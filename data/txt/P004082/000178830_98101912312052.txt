KOREA
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF A
SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1. TRANSPORT SECTOR
General
1.01      The rapid economic growth of Korea in the past decade, coupled
with industrialization, has res 'ted in major developments and changes in
the transport sector: freight and passenger traffic tripled between 1966
and 1976. This rapid growth in transport demand was accompanied by a greater
diversification among modes, as railways lost their predominant position and
road transport and coastal shipping increased their share.
1.02      Traffic statistics, in Tables 1.1 /1 and 1.2, illustrate these
changes over the 1966-76 decade. The rail transport share of freight traffic
fell from 78% of total ton-km to 46%, while road and coastal shipping shares
increased respectively from 12% to 27% and from 10% to 27%. For passenger
traffic, the rail share of total passenger-km fell from 43% to 25% over the
decade, while the road share increased correspondingly from 56% to 74%. These
changes very much reflect the economic advantages of the various modes, as
rail and coastal shipping increasingly concentrate on long distances and bulk
commodities, while road transport handles short distance and more diffuse
traffic.
1.03      As Korea's economy continues to grow and diversify, transport
demand will continue to experience a parallel expansion. Internally, the
transport system will have to cope with larger movements of bulk commodi-
ties, such as coal, cement, ores and oil. The industrial complexes being
developed along Korea's south and southeast coast will necessitate the import
of large amounts of raw materials and the shipment of intermediate products
between plants. A more diffuse demand for nonbulk freight and passenger
transport will follow the general increase in GNP.
1.04      Recognizing the necessity for the transport sector to keep up
with the growing economy, the Government's basic policy in the Fourth Five
Year Plan 1977-81 (FFYP) is to develop the transport system to meet increases
in traffic demand. Among the other objectives stated in the FFYP documents
the most important are: (a) to increase transport efficiency and ensure
economic allocation among modes; (b) rate increases and improvements in
operations to reduce the fiscal burden imposed on government by the railway;
and (c) to favor maintenance expenditures over new investment. Other lesser
objectives are described in detail in the Bank's latest Basic Economic Report
dated February 23, 1977 (Reference Al)./2
1.05      The FFYP investment allocation for the transport sector is
Won 2,780 billion (US$5.7 billion), or 14.6% of total investment. It is
expected that 45% (Won 1,258 billion) will be invested by the public sector
in infrastructure and equipment. The remaining 55% (Won 1,526 billion) will

be invested by the private sector, primarily for road transport vehicles and
ships. The allocation for transport investment in the Fourth Plan is about
50% higher in real terms than in the Third Plan (Table 1.3). Forecast trans-
port demand indicates that the proposed investment should provide for
increases of about 34 billion passenger-km and 12 billion ton-km, respectively
30% and 180% more than during the Third Plan, thereby justifying the substan-
tially larger capital allocation. The allocation among modes reflects the
increasing importance of road transport and coastal as well as international
shipping; proposed investments in these modes are, respectively, 47% and 80%
above the Third Plan, while railways are allocated only 25% more than in the
previous plan.
The Transport System
(Map 13133)
Highways
1.06      The present highway system is still inadequate to cope with the
rapid growth of road transport, despite the Government's effort since 1968
to develop a modern road network. Only about half of the national highways
and less than 20% of local roads are paved, and a high level of investment
will continue to be required. The Bank Group has financed three highway
projects, totalling US$191.5 million: Loan 769-KO in 1971 (US$54.5 million),
Loan 956-KO in 1974 (US$47 million) and Loan 1203-KO in 1976 (US$90 million).
Performance on these projects generally has been satisfactory.
1.07      Road transport of freight and passengers grew rapidly over the
last decade and, as mentioned above, the share of road transport increased
dramatically at the expense of the railways. This rapid development of
road transport occurred despite the Government's restrictive licensing
policy for commercial vehicles and heavy taxes which limit private auto-
mobile ownership (para. 4.02). Because of restrictive licensing, the number
of common carrier trucks is about 34,000, while the private truck fleet, which
is subject to less restrictive licensing, has grown to 55,000. In 1966, the
number of common carrier trucks was double the number of private trucks.
Private trucks can carry only the owner's goods. This limitation, together
with the increasing proportion of private trucks, is lowering the efficiency
of the truck fleet as a whole. The Bank therefore has been pressing the
Government to relax its truck licensing system, and some relaxation was
introduced in early 1977. Urban passenger traffic in Seoul moved entirely by
road (mainly bus and taxis) until the subway and the railway's electrified
suburban lines began operation in 1974 (para. 4.13). As congestion increases
in Seoul, the share of the suburban lines will rise, although road transport
will remain the dominant mode in the urban area.
Railways
1.08      As mentioned above, major structural changes occurred in the trans-
port sector over the last decade: the transport system is now evolving
into a more balanced multi-modal system in which different traffic modes
complement each other according to their technical and economic character-
istics. Cost comparisons indicate that rail transport is still the most
economic means of moving bulk traffic over medium and long distances, and
also has an important role to play in long distance passenger traffic. In



- 3 -
1976, about 81% of rail freight traffic consisted of six bulk commodities,
as against 69% in 1966. In addition to its long distance hauling of bulk
freight and passengers, KNR will play a growing role in providing rapid
transit service for Seoul and its suburbs. Details are given in Chapter 2.
1.09      Since 1962, Bank Group assistance to KNR through five projects
amounted to US$220 million. The first three lending operations have been
satisfactorily completed. Disbursements of the Fourth Railway Project (Loan
863-KO) are 96% completed, but the Closing Date has been extended to March
31, 1979, to allow for disbursements for equipment with long delivery times.
The Fifth Railway Loan (1101-KO) made in 1975 for US$100 million is over 80%
disbursed and will be completed before the end of 1978. The major require-
ments of the Loan/Credit Agreements covering these first five railway
projects fall into fGur main areas: (a) KNR's status and financial autonomy;
(b) KNR's financial situation; (c) railway operational and technical matters;
and (d) transport coordination.
1.10      Considerable progress has been made in providing KNR with more
autonomy, although it has not yet been reorganized as a public corporation
or other autonomous agency, as agreed under the Second Railway Project.
However, the Government has agreed to enable KNR to operate with autonomous
powers by 1979. KNR earned positive returns until 1971; since then its
financial situation deteriorated due to increased highway competition, which
eroded profitable passenger services, sharp inflation which increased costs
substantially, and tariffs, maintained at low levels by the Government, and
which did not fully compensate for inflation. The requirements of covenants
covering operational and technical matters have, in general, been met satis-
factorily, with a consequent improvement in KNR's level of performance.
Progress has been made in building up an organization in the Ministry of
Transportation to coordinate transport investment, and the Economic Planning
Board (EPB) is exercising a greater measure of control (para. 1.14 and 1.15).
Further details on compliance with specific covenants are given in Annex 2.
Ports and Shipping
1.11      Freight traffic through the ports has increased from about 13 mil-
lion tons in 1966 to over 80 million tons in 1976. This tremendous increase
resulted in serious port capacity problems, particularly at Busan, the largest
port, which handles 20% of the country's external trade and is chronically
congested. The Bank has assisted development in Busan through two port
projects-and ADB is financing the expansion of Incheon, the port nearest
to Seoul. The Saudi Fund for Development participated in the financing
of the first Busan Port Project. The Government has also proceeded to
develop a number of specialized ports in connection with industrial develop-
ment. The latter is largely concentrated on the coast: i.e. Bugpyeong for
cement, Pohang for the inputs and output of the steelmill, Onsan for a refinery
and nonferrous metal industry, and Samil for fertilizer and petrochemicals.
1.12      The role of coastal shipping has greatly increased in the last
decade, from 10% of the ton-km moved in Korea in 1966 to 27% in 1976. This is
mainly due to the construction of industrial complexes on coastal locations,
and, to a lesser extent, to shortages in rail and road capacity. Korea's



- 4 -
share in the merchant shipping of its external trade has been increasing and
reached about 38% of total tonnage in 1976.
Aviation
1.13      Although domestic air passenger traffic grew rapidly until 1973,
it still amounts to less than 1% of total passenger-km; air-freight is also
negligible. Domestic routes are served by the privately-owned Korean Airlines
(KAL), which also operates internationally. Most international traffic is
handled at the Seoul-Kimpo International Airport; other international airports
are at Busan and at Jeju Island, a major tourist center.
Transport Policy Planning and Coordination
1.14      Over the past two years, the Government has taken steps to improve
transport coordination. In 1975, this function was reorganized by the estab-
lishment of a Transport Coordination Committee (TCC) consisting of nine
directors, representing ministries most directly concerned with transport
matters, and a Transport Coordination Office (TCO) in the Ministry of Trans-
portation (MOT Chart 18023). The TCO is headed by a director general, who
also acts as Chairman of the TCC. Its main functions are to collect data
and assist in the formulation and review of transport policies, especially
those related to pricing and regulation.
1.15      While the charter of the TCC includes intermodal coordination of
transport sector investments, the TCC has not in fact exercised this function.
The Economic Planning Board (EPB), which exercises budgetary control and
plays a senior role with regard to all other ministries, has the dominant
role in decision on investment projects. EPB intends to make much more
intensive reviews of investment projects and has established a separate
Bureau of Project Evaluation to this end. Sector studies covering major
aspects of transport coordination have been identified by the sector mission
and are included in the Project (para. 3.07). They will be carried out
under the supervision of EPB.
1.16      This approach appears much more satisfactory and workable than the
one where investment coordination was to come under one of the ministries,
namely MOT. The role of the TCO should remain one of collecting basic data
in the sector and assisting in the formulation and review of transport
policies, especially those related to pricing and regulation, since MOT is
responsible for licensing and rates and fares setting.
1.17      The Bank should continue to assist the Government in increasing
the capacity of its transport system to cope with the demand resulting from
the continuous rapid development of the country. Since transport infra-
structure is capital-intensive, the Bank can ensure through careful project
preparation that capacity increases are provided at the least cost to the
economy, and that efficient use is made of existing capacity prior to
increasing it.

2. RAILWAY SUBSECTOR
KNR Organization
2.01      KNR is a semi-autonomous agency within the Ministry of Transporta-
tion, with its own management, accounts, and section of the national budget.
The legal basis for KNR's administration and operation is set out in:
(a) Law for Government Organizations No. 2907, revised December 31, 1976;
and (b) INR Organization - Presidential Decree No. 7310, dated November 4,
1974. The Government, largely through the EPB, exercises control over
staff, financial, budgetary and tariff matters. The Director General of KNR
is appointed (often from outside the railway) by the Government /1, while
the Deputy Director General comes from within KNR and is in charge of the
day-to-day operations. Chart 18024 shows KNR's organization.
Management, Staff, Training
2.02      Management is generally satisfactory, but there remains a need
to strengthen certain aspects, especially the capability for development
of technical, financial and economic policies and investment planning. The
Government has recognized the situation and proposed that a management
study be carried out by consultants (to be mostly Korean with support from
some overseas specialists). The Bank has agreed to finance this study
(which will take about six months) from Loan 1101-KO, in accordance with
terms of reference prepared by the Bank (Reference B-1) and presently being
reviewed by the Government and KNR. Agreement on the terms of reference was
reached during loan negotiations.
2.03      Pending the results of the above management study, KNR has prepared
and is now carrying out a Management Rationalization Plan (MRP). The main
items of this plan are:
(a) Cost savings due mainly to manpower reductions arising
from such measures as mechanization, improved operations,
closing or rationalizing of lines and stations, and reor-
ganization of administrative functions; and
(b) Revenue increases due to improving and upgrading passenger
services and baggage handling, expansion of container
services, provision of private sidings, reclassification
of freight rates (para. 2.30), and improvements to the
passenger fare structure.
The expected cost savings and additional revenues are incorporated in the
financial projections discussed in Chapter 5.
2.04      The number of permanent employees with Government civil service
status was about 33,500 at the end of 1976, a figure which has remained
almost constant for about five years. The financial forecasts assume that
there will be no major increase over the project period (to end of 1979).
In addition, KNR employs about 6,000 semipermanent and temporary personnel,
/1   The present Director General was appointed from the railway staff.

some on a seasonal basis, in workshops and on track works. Staff productivity
in terms of traffic units (pass-km plus net ton-km) per employee is high
(1976 - 600,000) compared with other railways; this is due in part to the
dense urban and inter-city passenger travel and heavy bulk mineral and
commodity traffic. In general, the staff continues to display excellent
discipline and productivity.
2.05      Basic salaries per employee (excluding management), which were
raised by about 20% on January 1, 1978, range from about W 33,000 to about
W 198,000 per month and are in line with Government pay scales. Allowances,
which increase with length of service and range from W 20,000 to W 120,000 per
month, were also raised on January 1, 1978, by about 10-40%. Staff remunera-
tion is lower than in comparable private industrial and commercial enterprises
in Korea, and this causes some difficulties in retaining qualified and experi-
enced personnel.
2.06      KNR's training programs were reviewed by the Bank during the
Fifth Railway Project and were found to be fundamentally sound and generating
considerable interest among the staff. The main problem lies with a lack
of equipment and material for practical training; agreement has been reached
on required items and their purchase is being financed from the Fifth
Railway Project.
Railway Facilities
Tracks
2.07      The system consists of 3,097 route-km of standard guage (1.435 m)
and 47 km of narrow gauge (0.76 m) lines; 567 km are double track and the
remainder single track (Table 2.1 and Map 13134). There are many lines in
mountainous areas, with some sections having gradients up to 2.5% and 3%,
along with numerous sharp curves. There are about 140 km of tunnels and 97 km
of bridges. The main lines are laid with 50 kg/m rail, while secondary branch
lines have mostly 50 kg/m and 37 kg/m rail (see Table 2.2); all new rail
renewals are carried out with 50 kg/m rail. Sleepers are predominantly
timber, but locally manufactured pre-stressed concrete sleepers are being
used as replacements on the higher speed lines. Rail joint welding is also
being carried out on a limited basis on such lines, with about 190 km
completed to end 1976 and another 90 km planned for 1977-81. The mission
recommended that KNR consider a larger program of rail joint welding because
of the economies in maintenance that can be obtained. All lines have crushed
stone ballast.
2.08      During the proposed project period (1978-79), KNR plans to carry
out renewal of about 330 track km of worn out rails, of which about 70
km are in connection with complete track renewal. KNR will also increase
the use of concrete sleepers and continue its ballast renewal program.
Equipment for partial mechanization of track renewal and maintenance work has
been provided under the Fifth Project. Under the new project, KNR intends to
set up a workshop for the manufacture of points and crossing components, the
preparation of timber sleepers and the rehabilitation of used track material.



-7-
2.09      Existing double track lines are the Gyeong Bu and Gyeong In lines
and the section Bongyang-Jecheon of the Jung Ang line. The double tracking
of the Ho Nam line between Iri and Daejon (89 km) is being completed, and
work has started on quadrupling part of the Yeongdeungpo-Suweon section in
the densely trafficked Seoul urban area. Works to increase the capacity of
the Chung Bug line (to give an additional access between the T!dustrial
northeast and the Seoul-Busan main line), by upgrading and partial doubling,
are included in the present project.
2.10      In step with the increasing traffic and train size requirements,
additional and lengthened crossing loops and enlarged marshalling yards have
been - and more are to be - provided.
2.11      The single track industrial lines between the northeast and
Seoul are electrified; an extension of electrification on the Jung Ang line
from Jecheon to Yeongju has been proposed for consideration in the 1980/81
period (para. 3.03). Most of the Seoul urban tracks are also electrified, in
association with the Seoul Metropolitan Electrified Suburban Railway System
(SMESRS); extension of electrification to the Seoul-Susaeg urban line is
proposed under the new project.
Signalling
2.12      Centralized traffic control (CTC) has been installed in the Seoul
urban area and on the heavily trafficked electrified single line Seoul-Jecheon.
Under the new project, CTC is to be installed on the Dae Gu line (about 35 km)
and between Yeongju and Gyeongju on the Jung Ang line (about 164 km).
Automatic block operation is provided on the Seoul-Busan double line. Most
of the other main lines are equipped with tokenless block signalling and
interlocking systems. For safety, an automatic train stopping system is
being installed under successive projects.
Motive Power and Rolling Stock
2.13      KNR's motive power and rolling stock fleet at the end of 1976 are
given in Tables 2.3 and 2.4. The fleet consists of 386 diesel and 69 elec-
tric locomotives (with about 20 steam locomotives still in service on
shunting duties), 120 diesel rail cars, 128 electric rail cars (on the Seoul
urban electrified lines), about 1,800 passenger cars, and about 16,000
freight cars (with another 1,400, mostly tank cars, privately owned).
Another 20 electric locomotives, 90 electric rail cars and 750 freight cars,
not included in the project, are ordered or being ordered for delivery during
1977 and 1978. An additional 30 diesel locomotives, 211 passenger cars and
1,420 freight cars are included in the project. Fifty-two of the diesel
locomotives have recently been re-powered; another 59 are to be re-powered
under the proposed project.
2.14      Under the Fifth Railway Project KNR agreed:
(a) to submit a firm plan acceptable to the Bank to ensure:



- 8 -
(i) the satisfactory maintenance of KNR's fleet of
locomotives and rolling stock; and
(ii) rehabilitation of out-of-service diesel locomotives;
and
(b) to appoint for a period of not less than two years a technical
adviser to assist KNR in the implementation of the aforesaid plan.
After some delay, a technical adviser from Canadian Pacific Consulting
Services (CPCS) has been provided for a two-year period from September 1976,
and the implementation of the maintenance and rehabilitation plans are now
under way. The adviser's first reports (Reference B2), however, indicate
that much needs to be done to clean up the workshops and to organize rational
programs for inspection and maintenance; all of which will require consider-
able effort by KNR over the next few years. The transfer of all passenger
and freight car maintenance operations to the new workshop at Daejeon (para.
2.15) should facilitate the new improved maintenance methods being adopted.
Improved training facilities now being provided (para. 2.06) should also
help in the longer term. Sufficient spare parts to carry on the improved
maintenance program have been or are being procured under the Fifth Railway
Project. Further measures to be taken will be included in the action plan
to be prepared by KNR (para. 3.20).
Workshops
2.15      KNR has at present four main workshops: at Seoul (electric loco-
motives, passenger cars, freight cars, diesel-rail cars and electric rail
cars), Yeongdeungpo (steam locomotives, passenger cars and freight cars),
Busan (diesel locomotives, passenger cars and freight cars), and Incheon
(passenger cars and freight cars). Steam locomotives are expected to be
completely phased out by 1979. A new freight car workshop is being con-
structed at Daejeon and will be completed in 1978; a new adjacent passenger
car shop is proposed under the project (paras. 3.14 and 4.14). KNR is plan-
ning to transfer all passenger and freight car maintenance to the new work-
shops at Daejeon and, by about 1980, to close the existing workshops at
Yeongdeungpo and Incheon after transferring usable equipment to other work-
shops. Provision is also made in the project for necessary improvements to
remaining running sheds for locomotives, rail cars and passenger and freight
cars.
Telecommunications
2.16      A microwave system has recently been installed between Seoul and
Busan, and a start has been made on providing improved station-to-station
and station-to-train communications. The latter is to be continued under
the project.
Other Property
2.17.     In general, the buildings, stations, offices and general plant of
the railways are reasonably maintained. A considerable program of bridge
strengthening, carried out under the Fourth and Fifth Railway Projects, is
to be continued under this project.

Traffic
Freight Traffic
2.18      KNR's freight traffic statistics from 1966 to 1976 are given in
Tables 2.5 through 2.7. During this period, freight traffic grew 6.2% p.a. in
tons and 6% p.a. in ton-km. Major commodities which contributed to these
increases were cement and coal. Cement transportation increased from 1.7
million tons in 1966 to 10.2 million tons in 1976, and coal rose from 10.5
to 16.1 million tons during the same period. In 1976, freight traffic was
43.8 million tons and 9.7 billion ton-km, the average transport distance was
222 km. Freight net ton per route km averaged 3.1 million in 1976. Preliminary
results for 1977 indicate that ton-km are in line with the forecast given in
Table 2.7 and 8% above 1976. Freight densities (see Char 18070) are higher
on KNR industrial lines between Seoul and the northeast region of coal mines
and cement plants, exceeding 13 million tons on the heaviest section. The
next highest freight densities are on the Jung Ang line south of Jecheon and
on the Seoul-Busan line, with the busiest sections carrying around 4 million
tons annually.
2.19      Bulk commodities best suited for rail transport - such as coal,
cement, ore, oil, fertilizer, and grain-accounted for 81% of KNR's total
freight ton-km in 1976, up from 69% in 1966. Apart from some military and
KNR's own transport, the remainder consists mainly of general cargo. Tonnage
of this carried by KNR since 1966 has fluctuated between 4.5 and 6 million
tons per annum, reacting to factors such as the opening of the Seoul-Busan
expressway in 1970 (much of the general cargo originally carried by KNR was
suitable for highway transport),and the econoniic slowdown in 1975.
2.20      Freight traffic forecasts from 1977 to 1981 are given in Tables 2.5
through 2.7. They take into account the expected increases in production
of bulk commodities during the FFYP, and prospective competition from other
modes, namely coastal shipping and road transport (Reference Cl). The
forecast for coal transport is based on the targeted national production of
24 million tons in 1981. While the government will do its utmost to reach
it, this target is ambitious and a delay of about one year is not unlikely.
Nevertheless, the target has been accepted for coal car acquisition in
1978-79 to avoid creating a bottleneck should the production indeed be on
target. The acquisition program for the last two years of the FFYP could
then be adjusted if necessary. General cargo has also been assumed to grow
over the plan period, as the heavy metal and machinery industry develops and
generates inputs and outputs suitable for rail transport. The development of
container services between Seoul and Busan will also contribute to the growth
of general cargo suitable for rail transport. In 1977 general cargo tonnage
was 43% above the same period of 1976.
2.21      Overall, the average freight traffic growth rate has been estimated
at 7% p.a. in tons and 7.5% p.a. in ton-km; it is projected to reach 62 mil-
lion tons and 14 billion ton-km by 1981, with the basic composition of
traffic remaining unchanged. These forecasts were discussed and agreed with
KNR, and appear realistic (with the above reservation on coal). However, in



- 10 -
view of past experience where freight forecasts generally have been proven
over optimistic, traffic development should be closely monitored and reviewed
by KNR and the Bank before finalizing investments in the last two years of
the FFYP (para. 3.03).
Passenger Traffic
2.22      Tables 2.8 through 2.10 show KNR's passenger traffic statistics
from 1966 to 1976, as well as forecasts to 1981. Significant changes occurred
during this period which greatly affected passenger traffic. They were the
opening of expressways in 1970-71, followed by the development of long
distance bus transport; the rise in personal incomes, which increased mobility
and the demand for greater comfort, resulting in a shift to the higher class
trains; and, finally, the opening in 1974 of the first Seoul subway line
connected to KNR's electrified suburban lines.
2.23      Regarding long distance travel, passenger traffic grew regularly
until 1969, when it reached 115 million passengers and 9.7 billion pass-km.
Due to sharp bus competition, particularly following the opening of the
Seoul-Busan and the Daejon-Gwangju expressways, the number of long distance
passengers fell to 85 million in 1971. By 1973, however, passengers and
pass-km were back to their 1969 levels, and both have been growing steadily
since then, despite the 1974-75 economic slowdown. In 1976, the number of
long distance passengers was about 7% above 1975 and, according to preliminary
results, the growth in 1977 was 11%.
2.24      As mentioned above, the growth in long distance passenger traffic
has been paralleled by a shift from lower class (ordinary) trains to limited
express and special express. The number of passengers on express trains
quadrupled in the last five years, while the number of ordinary passengers
remained almost constant (Table 2.9).
2.25      Regarding the Seoul urban system, SMESRS (Seoul subway plus the
KNR electrified suburban lines), passenger traffic grew rapidly from the
start of service in 1974 ad reached 134 million passengers in 1976; of
these, 100 million were KNR passengers and 34 million Seoul city subway
passengers. In 1977 urban passenger traffic was 40% above 1976.
2.26      In view of these recent and major changes in passenger traffic
patterns - both for long distance and urban services - and the resulting
absence of well-established trends, it is difficult to forecast future
traffic. To illustrate this point: in 1977, special express passengers were
up 23% and limited express passengers up 84% from the same period in 1976.
The best possible forecast agreed with KNR is for a 3.7% p.a. overall growth
in long distance passengers and a 6% p.a. growth in pass-km. This would
result in 156 million passengers and 15.6 billion pass-km by 1981, with most
of the growth occurring in the special and limited express categories. For
Seoul (SMESRS), a doubling of the number of passengers, to 209 million by
1981, has been assumed until the results of a comprehensive urban transport
study are available (para. 4.13). Even more than for freight traffic,
further developments in passenger traffic should be closely monitored to
ensure that investments are compatible with demand - not only in terms of
quantities, but also in terms of the quality of service demanded by KNR's
customers.

Operations
2.27      Table 2.11 gives a summary of KNR's operating statistics for
1971-76.  Operating efficiency and utilization of available equipment remain
high and, in some aspects, continue to improve: for example, annual pass-km
per available passenger car (from 5.7 to 8.1 million) and freight net ton-km
per available freight car (from 600 to 680 thousand). On the other hand,
availability of equipment remains lower than expected and, in the case of
cars, is not likely to reach the targets set for the end of 1977 in the Plan
of Action for improved availability under the Fifth Project (Annex 5, Appraisal
Report No. 610a-KO). In 1976, availability of passenger cars was 88.7%, com-
pared with the target for this year of 90%; for freight cars, availability
was 89.3% against the target of 93%. There were delays, however, in the
appointment of the technical advisor on equipment maintenance (para. 2.14), in
the supply of spares and components, and in the provision of new centralised
freight and passenger workshops (para. 2.15). With varying progress now being
made on all three aspects, it should be feasible to improve the situation
during the 1977-81 investment plan period. Operational forecasts are defined
in para. 3.19.
Tariffs and Costs
2.28      Tariffs are uniform throughout the system, and are regulated by the
Government; the latter, in exercising controls on the prices of essential
commodities, has held railway freight rates at low levels. For many years,
freight revenues have not covered the fully distributed costs of moving the
traffic, although passenger traffic had been profitable until 1976. The
following table gives average cost and revenue comparisons for the years
1973-76:
Freight                               Passenger
Cost per       Revenue per             Cost per           Revenue
ton-km          ton km (Won)           pass-km            pass-km
1973       2.27               .1.84                 1.76               2.14
1974       3.14               2.31                  2.44               2.97
1975       4.05               3.34                  2.93               3.53
1976       5.76               4.64                  3.69               3.67
2.29      Action on tariff increases over the last ten years is detailed in
Tables 2.12 through 2.14. These show that, since 1973, the Government has
permitted KNR to increase freight tariffs at a rate faster than passenger
fares, thereby reducing KNR's dependence on passenger traffic revenues.
However, coal, which constitutes 38% of total railway freight traffic, is
carried at the lowest class rate (class 4); grains, fertilizers, limestone
and ores (18% of total freight traffic) are rated at class 3.



- 12 -
2.30      The last tariff increase was in January 1977, when the five existing
freight class rates were restructured to four classes by combining classes 1
and 2 (at existing class 1 rate) and moving up the remaining classes, with
some additional increases in the rates for the new classes 2, 3 and 4. This
raised average revenues per ton-km by about 19%. The spread between the
lowest and highest class rates, which used to be as much as 110%, has now been
reduced to 32%. This is good, and in fact, the spread could be further
reduced by merging class 4 with class 3. Passenger fares have not been
increased since July 1975.
2.31      KNR's operating costs are low, due to a high degree of utilization
of rail facilities and rolling stock, low salaries and wages, and high staff
productivity. Cost analysis indicates that in 1976 the average fully distri-
buted costs were about W 3.69 (USi0.76) per pass-km and W 5.75 (USdI.19) per
freight ton-km; these costs are somewhat understated, since KNR's expenditure
on maintenance was below the minimum level. However, these average costs
should rise in 1977, with a better supply of maintenance spares becoming
available.
2.32      The cost data given for 1976 in Table 2.15 indicates that high
class, express passenger services earn a good profit margin, but that lower
class, ordinary passengers and commuters and baggage service lose money. All
freight classes except cement lose money, particularly grain, fertilizer, ores
and coal. However, all passenger services (except commuters) and all major
freight traffic revenues (except for grain and military) covered variable
costs and made full or partial contributions to overheads.
2.33      For KNR to reach a satisfactory financial position, the level of
tariffs must be raised. Prompt action should be taken in the future to
maintain a satisfactory level in the face of inflation. Future increases
should be selective rather than across the board. For instance, ordinary and
commuter passenger fares should be raised to a greater extent than the
higher class fares. KNR is already proposing a considerable increase in
baggage charges. Regarding freight traffic rates, where the need is greater,
more emphasis is needed on raising the charges on grains, fertilizers, ores
and coal (para. 5.08). Agreement was reached during loan negotiation on
increases in both passenger fares and freight rates (para. 5.22).
Budget, Accounting, and Audit
Budgets
2.34      KNR prepares detailed annual operating and investment budgets.
Through the Government Office of Audit, expenditures are rigidly controlled
against the very detailed budget provisions. KNR management has very little
flexibility in reallocating budget funds and, when other than minor revisions
are needed, approval must be sought from the House of Representatives. Agree-
ment was reached at loan negotiations on measures to allow KNR to submit its
budgets in a commercial form, to give KNR more flexibility in reallocating
budget funds and to allow KNR fix the emoluments of its staff.



- 13 -
Accounting
2.35      A requirement of the Fifth Project was that KNR would, within 12
months, complete the installation of a commercial accounting system devised
by consultants /1, and would install a traffic costing system. Implementa-
tion of the computerized, commercial accounting system has been subject to
considerable delay, largely due to KNR's inability to provide sufficient
qualified and experienced accounting staff - particularly staff with computer
experience - to work with the consultants. Actual implementation commenced
during 1977, and should be completed in 1978.
2.36      KNR has been using a manual traffic costing system introduced by
the consultants in 1970. A new, computerized system has been devised by the
Present team, and will be introduced when the accounting system is working
satisfactorily.
Audit
2.37      In accordance with loan requirements that KNR retain auditors satis-
factory to the Bank, international firms (latterly with local affiliation),
have been auditing KNR's commercial accounts since 1967. To date: (a) the
auditors have not been able to give a clear audit certificate, due to defi-
ciencies in operating the accounting system; and (b) KNR has not been able to
comply with the requirement that the Bank receive a copy of the audit report
not later than five months after the end of fiscal year, largely due to delays
in appointing the auditors. However, accounting has been improving with the
aid of consultants, and the audit report for 1976 was received within six
months. At negotiations it was reaffirmed that-audited accounts for 1977 and
thereafter will be submitted to the Bank within five months of the end of the
fiscal year.
Uneconomic Lines and Stations
2.38      Data from KNR's 1975 costing study has indicated seven branch lines,
totalling 164 km, on which the operating ratio was over 400% (Table 2.16). A
decision to close the An Seong line will be made in 1978, while the Korea
Electric Co. has agreed to bear the costs of the Yong San line as from 1977.
KNR is negotiating with the Korea Coal Corporation to bear the costs of the
Hwa Sun line. The Jin Sam, Og Gu and Kim Po lines are all used exclusively by
military authorities, who do not wish the lines to be closed. KNR is discus-
sing with the Ministry of National Defense the possibility of the latter
bearing the costs of operating these lines.  Regarding the Su In line, the
Government is studying the future traffic demand arising from the construction
of an industrial estate near Suweon, and will make a decision on the future
of this line, and on other uneconomic lines, by mid-1979.
2.39      KNR has identified 145 stations where revenues from passenger
services fail to cover 30% of the personnel costs involved, 97 stations
were freight revenues fail to cover 30% of personnel costs, and 230 stations
where baggage revenues fail to cover 100% of labor costs involved. Action

is proposed over the years 1977-79 to close 36 of these stations, change 56
into crossing stations only (i.e. used to arrange train meets, but without
either passenger or freight services), aLJ to s'r  -y ,-- -0
stations for passengers and 49 stations for freight services. This would
eliminate about 166 employees and save about W 320 million in 1979. T'he
proposed measures appear to be satisfactory. Action as above was actually
taken on 132 stations in 1977.
3. INVESTMENT PLAN AND PROJECT
KNR's Investment Plan (1977-81)
3.01      As a result of discussions during appraisal, KNR's Investment
Plan, which forms part of the Fourth Five-Year Economic Development Plan of
Korea, 1977-81, was substantially revised, both in regard to its size and to
the phasing of expenditures. The revised plan, as agreed between the Govern-
ment and the Bank, comprises investments totalling W 503 billion (US$1037
million), with a foreign exchange component of W 211 billion (US$436 million).
This includes items carried over from the 1972-76 Investment Plan, such as
the new Daejeon freight car shop, completion of double tracking of the Honam
line and the purchase of electric locomotives. It also includes items which
are being financed under Loan 1101-KO: for example, rails and freight cars.
3.02      The composition and cost of the plan are shown in detail in Table 3.1,
a summary of which is given below.

3.03      Items started before or during 1977 total about W 119 billion,
of which about W 77 billion is expected to be spent in 1977 (Table 3.2).
They include: (a) ongoing works, such as the completion of double tracking
of the sections Yeongdeungpo-Anyang on the Gyeong Bu line and Daejeon-Iri on
the Ho Nam line, by-pass lines, station extensions and improvements, rail
and track renewal, and the new Daejeon freight car shop; and (b) material
and equipment already ordered or being ordered, such as new electric locomo-
tives and rail cars, new passenger and freight cars, and rails. Investments
starting in the 1980/81 period of the plan, totalling about W 187 billion
(Table 3.3), will be subject to further adjustments on the basis of actual
traffic developments in the next two years. Also, detailed technical,
financial and economic analyses should be performed during the intervening
two years for some of the major fixed capacity investments proposed for
1980/81: that is, double tracking, electrification and signalling. Assurances
were obtained during negotiation that KNR will submit these studies and
justification, for agreed items and in agreed format, to the Bank by the
mid-1979.
3.04      The plan as now drawn up assumes continued high operational effi-
ciency and improving availability of motive power and rolling stock.
The Project and the Proposed Loan
3.05      The project to be financed under the proposed loan consists of the
plan investments, intended to start in 1978 and 1979 (Table 3.4). Total
cost of the project is estimated at W 197 billion (US$406 million equivalent),
with a foreign exchange component of about US$190 million, of which US$120 mil-
lion would be covered by the proposed loan. A summary of the estimated project
expenditure and items to be financed by the proposed loan is given in the
following table.

city, diesel locomotives, re-engining of diesel locomotives and diesel
railcars and workshop equipment, would be financed by other agencies
(para. 3.17).

3.07      Transport Sector Studies.  The Government is strengthening its
transport sector analysis capability, but has requested Bank assistance to
do so. As a first step, EPB intends to have studies done in the following
areas: (a) distribution of major bulk commodities, such as coal, cement and
oil; (b) costs and tariffs of various modes, to ensure economic allocation
of traffic; and (c) passenger transport demand by various modes. The
Government intends to have these studies carried out by local consulting
firms with the assistance of fo:eign experts in specialized fields, such as
the bulk handling of major commodities in the case of (a) above. This was
confirmed during negotiations. The proposed loan would include US$500,000
to finance about 70 man-months of such foreign experts assistance. Local
costs of the various studies would be determined when the terms of reference
are prepared and agreed with the Bank. This procedure and iming of the
various studies was agreed during negotiations, together with terms of
reference for the study in (a) above. The findings of the studies would be
valuable in a variety of feasibility studies of transport investment projects,
and will provide useful experience for local consulting firms in the transport
field. In particular, it is expected that the bulk commodity study would
lead to a project for Bank financing.

economic feasibility studies of major projects envisaged for
1980-81, accounting, and mechanical equipment maintenance.
Cost Estimates
3.16      Project costs are based on estimated prices at the end of 1976
(Reference C-6), adjusted for price escalation and physical contingencies
over the project period. The foreign currency cost of technical assistance,
not including airfares and subsistence, is estimated at US$6,000-7,000 per
man month. Physical contingencies of 10% have been included in the project
for all items except motive power and rolling stock, rail and track renewal,
track material workshop and track maintenance equipment. Price contingencies
have been included for all items; assumed price increases for local currency
items are 8% annually in 1977-1978, 7.5% in 1979 and 7% in 1980-1981; and for
foreign currency items 8% annually in 1977, 7% in 1978, 6.5% in 1979 and 6%
in 1980-1981. Contingencies, physical and price, on all items taken together
represent about 19% of project cost.

Project Implementation
3.18      KNR will be responsible for implementation of the project, with
the exception of the transport sector studies, which will be directed by
EPB. A project execution schedule and a procurement schedule for Bank
financed items are given in Tables 3.10 and 3.11. Monitoring of progress
based on these schedules will be further discussed during supervision.
KNR's performance in executing the five previous projects has been in
general satisfactory.
Action Plans
3.19      The calculation of motive power and rolling stock requirements
during the Investment Plan period is based on traffic forecasts given in

3.20      During negotiations agreement was reached that KNR will prepare, by
December 31, 1978 a plan for achieving the operational forecasts indicated in
para. 3.19, provided forecast traffic is offering. The measures to be
included in such a plan are mainly:
(a) improvement of maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock through:
(i)  implementation of the recommendations given by the technical
advisor presently assisting KNR in establishing improved
maintenance and rehabilitation schedules, including further
reduction of the number of major running sheds;
(ii) provision of funds for spare parts, in accordance with the
action plan agreed to under the Fifth Project (from 1978
on not less than W 2.2 billion annually for diesel locomo-
tives, W 1.0 billion for passenger cars and W 1.5 billion
for freight cars);
(iii) complete phasing out of steam locomotives;
(iv) concentration of passenger and freight car maintenance at
the new workshops at Daejeon, and closing the existing
workshops in Yeongdeungpo and Incheon; and
(v)  improved training;
(b) continued attention to utilization of rolling stock in order to
maintain the present trend of improvement.
3.21      The operational forecast given in para. 3.19, particularly for 1981,
may be revised as a result of the management study to be carried out under
Loan liOl-KO (para. 2.02).
Procurement
3.22      All items to be procured under the proposed loan will be subject
to international competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank guidelines.
In bid evaluation, Korean manufacturers of equipment will be allowed a
preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. cost of competing imports, or the
relevant prevailing level of customs duties, whichever is lower.
Disbursements
3.23      Disbursements would be made as follows:
(a)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment and materials;
and/or
(b)  100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment and
materials if local bidders are successful;



- 23 -
(c) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of specialized technical
assistance (para. 3.07);
(d) 100% of total cost for training and technical assistance
(para. 3.15 (d) and (e)).
Any savings under the loan would be used for financing additional, but
similar, project items, subject to review and agreement with the Bank.
3.24      An estimated schedule of disbursement is given in Table 3.12.
Disbursements are based on the assumption that the proposed loan would
become effective by June 15, 1978.
4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
General
4.01      KNR continues to play a vital role in the economy of Korea.
While road transport and coastal shipping have increased their share of total
transport demand over the last decade (para. 1.02), the railway remains
the most economic mode of moving bulk commodities to inland destinations.
The line haul costs are only a fraction of road costs and, while the costs
of coastal-shipping are competitive with rail costs on a ton-km basis, the
circuitous sea routes around the peninsula often give rail the advantage.
The traffic forecasts given in Chapter 2 have taken into consideration
competition from other modes, particularly from coastal shipping for bulk
movements of cement, oil and fertilizer from plants located on the coast.
However, for coal and most cement, which account for over 50% of railway
ton-km, the major production areas are inland. It is imperative that rail
capacity be at all times sufficient to handle this traffic, which is vital
for the country's continuous development (para. 4.07).
4.02      Regarding passenger traffic, the combination of increasing incomes
and the government policy of restricting the use of private automobiles has
led to a sharply increasing demand for the more comfortable and faster train
services. Korea is indeed far behind most other countries in terms of
private automobile ownership, despite its relatively high per capita income.
The 70,000 private cars presently in Korea amount to only 2 per 1,000 persons.
The ratios are 2.6 in Indonesia, 7.7 in Thailand, 10.6 in the Philippines
and 37.4 in Malaysia. Only the latter has a higher per capita income than
Korea. For long distances in the 300-400 km range, such as Seoul-Busan (445
km), Seoul-Gwangju (371 km) and others, express trains offer more comfortable,
safer and slightly faster trips than highway buses. Special express trains
also compete favorably with air travel on the Seoul-Busan route. The
price is about half and the time is comparable when terminal transport between
airports and city centers is taken into account. In view of the above, it
appears well justified to develop express train services to satisfy the fast
increasing demand, particularly since these are the most profitable services
of KNR. Operating ratios for the special and limited express services were,
respectively, 63 and 66% in 1977. Traffic forecasts are given in Chapter 2.

Benefits and Economic Returns
4.03      The investment analysis has focused on the last four years of the
1977-8i FFYP. Investments starting in 1978 and 1979, which form the proposed
project, are analyzed in detail below. Investments starting in 1980-81
are presently indicative of the order of magnitude of the need. Detailed
technical and economic justifications for the major investment items will be
prepared before the end of 1979 (para. 3.03).
4.04      The economic evaluation focuses on project investments globally,
and on particular items whenever possible. Table 4.1 shows project invest-
ments classified for the purpose of economic analysis. The larger group,
about 62% of all project costs, consists of investments which are primarily
geared to increase the capacity of the railway to carry traffic for which
rail transport is the most economic way of satisfying transport demand. The
remaining project items consist of: (a) way and structures renewals 10%;
(b) investments in the Seoul suburban rail system (SMESRS) 7%; (c) a new
central passenger car workshop at Daejon 5%; and (d) miscellaneous invest-
ments 16%. Items in (b) and (c) above are subject to further review follow-
ing completion of studies now in progress. No economic return has been
calculated on these items because of lack of appropriate cost benefit data,
although there is enough evidence to support their tentative inclusion in the
project.
Capacity Increasing Investments
4.05      These investments are basically of two types:  fixed installations
on the lines, and motive power and rolling stock. The latter can, of course,
be used more flexibly throughout the network than the former, and thus have a
lower risk factor than line installations. Consequently, line capacity invest-
ments have been very carefully analyzed on a line-by-line basis. Existing
capacity has been estimated, and ways to increase it through improved opera-
tions discussed extensively with KNR. The Bank also retained consultants Rapp
A.G. (Switzerland) to apply a line capacity model on two of the lines for which
KNR planned sizeable fixed investment: namely, a section of the Jung Ang line
(64 km from Jecheon to Yeongju) which was proposed for electrification, and
the Donghae-Nambu line (Busan-Pohang), on which KNR proposed to install CTC,
new crossing loops, stations, and marshalling yards. Application of the model,
which uses an "interactive graphic" approach, indicated that in both cases it
would be possible to reach a practical capacity at least 10% above the level of
the present timetable without major investments (Reference B3). The consultants
also identi-fied some low cost measures which would further increase practical
capac ty, without yet engaging the larger proposed investments. As a conse-
que-ce, electrification of a section of the Jung Ang line and CTC on the
Donghae-Nambu line was postponed for a few years, and KNR was asked to further
review its justification (para. 3.03). Where traffic demand forecasts still
exceeded possible line capacity, the analysis focused on the least cost invest-
ments to increase it. For instance, by adding as many crossing stations as
possible on a single track line, instead of installing either expensive



- 25 -
signalling systems or double tracking. As a result, line capacity investments
in the project period were reduced by about US$40 million from the original
investment plan proposal, and now represent only 15% of total project costs.
4.06      Capacity in motive power and rolling stock has been analyzed
on a network-wide basis. Careful consideration was given to possibilities
for increasing operating performance, such as train-km for locomotives and
turnaround times, loadings, and distances traveled for wagons. For the
purpose of rate of return calculations, capacity-increasing investments have
been allocated to freight and passenger services. This was done directly in
the case of freight and passenger cars, and for some fixed investments. In
the case of locomotives and joint fixed investments on lines - such as
crossing loops, bypass lines and signalling - allocation was in proportion to
the relative capacity provided for each service (Table 4.2).
4.07      Freight - The benefits of investments to increase the railway's
capacity in carrying freight traffic are measured in terms of transport cost
savings for the economy of the country. They are calculated as the difference
between the economic cost of rail transport and the economic cost of the
next best alternative mode. The major variables involved in the calculation
of benefits are: (a) the amount of traffic that would be diverted to other
modes based on the capacity of the railway with and without the project; and
(b) the economic costs of tansport by various alternative modes (Table 4.3).
Alternative modes could be road, or a combination of either rail or road and
coastal shipping. As mentioned in para. 4.01, rail traffic forecasts
already reflect the share of coastal shipping when it is the most economic
mode; i.e. for traffic having origins and destinations at, or very near, the
coast. For the remaining traffic, for which rail capacity is provided by
the proposed project, coastal shipping is no longer a valid alternative, as
it would involve long terminal transport at either end, which would require
either rail capacity or the higher cost road transport. Consequently, in
this analysis, rail costs are compared to road costs, as the costs of an
alternative using coastal shipping for part of the way are even greater than
the all road alternative. The economic benefits in terms of transport cost
savings would yield an economic rate of return (ERR) of over 40% (Table
4.4). This is a conservative estimate, since the amount ot traffic that
would divert to other modes without the project has been assumed at only 60%
of the traffic increase forecast for 1978 and 1979; i.e. equivalent to the
capacity provided by new cars acquired under the project. The remaining 40%
of anticipated traffic growth will be handled by conversion and improved
utilization of existing cars. No benefits have been attributed to this
traffic, since the costs are small and most of the benefits should accrue
even without the project.
4.08      Passengers.  The proposed capacity increases are for the better
quality services provided by KNR: the special and limited express trains.
No capacity increase is provided for ordinary trains. The economic cost
of these better services is comparable to that of the air-conditioned
expressway buses. Rail fares for these services, however, are substantially
higher than either rail costs or bus fares; 91% higher than costs for
special express and 72% higher than limited express (Table 4.5). The fact



- 26 -
that people are ready to pay twice as much as the bus fare to travel on the
special express trains  reflects the benefits they derive from such service:
e.g. comfort, speed, lesser accident risk, etc. Consequently, benefits of
increasing the capacity of the better passenger services are measured in
terms of willingness to pay for the service over and above their costs. They
are calculated as the difference between the cost of the services and their
revenues, and give a return of 17% on the investment (Table 4.6).
Way and Structures Renewals
4.09      The main items in this category are rail and track renewal, includ-
ing sleepers replacement and new ballast. The remainder of the cost is
for strengthening of bridges and tunnels. While it is a general practice of
railways to show way and structure renewal costs in their investment programs,
the nature of these costs is more periodic maintenance than investment. Rail
and sleepers have to be periodically replaced, and ballast has to be added
in order to keep the trains operating safely at normal speeds. The program
submitted by KNR for implementation during the plan and project period
was examined on the basis of the age and characteristics of rail, track,
and traffic on a particular line.
4.10      KNR's network consists of 4,100 km of track.  Some 930 km or 23%
of the network, have rails over 20 years old; another 880 km have rails
between 10 and 20 years old. In terms of traffic, rail renewal timing can
be related to the number of gross tons which have passed over a given line
section. This is only broadly indicative, as conditions will vary widely
from one line to the other as a function of topography, alignment, and
train types. Assuming, however, that the useful rail life is on average
around 300 million gross tons, there would be some 1,000 km (24% of the
network) on which rail life would be between 10 and 20 years, and another
250 km with a 20-30 year life (based on 1976 traffic volumes). For the rest
of the network, rails would last up to 40 and 50 years. On the basis
of the above assumed rail life for various sections of the network, renewal
should average about 140-150 km/year. This figure would increase over time,
as traffic growth shortens rail life.
4.11      The rail and track renewal program discussed with KNR, and
confirmed during negotiations, would cover the recurrent need and also some
of the urgently needed rail replacement in curves on the industrial lines.
If this program was not carried out, the quality of the track would deterio-
rate, with the risk of increased accidents. Speed restrictions needed to
ensure safety would gradually reduce capacity, particularly on single track
lines which account for most of KNR's network. In calculating line capacity
as described in para. 4.05, it was assumed that track conditions would not
be allowed to deteriorate and that speeds would be maintained at least at
their present levels. To prevent track deterioration without the proposed
rail and track renewal program would require increased maintenance. On the
basis of maintenance costs savings, rail renewal on the 8 lines included in
the project would yield ERRs ranging from 20% on the line with the lowest
traffic (6 million gross tons p.a.) to 32% on the line with the highest
traffic (25 million gross tons p.a.), with a weighted average of 27%
(Reference C-7).

Seoul Suburban Lines
4.12      The city of Seoul now has over 7 million inhabitants.  Further-
more, urban development has spread beyond the city boundaries along the
transport lines. Cities such as Incheon (800,000), Anyang (135,000) and
Suweon (225,000) to mention only the larger ones on the rail lines, are
growing rapidly; thus creating with Seoul an interconnected urban system
of some 9 million people. Until 1974, urban transport consisted almost
exclusively of buses and taxis. Because of the configuration of the center
of Seoul, which includes large blocks penetrated by narrow streets suitable
only for pedestrians and small delivery vehicles, traffic congestion on the
major arteries is acute despite the very low rate of private car ownership
(para. 4.02).
4.13      In 1974, the first sections of a mass rail transit system were
put into service, consisting of a 9.5 km underground line (Seoul City
Subway) and 86 km of electrified existing KNR lines (MAP). The system
met with immediate success and acceptance by the public, carrying over 130
million passengers in 1976.  For the first half of 1977, traffic was 40%
above that in 1976. The city of Seoul is considering further extensions of
the subway but, because of the high cost of subway lines no final decision
has been made. Meanwhile, KNR proposes to upgrade about 63 km of existing
lines with electrification and some double tracking, in order to expand
suburban services. There is no doubt that, given the densities of urban-
ization in Seoul, there is a good case for making the maximum use of existing
rail infrastructure and right of way. Costs of upgrading existing rail
lines are small compared to subway construction. However, to derive maximum
benefit from the investment, it is necessary to analyze in detail potential
transport demand in the corridors in which KNR proposes to expand service, to
forecast traffic in relation to other modes, ensure the optimum location of
stations, and confirm the order of priority and timing of construction of the
various sections. A comprehensive urban transport study of the larger Seoul
Metropolitan Area was, started in July 1977 by the Transportation Economic
Group of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST). It is expected
to take about one year to complete and would answer the above questions. It was
agreed during negotiations that KNR would postpone investment on the suburban
lines until the results of the study become available. Meanwhile, the
proposed investments are included in the project, although none of the loan
funds will be applied to them.
Daejon Passenger Car Workshop
4.14      KNR has decided to consolidate its passenger car maintenance
at Daejon, a central location on the two most heavily traveled lines:
from Seoul to the Southeast (Busan) and to the Southwest (Gwangju-Mogpo).
Existing workshops, particularly those at Seoul and Incheon, are old and
crowded. Urban development prevents their extension and access is diffi-
cult in view of the intensive use of the Seoul area lines for frequent
urban services.. Studies for the proposed Daejon workshop have recently



- 28 -
been completed and will be reviewed by the Bank prior to the start of
construction.
Miscellaneous
4.1       This category, comprising some 16% of the project cost, almost
all in local currency, includes numerous small investments dispersed over
the entire network. The largest amount, about a third of the total, is for
improving safety at rail and road intersections. This ranges from simple
signalling, to level crossing barriers and grade separation where justified
by higher traffic volumes. The cost of these safety measures is shared
equally between KNR and the Ministry of Construction (MOC). The locations
of these improvements are selected jointly by KNR and MOC, according to
established rules, based on respective levels of traffic on rail and'on the
intersecting road. Other items include improvement of existing backshops
and sheds, relocation of lines to accomodate new industrial and urban
developments, and general improvements to right of way, buildings, housing
and training facilities.
Overall Economic Evaluation
4.16      The average economic return on the capacity increasing investments
and on way and structure renewals, which account for 72% of total project
costs, is 30%. This rate of return excludes the investments in: (a) the
SMESRS lines and Daejon Workshop, for which studies are still underway
(para. 4.12 to 4.14), totalling 12% of project costs; and (b) miscellaneous
small investments dispersed over the entire network (para. 4.15), totalling
16% of project costs.
Sensitivity and Risks
4.17      As previously mentioned (para. 2.21), traffic forecasts for railway
projects have often been over-optimistic. This is the main area of risk.
However, in an economy growing as rapidly as Korea's it is only a matter of
time for the forecasts to be achieved. Thus, full project benefits are
realized at most one or two years later than expected. For the purpose of
sensitivity analysis, the ERR's of the capacity increasing investments have
been recalculated assuming that both freight and passenger traffic would
increase at 50% of the forecast between 1977 and 1981. This same assumption
is used for the sensitivity analysis in the financial evaluation (para.
5.27).
4.18      Estimated costs for Korea railway projects have typically been
realistic, and slightly on the high side, as illustrated by the funds remaining
in previous loans after the projects have been fully executed. For the
sensitivity analysis, the ERRs of the capacity increasing investments have
been recalculated with cost variations of + 10%. The results of sensitivity
analysis are given in the table below:

4.19      As expected, the impact of even substantially slower traffic
growth on the rate of return is not very large, since benefits are postponed
but not cancelled. Another risk which is, however, impossible to quantify
and time, relates to passenger services. As mentioned in para. 4.02, the
high demand for better quality trains is related to low private car owner-
ship. Should government policy change, passenger traffic would certainly be
negatively affected. However, the effect of increased car ownership would
spread over a period of years and may be tempered by overall growth in
transport demand. Since railway equipment has a long life (assumed at 25
years for the ERR calculation), it is important to closely monitor shifts in
demand for rail services in order not to be saddled with excess capacity.
5. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
General
5.01      With heavy passenger and freight traffic, generally efficient
operations and low unit costs, KNR has the potential to become a financially
viable enterprise. Revenues could be sufficient to cover operating expenses,
debt service and a reasonable proportion of its capital investment needs.
KNR earned annual profits through 1969, although the amounts were relatively
modest and, due to inadequate depreciation provision and maintenance expendi-
tures, its profits were overstated.
5.02      As explained in para. 2.28, tariffs are strictly regulated by
the Government, which has held freight rates at low levels. As a result
after 1970 - with rising cost levels inflating KNR's operating expenses,
and the Government reluctant to permit adequate railway tariff increases
(para. 5.06) - the situation changed. KNR has since sustained regular
annual net deficits.
5.03      Reduced earnings, together with Government refusal to provide
equity capital (other than operating subsidies commencing in 1972), have
forced KNR to finance most of its investment requirements by borrowing.



- 30 -
This has increased its debt service burden, further reducing available funds,
and even causing KNR to borrow from the Korean Development Bank funds needed
to cover debt service.
5.04      Rates could be substantially raised on most of KNR's major freight
traffic (coal, cement, fertilizer, ores, grains and oil) with little fear of
significant diversion to other transport modes. In view of KNR's continual
efforts to improve passenger services (introducing new equipment and providing
more frequent services), passenger fares could also be raised (para. 2.33).
Thus, it should be possible for KNR to achieve financial viability, provided
the Government takes the needed action on tariffs.

- 32 -
5.06      This table shows that because tariff increases generally have been
inadequate and too late, KNR has been unable to generate sufficient revenues to
cover debt service requirements (which have risen from W 8.8 billion in 1971
to W 23.2 billion in 1976), or to earn agreed rates of return. The Government
recognizes this, but has maintained it would be inflationary to raise railway
freight tariffs to a level sufficient to cover fully distributed costs. Con-
sequently, to compensate for the loss in revenues due to delayed or inadequate
freight rate increases, the Government commenced, in 1973, to pay a subsidy
to KNR. This subsidy rose from W 1.5 billion in 1973 to W 14.4 billion in
1975, declined slightly to W 13.7 billion in 1976, and increased to W 21.7 bil-
lion in 1977.
5.07      Confronted with this Government policy regarding freight tariffs,
KNR has tended to rely on passenger service profits to offset losses on
freight services. Until recently, average revenue per passenger-km has been
higher than revenue per freight ton-km (Table 2.14). However, this has
tended to make railway passenger service more vulnerable to highway compe-
tition; in fact, KNR's passenger-traffic declined by 17% from 1969 to 1971.
Since 1973, as seen in Table 2.14 the Government has allowed freight tariffs
to increase more rapidly than passenger fares. The result has been that, by
1976, average revenue per ton-km exceeded that per passenger-km. The slower
increase in passenger fares, and improvements to passenger services, have
resulted in a reversal of the downward trend in passenger-km, which have
increased by 68% since 1971.
5.08      Table 5.2 illustrates the effects of inflation on revenues and
costs. Average revenues per passenger-km increased in current won from
W 1.976 in 1970 to W 3.673 in 1976, but declined in real terms to W 1.313.
Average revenues per ton-km increased in current won from W 1.44 in 1970
to W 4.636 in 1976, but declined in real terms to W 1.107 in 1974 (this has
since improved to W 1.657 in 1976).
5.09      Costs rose significantly in 1976, due largely to a mandatory wage
award, and for KNR to have covered its debt service obligations, operating
revenues would have needed to be increased by about 15%; i.e. the increase in
freight tariffs granted in January 1976 should have been matched by a similar
increase in passenger fares. As noted in Table 2.12, freight rates were
raised in January 1977 by the restructuring of the freight tariff, but there
was no increase in passenger fares. The freight rate increases ranged from
16% for the previous class 2 to 27% for the lowest class (mainly coal).
Tentative results for 1977 indicate that KNR almost broke even on operations.
Freight revenues, aided by the tariff increases noted above, rose from
W 43.5 billion in 1976 to W 59.5 billion in 1977, and passenger revenues, due
to increased traffic rose from W 52.5 billion in 1976 to W 66.7 billion. The
net deficit, after interest charges, of W 20.1 billion was more than covered
by the government subsidy of W 21.7 billion.

and in 1976 (all assets including land).
5.11      As shown by the above table, KNR's working capital position,
which had steadily deteriorated until 1974, has improved. This is largely
because the Government paid considerable operating subsidies to KNR in 1975
and 1976. However, the long-term debt has risen sharply over the period,
from W 100 billion in 1973 to W 245 billion at the end of 1976.
5.12      The Fifth Railway Loan Agreement reaffirmed the debt limitation
covenant of the Fourth Railway Loan Agreement, which required the Bank's
agreement before KNR incurred any debt should KNR's net cash revenues be less
than 1.2 times the maximum debt service requirements. KNR's net cash revenues
have not been sufficient to achieve this ratio, and the outstanding debt has
continued to grow, with a consequent rise in debt service requirements. The
increase in the outstanding long-term debt referred to in para. 5.11 was
largely due to: (a) the drawing down of loans already negotiated, such as IBRD
loans 863 and 1101-KO, O.E.C.F, KFW, Eximbank and 50 c/s group /1 loans,
/1 European manufacturer's consortium.



- 34 -
which rose by W 84 billion; and (b) the increase in borrowing from the
KDB, for capital investment and to help finance KNR's growing annual debt
service (para. 5.03). The debt limitation covenant was re-affirmed at

5.14      In a side letter to the Fifth Railway Loan Agreement dated April
10, 1975, the Government undertook to provide KNR with the funds needed to
service debt, until such time as KNR's cash generation became sufficient for
this purpose (which should not be later than Fiscal 1980). During 1975 and
1976, such funds were provided by the Government in the form of further
borrowing from the KDB. In the same letter, the Government also undertook
to formulate a financial recovery plan designed to enable KNR to generate
revenues sufficient to cover its operating expenses, meet its debt service
obligations in full and make a contribution towards its capital investments.
The elements, and effects, of such a plan are discussed in paras. 5.16 - 5.21.
5.15      As agreed under the Fifth Railway Loan, KNR carried out a revalua-
tion of fixed assets in 1975/76, the results of which are reflected in the
balance sheet of December 31, 1976. This revaluation added W 470 billion to
the gross value of fixed assets (including W 97 billion for land), and
resulted in a rise in annual depreciation provision from 14 6.5 billion in
1975 to W 15.0 billion in 1976. A further revaluation done in 1977, using
cost indices, added W 25.7 billion to the gross value of fixed assets. KNR
has agreed to revalue its fixed assets on an annual basis.

Forecast Financial Performance (1978-81)
5.16      KNR has prepared financial forecasts, based on assumptions and
data detailed in Table 5.5. These forecasts have been adjusted to take
into account tariff increases proposed by the Government, and are given in
Tables 5.1, 5.3 and 5.6. The proposed increases, which would enable KNR,
after 1978, to generate funds sufficient to cover debt service requirements,
and make some provision towards capital investment needs are listed below:
Proposed tariff increases    Passenger   Freight
1978                  10%         15%
1979                  10%         15%
1980                  10%         15%
1981                  10%         10%
The Government has proposed the tariff increases listed above in the light of
its policy to restrict inflation within a limit of 10% annually. Thus
passenger fares would keep pace with inflation, and KNR's freight revenues
would improve by about 5% annually in real terms. The proposed tariff
increases are lower than those suggested by the Bank; to compensate for the
reduced revenues the Government also proposes to grant subsidies to KNR of
W 14.6 billion (1978), W 12 billion (1979) and W 7.5 billion (1980).
5.17      The methodology and principal assumptions are summarized below:
(a) Income accounts
(i) Revenues: Based on agreed traffic forecasts, converted
to revenues by applying average 1977 revenues per pass-km
or ton-km. The effect of tariff increases is shown sepa-
rately. Other minor increases are due to a Management
Rationalization Plan (MRP) KNR is carrying out.
(ii) Operating Expenses
a.  Labor costs take into account some minor increases
in staff, plus forecast 11-12% average annual cost
increases.
b.  Fuel costs are based on estimated engine-km (derived
from traffic forecasts), plus forecast 7.5-8% average
annual cost increases.
c.  Maintenance costs include labor costs calculated as
in (a) above, materials costs adjusted for traffic
increases and for cost increases as in (b) above.



- 36 -
d. Other costs are based on the 1977 level, inflated as in
(b) above.
(iii) Depreciation is calculated at 2.4% of the annual value of
gross fixed assets, excluding land. Calculations include the
effect of proposed annual revaluations.
(iv) Interest charges: Forecast on the basis of: existing debt,
plus new foreign debt at 8% p.a. (largely repayable over
17 years, including 4 years grace); and new local borrowing
at 6% p.a. (repayable over 20 years with 5 years grace, as
presently obtained from the KDB).
(b)  Balance sheets
- Receivables vary largely with freight traffic;
- Inventories vary with total operating costs;
- Accounts payable vary with cash operating costs; and
- Fixed Assets take into account (i) investment proposed under
the Investment Plan; (ii) annual retirements or disposal of
assets at about 10% of annual investment, (iii) annual revalua-
tions at 8% for the years 1977-79, and 7.5% for 1980 and 1981.
(c) Detailed calculations are available in the Project File
(Reference C-8).
5.18      Overall, the projections show an improved financial performance.
The actions proposed would enable KNR to maintain a satisfactory working
capital position. However, it would be unable to contribute anything toward
capital investment requirements of W 202 billion needed over the project
period (1978/79) but would be able to contribute W 33 billion towards overall
investment plan requirements of W 503 billion; the Government is expected to
provide about W 76 billion in subsidies and grants, and about 78% (W 394 bil-
lion) of the investment plan would have to be borrowed (para. 5.20). Long-
term debt would thus rise from W 245 billion at the end of 1976 to W 533 bil-
lion by the end of 1981 (Table 5.3).
5.19      The 1978-81 income account forecast, given in Table 5.1 is sum-
marized below.

Return on net fixed assets                0.3%      2.1%     3.5%      4.2%
The operating ratio would improve from 110-in 1976 to 78 by 1981; the
interest charge coverage would rise from negative in 1976 to 1.6; the debt
service coverage would improve from 0.4 in 1976 to 1.6, and KNR would earn a
rate of return of 0.3% in 1978, improving to 4.2% in 1981. While the latter
is relatively modest, further improvement would require raising tariffs
higher than as proposed, which would conflict with the Government's policy of
inflation restraint (para. 5.16).
5.20      The cash flow forecast for the project period (1978/79),/1 and for
the investment period (1977-81) (detailed in Table 5.6), is summarized

KNR will not be able to contribute to the project cost, and with the
Government providing equity funds of about 17%, KNR will have to borrow
the remaining funds needed. KNR's earning power will improve in later
years, and its dependence on the Government and on the need to borrow
for investment will decline. Thus over the whole investment plan period
(1977-81) KNR would be able to contribute about 7% of the total cost, the
Government share would deline to 15% and borrowing would account for 78%.

5.21      Forecast balance sheets for the years. 1977-1981 are summarized
below:
1977     1978      1979      1980     1981
Current assets                         29.1      32.5      36.9     43.7      48.6

Long-term debt                        275.0    340.3    420.6    482.8    533.0
Provision for severance pay             3.3       3.3       3.3      3.3       3.3
Net equity                            580.0    655.4    753.1    876.6  1,014.9
Total liabilities and equity        858.3    999.0  1,177.0  1,362.7  1,551.2
Current and liquid ratios should be about 1.4 and 0.8, respectively, after
1977.  The debt/equity ratio should rise from 29/71 in 1976 to 36/64 in 1979,
then fall to 35/65 by 1981. These ratios would be satisfactory.
5.22      A financial recovery plan, agreed on at negotiations included the
following points:
(a) the aggregate of tariff increases in any fiscal year will be
not less than the increase in the wholesale price index in Korea
for that year;
(b) the earning by KNR of a rate of return of not less than 2% in
fiscal year 1979, 3.2% in fiscal 1980 and 4% annually thereafter;
(c) the funds needed to finance debt service (para. 5.14) will be
provided by way of grants or equity contributions;
(d) -tariff increases acceptable to the Bank will be made before loan
effectiveness.
Sensitivity Analysis
5.23      Experience with most railway projects has shown that forecasting
traffic presents the greatest difficulty. With few exceptions, project
appraisal forecasts have been overly optimistic, particularly for freight.
5.24      In Table 5.7, 1972-76 freight and passenger traffic, forecast
in appraisal reports for Loans 863-KO and 1101-KO, are compared with actual
results. As the forecasting periods of the two reports overlap, there is
some duplication. In general, the forecasts for Loan 1101-KO were more
optimistic than those for 863-KO.



- 40 -
5.25      For Loan 1101-K0, actual freight ton-km rose at 50% of the rate
forecast; actual passenger traffic (in pass-km) rose at 73% of the rate
forecast. For the purposes of a sensitivity analysis, it is assumed that both
freight and passenger traffic will increase over the years 1977-81, at 50% of
the rate forecast.
5.26      Another risk relates to the adequacy of tariff increases granted by
the Government. As discussed in para. 5.06, tariff increases, due to the
Government's reluctance to take such action, have been generally granted too
late and too small. The financial forecasts given in this chapter have
assumed tariff increases as now proposed by the Government. Should the
actual tariff increases fall short of these, then the effect of such action
is shown in Table 5.8.
5.27      Table 5.8 presents the effects of three alternatives:
(a) Page 1. 50% reduction in traffic growth, with the Government's
proposed tariff increases;
(b) Page 2. No reduction in traffic growth, with 50% of the
Government's proposed tariff increases after 1978; and
(c) Page 3. 50% reduction in traffic growth, with 50% of the
Government's proposed tariff increases after 1978.
5.28      Only in alternative (a) would KNR's cash generation be sufficient
to cover debt service and make some contribution to investment. In all other
cases, unless the Government continued to pay increasingly large annual
operating subsidies, KNR would have to incur a much higher debt. This is
illustrated by the table below:
Total
Additional Government subsidies       1978      1979     1980      1981   1978-81
needed (or additional borrowing)    -------------- (W billion) --------------
Alternative (a)                       16.5       8.8         -        -      25.3
Alternative (b)                       12.6      15.8     14.3      15.4      58.1
Alternative (c)                       14.5      17.9     19.4      27.2      79.0
The rate of return under alternative (a) would be negative in 1978, rising to
2.6% by 1981; under (b) it would be 0.3% in 1978 rising to 1.0% in 1981, and
under (c) it would be negative in 1978 rising to 0.5% in 1980 and falling to
0.2% in 1981.
5.29      The foregoing analysis emphasizes the importance of adequate tariff
action. Slower traffic growth by itself would reduce cash generation, but
KNR would still be able to finance debt service after 1979. Inadequate
tariffs would only worsen the present unsatisfactory financial position of
KNR.



- 41 -
5.30      The project's sensitivity to changes in (a) cost of the project and
(b) level of operating costs was examined. Relatively generous price contin-
gencies have been built into the estimated project costs (para. 3.16) and as
further increases are not expected to be substantial, their effect is likely
to be minimal, and has been disregarded. Regarding (b), as labor cost is the
most significant, and has risen more sharply than other cost increases over
recent years (Table 5.2, Item 3), the effect of annual increases of (i) 20%
and (ii) 25% (as against annual increases of 12% assumed in the forcasts)
was examined. The additional costs and the further annual tariff increases
needed to generate the equivalent additional revenues are given below:
1978   1979   1980   1981
Additional labor costs (W billion)
(i)                                                   4.9   11.6   20.2   32.3
(ii)                                                   8.0   19.2   34.3   55.5
Additional annual tariff increases needed (M)
(i)                                                   3.0    2.9    2.4    3.0
(ii)                                                   4.9    4.7    4.3    5.0
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During loan negotiations satisfactory assurances were obtained
from the Government on the following principal points:
(a)  a management study of KNR will be carried out by June 1979
(para. 2.02);
(b)  KNR will submit to the Bank, by mid-1979, detailed technical,
financial and economic analyses of major fixed capacity investments
proposed for 1980/81, such as double tracking, electrification and
signaling (para. 3.03);
(c)  transport sector studies will be carried out under the supervision
of EPB, mainly by local consulting firms, with some specialized
expatriate technical assistance (para. 3.07);
(d)  KNR will establish a plan by end 1978 including measures necessary
to achieve specific operational forecasts in 1979, 1980 and 1981
(para. 3.20);
(e)  investment to upgrade Seoul suburban lines will be postponed until
the results of the urban transport study of the larger Seoul
metropolitan area become available (para. 4.13);



- 42 -
(f)  construction of the proposed Daejeon passenger car workshop will
not commence until the Bank has reviewed studies recently completed
(para. 4.14);
(g)  a financial recovery plan for KNR, (para. 5.22).
6.02      A condition for loan effectiveness is that KNR's freight and passenger
tariffs have been increased to levels acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.22).
6.03      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$120 million
for a period of 17 years including 4 years of grace to the Government of the
Republic of Korea, for onlending to the KNR.

the Bank.                                                 there have been considerable
delays in installing the revised
system due to KNR's lack of
suitably qualified and ex-
perienced accounting and
computer staff needed to work
with the consultants. Work on
installing the system commenced
in 1977 and is expected to be
completed early this year
(para 2.35 of Staff Appraisal
Report on Sixth Project).
3.        When the first Credit was made in 1962, the Ministry of Transportation was
responsible for the operation of the railway and had four bureaus dealing almost
exclusively with the matters relating to it. Since then considerable progress has
been made in providing KNR with a greater degree of autonomy, both operationally and
financially. Progress on commercial accounting, developed by consultants, has been
slow, due to difficulties in KNR supplying sufficient qualified and experienced staff
to work with the consultants and in developing and implementing a commercial account-
ing system in parallel with the traditional budgetary accounts required by the Govern-
ment. However, as indicated above, installation should be completed by the end of
this year (para. 2.35 of Staff Appraisal Report and para. 4.03 of the draft Loan
Agreement sets a deadline of December 31, 1978 for such completion).
4.        Because of the importance that the Government attaches to the railway, not
only as an important transport mode but also for security reasons, it is understandable
that it wants to keep substantial control on KNR. As shown by the very high operating
performance of KNR this has not been detrimental. However, there are measures which
can be taken within the Government accounting and budgetary framework, while giving
KNR as much autonomy as possible. We intend to include in the proposed Loan Agreement
a covenant similar to the one agreed to for the Korea Maritime and Port Authority
(KMPA) in Loan 1401-KO, which would achieve this objective.
B. KNR'S Financial Situation
1.        Tariffs and Financial Performance.  All the five Loan/Credit Agreements have
covenants stipulating that the Borrower shall cause KNR to have its tariffs reflect
costs and also that KNR shall take all measures, not limited to tariffs, to enable KNR
to cover its working expenses, meet debt service requirements, maintain adequate
working capital, establish reserves for contingencies, and finance a reasonable
proportion of its capital.

follows:

VI. Supplemental Letter of April 10, 1975 - "KNR's Financial Situation"
(a)  The Government intends, until such                   (a)  Funds were provided in 1975,
time as a financial plan acceptable to the                and 1976 in the form of additional

to meet the service of all its foreign
and local borrowings.
(b)  The Government shall formulate such                  (b)  In a letter dated December 7,
a (financial recovery) plan and discuss                   1977, the Government spelled out
it with the Bank within eighteen months                   its intentions regarding tariff
of the signature of the Loan Agreement                    increases (see para. 4, page 8).
pertaining to the above-mentioned
Project so that KNR could attain the
agreed financial targets set out in
Section 4.06 of said Loan Agreement and
the objectives set forth in this letter
no later than its fiscal year, 1980.
3.        Although in the late 1960s KNR was not able to earn the full required rates
of return, it did earn positive returns until 1971. In that year competition from
improved highways, and in particular, the opening of the Seoul-Busan expressway,
eroded KNR's profitable passenger traffic. The financial performance deteriorated
even further in 1973-75 following the sharp inflation caused by the oil crisis. The
Korean Government, as most other governments have done, has argued for keeping public
sector tariffs low so as not to further contribute to inflation. As a result freight
rates were not increased between March 1972 and Janury 1974, while passenger fares
were not increased between January 1970 and January 1974. In order to alleviate the
effect on KNR's finances the Government has provided annual subsidies of W 0.7 billion
in 1972, W 1.5 billion in 1973, W 5.7 billion in 1974, W 14.4 billion in 1975 and
W 13.7 billion in 1976.
4.        With inflation somewhat abated in 1977, the Government is now prepared to
grant reasonable tariff increases as given in the letter of the Deputy Prime Minister
dated December 7, 1977, the receipt of which was made a condition of submitting loan
documents to the Loan Committee. Assuming that the rate of inflation will not exceed
10%, the proposed tariff increases will enable the achievement of the financial
targets by the date specified in the Supplemental Letter to the Loan Agreement for the
Fifth Railway Project. We will seek assurances that the proposed tariff increases
will be adjusted upwards if inflation is greater than anticipated.
C. Operational and Technical Matters
1.        Most agreements specify technical and operational studies to be conducted
generally in association with proposed developments and investments. All required
studies have been conducted and the results communicated and discussed with the Bank.
In general recommendations have been implemented. The continuously improving perform-
ance level of KNR shows that the dialogue with the Bank on operational and technical
matters has generally been successful. Further studies are included in the Sixth
Project to continue improvements. A list of the subjects studied under the various
agreements is given below:

at Daejon (Section 4.10 to 4.13). All studies have been conducted. Availability of
diesel locos and rail cars has been constantly increasing from 83% in 1971 to 87% in
1976 for diesel locos and from 67% to 80% for diesel rail cars. Detailed schemes for
improving telecommunications were recommended by consultants and financed and implemented
under the Project. Consultants recommended the construction of a new workshop at
Daejon, construction has started for the freight car workshop and will start under the
Sixth Project for the passenger car workshop. Recommendations regarding coal transport
were partially implemented (Section 4.14). A study of bulk commodities including coal
is included in the Sixth Project with a view to preparing a project for Bank financing
to further improve distribution of bulk commodities, mainly coal and cement.
Fourth Project - Loan 863-K0 (November 22, 1972)
4.        No new study was specified under this agreement but covenants covered the
completion of construction and improvement of marshalling yards studied under the
Second Project (Section 3.07) and further rationalization of workshops in connection
with the electrification of the industrial line (Section 3.08). Marshalling yards and
workshops continue to be improved and expanded in line with traffic growth.
Fifth Project - Loan 1101-KO (April 10, 1975)
5.        No new study was specified under this agreement but covenants covered further
improvements to be made in workshops with a view to further increasing availability of
motive power and rolling stock (Section 3.07). An advisor was appointed and commenced
work late in 1976. Since the availability and utilization of motive power and rolling
stock in Korea is generally high compared to most other railways, improvements, while
always possible, require constant efforts. Results are gradual and long term.
D. Transport Investment and Coordination
1.        In 1965, the Bank made a technical assistance grant for a comprehensive
survey of all modes of transport in Korea. The study drew attention to the need to
develop roads in the country as well as provide for transport coordination. In 1968 a
Technical Assistance and Engineering Credit (S4-K0) was made to study the highway
sector as well as review responsibilities of ministries concerned with transportation,
with a view to establishing an organization for the coordination of transport.

2.        This Credit refers to the study conducted under S4-KO mentioned above as
follows:

measures.                                                 It was intended that TPO would be
responsible for undertaking eco-
nomic analysis and rendering pro-
fessional advice to TCMC on
investment planning and important
policy measures including licensing,
p pricing and taxation within the
subsectors of transport. TCMC
met rarely and the TPO with
limited staff and its location
in one of the concerned Ministries
could hardly be expected to
perform its envisaged role of
investment coordination.
Fourth Project - Loan 863-KO (November 22, 1972)
Section 4.06 - With a view to improving                   Slow progress was made in
transport planning and coordination,                      strengthening TPO.  In 1973 the

of all modes of transport; (ii) review
the function and work program of the
TPO; (iii) cause the TPO to furnish to

of the Borrower, including the Ministry of
Construction of the Borrower, to ensure

that all major investment proposals
relating to the transport sector are
furnished to the TPO for the purposes
of appraisal and ensuring coordination
in respect thereof; and (v) strengthen
economic expertise in the TPO by making
appointments to, or training the staff
of, TPO.
4.         In 1973, EPB was reviewing the functions and work program of TPO with a
view to implementing this agreement (Appraisal report of the Second Highway Project).
This matter was discussed during the negotiations of that project (956-KO, January 25,
1974) and the Government promised to submit a status report on TPO with a view
to discussing appropriate action by mid-1974. Little progress was made as the Govern-
ment could not reach a firm conclusion about TPO's work program.
Fifth Project - Loan 1101-KO (April 10, 1975)
Section 3.13 - Within 12 months of                      Presidential decrees were issued
the date of submission of the time-                     in July and August 1975 establishing
phased program referred to in Section                   a Transport Coordination Office (TCO)
6.01 of this Agreement or other date                    in the Ministry of Transportation,
as the Borrower and the Bank shall                      and an inter-ministerial Transport
agree, the Borrower shall take                          Coordination Committee (TCC),  TCO

Borrower's policies and investment                      chairs the TCC.  The functions
proposals made by all its agencies                      of TCO and TCC are given in
and ministries related to the                           Annexes 4 and 5 of the Korea
transport sector, including, inter                      Transport Sector Mission full
alia, highways, railways, ports,                        report of February 11, 1976.

working group on transportation
prepared detailed transport
demand forecasts providing a
useful basis for investment
planning.
6.         While the charter of the TCC includes intermodal coordination of transport
sector investments, the TCC has in fact not exercised this function. The Economic
Planning Board (EPB), which exercises budgetary control and plays a senior role with
regard to all other ministries, has the dominant role in decision on investment projects.
EPB intends to make much more intensive reviews of investment projects and has estab-
lished a separate Bureau of Project Evaluation to this end. Sector studies covering
major aspects of transport coordination have been identified by the sector mission and
are included in the Sixth Project. They will be carried out under the supervision of
EPB.



ANNEX 2
Page 12
7.        This approach appears much more satisfactory and workable than the one where .
investment coordination was to come under one of the ministries, namely MOT. The role
of the TCO should remain one of collecting basic data in the sector and assisting in
the formulation and review of transport policies, especially those related to pricing
and regulation since MOT is the Ministry responsible for licensing and rates and fares
setting.

/a In addition, dangerous goods have a 10g surcharge.
/b These commodities previously rated as Class 2.
/c Previously Class 3.
/d Previously Class 4.
/e Previously Class 5.
(a)  Tariffs are straight line, in direct proportion to distance travelled
(i.e. no taper for distance) and rates are quoted in increments for
each block of 50 kilometers. Intermediate distances are charged at
the next highest 50 km level (i.e. 227 km charged at 250 km rate).
(b)  There is a Won 14,220 minimum charge, to help cover basic non-
distance related charges (i.e. terminal costs); it also introduces
a slight distance taper on a rate per ton-km basis.
(c)  Car-load charges are billed at a minimum car-load weight which is
usually equivalent to the practical capacity of the car for the
particular commodity density. In addition, these minimum charges
effectively penalize the use of smaller freight cars (under 30 tons)
for hauls up to 100 km.
(d) Miscellaneous charges include:
(i) Switching - W 1,877 per km per movement.
(ii) Demurrage - W 120 per ton for each 6 hours (after first
6 hours free use).
(iii)  Storage   - W 476 per ton (car-load basis) each 24 hours.

W 1,090 (one month), or W 3,270 (three months), for journeys
up to 18 km. Thereafter, the charge is on a straight line
kilometrage basis at W 1.21 per pass-km.
(ii) Nonstudents can buy monthly or three monthly tickets (but
which can be used 60 times in one month) with minimum charges
of W 1,880 or W 5,640, respectively, also for journeys up to
18 km. Thereafter, the straight line kilometrage charge is
at W 1.74 per pass-km, i.e. a 30% discount over the ordinary
basic fare.

B. Uneconomic Stations
1. Passengers and freight. The following stations where passengers and
freight services earn revenues covering less than 30% of personnel
costs involved are regarded as operating uneconomic services. KNR
proposes action to discontinue services, simplify operations, or
close stations, as under:
(i) Passenger services
1977    30 stations - ratio of revenues to personnel costs:  12% /a
1978    60    "        -       "    "                  "        :  18%

97 stations
2.  Baggage services.  At the following stations, where the revenues
fail to cover 100% of the personnel costs involved, KNR proposes
action similar to (1) above, as under:
1977   110 stations - ratio of revenues to personnel costs:   72% /c

iv)  Modal Comparison
For the purpose of this analysis the modal comparison is for
bulk commodities such as coal, cement, ore and fertilizer since no
further capacity is provided by the project for general cargo or bulk
oil. The figures above show that the line haul cost of road transport
is much higher than that of either rail or coastal shipping. The
traffic forecasts given in Part II already reflect the share of
coastal shipping when it is competitive i.e. for cement plants, fertilizer
plants, oil refineries located on or near the coast. For the remaining
traffic for which rail capacity is provided by the project, coastal
shipping is no longer a valid alternative as it would require long
terminal transport at either end, which would require either rail
capacity or a very high cost road transport.
Rail Versus Road Costs. Assuming average rail transport distance
of 165 km; this is the average for cement. Average distances for coal
and ore are larger and would give even a further advantage to rail:
Rail cost              Road cost
Line haul cost, 165 km    @ W 5.2/t = W 858        @ W 26.8/t - W 4,422

Per ton-km                              11.3                      26.8
Difference                               W 15.5/ton-km
/a  Estimated on the basis of 1970 cost analysis by consultants
Touche Ross. Including loading, unloading and transportation
costs from station within a 5 km radius, the terminal costs
were then estimated at W 434/ton. At the factory end, costs
are identical since all plants have sidings and direct loading
of either rail or road.

Rate of return is 42%
/a Include investment in - freight wagons
- locomotives (on the basis of diesel loco-km for
freight trains)
- line capacity increases and telecommunications
equipment allocated to freight services (see detailed
allocation of costs in Table 4.2).
/b This is taken conservatively as the capacity generated by the box and gondola
cars acquired under the project, assuming improved utilization. The figures
above represent somewhat less than 2/3 of the freight traffic increase forecast
for 1978 and 1979, and only about 85% of the traffic increase in bulk commo-
dities except oil. The remaining traffic will be handled by improvement in use
of the existing stock, including remodelling. Remodelling costs are included
in /a above although no specific benefits have been quantified.
/c Difference between transport costs by rail and the least costly alternative.
This is generally trucking since coastal shipping is only competitive for
traffic with origin and destinations at or near ports and this has already been
taken into consideration when forecasting railway traffic. An average of
W 15/ton-km is assumed as the cost difference (Table 4.3).

SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Financial Forecasts - Methodology and Principal Assumptions
1. Traffic
Traffic will increase as forecast in Tables 2.5-2.10.
2. Revenues
(a) Basic
(i) Passenger revenues have been calculated on the basis of agreed
traffic forecasts, analyzed under: Intercity commuters and
noncommuters, (further subdivided under Saemul express, limited
express, ordinary express and ordinary trains), military and
Seoul Metropolitan Electric Suburban Railway Services (SMESRS),
converted to revenues by applying the average revenue per
passenger-km earned on each service during the first five months
of 1977.
(ii) Freight revenues have similarly been calculated on the basis
of agreed traffic forecasts analyzed under major commodities,
converted to revenues by applying-the average revenue per
ton-km earned by each such commodity (or group of commodities),
during the first five months of 1977.
(b) Increased Revenues
(i) Assuming tariff increases as discussed in para. 5.23 of the
report. Although, as discussed in para. 2.33, such increases
should be selective, the annual effect on revenues is treated
as though they would be across-the-board./a
(ii) KNR has calculated increased passenger revenues, due to (a)
upgrading of services on major trunk lines (additional sleeper
trains and airconditioned limited express trains) and (b)
tariff increases on baggage trains, due to service improvements.
3. Operating Expenses
(a) Labor Costs - KNR has calcuated the average number of staff needed
each year, both for workshop and nonworkshop functions, and has
calculated a basic annual cost on the current (1977) average annual
cost per employee (workshop employees cost about 6% higher than
/a In the Grey Cover report, the increases as agreed at negotiations will be
indicated.

nonworkshop staff). Effect is then given to assumed annual cost
increases averaging 12% in the years 1978-80, and 11% in 1981.
Forecast savings due to staff reductions caused by the Management
Rationalization Plan (MRP) are shown separately.
(b) Fuel Costs - KNR has estimated the engine-km needed to carry the
forecast traffic, under engine types (diesel, electric and steam
locomotives and diesel and electric railcars), then applying the
current cost of fuel per engine-km (by type), and inflating the
annual costs by factors of 8% p.a. in 1978 and 1979, and 7.5% p.a.
in 1980 and 1981.
(c) Maintenance Costs - Costs are increased annually in line with
traffic increases. For maintenance of facilities, KNR has forecast
costs (excluding labor) increasing at 25% of the annual percentage
increase in traffic units, while for maintenance of rolling stock
50% is used. Workshop labor costs are as calculated in (a) above.
As in (b) above, annual costs (except labor) are inflated, using the
same percentages.
(d) Other Costs - (Administrative and General), are based on 1977
budgeted costs, inflated thereafter as in items (b) and (c) above.
(e) Cost Savings - As mentioned in item (ii) above, KNR has estimated
cost savings due to the MRP, for labor and other costs.
(f)  Depreciation - KNR has based its calculations on the figures arrived
at in 1976, taking into account the asset revaluation of that year.
After eliminating land, the overall percentage of depreciation to
gross fixed assets was found to be 2.4%. This is applied to the
gross value excluding land as at the beginning of the year, to which
