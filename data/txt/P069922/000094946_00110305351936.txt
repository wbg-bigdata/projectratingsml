EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Brief Background
This report focuses on the Environmental Impact Assessment of the proposed works to be
undertaken in repairing damages done to the southem and central parts of the Western
Main Road - (Queens Park-Grand Mal and Grand Roy - Palmist) by hurricane Lennie in
November 1999. It is one of the most important roads in the entire island, for example:
I.    The only fuel storage depot on the island is located along the road;
2.    It is recognized as prime tourist attraction;
3.    It is also the main communication link to the tourist attractions on the
western side of the island including the towns of Sauteurs, Victoria,
Gouyave and the capital St. George's.
4.    The damages done to the above-mentioned parts of the road almost
brought the island to a complete halt when access to the fuel storage depot
from both locations was severed.
The process involved in the preparation of this ELA Report involved public consultations
and discussions with the affected comnmunities; interviews and discussions with the
engineering consultants, Officials from the Ministries of Finance, Works and Agriculture;
surveys, data collection and assessments.

THE EIA REPORT
Environmental Manaeement-Lezal and Institutional Framework
The report highlights the legislature and institutional framework for Environmnental
Management in Grenada, the most relevant ones to the project and their major weakness
(Section 2). Of the above, the Land Development..Control Authority stands out for its
overall responsibility for land use management in general.
Description of Environment
The study areas are located along the coast and involve some important locations to the
local communities such as seine fishing sites and beaches (Section 4); hence the main for
their involvement in the process.
Identification of Environmental ImDacts
The environmental characteristics and scope of works for both components of the project
are similar, except for the land use, number and quality of beaches
(Section 3 & 4). Therefore the environmental issues, impacts and mitigation measures
are the same (Section 5 & 6). Although Grand Roy - Palmist is not a residential area, the
construction activities will have the same effect on commuters and the users of the beach.
Five key issues were identified:
* Beach protection and improvement
* Preservation of good seine fishing sites
* Pollution control
* Road safety
*  Public awareness
v



Sienificant Positive lmpacts
The significant positive impacts of the proposed works are that it will:
+ Provide protection for properties in low lying areas
+ Improve road safety
* Contribute to the preservation of Grenada's transportation network and the
enhancement of development potentials in general.
Significant Negative Imnacts
No significant negative impacts are predicted for the project. There will be some changes
in noise levels, air quality, beach and marine environment, traffic problems and public
inconveniences during implementation. However, except for accidents, they are expected
to be minimal.
Mitigation Measures
Thirteen measures are listed to be taken in order to address the above-mentioned negative
impacts (Section 6). The level of success will be, to some extent, dependent upon the
recommended public awareness program to be developed and implemented by the
Ministry of Works, in collaboration with the Police Traffic Department, targeting the
local communities and affected persons including bus driver (No. 2).
The other measure worth mentioning here is number 1. (As much as possible, beach
encroachment must be avoided and seine-fishing areas must be preserved). It sets out to
ensure the protection of the most important physical resource to the local communities.
vi



Site SuDervision and Monitorine
A site supervision and monitoring program is to be developed after final work schedules
are prepared by contractors. Some of the main issues to be considered are listed in
Section 7.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Government of Grenada is seeking financial assistance from the World Bank for sea
defense and road improvement in the Queens Park-Grand Mal and Grand Roy-Palmiste
areas. Both are part of the Western main road and were badly damageri by Hurricane
Lennie in 1999. Engineering designs and proposals are currently being prepared for this
purpose.
In order to ensure that the proposed works will not seriously affect the environment and
the respective communities, the Environmental Consultant, Mr. Edward Niles, was hired
by the World Bank to prepare an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the
proposed project. The period of contract is 30 working days from February 1".
The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the EIA required, among other things, that the
Environmental Consultant work closely with the Engineering Consultant and relevant
Government officials during implementation.  Public consultation was also a key
component of the TOR.
1.1 Brief Background
Over the past 10 years,the Governnent of Grenada has been investing large sums of
money towards the improvement of its road network throughout the island. This
investment has increased development potentials (particularly in the agricultural and
tourism  sectors) in the rural comnnunities and economically depressed areas.  The
positive economic, social and environmental impacts resulting from the swift movement
of agricultural produce, goods and services to and from the rural communities and
throughout the country, as a whole, can be described as tremendous, though difficult to
measure in this study.



Unlike the roads on the Eastem side of the island, the Western Main Road, which
includes the study areas, (Queen's Park to Grand Mal and Grand Roy to Palmist) is
located along the seacoast (Fig. 1) and constantly threatened by wave actions during
rough seas and hurricane seasons.  As a result similar investments in this part of the
island have obviously included coastal protection, mainly sea defense walls and rock
armor.
It is important to note here that if the problems of the study areas are not addressed soon,
it may have adverse effect on economic activities in the entire western side of the island.
This road is one of Grenada's prime tourist attraction. It provides excellent views of the
ocean most of the way. It is also the main link to other tourist attractions and between the
towns of Sauteurs, Victoria, Gouyave and St. George's. (Fig. 1).
The only fuel storage depot on the island, located at Grand Mal, also makes this road one
of the most important roads in the country. It became evident when both studies areas
were seriously damaged by the storm surge caused by Hurricane Lennie in November,
cutting off the area from the rest of the island. This situation almost brought the entire
island to a halt due to the lack of access to the storage depot.

2. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT - LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL
FRAMEWORK
2.1 Environmental Policy
Grenada's environmental policy focuses on the protection of sensitive terrestrial and
marine areas, adequate disposal of solid and liquid waste and the protection of public
health and safety. As such it covers a wide range of environmental resources and issues.
The forest, water sheds, marine ecosystems, cultural heritage, wildlife, air and noise
pollution and other aspects of the natural and built environment.
This broad-base environmental policy led to the enactment of several pieces of legislation
dating back to the 1946 Town and Country Planning Ordinance, which introduced urban
and land use planning in Grenada. Two decades later, in 1965, a Central Planning and
Housing Authority was set up to review development applications and control
development.
The dissolution of local government in 1969 left the development control functions
exclusively in the hands of the Central Government. At about the same time, in 1968, a
new law, the Land Development Control Act, created a new centralized authority- the
Land Development Control Authority (LDCA) -which, together with the Physical
Planning Unit (PPU), is responsible for both planning and development control in
Grenada.
Since the 1 940's, several other pieces of legislation and regulations have been enacted and
amended with the view of providing the necessary legal framework for the many
different agencies dealing with the management of environmental resources.
3



These legislations include:   Forestry, Soils and Water Conservation Ordinance,
1949;8each Protection Law, 1979; Bird and Other Wildlife Protection Ordinance, 1957;
and the National Trust Act, 1967, for the protection of cultural heritage. In the last 18
years, Grenada has updated the Land Development Control Act (in 1983, with regulations
in 1988). It has enacted a new Fisheries Act, 1986, which provides for the protection of
marine resources, and in 1990, a National Parks and Protected areas Act.
2.2 Relevant Leislations
Grenada now has in place several pieces of legislation to protect its environment.
However, the most relevant ones to the project are: The Public Health Ordinance, 1925
and Act 1973, which has been supplemented by the passage of the Solid Waste
Management Authority Act 1995, addresses pollution control and the abatement of litter.
The Fisheries Amendment Act, 1998, dealing with the protection of the marine
environment, the Land Development Act, 1983, with regulations in 1998.
The Land Development Control Act stands out in this regard for its overall responsibility
for land use management in general. It is set up under the Act with regulatory powers
over any development taking place in, on, under or over the land. It meets once a month
to review applications and other matters pertaining to land development. It also relies on
the staff of the Physical Planning Unit for implementation purposes.
Despite the above, environmental control is still seriously weak.  Critical pieces of
legislation are outdated.   Legislation dealing with environmental management is
dispersed among several different government agencies and often lacks enforcement
powers.  Those agencies often carry out developments and are not subject to the
regulations of the Land Development Control Authority. There is also no co-ordination
between them.
4



The following are some examples of legislative weaknesses:
0 Pollution control under the Public Health Ordinance follows the legal theory of
nuisance, defined to include any accumulation of deposit, which is injurious to
health. The difficulty of proof under this theory, added to the very outdated
provisions and extremely low penalties of the law weakens its enforcement.
> The Land Development Control Act does not make provisions for any
development to be subject to Mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment.
> There is no machinery in place for determining and monitoring levels of pollution
(e.g. air, noise, etc.) created by developments. This issue is, to a large extent,
dependent upon the affected communities or individuals.
2.3 Institutions
Responsibility for environmental management is dispersed among no less than fifteen
(15) Govemment Agencies. There is no mandatory provision for co-ordination among
them. The Physical Planning Unit and the Land Development Control Authority are
expected to perform this role. However, it is hampered by its apparent reactive approach
and bias towards the processing of land development applications.
The Government Agencies with environmental management responsibilities that are
Relevant to the project, apart from Physical Planning/Land Development Control
Authority, Ministry of Finance and Planning are:
> Fishery Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Lands, Forestry and Fisheries;
P Public Health Department, Ministry of Health;
5



) Department of Works, Ministry of Works, Public Utility and Communication.
It is important to note here that, except for cases of disaster, complaints or requests,
neither of those agencies have been known to be involved in environmental monitoring
for such projects or any other that is implemented by Government agencies.
3. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
The proposed project covers the coastal areas and roadway in two (2) locations along the
western main road, Queen's Park to Grand Mal in the parish of St. George and Grand
Roy to Palmiste in the parish of St. John. (Fig. 1) It involves construction of sea defense
walls and rock armor; reconstruction of damaged parts of the roadway; road widening
and realignment in some locations, road resurfacing; and construction of foot walk.
The Queen's Park-Grand Mal part of the project consist of a total distance of l,590m of
sea defense (Appendix. 1). The total sea defense for the Grand Roy-Palmiste section
amounts to 1,03 1 m. (Appendix 1). In both cases the width of the road will be extended
to 5.5m and 6.5m  in some areas.  The difference in width results mainly from
development constraints along the roadside.
A Summary of the above is as follows:

4. DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
4.1 Oueen's Park-Grand Mal
4.1.1 Physical Environment
The Queen's Park-Grand Mal component of the project is located within the northwestern
part of the parish of St. George. The area in question involves that part of the Western
Main Road from the Green Bridge on the Western side of the Queen's Park National
Stadium through Fontenoy up to the Northern end of Grand Mal Bay. Approximately
70%/ of that road is located directly along the sea coast/beach front.
The land use in the entire area is predominantly residential and recreational with some
commercial activities: two small shops, one large restaurant and guesthouse and one
automotive parts shop. Some of the existing buildings along the roadside are located
within 2 meters from the road.
Prior to the storm surge in November there were three good beaches along the road,
Fontenoy and Lower and upper Grand Mal (Fig. 1). Both Grand Mal and Fontenoy were
the best and most popular beaches on the western side of the island from St. George's. At
Fontenoy, approximately 20% of the beach was washed away by hurricane, exposing the
previously covered rocks and stones. The remaining beach is now approximately 400
meters long and an average width of 12 meters. Grand Mal has been completely
destroyed by the storm surge.
According to local residents, the beach profile has been slightly altered. There is a build-
up of sand close to the wall and some areas along the beach close to the high water mark
are now higher than before. There are also some moderate changes in the near shore
seabed level in some areas. However, the situation has been gradually retuming to
normnal.
8



Sea defense walls protected the road along both beaches. The wall at Grand Mal and part
of the roadway were destroyed by the storm surge. The southem end of the wall at
Fontenoy beach and that portion of roadway were also destroyed. The remaining portion
of the wall shows signs of weakness in some areas. Lower Grand Mal Beach has no sea
defense.  According to local residents, it was slightly affected by the storm  but
replenished itself within a few weeks.

The topography of the area can be described as flat and gently sloping in some areas and
becoming steeper towards the southern end. From Queen's Park end of the project the
road is flat up to the end of the existing sea defense wall, an average height of 2.5 meters
above sea level. It then rises to a height of 12 meters at the beginning of Fontenoy and
sloping to a height of 3.5 meters over a distance of 75 meters. From the foot of the hill to
a distance of approximately 620 meters, that stretch of land is also flat, an average height
of 2.5 meters above sea level. From there on it rises gently to a height of 7.5 meters, then
dropping to another stretch of flat lands, an elevation of 2.5 meters, up to the end of this
component of the project.
Lower Grand Mal Beach is much smaller, approximately 80 meters long and an
average width of 12 meters. The beach is frequently used by the community for bathing
and mooring of their fishing boats.
The soils in the area are classified in the Grenada Soil Map as. "Perseverance Clay". It is
a stDnj and bouldery type of soil, shallow and moderately drained. However, the soils
along the beach are more of a sandy and stony nature.
Grenada has not experienced a serious hurricane since Janet in 1955. However, the
island usually suffers from the effects of rough seas and storm surges each year. The
period of high frequency is from November to March. This is due to the development of
low-pressure systems in the region. The usual duration of storm surges or rough seas
during that period is three to four days. (34 days). The average wave height is between
6 to 9 feet and 12 to IS feet.
Wind normally flows from East to West at an average velocity of 10 - 20 miles per hour.
The air quality can be described as good. Being directly on the coast, both sites
experience a cooling sea breeze. There is no evidence of excessive smoke, dust or any
other forms of air pollution. Small pockets of dust usually occur in both sites during
heavy traffic as a result of the damages to the road caused by Hurricane Lennie.

There is no evidence of solid waste disposal in the area. In the past the St. John's River
was known to have been the source of water pollution in the area close to the mouth of
the river. Nevertheless, that problem was not considered to be serious.
There are no important fauna and flora or endangered species in the area that are likely to
be affected by the proposed works. The two existing beaches, Fontenoy and Lower
Grand Mal, are the only such physical resources left in the area that are of great
importance to the community and are likely to be affected by the proposed works. They
are among the best beaches on this side of the island.
There are also no important marine resources in the area that arelikely to be affected by
the development. The seabed is basically sandy. The closest coral reef-ecosystem to the
area is at Molineire Point, approximately 2K1 North of Grand Mal. The fishes that are
usually found in the area are coastal pelagic species, mainly Round Scad, Balyhoo,
Covaly and Rainbow Runner. They are rnigratory species.
4.1.2 Socio-Cultural Environment
The Fontenoy-Grand Mal area involves a total population of 1,270 persons. The lands in
that location can be considered to be medium to high density, individual housing plots.
Most of the newly constructed buildings have received planning permission from the
Land Development Control Authority.
Unlike Carriacou, for its Big Drum Dance and African type customs, or cultural festivals
endemic to other villages like River Sallee in the parish of St. Patrick's, the cultural
properties of the study area is somewhat intertwined with that of the nation's.
Nevertheless, the area can be characterized by its fishing and sporting activities, football
and cricket.
12



For many years now, Fontenoy and Grand Mal have been producing some of the best
sporting personalities in Grenada. The area is also one of the largest fishing villages on
the island. Fishing is one of the major sources of employment for the community.
In fact, the coastal areas play an extremely important role in the lives of the local
citizens. The greater part of their lives is being spent either on the beach or in the sea.
Recreational facilities are limited - there is only one small recreation ground located at
the back of the fuel storage depot - hence the use of the beach for multiple types of
recreation apart from swimrning.
Fontenoy Beach and Grand Mal Beach have been catering for the above-mentioned needs
of the local communities for centuries. However, those resources have been eroding
rapidly in the areas where sand mining activities were undertaken. Grand Mal beach was
most seriously affected. Fortunately, sand mining is no longer permitted in those areas.
4.2 Grand Rov
4.2.1 Physical Environment
The Grand Roy-Palniste component of the project is located in the parish of St. John
(Fig. 1). It includes that portion of the Westem Main Road from Grand Roy Bridge to
Palmiste. Approximately 600/o of that road is located directly along the seacoast and is
protected only by a sea defense wall. The Southem end of the wall and the road was
destroyed by the storm surge. The Northern portion of the road and coastal area were
also destroyed.

PALMISTE
Badly damaged areas



The land use in this portion of the project is predominantly scrub forest. There are two
buildings in the area: a shop at Grand Roy near to the bridge and one dwelling house at
Dothan Bay. Both buildings are located very close to the road. The small beach located
at the upper end of Dothan Bay is used for bathing and seine fishing. There is also a
small river towards the upper end of the bay. (See Fig.l).
The topography of the area is predominantly flat to gently sloping for the greater part and
steeper towards the southern end. The elevation at the Grand Roy end of the road is 2.5m
above sea level and rising towardran elevation of 14 Feet at the top of the hill, then falling
to an elevation of 2.8m along the coast up to the end of Dothan Bay and rising gently for
the rest of the way.
The soils within the study area are classified as Woburn Clay Loam. This is a stony and
bouldery, very shallow, moderately to poorly drained soil. According to a study done by
Dessau in mid last year, the geological characteristics of the soil close to the river is made
up of clay and silt, red to gray in colour, with 10% of gravel, cobbles and boulders on the
upper stream side and marine brown sand on the seaward side of the bridge. There is also
no important or endangered species in the river. The water flow at that time was
recorded at 1.6m/s.
The area is usually affected by rough seas or storm surges each year. Like the rest of the
island, the period of high frequency is from November to March, due to the development
of low-pressure systems in the region. The usual duration is 3 to 4 days. The average
height of waves is recorded at 6 to 9 andl2 to 15.feet.
The wind usually flows from East to West at an average speed of 10 to 20 miles per hour.
The air quality is generally good. There is no evidence of air pollution except for small
pockets of dust generated by vehicles during heavy traffic. This is as a result of damages
done to the road by the hurricane. Even so, the dust does not usually spread beyond a
100 ft. radius.
15



The average yearly rainfall for the area recorded over the past nine years: 1990-1998 -
was 99.01 inches. The average mean monthly rainfall for the same period was 7.67
inches. During the period 1990-1992 the average rainfall rose from 89.85 to 99.34
inches, a difference of 9.49 inches. The mean monthly also rose from 7.49 to 8.28, a
difference of .79 inches. Thereafter, it declined to 66.79 in 1995 before leaping to 100.74
the next year, 1996, then dropping again to 95.85 inches followed by another leap to
104.17 inches, the highest for that period.

At the time of survey, no evidence of solid waste disposal or water pollution was
observed within the study area. There is also no record of important flora and fauna or
endangered species that are likely to be affected by the proposed development. The
beach at Dothan Bay is important as a seine fishing location.
Like the other parts of the project previously discussed, the closest important reef or
marine resource to the study area is the Molinere-Bizan marine reserve, located
approximately 3 km South of the area.
4.2.2 Cultural Environment
There is only one household, approxirnately five persons, living close to the area. It is
what is left from a former small village of 21 persons. The fishermen mainly come from
Grand Roy. There is no particular cultural customs or properties that is associated
specifically with the area.
5. SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
5.1. Introduction
It is obvious, from the above mentioned that investments in Grenada's road network and
to a greater extent the study areas, can create more positive than negative impacts on the
local communities and the country as a whole. Such investments must also incorporate
proper traffic and environmental controls together with land use management, in order to
minimize/eliminate possible negative impacts.
Some of the positive impacts are associated with the opening up of investment and
employment opportunities. The spin off from such can result in improvement in the
quality of life of the affected communities and ultimately the enhancement of the local
environment. For both sites, the impacts are expected to be similar, except for some
slight variations depending on site characteristics.
18



In the case of the negative impacts, they are not expected to be significant. Some
increase in noise levels, depreciation of air quality and near shore marine environment,
traffic problems and public inconveniences are expected to occur. However they can be
easily abated.
5.2 Identification and Assessment of Impacts
After a review of relevant information,five key issues were identified to be addressed:
> Beach protection and improvement
> Preservation of good seine fishing sites
> Pollution control
> Road safety
> Public awareness
Oueens Park - Grand Mal
5.2.1 Significant Positive lmDacts
The positive impacts associated with this site are that the project will:
> Provide protection for properties in low lying areas
> Improve road safety
> Contribute to the preservation of Grenada's transportation network and the
enhancement of development potentials in general.
The effects of the storm surge and recent rough seas are some exanples of the
vulnerability of the properties in the low-lying areas, particularly those closer to the sea.
Since all - (except the National Stadium, Sea View Restaurant, a small bar at Grand Mal
and two small shops at Fontenoy) - are residential buildings. The necessity for disaster
19



relief, shelter and other related issues are greater, likewise the discomfort and stress to the
local communities during similar weather conditions in the future.
Through implementation of the project, public safety would be reassured and
development potential should continue to improve.
The National Stadium located approximately 50m away from the seacoast, faces similar
threat of destruction, should a hurricane occur before the completion of the project.
The worsening dust and hazardous conditions of the road since the storm surge will be
eliminated by the road improvement. Road safety will be enhanced by this activity
together with the construction of the sidewalk. The ability to move goods and services
(including petrol) around the country will also be enhanced,
5.2.3 Nemative Impacts
As mentioned earlier, no significant negative environmental impacts are predicted for this
site. The impacts that are predicted are expected to be minimal and can be abated
without much difficulty. They are:
- Air and noise pollution
> Beach and coastal pollution
> Traffic obstruction
> Changes in coastal currents
The extent of the above is expected to vary between different stages of the project - site
preparation, construction, and site clearance/restoration.
20



Site Preparation
Limited loss of vegetation and topsoil is likely to occur. The transportation and storage
of materials and equipment is also expected to create similar pollution problems and also
traffic obstruction.  Dust and carbon monoxide from trucks during transportation and
storage' of materials, can be harmful to the environment and become a public nuisance
depending upon the location and volume.
The existing narrow roads and limited space makes it extremely difficult to avoid traffic
obstructions, particularly during the busy hours of the day - 7:30am to 9:30am and
4:00pm to 6:00pm, Monday to Friday and on Saturday, 7:30am to 9:30am. Similar
problems can occur along the route, from the collection to the storage site.
Construction
The use of machinery and equipment during construction is expected to create similar
pollution and traffic obstruction problems as the above. The physical conditions are the
same. However, the problem would be greater within the areas of operation mainly
because the volume of activities will be more intense. The lack of an alternative road for
diverting traffic makes the situation more complicated.
Excavated staff together with oil and grease escaped from machinery in operation can
eventually end up on the beach and into the sea. The proposed activities may alter the
beach profile in some areas and also require limitations to the use of the beach during
construction. Because the bulk of the works will be carried out along the beach and in the
sea (during the erection and construction of the sea defense walls and rock armor) much
of the suspended materials are expected to be sandy, as such siltation should not be a
serious problem. Roadside litter may create congestion, harbor rodents and it can become
a public health hazard.
21



Site Clearance/Restoration
No negative environmental impacts are predicted for the activities to be undertaken at
this stage, except for minor traffic obstructions, air and noise pollution, limited only the
affected locations.
Residual! Long-term Impacts:
The potential residual impacts are more likely to be concerned with the issues of road
safety and possible changes to the marine /coastal environment. Like is the case with road
improvements on the Grand Anse- Point Saline Airport Road in the south of the island,
the improvement of that road can bring about an increase in accidents. The areas along
the beaches will be more at risk. It is customary for motorists to drive recklessly on such
roads, particularly bus drivers. This situation can be avoided if a concerted effort is made
be all concerned, the traffic Department, motorist, pedestrian, local residence and the
general public.
Although the effects of the placement of rock armor in other parts of the western coast
are not monitored systematically there is no evidence of negative impacts. According to
the Marine Biologist of the Fisheries Department, the rock arnor seems to have been
encouraging the development of new marine ecosystems. There is an increase of various
coastal and reef species in those areas.
The indirect economic environmental and social benefits in the -long term  (though
difficult to evaluate in this study) will manifest itself in the improvement in the quality of
life in the rural communities and their enviromnent, particularly in economically
depressed areas and in the country as a whole.
22



Unavoidable lmpacts
It is not possible to implement this project without the potential negative impacts
discussed earlier. Even the best locally available machinery and equipment used in such
operations "do" and in this case "will" create some levels of air and noise pollution. This
project is located along the seacoast and also involves water-related activities; therefore
some degree of depreciation of the water quality is inevitable.
Except for accident or carelessness the impacts are not expected to be significant. The
experience gained by commuters plying this route and all concerned during previous
similar operations will be of tremendous benefit in coping with those problems.

As discussed earlier both the positive and negative impacts of the Grand Roy-Palmist site
are similar to that of Queens Park-Grand Mal. The only differences are with the existing
land use. Only two buildings and one small beach are located within the area. Like the
Queens Park-Grand Roy site there are no important flora and fauna or marine resources
in the area that are likely to be affected by the proposed works.
6. MITIGATION MEASURES
The following are some necessary actions to be taken in order to address the potential
negative environmental impacts of the proposed project. As discussed earlier, they are
not expected to be significant, and are similar for both locations. Therefore. The under-
mentioned applies to both study areas.
1. As much as possible, beach encroachment must be avoided and seine-
fishing areas must be preserved.
23



2. A public awareness program should be developed and implemented by the
Ministry of Works in collaboration with the police traffic department
before the commencement of the project. If necessary, it should be
continued throughout the life of the project.
3. Unnecessary cutting of trees and excavation must be avoided at all times.
4. Machinery and equipment used must be in good working condition to
avoid excessive discharge of carbon monoxide and noise, grease or oil
spills.
5. All waste must be properly disposed of according to standards set by
WAMAS.
6. Relevant traffic signs and controls should be appropriately placed to give
early notice to road users and to control traffic during implementation.
The type and location of the above should be determiined on site. In
addition, a traffic management plan should be developed for the use of the
area after completion of the project, in order to avoid accidents.
7. The surfaces of areas where oil or grease are to be stored and distributed
should be covered with grease-proof or non-porous materials that can
facilitate the collection of spilt grease or oil before reaching the soil.
8. Materials should be properly stored to avoid sliding into the streets or
coastal areas.
9. Driving of machinery on the beaches should be avoided as much as
possible.
24



10. Excavation works should be limited to the time of year when there is less
rainfall.
11. All temporary materials, works and equipment must be removed from the
site and affected areas restored immediately after the completion of the
project.
12. Beach replenishment, wherever feasible, must be incorporated into
proposed works.
13. Consideration should be given to the enhancement of the playing field
and beach, currently used by the local residents, located between the
community center and the fuel storage depot.
7. MONITORING PLANS
A site supervision and motoring program is expected to be developed after final work
schedules are prepared by contractors. Some of the main issues to be considered are:
* Identification of best possible locations for storing materials, grease, oil, petrol, waste
and excavated stuff.
+ Suitable means of protecting the area against oil, grease and petrol pollution.
* Selection of the best possible option for implementing the project.
* Establishment of an environmental monitoring system with inputs from relevant
agencies institutions.
8. INTER AGENCY AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The process involved discussions, and meetings with officials from the Ministries of
Finance, Works, Agriculture and Health; Physical Planning Unit, Land Development
25



Control Authority; the Engineering Consultant, local residents and public participation
meetings in both areas.
8.1 Public Consultations
Two public consultations were held one in the Grand Mal Community Center on
February 11h and the other at Grand Roy Government School on February 13ti . A wide
cross section of the community was represented. Persons present included fishermen,
women, teenagers, NGO's and community leaders.
The Environmental Consultant presented the proposals.  During the presentations
participants, were given the opportunity to comment/criticize as they saw fit and to offer
suggestions and ideas on various issues of interest to themselves and the community at
large. Thereafter the proceedings took the form of an open discussion among all present.
In both instances strong commendations were extended to the consultant, Officials of the
World Bank and the Ministry of Finance who were responsible for initiating the
participatory approach.
A summary of the key issues raised and recommendations presented are as follows:
Fontenoy - Grand Mal
There were thirty-five (35) persons present. The main issues were:
+ Protection of the beaches and seine fishing sites
* Pollution control
+ Road safety
Participants expressed their recognition of the urgent need to protect the coastal areas,
particularly those locations where there are houses and major public investments such as
26



the National Stadium. Some even attempted to relive the terrifying experience of the
residents near to the coast, in order to emphasize the urgency of the matter.
The issue of comprormise was well explored when considering the idea of rock armour
along the coast opposite to the National Stadium. The rock armour is likely to occupy a
seine fishing spot.
Although that beach is not very good, this revelation stirred a lively and interesting
debate between fishermen and some of the participants. Finally, it was suggested and
accepted that the fishermen can use an alternative method locally call "ringing". It is used
in areas where it is not possible to pull their nets ashore.
Again, in the spirit of compromise, participants strongly suggested that consideration
should be given to the improvement of the small recreation area and the nearby beach at
the back of the fuel storage depot. This, it was suggested, will help compensate for the
loss of the Grand Mal Beach.
Finally, participants re-emphasized their strong opinions about the protection of the
remaining beaches and the urgent need to protect the area from potential disaster.
Grand Roy - Palmist
Thirty-two persons participated in that consultation meeting. The main issues were:
* Public safety on that roadway
+ Protection of the seine fishing beach
The same procedures as the above were followed for that meeting. The participation was
also quite interesting and lively. Participants felt that it was too expensive to build sea
defences. They also were not certain that sea defences will be able to solve the problem
given the current sea level rise. As a result it was suggested that the road should be
reconstructed further inland.
27



Those suggestions were discussed at length, together with the physical constraint with the
topography and neighboring high-density housing area of Grand Roy.
Finally, the proposal was accepted on condition that the seine-fishing beach should not be
touched. Also, the idea of road relocation should be considered in the long term.
All agreed that the road and sea defence works must be undertaken very soon, as a matter
of priority.
