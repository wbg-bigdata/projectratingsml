leverage their own competitive advantages and particular
expertise. The key is determining what each partner can
bring to the table. The objective is the best possible way to
make the most of the PNPM program.

As a result, the interaction among donors involved in a
PNPM program is very high — much higher than is usual
for multi–donor trust funds. Donors do not just make a
contribution and then leave the implementation to a single
implementing agency. Donors remain engaged, and their
input is constantly sought. The level of excitement amongst
donors towards the PNPM program is unique. This makes the
PSF quite special.

The success of the PSF has not gone unnoticed. In recent
years, PNPM has served as a model for the development of
similar community–driven development programs, such as
in Afghanistan. The PSF plays a direct role in this. knowledge
sharing continues to expand between the PSF and parties
interested in emulating the success of PNPM. None of this
success could have been achieved without the support of
all our development partners, and the strong leadership and
commitment of the Indonesian Government. we cannot
overstate the vital role of the Ministry of home Affairs, the
Coordinating Ministry for People’s welfare, and BAPPENAS
in leading the PNPM program. we must continue our
support for their vision of inclusive, community–based social
development throughout Indonesia.

north sumatra, Jambi, Bengkulu, Bangka Belitung, west nusa

and west sulawesi.

Building on the existing PNPM–Rural platform, the program
aims to accelerate social and economic infrastructure
development by improving access of the poor to the
following: transportation facilities; water supply and
sanitation facilities; irrigation facilities; market facilities;
health facilities and education facilities; and by introducing
micro–credit services on a pilot basis. The project in
this way contributes to: rural poverty alleviation efforts,
the autonomous development of regional economies,
the increasingly self–reliant capacity building of local
communities, and strengthening the administrative capacity
of local governments.

RISE is financed through a International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) loan in the amount JPY 23.5 billion or uS$ 252.2 million.

The project has provided community grants for 2,355 villages
disbursing more than uS$ 42 million over 9,485 packages.
In 2011, these community grants directly benefited

 objectives.

pillar of Indonesia’s democracy and not just a cheap way to

Asking me to assess my own and the Bank’s role in this
theater is a little unfair! In one sense it’s been a great
adventure for all of us. I love knowing that all of the pain,
heartache, and stress in the end still mean that villages
in Maluku can for the first time make open, transparent,
harmonious decisions about what development should mean
for them — and then get the resources and freedom to do
it. And I love watching so many young, idealistic Indonesians
take part in the program and visibly blossom at the chance
to help people make development something substantive
and real. Overall I think that PSF has played and continues to
play a useful role as an important technical support unit for
the Government but also, when it works, PSF is a place where
new ideas can be discussed, tested, and used. So no regrets,
and ongoing optimism on the future of PSF.

At the same time, I’m not going to gloss over the problems.
The world Bank’s been as unprepared as anyone else to cope
with the scale–up of a national program. Some problems
have been just been part of the process. But others could
and should have been avoided, such as the large gaps in
senior staffing and effective management decision–making
that happened just when a steady hand was most needed.

   sustainable and reliable health care utilized by all
   poor households.
2. Then, scale up to protect all vulnerable from health
   risks, promote continuous education and protect
   them from shocks that threaten their welfare: Expand
   Jamkesmas and BSM to reach all vulnerable households,
   and introduce a pilot early childhood education program.
   Scale up Pkh to reach all chronically poor households
   and the collection of programs that target marginalized
   populations. Right–size Raskin to cover only poor
   households. Fill existing gaps in the social safety net
   by adding a coordinated emergency response system,
   featuring a revised version of BlT that includes conditions
   for community service. Such expansion to all vulnerable
   households is estimated to require an increase in social
   safety net spending levels to 1.4% of GDP; and
3. Integrate the social safety net by consolidating
   program support operations under a single roof
   and encouraging single window household access
   to all services: Consolidate support operations (e.g.,
   socialization, complaints handling and M&E) under one
   roof and develop a single NTS. Create a reliable public
   face for the social safety net under a single agency with
   employees that perform outreach and socialization
   activities and can encourage and facilitate access to all
   initiatives available in the social safety net and beyond.
