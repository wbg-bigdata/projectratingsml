PANAMA
THIRD AGRICULTURAL LIVESTOCK PROJECT
I. The Agricultural Sector
A. Agriculture in the Economy
1.01      During the past two decades, the Panamanian economy has undergone
profound structural change. Agriculture has declined from producing 23% of
GDP in 1960 to only 10% in 1982. In its place, the services' sector has
grown to contribute 60% of GDP from financial, commercial and transport
activities. One result of this shift in growth has been that those remaining
in agriculture are generally disadvantaged in terms of incomes and employment
opportunities.
1.02      The 1980 National Census estimated that of Panama's 1.8 million
inhabitants, about 800,000 live in the rural sector. Because of the scarcity
of new jobs in agriculture, migration to the cities has been rapid, resulting
in a 4.4% population growth rate in urban areas and one of only 2.2% in the
countryside. Nevertheless, the rural population increases are of concern,
given that the value of sectoral output at constant prices has been declining
over the medium term. Although long-run real growth in the sector had been
satisfactory at some 3% annually, a turn-around occurred in the
mid-1970s. Since 1977, real output of the sector has declined by an average
0.5% per year. In addition, Panama has shared in the global problem of
deterioration in terms of trade for farm commodities.  Despite the
relative decline in agriculture's contribution to total GDP, the performance
of the sector remains crucial to Panama, as it still employs 27% of the
workforce and generates 55% of commodity exports worth some US$160 million
annually.
1.03      The income level in Panama is among the highest in Latin America
being forecast at about US$2,000 per capita for 1983. Metropolitan per
capita income is estimated at some US$2,500 whereas rural median per capita
incomes are about US$700.
B. Land Tenure
1.04      The major determinants of rural poverty are the relatively high
frequency of very small farms combined with low levels of productivity and
output. The agricultural census of 1981 estimated that, of Panama's 153,000
farms, some 116,000 were of less than 5 ha. Some 72% of farms, covering 44%
of the land in farming, is worked without legal title. Land titling has been
made difficult because of the informal settlement on unused land. According
to Government studies, about one-quarter of the arable land and one-half of
the land suitable for grazing are currently being used. Although it is not
clear why this situation persists along with the "minifundia" poverty
problem, the lack of infrastructure in most of the eastern half of the
country and in the Atlantic areas of the west may be a major contributing
factor.



- 2 -
C. Land Use
1.05      Of the land under permanent cultivation, some 565,000 ha are used
for major crops. Food crops for local consumption are grown on about 422,000
ha, with the balance planted to cash crops mainly for export or processing.
The principal food crops are rice, maize and beans. The most common cash
crops are bananas, sugarcane, coffee and vegetables. Yields are universally
low, generally about one-half of what could be expected. For instance,
sugarcane yields only 40 tons of cane per ha, maize less than 1 ton per ha
and rainfed paddy about 1.6 tons per ha. These yields indicate that
considerable margin exists for potential productivity gains. A similar
situation exists in the livestock subsector where lack of land pressure has
given rise to land-extensive pastoral systems.
D. Government Strategy
1.06      Public policy has sought to improve small farmer productivity and
living standards through land settlement, concessional credit programs and
technical assistance. Farm product prices are controlled for major basic
commodities, as are marketing margins and retail prices. Minimum product
prices are guaranteed through Government intervention buying and storing.
Imports and exports are controlled as well as private trade in food items.
The Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy (MIPPE) makes final decisions on
consumer prices and thereby those for producers. Government's intervention
has had a less than favorable effect on the livestock sector principally
through its policy of restricting beef exports.
E. Principal Sector Institutions
1.07      The most important institution in the sector is the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock Development (MIDA). While the Ministry of Planning
and Economic Policy coordinates overall strategy, MIDA is responsible for the
formulation and evaluation of programs and projects in the sector. Its
responsibilities also cover preservation of natural resources as well as the
provision of technical assistance and extension services principally focusing
on land reform beneficiaries and other small-scale farmers. MIDA's
effectiveness has been hampered by its weak organizational structure. MIDA's
technical assistance has mainly been for crop production and the advancement
of the collective communities set up on the Atlantic watershed. The
principal institutions involved in agricultural lending are the Agricultural
Development Bank (BDA) and the National Bank of Panama (BNP).
F. Agricultural Lending
1.08      In July 1980, the Government instituted a preferential interest
rate system (PIR) for agriculture by creating a Special Interest Compensation
Fund, a fund derived from a surcharge of not more than 1% on personal and
commercial loans. The National Banking Commission (NBC) administers this
system which currently enables the interest rate for agriculture to be three
percentage points less than for other lending through the banking system.
The banking system's agricultural portfolio has increased from US$144.9
million in 1979 to US$162.2 and US$205.6 million in 1980 and 1981,



- 3 -
respectively, representing an average annual growth of 19%. At the end of
the first quarter of 1982, the agricultural portfolio reached US$211.5
million.
Agricultural Development Bank (BDA)
1.09      BDA is a semi-autonomous institution operating within MIDA's
institutional framework, with the Minister of Agriculture as Chairman of the
Board of Directors. Although it is a bank, it is not formally part of the
banking system. BDA's main programs consist of providing credit for
small-scale farmers and to others including livestock operations at interest
rates in the vicinity of 9%. At year-end 1981, BDA had a loan portfolio of
US$84.5 million which made up 41% of the total agricultural portfolio in
Panama. In 1981, it sustained an operating loss of US$2.6 million on
revenues of US$8.3 million. Operating losses for the five years prior to
1981 have averaged US$1.7 million per year. BDA's principal problems relate
to: (a) high administrative costs; (b) low yield on outstanding portfolio;
and (c) high costs of borrowing. BDA has been a recipient of concessional
IDB and USAID loans. BDA operates through its headquarters in Panama City,
eight regional offices and 28 branch offices throughout the country. BDA's
has a staff of about 700, of whom 230 are agricultural technicians.
National Bank of Panama (BNP)
1.10      BNP's organization consists of 10 departments whose principal
activities (Chart 1) are to provide credit for agriculture, industry and
commerce, as well as to function as the official financial entity of the
Government. The Technical Unit (TU) (Chart 2), which operates under BNP's
Agricultural Development Department, has been responsible for the two
previous projects financed by the Bank (Loan 901-PAN and 1397-PAN), and would
be in charge of the proposed project execution. BNP's organization consists
of a Board of Directors; a General Manager and his deputy, who are the chief
executive officers; and 10 department managers, who are responsible for BNP's
operations. Top management is supported by staff advisors for functions such
as legal and economic affairs. BNP has 47 branches coordinated by the Panama
City Main Office and three regional offices. Its staff of 2,300 represents
about 30% of the total banking system. BNP's past financial statements and
forecasts are in Tables 1 to 4. BNP's loan portfolio at the end of the first
quarter of 1982 totalled US$439 million, of which US$71 million was
agricultural loans. At the end of the same period, the banking system's
total agricultural portfolio was US$211 million, with BNP's participation
being 33%. BNP's loan portfolio is funded mainly from local savings and from
foreign borrowings, much of it at LIBOR terms. In the last five years, BNP
has experienced excellent real growth in its portfolio, savings and generated
surpluses.
Commercial Banks
1.11      Panama has a large number of banks (82 are associated with BNP's
clearing house); however, most of the sector's financial requirements are
provided by BNP and BDA which collectively account for 74% of the total



US$211 million agricultural credit portfolio. The rest of the credit ('mostly
short term) is provided by private banks and other public organizations such
as the National Financial Corporation (COFINA). The banks that provide most
of the private agricultural lending are the Bank of America, the Chase
Manhattan Bank, the Bank of Bogota, the Bank of Colombia, and the Trusi: Bank.
II. THE LIVESTOCK SUBSECTOR
A. BACKGROUND
General
2.01      Although available statistics have limitations, it is clear t:hat
the livestock subsector has shown a trend of slow growth, like the crop
subsector. Within the livestock subsector, milk, poultry and pork production
kept up with population growth of some 3% annually during the 1970s, but beef
production increased by less than 2% per year. Beef production estimat:es are
for output from registered slaughterhouses, but clandestine slaughter may be
considerable, introducing significant error in livestock inventory and growth
estimates. Nevertheless, a generally consistent view of a rather stagnant
industry emerges, with sporadic short-term improvement resulting from good
seasons and fortuitous market improvements. In 1981, cattle numbers were
estimated at about 1,345 thousand as seen in Table 5. This number is not
significantly different from the 1,347 thousand estimate used for the 1.975
inventory in the appraisal of the Second Livestock Development Project.
2.02      The main livestock producing areas are located on the Pacific
watershed, west of the canal. The regional distribution of cattle over the
1.3 million ha, representing 37% of the long-term potential grazing lands
(3.5 million ha), is shown in the following Table. The Central Provinces are
the most important in terms of cattle numbers and numbers of farms, with the
highest productivity on the better land around Chiriqui near the Costa Rican
border. The lowest productivity is in the eastern part of Panama, including
the Darien Province which has poor soils and almost no infrastructure.

- 5 -
2.03      Stocking rates are low; a typical farm has 40 ha with a herd of
about 40 adult animals. On the basis of an offtake rate of little better
than 10% to give annual sales of four adults plus some 20 calves per year, a
net profit of US$600 on total saleskof US$1,000 could be about the best that
could be expected from beef production. Within these averages is a wide
variance of returns, depending on farm sizes, productivity levels, seasonal
variability, management, and the extra income available to those able to
diversify into milk production.
Soil, Climate and Pastures
2.04      The dominant topographic feature of the country is the long
mountain chain extending along the center from the Costa Rican border to near
the canal where it becomes broken, and then continues into the eastern
regions, finally ending in Darien province at the Colombian border (Map IBRD
16929). Mountain peaks higher than 2,000 m are located in the western
provinces. Elevation strongly influences rainfall incidence throughout the
country, with a variation from some 1,000 mm annually in the lower parts of
the Azuero peninsula to over 5,000 mm around the mountain peaks in the
northern part of Chiriqui province and a substantially higher rainfall along
the Atlantic slopes than on the Pacific side. Rainfall is seasonally
distributed, with a dry season of two to five months between December and
May.
2.05      Soils are leached and low in major nutrients, organic matter and
trace elements. The predominant pasture species are Faragua grass
(Hyparrhenia rufa) on cleared land of low fertility and Guinea grass (Panicum
maximum), Kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum), and Para grass (Brachiaria
mutica) on improved land. Tropical legumes are infrequent in native grass
stands because of the low soil fertility. Introduced legume species such as
Kudzu (Pueraria phaseoloides), Stylo (Stylosanthes guyanensis) and Centro
(Centrosema pubescens) thrive under proper management, but their use is not
widespread.
Infrastructure
2.06      The main trunk road is the Pan American Highway, which follows the
southern side of the Cordillera for most of its length. The major cattle
producing areas are connected by an all-weather road system, giving a total
of 8,600 km of road for the country's total area of 77,082 kmZ. However,
many areas of the country, particularly to the north of the mountains, are
isolated from the highway and must be served by coastal freighters from
Colon.
Processing
2.07      Beef is processed at: (a) three modern packing plants, each with
installed capacity of 1,000 head per day and approved for export trade; (b)
nine slaughtering plants, each with 50 head per day capacity for regional
domestic markets; and (c) about 300 slaughtering centers for local village
trade. The village facilities are rustic and each processes about 10 head
per day. The main problem with the export grade plants is the inadequate
facilities for proper deboning, by-product processing and storage.



2.08      Over 70% of Panama's milk is produced in two areas:  Chiriqui at
the western extreme of the country and Azuero in the southwest. Most of the
milk must be transported to Panama City for processing where 80% is
consumed. Average one-way hauling distances are over 300 km, resulting in a
relatively high transport cost of about 3 US cents per liter, accounting for
10% of the cost of raw milk delivered to the plants. Almost 90% of
processing is done by three firms. The existing facilities are considered
quite adequate and operate at only 63% of installed capacity.
B. Livestock Production Systems
2.09      Of the 33,200 cattle properties in Panama, 85% are used for
breeding and/or fattening (following table). In recent years, dual-purpose
beef-milk enterprises have become increasingly common, having the advantage
of reducing beef price cycle problems (by retaining cull cows during low
price periods) and ensuring a regular cash flow from milk sales. These farms
now number almost 15% of the total. Only 63 specialized dairies are in
operation.
Cattle Enterprises, 1982
No.              %
Breeding and fattening                   28,230           85.0
Dual purpose                              4,907           14.8

Total                                 33,200          100.0
2.10      Hilly, remote and otherwise low productivity areas are reserved
mainly for breeding. The unfinished cattle are then transferred to
specialized fattening areas such as the Pacific coastal plains of Tonosi,
Sona, and Chiriqui with well watered pastures throughout the year. Mixed
breeding and fattening operations are the predominant systems in the central
provinces. Fifty-five of the 63 specialized dairies are located in the
fertile valleys of Chiriqui. Five of the specialized diaries are state-owned
and are maintained for demonstration purposes. The highest concentration of
dual-purpose operations is in the Central provinces (63%) with another large
group in Chiriqui (31%).
2.11      Although disease is an important limitation on herd performance,
poor husbandry is the dominant factor causing the generally poor condition of
much of the herd. Husbandry problems include low levels of nutrition,
haphazard parasite control and poor herd selection. Production losses occur
from brucellosis, tick-borne organisms and internal parasites in young
animals. The country is free of foot-and-mouth disease and its entry is
blocked by the undeveloped Darien buffer zone with Colombia. General
veterinary services and supply of medicines are adequate.
C. Beef Marketing
2.12      Two basic markets exist for Panamanian beef:  the local market
which historically consumes approximately 90% of the annual herd offtake of



- 7 -
220,000 head; and the export market (principally to the USA as boneless beef)
which absorbs the balance after local demand has been satisfied (Table 6).
Prices (currently US$.40/kilo liveweight) received by ranchers have generally
kept pace with inflation (Table 7). The main problem is the Government's
imposition of short-term export restrictions has led to stagnation of the
beef industry by not allowing ranchers to plan for herd expansion. This is
further discussed in Chapter V under marketing.
D. Milk Marketing
2.13      Fresh milk output has grown by a satisfactory 2.5% annual rate
during the 1970s (Table 8). In 1981, total fresh milk production reached 91
million liters up from 72 million liters in 1971. All fresh milk is consumed
in Panama and in 1981, the equivalent of approximately 37 million liters of
milk in powdered milk ingredients was imported to meet demand. In late 1982,
the producer prices for the three grades on the basis of 12% total solids
were as follows:
Grade A     B/. 0.37 per liter
Grade B     B/. 0.27 per liter
Industrial B/. 0.23 per liter
Approximately 90% of fresh milk is purchased as Industrial grade.
The use of Grade B, the intermediate grade, is not enforced and no milk is
presently bought as Grade B. The unit price received for Industrial milk has
not kept pace with inflation during the 1970s as seen from Table 8. The lack
of enforcement for the payment for Grade B milk to qualifying farms prevents
further significant fresh milk expansion. Other considerations of milk
marketing are discussed in Chapter V.
E. Bank Participation in the Subsector
2.14      Bank lending to the agricultural sector of Panama has totalled
US$41.6 million, starting with Loan 86-PAN (1953) for US$1.2 million for farm
machinery. This was followed by Loan 87-PAN of US$0.3 million for grain
silos, Loan 784-PAN for US$3.4 million for fisheries development, Loan
901-PAN for US$4.7 million for livestock development, Loan 1397-PAN for
US$8.0 million for a second livestock project, Loan 1398-PAN of US$5.0
million for the follow-on fisheries development, and Loan 1672-PAN (1979) of
US$19.0 million for a tropical tree crop project. In general, when the
project has been executed exclusively by BNP, results have been very
favorable. Projects involving major participation from MIDA have generally
experienced management problems.
First Livestock Development Project
2.15      Loan 901-PAN for US$4.7 million became effective in November 1973
and provided for the organization of the existing TU within BNP. After some
initial delays in securing qualified personnel for the TU, the project
financed a total of 340 subloans with an average subloan size of US$25,500.
The loan took seven years to disburse and was closed in March 1981, two years
later than originally planned.



- 8 -
2.16      The Project Performance Au-dit Report (PPAR) (Report No. 3727) for
Loan 901-PAN estimated an overall economic rate of return of 8% versus the
15% used at appraisal.  Incremental milk production was 7.2 million liters
per year which was within 3% of appraisal estimates. Beef production on the
other hand reached only 15% of the volume expected. These achievements are
partially explained by the shifting of relative prices for beef and milk
which favored milk production at the expense of beef, but also by lower than
expected calving and stocking rates on beef ranches and by higher milk
production per cow. Another reason for the reduced economic rate of return
was the decline in real prices for beef and milk experienced during
implementation.
Second Livestock Development Project
2.17      Loan 1397-PAN for US$8.0 million became effective in February 1978
and at year-end 1982 was approximately 70% disbursed, with full commitment
and disbursement planned respectively for November 1983 and June 1984. Bank
funds for this project are channelled through the TU to 350 livestock farms
with a total portfolio to date of US$14.7 million and an average subloan size
of US$42,000. Much of the increase in the subloan size of Loan 1397-PAN as
compared to 901-PAN is due to inflation. The medium size farm at year-end
1982 was 125 ha. The second project refined subloan evaluation techniques,
and strengthened the existing TU by adding field supervision and contracting
consultant specialists to train staff. Subloan recovery experience under
the livestock projects has been excellent: only 4% of portfolio of the First
Livestock Project is in arrears while less than 1% of the Second Project's
portfolio is delinquent. Loan 1397-PAN called for the implementation of Law
60, which included a uniform milk pricing system, which has not yet been
fully carried out; lacking is the provision which calls for payment by
processors for Grade B milk. The Government has now agreed to implement the
Grade B milk provision. Monitoring and evaluation established for the
project indicates that production goals established at appraisal are
generally being met or exceeded. The TU is staffed with qualified
professionals and has competent management.
III. THE PROJECT
A.  Introduction
3.01      The Government of Panama has requested a Bank loan to help finance
the Third Livestock Project. The proposed project would finance some 260
dual-purpose (milk and beef) operations and some 160 beef production
operations.  -he project would reduce Panama's balance of trade deficit
through increased beef exports and the substitution of local milk for
imported dried milk. It would also bring about the implementation of
improved milk standards which would lead to the wider use of higher quality
milk with a longer shelf life.
3.02      The project was originally prepared by the BNP TU, with assistance
from FAO/Bank-CP  which produced a preparation report in March 1982.  Two
subsequent Bank missions (April 1982 and August 1982) completed the
preparation work and the project was appraised in December 1982.



B. Brief Description
3.03      The principal objectives of the proposed project would be to
increase the production of milk under improved sanitary conditions on some
260 dual-purpose dairy farms and augment the output of some 160 beef
production farms. Production of milk would be increased by 16 million liters
annually. The incremental beef production provided by the project, amounting
to over 2,000 tons of dressed beef annually, could be exported to readily
available foreign markets.
3.04      Overall straLegies to reacdI  these objectives would be to:
(a)  provide supervised credit for:
(i) long-term investments to include: milking facilities,
fencing, livestock, water systems and pasture improvements
on dual-purpose (milk and beef) and beef production farms;
(ii) complementary short-term purchases of cattle for fattening
in conjunction with long-term livestock investments; and
(iii) annual crop production, when incorporated into a
complementary long-term livestock investment program;
(b)  continue the technical assistance of the existing successful TU
within BNP;
(c)  provide seminars, programs and short-term specialists to train the
TU staff in improved livestock management techniques;
(d)  provide for the purchase of vehicles and equipment for the TU;
(e)  implement existing legislation providing for the introduction of an
intermediate milk grade; and
(f)  bring about the removal of Government restrictions on meat exports.
3.05      The project would be carried out over a five year period and
initially would be located in the seven provinces now served by the Second
Livestock Project, but could be expanded to include all nine of Panama's
provinces.
C. Detailed Features
Overall Investment Criteria
3.06      Credit would be extended through the project over the five-year
development period to approximately 420 sub-borrowers to implement farm
investment plans. Supervised credit would be the key project component. The
project would finance technically and financially sound farm investment plans
prepared by the TU field staff in close cooperation with eligible project
beneficiaries. The technologies and farming systems would be basically those
now being successfully employed by the TU in the ongoing Second Livestock



- 10 -
Project which emphasize forage conservation or dry season forage production
and improved animal health. Two representative investment models are
presented to analyze the technical and financial feasibility of the on-farm
investments; these are: a dual-purpose (milk and beef production) operation
on 80 ha and a beef cattle production operation on 160 ha. These operations
are considered representative of the most common and economic cattle
production systems in Panama. Recipients of subloans would most likely be
owners of farms needing major capital expenditures, having been decapitalized
by high animal mortality rates and the need to sell off livestock to meet
current expenditures. The models should be taken only as illustrations and
credit would not be in any way restricted to operations described.
Farm Pasture, Forest and Cropland Investment Criteria
3.07      The pattern of investment to be promoted would be to make better
use of the natural resources of existing farms in order to transform them
into self-sustaining systems of forest, pasture and crops. Emphasis would be
given to: financing combinations of crops on the sites most suitable for
cultivation; establishing and improving pastures and intensive fodder crops
in areas of intermediate fertility; and encouraging forest regeneration in
erodible areas. Crops to be financed would be for sale or to be fed to farm
livestock. Conservation activities such as contour plowing and the
construction of small check dams and farm ponds would be included in the
investment plans. Farm investment plans could include: reforestation of
eroded areas; the replanting of existing forest areas; the use of live trees
as fence posts; and costs of land surveying to allow for processing of a
title for the farm.
Farm Level Animal Health and Productivity Programs
3.08      Experience in the Second Project has shown that the most critical
physiological factor affecting cattle health and production in Panama is the
lack of adequate nutrition throughout the year. Most of the pasture land in
Panama experiences dry periods of from two to five months each per year which
restricts forage growth. Therefore, in dual-purpose operations, where
uniform flows of milk output are desired and in cattle raising and fattening
operations where sustained weight gains are needed, a sound (both
physiologically and economically) dry season feeding program should become
the first technological priority in managing these farms. Investment plans
would include the establishment of high protein and energy forage which would
be fed during the dry season.
3.09      Control of internal and external parasites is another major area of
concern which would be incorporated into farm investment plans by the
provision of equipment, veterinary supplies and technical assistance, along
with regionally determined cattle vaccination programs. A control of
colmoyate (Dermatobia hominis), oxwarble, and vampire bats would be a
critical priority in wetter environments.  Bruccellosis, tuberculosis and
rabies, as well as predators, would be controlled. A watch for vesicular
diseases, namely stomatitis and the possibility of foot-and-mouth disease,
would be maintained by TU veterinarians because of the location of Panama
with nearby foot-and-mouth infected countries.



- 11 -
3.10      One of the most serious factors affecting cattle productivity in
Panama is the generally low level of herd reproductive rates (about 50% in
beef breeding and 60% in dual purpose). The low rates are due to: poor herd
management; nutritional problems; and low calf survival. As the economic
efficiency of reproduction is a complex matter involving numerous
soil-plant-animal relationships with economic factors, it cannot be regarded
as an isolated veterinary problem. Improving reproductive efficiency
requires a multi-disciplinary approach (agriculturalists, veterinarians,
animal production specialists and economists) and would be accomplished by a
comprehensive plan incorporated into each investment program.
Livestock Purchase Criteria
3.11      Cattle purchases for dual-purpose operations would be to make
rapid genetic improvements to the existing Zebu bred herds by the
introduction of more productive animals, with one-half to one-third dairy
breeds (Holstein or Brown Swiss). Purchased bulls should be seven-eighths to
pure dairy breeds. Suitable livestock would be purchased mainly from
domestic sources.
3.12      Livestock purchased for beef farms would be to introduce genetic
characteristics which would improve production potential, high calf
mortalities and low growth rates. This would be acomplished by introducing
dairy breed bulls (three-quarters to purebred) to change the existing herd
genetic composition of miscellaneous Zebu crosses.
Other Farm Investment Criteria
3.13      Farm investments for dual-purpose farms would include improvements
to qualify farms for Grade B milk certification (para 5.08). Items required
for this certification include a concrete slab in the milking area and the
provision of a pressurized water system. Beef production farms would include
investments designed to lower cattle handling costs by providing additional
fencing, loading chutes and corrals. It is estimated that about 30% of the
prospective beneficiaries would require land titling services which would be
financed out of the subloan.
Total Farm Investment Program
3.14      Based on the two investment models, which reflect the livestock
development strategy to be followed by the TU, investments are expected
generally to be distributed among the categories listed as follows:

3.15      The major long-term investment items would be livestock, 56%; farm
structures (mainly fencing and milking facilities), 22%; and pasture
improvement, 11%. The purchase of steers on a short-term basis, when used
with long-term investment, would be financed from local funds totaling
approximately US$0.6 million (see Tables 9 through 11 for details).
3.16      It is estimated that the major farm assets financed by the project
would approximate quantities listed in the following table over a period of
five years.

Technical Unit
3.18      The project would provide funding for the TU during the five-year
implementation period. Included in the funding would be the purchase of
vehicles and technical and office equipment (Table 12). Vehicle purchases
would be according to the phasing below which takes into account vehicles
already in use by the TU but which would need replacing during the project.

Office and technical equipment would include the purchase of a micro-computer
for monitoring and evaluation, as well as typewriters, calculators and
scientific instruments such as, field soil test equipment for a total of
about US$100,000. The main purpose of the TU would be to render technical
assistance to project beneficiaries in the implementation of their investment
plans.



- 14 -
Training Program
3.20      Training supported by the proposed project would be provided for
the TU staff and project beriefiLciaricss
3.21      TU Staff.  TLU staff, numbering some 30 professionals, ranging in
disciplines from veterinarianas to accountants, would receive a total of 477
man-weeks of training during the implementation period. Training would be
divided between foreign '_15 man-weeks) and local training (262 man-weeks).
Training topics would consist of a -vide variety of subjects such as milk
production systems, animal fertilit , roject evaluation techniques and basic
banking.
3.22      The purpose of training at this level would be to acquaint the
technicians with the Dest meth50ds to use to train farmers. Training would be
conducted at this level in the local university) local institutions such as
the Agricultural Research Instltute eTNIAP) and at many international centers
such as the Center for Tropical Agricultural Research and Training (CATIE) in
Costa Rica and the Center for Tropical Agricultural Research (CIAT) in
Colombia. The Second Livestock Project sponsored programs in dual-purpose
farm management accomplished by CIAT and forage production seminars done by
personnel of the University of Panama.  Details of the training program are
in Tables 13 and 14.
3.23      Project Beneficiaries.  Project beneficiaries would receive
training through field days sponsored by BNP and managed by the TU which
would demonstrate approprlate technology and give advice on farm problems as
has been done under the Second Livestock Project.  Training would also be
conducted at the five BNP-MIDA milk production centers which were supported
under the Second Livestock Project. The proposed Project would continue to
pay the salary of two staff members at the centers which serves as
demonstration farms for proven livestock technology. Training would also be
reinforced by the TU's field technicians during their periodic visits to
beneficiaries' farms.
Consulting Services
3.24      A total of 10 man-months at a gross cost of US$10,000 per man-month
(50% of which would be in fees) of short-term consultant services (Table 15)
would be utilized in the project to assist the TU in the following four
specific areas. An outline of each consultant's terms of reference is in
Annex 1.  The consultant assignments would concentrate on:
(a)   Dual-Purpose Cattle Systems and Pasture Management.  Reviewing
field data and advising on optimal dual-purpose cattle systems, as
well as low cost methods of producing high energy, on-farm dry
season forage for small- and medium-scale operations.
(b)   Cattle Reproduction Efficiency.  Improving the low calving rates
found on many farms in Panama in order to bring about lower cost
cattle operations.  This would continue the initial work already
financed under the Second Livestock Project.



- 15 -
(c)   Project Monitoring and Evaluation.  Reviewing the current TU
proposal for a computer-based monitoring system and assisting in
its implementation.
(d)   Soil and Water Conservation.  Continuing the work financed by the
Second Livestock Project which indicated that soil erosion was
proceeding at alarming rates in some areas. The proposed project
would finance consulting services to design and assist in the
implementation of soil conservation praetices on selected project
beneficiaries' farms.
D. Project Costs
3.25      Total project costs are estimated at US$25.5 million, including
contingencies. The costs include taxes on imports and equipment totalling
less than 1% of baseline costs. The foreign exchange component is estimated
at US$6.2 million, or 28% of total project cost. Project baseline costs were
calculated at projected mid-1983 prices based on appraisal mission
estimates. Physical contingencies equivalent to less than 1% of total
baseline costs have been added as 10% of the cost of the Technical Unit's
vehicles and equipment, amounting to less than US$0.1 million. An additional
19% of baseline costs has been included to accommodate expected price
increases over an estimated five-year disbursement period.
3.26      The same price contingencies were used for both local and foreign
costs at the following rates of projected price increases:

E. Financing
3.27      The proposed loan would be US$9.0 million, equivalent to 35% of the
project cost during the five-year development period. The loan would cover
100% of the foreign exchange costs and approximately 11% of the local costs.
Coverage of local costs in the Bank loan is justified on country grounds.
The balance of the funding would be provided by BNP (US$12.9 million or 51%)
and by the beneficiaries' equity (US$3.6 million or 14%).

3.28      The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk and would be
the guarantor.  The Bank loan would be at the standard variable interest rate
with a term of 15 years, including a three-year grace period.
F. Procurement
Works
3.29      Farm buildings, storage sheds, water tanks and wells totalling
US$3.5 million, would be purchased on the basis of normal commercial channels
for the estimated 420 farm subloans to be included in the project. Due to
the large number of individual farmers involved, each with particular needs,
grouping of the works into large contracts would not be feasible.
Goods
3.30      Goods required for all farm subloans aggregating to an estimated
US$16.5 million, would be procured through normal commercial channels because
of the small individual purchases and the high variability of items.



- 18 -
Vehicles and equipment for the TU totalling US$0.6 million, including
contingencies, would be grouped into appropriate bidding packages where
possible. Contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or less
would be awarded based on negotiated purchase with at least three bids; those
above US$50,000, would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally, the procedures for which are satisfactory to the Bank.
International bidding is not appropriate because of the mixed nature of the
equipment and its spread over time.
Services
3.31      Services such as foreign training (US$0.1 million), local training
(US$0.1 million), and farm surveying (US$0.9 million) would be procured
through normal commercial channels. Internationally recruited consultants,
estimated to cost US$0.1 million (a gross cost of approximately US$10,000 per
man-month), would be procured according to Bank guidelines.
Contract Review
3.32      All bidding packages and contracts estimated to cost over
US$100,000 would be subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement
documentation. All contracts for consultants would be subject to the Bank's
prior review. This would result in approximately US$0.5 million of works,
goods and services being subject to prior Bank review. The balance of
contracts and records of expenditures would be subject to review by the Bank
after contract award or expenditure. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the procedures in this and in previous paragraphs on
procurement would be followed.
G. Disbursements
3.33      The Bank loan would be disbursed over a five-year period for:
(a)  46% of the amount financed for long-term investment subloans
(US$7.8 million);
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures for the
purchase of materials, equipment and vehicles for the TU
(US$0.6 million);
(c) 100% of total expenditures for internationally recruited experts
and foreign training (US$0.2 million); and
(d) a sum of US$0.4 million which would remain unallocated minus a Bank
front-end fee of US$22,444.
3.34      Disbursements under (b) and (c) would be fully documented and under
(a) disbursements would be made under certified statements of expenditure,
with the supporting documentation retained by BNP and available for periodic
review by Bank supervision missions. The control arrangements of BNP worked
satisfactorily in earlier projects and are adequate for the adoption of this
procedure.



- 19 -
3.35      The proposed disbursement schedule envisages a disbursement rate
considerably faster than other Bank agricultural projects because:
(a)  the project would be the third project with the existing TU and
there would therefore be no initial delays in forming a project
unit; and
(b)  the project has few components, with over 90% of the Bank loan
being for credit, for which there is a strong demand.
3.36      Table 16 compares the proposed loan disbursement schedule, based on
Board presentation in late 1983, with the average actual disbursement
schedule for all LAC Agricultural Credit Project Loans/Credits completed
during FY78-80.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
4.01      BNP would be the borrower and executing agency for the project.
Within BNP the project would continue to be administered by the Agricultural
Development Department which manages the Tropical Tree Crop Development
Project (Loan 1672-PAN), the Second Livestock Project (Loan 1398-PAN), an
IDB-financed aquaculture project, and BNP's own agricultural credit lines.
At the end of 1982 the combined loan portfolio managed by the agricultural
department totaled US$81 million.
Technical Unit
4.02      At the current rate of usage, all funds from the Second Livestock
Project (Loan 1397-PAN) would be fully committed prior to the effectiveness
of the third project, thereby allowing the TU to focus on the new project.
Current manning of the TU is 40 persons, as shown on Chart 2. During the
development period, four additional field technicians would be added, which
would bring the total of field personnel to 23. Over half of the TU staff
would be stationed in the field, serving approximately 25 of BNP's 47 branch
offices.
Functions of the Technical Unit
4.03      The TU's subloan administration would follow the well-tested
procedures of the two earlier projects. The TU would provide technical
personnel to draw up the farm investment plans that make up part of the
subloan applications. These applications would then be submitted for
approval to the Credit Committee of the local branch or regional office of
BNP nearest the subloan applicant. Prior to submission to the Credit
Committee, the farm investment plan would be reviewed on a technical basis by
the Technical Unit Director. After subloan approval, the project field
technicians would render technical assistance, supervise and monitor the
implementation of the investment plan. The number of subloans per technician
would be based on the experience of the First and Second Livestock Projects.
The average number of subloans managed by each field technician, including
the outstanding subloans from the First and Second projects, would rise from
the present 29 subloans to 36 subloans by the first year of project
development, as seen in the following table.

Project Field Technicians         16        16     18      19     19      19
Subloans/Technician             29       36      35     37      37     33
4.04      Experience gained under the First and Second Livestock Projects
indicates that the maximum number of subloans that a field technician can
handle varies from 35 to 45, depending on the development stage of each
subloan.
Farm Visit Frequency and Technical Support
4.05      The field technician would be the link between the TU and the
farmer. After approval of a subloan, the field technician offers guidance
and technical assistance in the implementation of the farmer's investment
plan. At the beginning of each plan, field visits would be frequent (as many
as one or two times per week). The visit frequency would be decreased
(minimum once per two months) as the plan progresses. The technician would
be a university graduate, have a project four-wheel drive vehicle and would
receive close direction from a senior field supervisor. Field support staff
would consist of four senior staff technicians in pasture development, milk
and beef production and veterinary science.
B. Lending Program
Coverage
4.06      The project would cover the seven 1/ provinces served by the 25 BNP
branch offices that have TU representation. Coverage would be extended to
all nine provinces, depending on BNP branch office support, availability of
technicians and subloan demand.
4.07      The program would offer credit to about 420 farm families and would
be accomplished at a rate of approximately 105 new subloans per year as seen
in the following schedule. This rate is based on the subloans demand
experienced by the Second Livestock Project.
1/ Cocle, Colon, Chiriqui, Herrera, Los Santos, Panama and Veraguas.

Subloan Lending Terms and Conditions
4.08      Terms for dual-purpose and beef production subloans would be as
follows:
(a) long-term credit up to 12 years, including up to four years of
grace; and
(b) short-term credit up to 24 months with no grace period, for
fattening, in conjunction with a long-term farm investment plan.
4.09      Complementary annual crop activities integrated into investment
plans for beef or dual-purpose farms could be financed by the subloan.
Beneficiaries' minimum contributions would be 15% of the investment cost.
Subloans would be for no more than US$250,000 each. Subloan proposals for
over US$200,000 would be submitted to the Bank for prior approval. The
proposed project would not finance land acquisition. Livestock purchases
could not make up more than 70% of a long-term subloan.
4.10      Annual interest rates for subloans would be initially 9% which
would be according to current interest rates for agricultural lending, plus a
service fee of 1% per annum charged on disbursements and a 1% commitment
fee. BNP and the Bank would review the subloan rates and other terms and
conditions from time to time. Details of the lending program are in Schedule
A and assurances were obtained at negotiations that the lending terms and
conditions would be as specified therein. The subloan interest rate would be
above the estimated 7.5% inflation rate foreast for Panama at the start of
the project. Inflation has averaged 10% per year for the period 1980-82 and
is forecast at an average of 7.5% per year during the first three years of
project implementation.
4.11      Subloan guarantees, procurement, insurance, disbursements, credit
procedures and other associated activities would be according to BNP's
practices and policies, which are satisfactory.



- 22 -
4.12      The responsible BNP branch office would handle all routine subloan
payments and other business contacts with the borrower. Data on accounting,
payroll, and loan portfolio movements originating at the BNP branch office
level would be sent to the BNP main office in Panama City for computer
processing. Data on the project would be consolidated in Panama City and
reports would be distributed to the branch offices and to the TU.
C. Accounts and Audits
4.13      Separate project accounts, records and documentation pertaining to
financial transactions would be kept by BNP in accordance with sound
accounting principles consistently applied. Previous external auditors'
reports for the First and Second Livestock Projects were prepared according
to Bank guidelines for financial reporting and auditing of projects.
Accounting systems currently in use by BNP are considered adequate.  Project
accounts and related financial information, including those supporting the
statements of expenditure utilized by BNP to claim reimbursement from the
Bank, and BNP's financial statements would be audited annually, in accordance
with generally accepted accounting standards, by independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank. The auditor's report would express an opinion as
to the reliability of statements of expenditure to support claims for
disbursement and to verify that claims were supported by adequate
documentation that adequately reflect expenditures incurred for legitimate
project purposes and the comment on adequacy of internal controls. Certified
copies of the audited project accounts and BNP audited consolidated accounts,
together with the report of the auditors (management letter), would be sent
to the Bank not later than four months after the close of each fiscal year.
Assurances on these points were obtained at negotiations.
D. Monitoring and Reporting
4.14      Quarterly progress reports for the Second Livestock Project are
being compiled by the TU and copies are forwarded regularly to the Bank. The
reports include the status of subloan commitments, outstanding portfolio
recoveries, and subloan arrears. The same format would be utilized for the
Third Livestock Project but reports would be prepared semi-annually.
Monitoring data on the Second Livestock Project are being collected,
consolidated and analyzed manually. The Third Livestock Project would
utilize a computer-based system to consolidate and analyze monitoring data.
The project would finance a consultant to advise on the final format for the
monitoring data sheets and on the installation of the system. The TU, with
the assistance from consultants, has drafted a preliminary version of the
proposed computer-based monitoring system, but a final testing of the system
is needed. TU personnel would be responsible for the operation and
evaluation of the monitoring system. An assurance was obtained at
negotiations that semi-annual progress reports would be sent to the Bank no
later than 60 days after the close of each semester and that a draft
completion report would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months
after the project had been completed.

V. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Production
5.01      Although investment under the project would not be restricted to
specific areas, subloan demand is expected to be highest in the western
Pacific watershed and in the areas adjacent to Panama City, as has been the
experience in the two previous Bank-financed livestock projects.
5.02      Production targets are based on realistic coefficients that have
been achieved by beneficiaries of the ongoing projects (Table 17). Most of
the proposed changes in technology have already been made, either on
participating farms or on other similar farms in the project area. As a
result of project-induced changes, aggregate milk production on
beneficiaries' farms should rise from 2.5 million liters annually to 18.5
million liters, an increase of 640%. Beef production would increase from
about 1,100 tons dressed weight to about 3,500 tons dressed weight annually,
an increase of 218%. The annual gross value of incremental production
attributable to the project at full production (Year 12) would be some
US$10.5 million.
5.03      Labor demand would rise by 52%.  This would not pose supply
problems since the existing farm family members are able to provide
requirements under the assumption of 2 man-units per farm for 300 days per
year each unit.
5.04      Project production gains would come from stocking rate increases
through establishment of improved grass-legume pastures and better herd
management. Two investment models are presented to illustrate the changes
expected to take place. Model 1 (Tables 18 through 22) represents the
dual-purpose system commonly found among beneficiaries of the on-going
livestock project. Without the project, the 80-ha produces 9,576 liters of
milk and 4,060 kg livestock of beef per year on 78 ha of native grasses and 2
ha of crops. With the project, 10 ha of higher yielding forages would be
established, together with 2 ha of trees for erosion control. The stocking
rate rises from 0.7 animal unit (AU) per hectare to 1.6 AU/ha. Through
better health care and nutrition, individual performance coefficients would
rise, as shown in the following table.

5.05      The second example, Model 2 (Tables 23 through 27), represents a
beef breeding operation on poorer land and more distant from milk collection
points. Without the project, the farmer produces about 6,560 kg net
liveweight of beef on 153 ha of natural grasses with another 7 ha of forage.
With the project, 15 ha of improved pastures would be planted as well as 4 ha
of trees for erosion control. Technical assumptions are summarized in the
following table.

B.  Marketing
5.06      The incremental beef production would represent an additional 5.5%
of national output. Disposal of this increment would not pose problems since
Panama does not take full advantage of its available foreign markets.
Although this quantity is marginal, it is expected that the experience from
the type of investment envisaged under the project would lead to more
widespread interest in beef production. For this to occur, meat export
packers would need reasonable assurance of their medium- to long-term export
possibilities before investing in proper plant maintenance or expansion.
This would require a change in the present system of fixing export quotas and
prices on a short-term basis. The restriction on beef exports has now been
removed. Some reasonable consistency with world market conditions is
required to give direction for further development of the Panamanian beef
industry. Since domestic demand is already satisfied, future growth would
have to be directed towards exports. The Government controls producer and
retail beef prices within its overall strategy of consumer protection.
Although some divergence between actual farmgate prices of cattle and those
derived from world trade price comparisons occurs from time to time, cattle
pricing is not considered an issue. The 1982 border price comparator working
back from Panama's actual exports to the USA was a farmgate price of B/. 0.92
per kg liveweight (Table 28) whereas the price received by growers for the
same class of animal was about B/. 0.88 per kg liveweight with the difference
attributable to transport and processing costs plus some error of estimate.
5.07      The extra 16 million liters of milk to be produced each year with
the project would amount to an 18% increase in the annual production
nationwide. Since current imports run at around 37 million liters per year,
this amount can be easily absorbed, not only through import substitution but
also by the 30% increase in population expected during the 10-years to full
development of the milk output. The willingness of the milk processors to
buy the local production would depend on three factors: the price at which
local dairy farmers are willing to supply factories in comparison with import
prices; the reliability of deliveries at all seasons of the year; and milk
quality. The supply regularity is, in part, a function of supplementary
feeding, itself depending on the relative price of milk and feed costs, and
of the relative price of milk and beef received by dual-purpose operators
from whom most of the incremental milk is expected to come. The milk quality
depends on investment in on-farm milk plant. Table 29 shows that the cost of
locally produced Grade B milk delivered at the factory-gate of 0.280 cents
per liter and is about equal to the cost of reconstituted powdered milk of
industrial grade. Consumers already pay this premium for what is supposed to
be "Grade A" milk but is actually a mixture of Industrial Grade, Grade A and
reconstituted milk.
5.08      The project addresses these issues by providing for investments to
produce supplementary feed to improve the regularity of delivery throughout
the year and for investments in dairy infrastructure to enable farmers to be
eligible to produce Grade B milk. However, unless the Grade B payment is
introduced, farmers would have no incentive to make investments to produce
Grade B milk.



- 26 -
5.09       As described in the preceeding paragraphs, two basic policy issues
which impinge upon the project's complete success are:
(a) the lifting by the Government of quotas on beef exports. Beef
quotas in the past have been set on a short-term, ad hoc basis and
have hampered the orderly establishment of export markets for beef;
and
(b) the implementation of that part of Law 60 which establishes Grade B
milk, which means for the qualifying producer an average unit price
rise from below US$0.22 per liter to US$0.25 per liter. Besides
the producer, the consumer would also benefit by receiving more
wholesome milk.
5.10       Because of the Government recognition of the importance of these
factors to the sub-sector, the Bank has been assured that:
(a) export quotas for beef have been removed; and
(b) the Grade B milk pricing policy would be implemented before
December 31, 1983. Project effectiveness is conditioned on this
implementation.
C. Financial Analysis at Farm Level
Farm Income
5.11       The two models selected to demonstrate the financial and economic
feasibility of the project are distinctly different with respect to farming
intensity and location. The first model, the dual-purpose operation of 80
ha, is located near an all-weather road system and therefore can make daily
milk deliveries to a milk collection point. Farm production consists of both
meat and milk. In this case, as seen in Table 30, the farm income rises from
the 'without project' situation of US$4,700 to US$16,300 in the 'with
project' situation by the 10th year of the investment plan. Per capita
incomes based on a family of five rise from US$940 per year to US$3,260 per
year by the tenth year. This would compare favorably with Panama's estimated
1983 GDP per capita of US$2,000. The second farm model, the beef production
system of 160 ha, represents a situation where the farm is located in an area
too remote for daily milk deliveries. In this case the net proceeds from the
farm increase from the 'without project' situation of US$2,500 per year to
US$6,200 per year in the 'with' situation by the 10th year.
Financial Rate of Return on Farm Models
5.12       The financial rate of return, without financing charges, as seen in
Table 30 is close to 20% for each model, which should provide sufficient
incentive for farmers to participate in the project.



- 27 -
D. Financial Analysis at Project Level
Financial Rate of Return
5.13      The financial rate of return of the project using market prices is
16%. This includes all project investment and operating costs borne by the
subloan beneficiaries and BNP.
Technical Unit Cash Flow
5.14      Table 31 is a detail of the TU's operating costs while Table 32 is
the TU's projected income statement, sources and application of funds and
cash flow. BNP's current practice in advancing its own funds to operating
units of the organization is to charge an interest rate of 8.5% to the unit.
Accordingly, BNP's projected contribution of US$12.9 million to the project
financing is charged to the TU as an advance at 8.5%. In the same manner,
the Bank's US$9.0 million loan would be charged to the TU at the Bank's
variable interest rate. On a consolidated basis (taking into consideration
the existing TU subloan portfolio and liabilities), the TU cash flow with the
planned inputs remains positive up until the 15th year, with all subloan
repayments passing back to BNP to repay the BNP advance and the Bank loan as
soon as they are collected.   As subloan recoveries pass back to the BNP
parent organization to repay advances and loans and are not reinvested at the
TU level, the TU's cash flow is gradually reduced and, in the last four years
of the 15-year program, deficits are experienced in meeting obligations. In
actual practice, the TU would receive funds in the future for subloans under
new loan programs which would contribute to the TU's cash flow.
VI. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Economic Benefits
6.01      The proposed project would directly benefit some 420 farm families,
totalling over 2,000 people. In addition to increased on-farm labor demand,
work would be generated in the transport and processing activities. The
direct investment in productivity-raising measures, together with increasing
milk quality at the farm would be matched by contingent policy changes,
consisting of removal of beef export control and introduction of the
intermediate Grade B milk payment incentive (para 5.10). Milk consumers
would also benefit by receiving the 100% fresh milk that they pay for.
Reduction of imports would help reduce the balance-of-payments deficit on
commodity trade.
B. Economic Analysis
6.02      The economic rate of return has been estimated at about 19%
(Table 33) and is based on directly quantifiable benefits. The following
assumptions were used in the analysis: (a) milk and beef production was
taken from the aggregation of the investment models; (b) prices for traded
commodities (meat and milk) were calculated from border prices adjusted for
handling, processing and transportation costs to reach average farmgate
prices (Tables 28 and 29); (c) production costs associated with labor were
adjusted to opportunity cost estimates; family labor cost was considered to



- 28 -
be 90% of the market price for unskilled labor; hired unskilled labor was
charged at a lower 75% of its market prices because of fewer opportunities
for productive activities during off-peak season; (d) taxes were deleted, and
other production costs were priced at local market prices on the grounds that
they best reflect their opportunity costs; (e) the period of analysis was 15
years; (f) all investments and recurrent costs were included in the analysis
for the calculation of the economic rate of return; and (g) the value of the
herd was inputed as a benefit in year 15.
C. Sensitivity Analysis
6.03      A sensitivity analysis to test the impact of changes in costs,
benefits, prices and other factors was also made (Table 39). Switching value
tests indicate that the rate of return is sensitive to changes in estimates
of gross benefits, operating costs, on-farm investment costs and prices of
milk and beef. The rate of return is relatively insensitive to other items
such as cost of vehicles, equipment, training and recurrent costs. Project
gross benefits could be reduced by 15% and the economic rate of return would
still be 12%.  The price of beef would have to decline by 30% or the price of
milk by 50% to get an ERR of 12%.  The main factors that could delay project
benefits -- institutional problems and adverse weather -- were also tested,
indicating that a delay in benefits of about two years would be required to
cause the ERR to drop to 12%, assuming that cost outlays would occur as
planned.
D. Project Risks
6.04      The technical assumptions used in the project are based on actual
achievements on directly sampled farms of beneficiaries of the ongoing
livestock project. Since the proposed project is a continuation of the same
strategy with the same TU for project management, no problem is expected from
technical uncertainty. In view of the strong subloan demand under the Second
Livestock Project, all funds are expected to be committed in 1983. No
adverse environmental effect is foreseen. On the contrary, the project
envisages erosion control on already exploited land and no substantial
deforestation would occur.
VII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were received from the Government
that:
(a) the Government would carry the foreign exchange risk (para 3.28);
(b) procurement would be as specified in paras 3.29 to 3.32;
(c) lending terms and conditions for subloans would be as specified in
paras 4.08 to 4.10;
(d) audited project accounts and BNP financial statements would be
forwarded to the Bank not later than four months after the close of
each fiscal year (para 4.13);



- 29 -
(e) semi-annual progress reports would be submitted to the Bank no
later than 60 days after the closing of each period and a draft
completion report would be submitted to the Bank no later than six
months after the project had been completed (para 4.14); and
(f) processors would begin paying producers for Grade B milk prior to
December 31, 1983 (para 5.10).
7.02      A condition of loan effectiveness would be that a scheme for
payment by processors to producers for Grade B milk had been implemented
(para 5.10).
7.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project would constitute a
suitable basis for a Bank loan to Panama for US$9.0 million. The loan would
have a term of 15 years, including three years of grace, with a variable rate
of interest.

credit demand and BNP branch office services, the project could be extended
to Bocas del Toro and Darien provinces.
Subloan Approval Procedures. All subloans would be approved by
BNP's Loan Committees, according to BNP's practice. Proposals for subloans
of over US$200,000, would require Bank approval prior to the submission to
the appropriate BNP Loan Committee.
Subloan Terms and Conditions
Interest Rate. The subloan interest rate would be according to BNP
policies for agricultural lending and would be initially set at 9% per
annum. In addition, a 1% technical service fee would be charged based on
annual disbursements. The Bank and BNP would from time to time jointly
review subloan interest rates structure and other terms and conditions and
appropriate changes would be made with the Bank's approval.
Security. Subloan security or collateral would be according to BNP
policies.
Maturities. The maximum subloan repayment period would be
determined on the basis of each development plan, with the following limits:

Page 2
(a) 12 years, including up to four years of grace, for long-term
financing for on-farm investments in dairy dual-purpose and beef
production operations; and
(b)  24 months, without a grace period, for shQrt-terW  financing for the
purchase Qf animals for fattening in cqn un;tion with the long-term
farm investment.
Subloan Limits and Beneficiaries' Contributions. Subloans would be
for a minimum of US$10,000 and a maximum of US$250,000. Subloans would not
exceed the equivalent 85% of the estimated cost of the investment plan,
including the beneficiary's own labor as a cost.
Subloan Restrictions. Subloans could not finance the purchase of
land. Long-term subloans (more than 24 months) could not finance the
purchase of steers. Short-term loans for the purchase of steers must be in
conjunction with long-term financing. Livestock purchases could not make up
more than 70% of a long-term subloan.
Inspection and Supervision. Inspection by the TU and Bank
supervision missions would be permitted on the farm.
