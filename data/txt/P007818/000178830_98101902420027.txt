THIRD LIVESTOCK PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:         Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP)
Guarantor:        Republic of Panama
Amount:           US$9.0 million equivalent (including US$22,444 capitalized
front-end fee).
Terms:            15 years, including 3 years of grace at the standard
variable interest rate.
Relending
Terms:            BNP would relend US$7.8 million equivalent of the proceeds
of the loan to the farmers at its current interest rate
for agricultural lending (presently 9 percent per annum plus
a 1 percent per annum technical service fee and a 1 percent
commitment fee); subloans would have a term of up to 12
years including up to 4 years of grace.
Project
Description:      The proposed project aims at increasing beef export, milk
production for the local market, the reduction of milk
imports, improving livestock management methods and
generation of rural employment. These objectives would be
achieved through the provision of credit and training to
farmers, training and support to BNP's Technical Unit (TU),
and promoting the market conditions which would encourage
investments in the sector. Sub-loans would be made for some
260 dual purpose (milk and beef) operations and 160 beef
production operations. Loan proceeds would finance:
(a) Livestock;
(b) Farm structures (mainly fencing and milking
facilities);
(c) Farm equipment;
(d) Water systems, pasture improvements; and reforestation;
(e) Vehicles and equipment for TU; and
(f) Technical assistance and training.
Risk:             The project would have no unusual risk.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPA1ENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EOUIVALENT TO US$9.0 MILLION
TO BANCO NACIONAL DE PANAMA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
FOR A THIRD LIVESTOCK PROJECT
t   1.    I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP) with the guarantee of the Republic of
Panama for the equivalent of US$9.0 million, including the capitalized
front-end fee to help finance a Third  Livestock Project.  The loan would
have a term of 15 years, including 3 years of grace, with interest at the
standard variable rate. BNP would relend USS7.8 equivalent of the proceeds
of the proposed loan to farmers at its current interest rate for agricultural
lending for a term of up to 12 years including up to 4 years of grace for
subloans.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Panama:  Special Economic Report-Metropolitan
Unemployment" (3833-PAN) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June
7, 1982. The findings of that report and subsequent economic missions to
Panama are summarized below. A President's Report recommending a Structural
Adjustment Loan, scheduled to be distributed to the Executive Directors very
shortly, includes a more detailed discussion of the economy and of the
Government's structural adjustment program.  Country data sheets are attached
as Annex I.
3.        Between 1978 and 1982 the Panamanian economy grew at an annual
average rate of 4.4 percent, almost double the rate of population increase.
This reversed a decline in per capita GDP experienced during the mid-1970s.
The principal sources of growth were the provision of international services,
construction and the public sector. Agriculture has been the least buoyant
sector, with no real output growth since 1978.
4.        The Government's three main concerns since 1968 have been to
eliminate rural poverty, to increase national control over the economy,
including the Panama Canal, and to reate new sources of economic growth and
exports.  Social programs in health and education were extended to most
areas, and an agrarian reform program was initiated. The second goal was
achieved by the U.S.-Panamanian Treaty of 1979 by which the administration of
the prior Canal Zone reverted to Panama. Major investments were undertaken
in transport, tourism, international commercial infrastructure, water supply
and sewerage, and power, mostly to provide support for expected private
activities. Power and most telecommunications facilities were nationalized.
New state enterprises were created for export crops such as sugar, citrus,
and bananas; and a state-owned cement plant was built. Self-sufficiency in
basic foodstuffs such as rice, corn, and beans was also accorded high
priority.
5.        The Government's social programs have had considerable success in
enhancing the quality of life in Panama, as reflected in demographic, health
and educational indicators. Infant mortality was halved between



1970 and 1980, while the birth rate fell more than 20 percent. Access to
potable water for the rural population increased from 41 percent in 1970 to
70 percent in 1980. The proportion of the population enrolled in schools
of all types increased from less than one-quarter to over one-third between
1968 and 1980. In 1981, 57 percent of the population had access to elec-
tricity compared to 52 percent in 1970. The Government's goal is to
increase this to 62 percent by 1986. Despite these achievements, estimates
indicate that some 20 percent of the urban and 30 percent of the rural
population continue to live in poverty.
6.        As regards the Government's economic programs, the Colon Free
Zone and past hydroelectric projects increased employment and earnings from
export of services, and reduced the burden of rising petroleum costs. The
most successful of Government programs was a major change in the banking
legislation in 1970. This has attracted about 130 banks to Panama; it is
now a major regional Eurodollar Center. Other programs involving direct
production by the public sector or affecting private sector decisions have
been less successful. Agricultural programs have led to self-sufficiency
in rice and increased the output of milk, but have had less impact on the
output of beef and feed grains.  State sugar mills have increased output
but they operate unprofitably. Similarly, State enterprises in tourism and
cement have been a burden on the fisc. The public enterprises' direct
competition with private enterprises and uncertainties relating to Govern-
ment labor and price policies adversely affected the climate for private
investment. Recent changes in economic policy, improvements in the dia-
logue between the Government and the private sector, and a more flexible
approach to labor and price policy have increased private sector
confidence.
7.        The high level of outlays for economic and social infrastructure,
coupled with the substantial losses of state enterprises, resulted in
significant increases in the public sector deficit, despite periodic
efforts to strengthen the public finances. This deficit increased from
4.4 percent of GDP in 1970 to over 15 percent of GDP in 1978, before fal-
ling to 6 percent in both 1980 and 1981 in compliance with a series of
Standby Arrangements with the IMF. In 1982, however, the public sector
deficit widened to 11 percent of GDP, well in excess of the Standby pro-
gram. Because Panama has no central bank or control over its currency, the
authorities cannot finance their deficit by resorting to central bank
credit. Deficits are, therefore, met by borrowings denominated in US dol-
lars.  Outstanding external public debt (including some short-term debt)
increased by almost one-fifth during 1982, to reach US$3.1 billion, or
73 percent of GDP. Interest pay rtents on this debt absorbed 30 percent of
total public sector revenues.                                   -
8.        This situation prompted the authorities to take a series of cor-
rective actions in late 1982 and early 1983. The Government is reducing
the public sector deficit to 6 percent of GDP in 1983 and to 512 percent in
1984. This is to be achieved partly by new tax measures, but mainly by
reduced current and capital expenditures. Budgetary controls have been
considerably strengthened, and the public investment program for 1983-84
thoroughly reviewed. Public capital outlays in both years will be
substantially lower than in 1981-82 and a number of projects have been
cancelled or postponed. These measures led to successfully concluded
negotiations with the IMF for a two year Standby-cum CFF Arrangement of



- 3 -
about $230 million, of which $120 million will be available in 1983 and the
rest in 1984. The IMF Board approved the Standby in late June, 1983.
Other than the reduced public deficit the main condition of the Standby is
no net increase in commercial foreign debt by the public sector in 1983 or
1984.
9.        In addition to addressing its short-term financial difficulties
the Government has embarked upon a program of medium-term structural
adjustment. A number of important measures have already been taken which
aim to create an environment where private initiative generates the
buoyancy in economic activity no longer provided by the financially
weakened public sector.  They include rationalization of public sector
institutions, reduction of effective protection, reforms in the structure
of incentives and changes in pricing policies. Due to past high levels of
public investment much of the infrastructure required for private sector
activity is already in place. There is social tranquility and excellent
financial, communications and transport facilities, while Panama's work-
force is among the best educated in the area. The Government anticipates
that its new strategy will stimulate private investment leading to the
accelerated production of goods for export, since the scope for further
import substitution and for more growth in the service sector is limited.
The Government's medium-term program is therefore geared towards greater
efficiency in both agriculture and industry to improve their competi-
tiveness.
10.       The prospects for growth also depend on the use of land and
facilities reverted to Panama and on the higher earnings received under the
Canal Treaty. Implementation of the Treaty began on October 1, 1979, and
will be completed on December 31, 1999, when the Canal and all ancillary
facilities will revert to Panama. Already the ports of Balboa, Cristobal
and Coco Solo Norte, two abandoned airfields, much valuable land, and most
service outlets of the former Panama Canal Company's supply division have
reverted to Panama. The reverting land enhances the attraction of the
metropolitan area, along the Canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific, as the
best site for activities to take advantage of Panama's excellent geographic
location. The Government has prepared legislation which will enable the
lease or sale of facilities in this area to the private sector to generate
employment and revenues.
11.       The longer-term outlook for the Panamanian economy is favorable,
given its geographic advantages, educated workforce, low population/land
ratio, and adequate physical infrastructure. The medium-term outlook will
depend on key domestic policies and on the international economy.  The
critical domestic issues include rising urban unemployment, -the size of the
public external debt, the relative roles of the public and private sectors,
and the climate for private investment. The scope and depth of the
structural adjustment measures already taken indicate the Government's keen
awareness of these issues. It has a continuing dialogue with the private
sector and is aggressively pursuing a program to attract internationally
integrated assembly industries. Procedures for establishing plants and
granting incentives have been simplified, and labor is trained in accord-
ance with the specific requirements of incoming firms. Nevertheless, the
very open Panamanian economy will find its medium-term recovery adversely
affected if the recovery in world economic activity is delayed.



- 4 -
12.       The Government has recently acted decisively to reduce the public
sector deficit. In addition, its medium-term structural adjustment program
is designed to rationalize current and capital expenditures and hence ensure
a continuing stable financial environment. Panama has recently concluded
negotiations with the IMF for a two-year Standby arrangement and proposed
Bank support for its medium term program in the form of a Structural
Adjustment Loan and related Technical Assistance financing will be submitted
for Board consideration in November, 1983. The Bank has reviewed the invest-
ment budget for 1983 which reflects not only a recognition of the need for
austerity but high standards in selecting priority projects. Panama has a
long record of prompt payment of its debts and a proven capacity to reduce
rapidly the public sector deficit when necessary. On this basis, and given
the Government's clear commitment to a stabilization program supported by the
IMF, Panama is considered creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       The Bank has to date made 27 loans to Panama totalling US$467.9
million (net of cancellations). Of these, 13 loans for US$159.0 million are
fully disbursed, two for roads totalling US$13.1 million; one for an airport
project for US$20 million; three for agriculture totalling US$5.7 million;
two for fisheries totalling US$8.2 million, three for power for US$76
million; one for ports for US$24 million; and one for water supply and
sewerage for US$12.0 million. Ongoing operations include one project for
livestock credit; one for development of tropical tree crops; two for
development banking; two for highway maintenance and rehabilitation; three in
the power sector (for generation, transmission and distribution); one to
support energy planning and petroleum exploration; one to help develop the
water supply and sewerage sector; one for the urban development of Colon; and
one for port development. The most recent loan to Panama, for a Sixth Power
Project, was approved by the Executive Directors on June 9, 1983.
14.       IFC has made three investments in Panama.  The first was a
commitment in 1971 to acquire US$0.3 million of equity in the Corporacion de
Desarrollo Hotelero, S.A. and to lend to the Corporacion US$1.2 million to
build a new international hotel. The second was a commitment in December
1977 to lend US$2.4 million and acquire US$1.4 million in equity in Vidrios
Panamenos, S.A., the first glass container factory in Panama. These projects
have been satisfactorily completed. The third is a commitment in 1979 to
acquire US$2.5 million in equity in the Banco Latinoamericano de
Exportaciones (BLADEX), a regional export hank promoted by the Government of
Panama.
15.       While there are some difficulties, satisfactory overall progress in
the implementation of ongoing projects is reflected in the steady increase in
Bank disbursements, from US$17 million in FY79 and US$16.1 million in FY80,
to US$31 million in FY81 and US$39 million in FY82. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of March 31, 1983.



16.       Bank lending to Panama is designed to support the Government's
development strategy particularly as regards the further development of
Panama's infrastructure and service industries, the diversification of
production and exports, and the rationalization of economic policies in order
to create the climate conducive to stimulating economic activity.
Specifically, the Bank assists those sectors in which it can make a special
contribution in terms of: (i) developing policies and institutions; (ii)
removing remaining infrastructure bottlenecks; and (iii) better utilizing the
country's natural resources, including its geographic location. In addition
to the proposed project, projects under active consideration for Bank lending
include a further power project, a structural adjustment operation, and a
v          technical assistance project.
17.       Both USAID and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have
invested substantial amounts in agriculture and social services (including
family planning in the case of USAID). Past lending patterns are likely to
persist, at least as regards the social services, because the Government
prefers to borrow on concessionary terms for these sectors, while utilizing
other assistance for projects which are expected to result in more immediate
economic benefits. In addition to agriculture and social services, the IDB
is financing road construction, industry and telecommunications, sectors in
which it is likely to continue lending. The IDB also participated with the
Bank in the financing of the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project and is financing a
rural electrification program. USAID expects to continue its efforts in
manpower training and projects oriented toward environmental protection.
USAID is also lending for alternative sources of energy (other than
petroleum).
18.       The Bank's share of Panama's publicly-guaranteed external debt
outstanding and disbursed was 6.2 percent at the end of 1982 and the Bank's
share of public external debt service was less than 4 percent in 1982. These
percentages are expected to increase slightly in the 1980's.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND THE LIVESTOCK SUB-SECTOR
A. The Agricultural Sector
19.       Agriculture plays a less dominant role in the Panamanian economy
than it does in most developing countries in a similar stage of development.
Bananas and sugar are the main cash and export crops, and their depressed



- 6 -
prices in recent years have had adverse effect on the sector. During the
past two decades agriculture has declined from producing 23 percent of GDP in
1960 to only 10 percent in 1982, In its place, the services sector has grown
to contribute 60 percent of GDP from financial, commercial and transport
activities. Average per capita income in rural areas is around US$700,
compared to a national average of a little less than US$2,000 in 1982 (up
from US$1,730 in 1980).
20.       In 1980, about 800,000 of Panama's 1.8 million inhabitants lived in
rural areas. Because of the scarcity of new jobs in agriculture, migration
to the cities has been rapid resulting in a 4.4 percent population annual
growth rate in urban areas and only 2.2 percent in the countryside. Although
long-run real growth in the sector had been satisfactory at some 3 percent
annually, a turn around appeared in the mid-seventies. Since 1977, real
output of the sector has declined by an average 0.5 percent per year.
Despite the relative decline in agriculture's contribution to total GDP, the
performance of the sector remains crucial to Panama as it still employs 27
percent of the workforce and generates 55 percent of commodity exports worth
some US$160 million annually.
Government Policy
21.       The Government has sought to improve agricultural productivity and
the living standards of small farmers through land settlement, concessional
credit programs and technical assistance. The Government also controls the
farm product prices, marketing margins and retail prices, as well as the
export and import of food items. The Office of Price Regulation makes final
decisions on consumer prices and therefore prices for producers. However,
the Government is revising these policies with a view to reducing controls
and enabling market forces to play a greater role in increasing the
efficiency of the agricultural sector (para. 9).
Land Tenure and Use
22.       The agricultural census of 1981 estimated that of Panama's 153,000
farms, some 116,000 were smaller than 5 ha in size. Some 72 percent of
farms, covering 44 percent of the land in farming, is worked without legal
title. About one-quarter of the arable land and one-half of the land
suitable for grazing is currently being used.
23.       Of the land under permanent cultivation, some 565,000 ha are  used
for major crops. Foodcrops are grown on about 422,000 ha with the balance
planted to export oriented cash crops. The principal food crops are rice,
maize and beans. The most common cash crops are bananas, sugarcane, coffee
and vegetables. There are no agronomic reasons why average yields could not
be doubled. For instance, sugarcane yields only 40 tons of cane per ha and
maize less than 1 ton per ha,



-7-
Lending in the Sector
24.       Institutional agricultural lending in Panama has grown steadily
from US$145 million in 1979 to US$211 million in 1982. As part of the
Government's policy to stimulate agriculture and increase its contribution to
the economy, a preferential interest rate is utilized for agricultural
lending, which is currently three percentage points less than commercial
rates. The three percentage points difference (reduced from 7 percent in
1981) is funded by the National Banking Commission from a one percent
surcharge on personal and commercial bank loans. Real rates are currently
positive regardless of this subsidy. In the course of the Bank's continuing
v        economic work it is intended to pursue a dialogue with the Government to
encourage it to continue to reduce or end this subsidy over a reasonable
period.
25.       Two Government-owned institutions, the Agricultural Development
Bank (BDA) and the National Bank of Panama (BNP) provide approximately 75
percent of total lending to the sector. BDA lends mostly to small-scale
farmers and sustains operating losses. BNP's agricultural portfolio is about
one-third of the total agricultural lending.  In addition to maintaining the
Government's accounts, BNP operates as a commercial bank carrying out all
other banking operations. In the last five years, thanks to efficient
management, BNP has experienced real growth in its loan portfolio, its
reserves and its annual surplus.
B. The Livestock Subsector
26.       The livestock subsector has shown slow growth tendencies similar to
the rest of the agricultural sector. Within the subsector, milk, poultry,
and pork production kept up with population growth of some 3 percent
annually, but beef production increased by less than 2 percent per year
during the 1970s. Beef production estimates record only output from
registered slaughterhouses. Clandestine slaughter which may be sizeable,
introduces a significant error factor in livestock inventory and growth
estimates. Nevertheless, due to the policy environment existing until
recently (para. 31), it is a rather stagnant industry with sporadic short
term movements in response to good seasons and fortuitous market
improvements. In 1981, the cattle population was estimated at about 1.3
million.
27.       The main livestock producing areas are on the Pacific watershed,
west of the Canal. The central provinces are the most important in terms of
numbers of cattle and of farms with the highest productivity on the better
land around Chiriqui, near the Costa Rican border. The lowest productivity
is in the eastern part of Panama including the Darien Province which is
almost completely without infrastructure. Elevation strongly influences
rainfall incidence and pasture throughout the country. Rainfall varies from
some 1,000 mm annually in the lower parts of the Azuero peninsula to over
5,000 mm around the mountain peaks in the northern part of the Chiriqui
province. Rainfall is substantially higher along the Atlantic than on the
Pacific side. A dry season of two to five months occurs between December and
May. Soils are generally leached and low in major nutrients, organic matter
and trace elements.

28.       Of the 33,200 cattle farms in Panama, 85 percent are used for
breeding and/or fattening. In recent years, dual-purpose (beef and milk)
enterprises have become increasingly common, with the advantage of ensuring a
more even cash flow resulting from milk sales. These farms now number almost
15 percent of the total. Only 63 specialized dairies are in operation.
29.       Animal Health.  Although disease is an important limitation to herd
performance, poor husbandry is the dominant factor causing the generally poor
condition and low reproductivity of much of the herd. Husbandry problems
include low levels of nutrition, haphazard parasite control and poor herd
selection. Production losses occur from brucellosis, tick-borne organisms
and internal parasites in young animals. The country is free of foot-and-
mouth disease.
30.       Beef Marketing and Processing.  The domestic market absorbs about
90 percent of the annual beef off-take of some 220,000 head. Most of the
slaughter at the village level is done at some 300 rudimentary facilities.
Larger towns and cities are served by nine commercial slaughterhouses. Plant
and equipment is generally obsolete, not properly maintained and deficient in
sanitary standards. Demand for edible offal is high, but facilities are not
adequate for proper processing of by-products. Per capita consumption of
beef and offal rose about 1 percent annually during the 1970s to a current
level of some 20 kg.
31.       The Government's overall strategy for consumer protection has
comprised the control of producer, wholesale and retail beef prices, and the
limitation of beef export, through export quotas. These controls resulted in
disincentives for investment in livestock. As part of the Government's new
economic policy, restrictions on exports and on the price of expensive cuts
have been lifted, which will largely liberalize the marketing of beef and
stimulate production. Liberalization of exports will tend to decontrol beef
prices.
32.       Export quality beef is processed by three modern packing plants for
sale abroad and to high income consumers. Two of the plants are in Chiriqui
and one in Azuero. Only one of these plants possesses a U.S. sanitary
certificate. Annual beef exports are currently some 1,500 tons of boneless
beef. However, the recent lifting of export restrictions should encourage
increased production and exports.
33.       Milk Production and Marketing.  In contrast to the slow development
of the beef industry, milk output expanded by a 2.6 percent annually during
the 1970s. In 1981, total milk output reached 91.2 million liters, up from
71.7 million liters in 1971. Dual-purpose operations producing meat and milk
from the same herd produce 88 percent of the milk in Panama.
34.       Overall milk processing capacity utilization is about 60 percent of
that installed. One plant alone supplies about 85 percent of the pasteurized
liquid milk market. Until recently the Government had established two milk
grades at the producer level and fixed the price to be paid to producers



- 9 -
accordingly (Grade A and an Industrial Grade). Producers qualify for either
in accordance with on-farm production facilities and Grades are based on set
minimum butterfat content and hygiene standards. Industrial grade milk is
intended for processed products. However, processors mix much of the lower
grade with imported dried milk to form a consumer Grade A blend. Law 60 of
1977 established an intermediate classification, Grade B, with certain
requirements of hygiene to I'e met and a price four cents per liter higher
than the one for the industrial quality milk. This price differential has
not been enforced and milk processors do not pay producers the higher price
for this grade. The enforcement of Law 60, which would result in raising the
price paid to the producer for Grade B, is necessary for providing the
incentive for further dairy development and ensuring an adequate supply of
good quality milk. The Ministry of Health is currently undertaking a program
for the enforcement of milk grading, which will enter into effect at the end
of 1983. Implementation of the scheme for payment by milk processors to
producers for Grade B milk is a special condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan (Section 8.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Bank Participation in the Livestock Subsector
35.       The Government's policy in the agricultural sector is to accelerate
increased efficiency and production. The Bank's operations in the sector
support these aims through provision of credit to farmers, continued policy
dialogue with the Government and technical assistance.
36.       Bank lending to the overall agricultural sector of Panama has
totalled US$41.6 million, starting with Loan 86-PAN in 1953 for US$1.2 mil-
lion for farm machinery. This was followed by Loan 87-PAN of US$0.3 million
for grain silos, Loan 784-PAN for US$3.4 million for fisheries development,
Loan 901-PAN for US$4.7 million for livestock development, Loan 1397-PAN for
US$8.0 million for a second livestock project, Loan 1398-PAN of US$4.9 mil-
lion for the follow-on fisheries development, and Loan 1672-PAN of US$19.0
million for a tropical tree crop development project.
37.       Loan 901-PAN, First Livestock Development Project for US$4.7 mil-
lion, became effective in November 1973 and provided for the organization of
the existing Technical Unit (TU) within BNP. After some initial delays in
securing qualified personnel for the TU, the project financed a total of 340
subloans with an average subloan size of US$25,500. The Project Performance
Audit Report (No. 3727 of December 31, 1981) estimated the overall economic
rate of return at 8 percent compared to the appraisal estimate of 15 per-
cent. Incremental milk production, 7.2 million liters per year, is within 3
percent of appraisal estimate, but increase in beef production reached only
15 percent of the volume expected. This is partly due to the shifting of
relative prices for beef and milk, which favored milk production, higher milk
production per cow and the lower than expected calving and stocking rates on
beef ranches. In addition, the decline in the real prices for beef and milk



- 10 -
experienced during project implementation contributed to a lower rate of
return.
38.       Loan 1397-PAN Second Livestock Development Project for US$8.0 mil-
lion became effective in February 1978 and at the end of 1982 was approxi-
mately 70 percent disbursed. It is expected to be fully committed before the
end of 1983 and disbursed by mid-1984. Bank funds for this project are
channeled through BNP to some 350 livestock farms with an average subloan
size of US$42,000. Under the second project subloan evaluation techniques
were refined, the milk law was revised and the existing TU was strengthened
by adding field supervision and consultant specialists to train staff.
Technical assistance under the project also included a study of cattle and
beef economics, which contributed to the preparation of the proposed
project. Repayment of subloans has been excellent. At the end 1982 only one
percent of subloans was in arrears and over 90 percent of the interest due
was collected on time. However, beef export quotas constituted a
disincentive to proper planning for increased meat production. The
Government has recently abolished these quotas (para. 31).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
39.       The proposed project was prepared by the TU of BNP with assistance
from FAO/Bank Cooperative Program and Bank missions, and was appraised in
December 1982. Negotiations were held in Washington in September 1983. The
Panamanian delegation was led by Mr. Alfonso Guevara, Manager of the
Agricultural Development Division of BNP. The appraisal mission's report,
entitled "Staff Appraisal Report. Panama Third Livestock Project" (No.
4371-PAN, dated October 14, 1983), is being distributed separately. Annex
III contains a supplementary project data sheet.
Project Objectives and Description
40.       The proposed project aims at assisting the Government in making
fuller use of the country's comparative advantage in the livestock
subsector. The objectives of the project include increasing beef production
mainly through improved livestock management methods and liberalizing
official marketing policies; expanding milk production and improving its
quality through on-farm investments and the price structure of the various
qualities; and generating employment opportunities in the rural sector.
41.       The proposed project would consist of:
(a) Subloans for Dual-purpose and Beef Production Operations
(i)   long-term investments to include milking facilities, fencing,
livestock, water systems, pasture improvements, annual crop
production and reforestation on dual-purpose (milk and beef)
and beef production farms;
(ii)   short-term financing for purchasing cattle for fattening in
conjunction with long-term investments; and



- 11 -
(b) Technical Unit (TU)
(i)   training in improved livestock management techniques
consisting of:
(a) local training for TU staff and project beneficiaries;
and
(b) foreign training for TU staff;
(ii)   internationally recruited consulting services to assist TU in
livestock management systems, cattle reproduction efficiency,
project monitoring and evaluation and soil and water conser-
vation; and
(iii)   acquisition of field vehicles and office and technical
equipment.
The project would also provide for the effective implementation of existing
legislation introducing an intermediate milk grade.
Project Implementation
42.       BNP, a successful bank with efficient management, would be the
Borrower. TU, which BNP set up under the first Livestock Project (Loan No.
901-PAN), and which is successfully administering the Second Livestock
Project (Loan No. 1397-PAN), paras. 36 and 38 above, would be responsible for
project implementation. TU is headed by a Project Director who reports to
the Manager of the Agricultural Development Division of BNP. TU would
employ internationally recruited consultants with qualifications and
experience acceptable to the Bank to assist in cattle and pasture management
systems, cattle reproduction efficiency, soil and water conservation and
project monitoring and evaluation (Section 3.05 of the draft Loan
Agreement). The consultants would train TU staff who, in turn, would provide
technical assistance to farmers. The project is expected to be completed by
the end of 1988.
43.       TU staff would visit project farmers periodically (no less than one
visit to every farm in three months), and provide them with necessary advice
in cattle husbandry, improved forage production, veterinary programs and the
improvement of reproductive efficiency.
Lending Arrangements
44.       BNP would relend US$7.8 million equivalent out of the proceeds of
the loan to project farmers, initially in the seven provinces now served by
the Second Livestock Project, but could be expanded to include all of
Panama's nine provinces. The seven provinces are: Cocle, Colon, Chiriqui,
Herrera, Los Santos, Panama and Veraguas. These were selected since BNP has
offices equipped with technical staff in all of them. Lending would extend
to the remaining two provinces of Darien and Bocas del Toro if infrastructure
conditions permit. Demand for credit is expected to be highest in the



- 12 -
Western Pacific watershed and in the areas adjacent to Panama City,
comprising the provinces of Chiriqui, Veraguas, Los Santos, Cocle, Colon and
Panama.
45.       BNP's subloans would bear the same interest rate as BNP charges on
its other loans in the agricultural sector, currently 9 percent per annum
plus a 1 percent per annum technical service fee and a 1 percent commitment
charge   (Section C of Schedule 5 to the draft Loan Agreement).  The current
rate covers BNP's cost of financing and is higher than the projected
inflation rate in the coming few years, which is forecast at 5 percent in
1983 and under 7.5 percent annually between 1984 and 1987. Long-term
subloans, within a maximum of US$250,000 equivalent, would be made to assist
in the financing of beneficiaries' investment plans, acceptable to BNP, for
dual-purpose (milk and beef) and beef production farms and those for more
than US$200,000 would be subject to Bank prior review. Repayment period of
long-term subloans would not exceed 12 years including a grace period of not
more than four years. Short-term subloans would be made to finance the
purchase of cattle for fattening in conjunction with long-term subloans, and
would have a term of up to 24 months with no grace period. These terms and
conditions would be reviewed periodically by the Bank (Section C of Schedule
5 to the draft Loan Agreement). In addition BNP receives from the National
Banking Commission the 3 percent subsidy (para. 24) which would represent its
spread for administering this program. The Government would carry the
foreign exchange risk (Section 3.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
Production and Marketing
46.       Annual milk production on beneficiaries' farms is expected to rise
from 2.5 million liters to 18.5 million liters, and annual beef production on
these farms should rise from 1,000 m tons dressed weight to 3,500 m tons in
year 12, at full development. The annual gross value of incremental
production attributable to the project would be about US$10.5 million.
47.       Increased milk production would replace part of Panama's present
imports (about 37 million liters equivalent of dried milk annually). Demand
is also expected to increase with the forecast 30 percent population growth
by full development in year 12. The higher price to be paid to milk
producers (para. 34) will encourage them to increase production and invest in
improving quality, thus increasing the willingness of milk processors to buy
the local production. Regularity of supply is, in part a function of
supplementary feeding, itself dependent on the relative price of milk and
feed costs, and of the relative price of milk and beef received by
dual-purpose producers from whom most of the additional milk production is
expected. The milk quality depends on investment in on-farm milk plant. The
proposed project addresses these issues through financing on-farm
investments, technical assistance, and enforcement of the scheme for payment
by milk processors to milk producers for Grade B milk.
48.       The incremental beef production would represent only an additional
5.5 percent of national output, and would be directed towards exports, since
domestic demand is already satisfied, and restrictions on exports have been
lifted. The recent abolition of export quotas helps provide a more favorable
climate for producers to invest in production infrastructure.

Project Costs and Financing
49.       Total project costs are estimated at US$25.5 million, including
contingencies. The costs include taxes on imports and equipment totalling
less than one percent of baseline costs. The foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$6.9 million or 27 percent of total project cost. Project
base costs were calculated at mid-1983 prices. Physical contingencies
equivalent to less than one percent of total baseline costs have been added
as 10 percent of the cost of the TU's vehicles and equipment, amounting to
less than US$0.1 million. Price contingencies for local and foreign costs
are included at 8 percent in 1983, 7.5 percent in 1984, 7 percent in 1985 and
6 percent in 1986 and 1987.  Ten man-months of consulting services would be
required, at an estimated cost of US$10,000 per man-month, including travel,
subsistence and other expenses.
50.       The proposed loan of US$9.0 million would finance 35 percent of
total project cost, representing 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs
and approximately 11 percent of the local costs. Financing of local costs is
justified on the grounds of enabling the Bank to make a meaningful contribu-
tion to the project considering the small foreign exchange components. It
also gives the Bank a tool in its policy dialogue with the Government and
demonstrates its interest in furthering the project's objectives. BNP would
provide US$12.9 million equivalent from its own funds and the beneficiaries
would contribute the balance of US$3.6 million equivalent, or 14 percent.
Procurement and Disbursements
51.       Goods, works and services required for all farm subloans,
aggregating an estimated US$20.0 million equivalent, would be procured
through normal commercial channels because of the large variety of items, the
small size of individual lots and the spread of procurement over five years.
Vehicles and equipment for the TU totalling US$0.6 million would be grouped
into packages whenever possible to be procured by local competitive bidding
procedures, which are acceptable to the Bank, since each of them would be too
small for international competitive bidding. All bidding packages and
contracts over US$0.1 million would be subject to the Bank's prior review.
52.       Disbursements would be made against 46 percent of the amount
financed for long term subloans; 100 percent of foreign expenditures for the
purchase of equipment, materials and vehicles for the TU or 90 percent of
total expenditures if locally procurel; and 100 percent of foreign expendi-
tures for consultants and training. Disbursements against subloans would be
made against certified statements of expenditures. Other disbursements would
be fully documented.
Benefits and Risks
53.       The financial rate of return of the project using market prices is
estimated at 16 percent. This includes all project investment and operating
costs whether borne by the beneficiaries or BNP.



- 14 -
54.       The economic rate of return has been estimated at about 19 percent
and is based on directly quantifiable benefits. The following assumptions
were used in the analysis: (a) estimated net increases in milk and beef
production were based on specific investment models; (b) prices for traded
commodities (meat and milk) were based on border prices adjusted for
handling, processing and transportation costs to reach average rarmgate
prices; (c) production costs associated with labor were adjusted to
opportunity cost estimates; family labor was considered to be 90 percent of
the unskilled market price; hired unskilled labor was est-mated at a lower 75
percent of its market prices because of fewer opportunities for productive
activities during off-peak season; (d) other production costs were priced at
local market prices; (e) taxes and other transfers were deieted; (f) the
period of analysis was 15 years; and (g) all investments and recurrent costs
were included.
55.       A sensitivity analysis to test the impact of changes in costs,
benefits, prices and other factors was also made.  Switching value tests
indicate that the rate of return is sensitive to changes in estimates of
gross benefits, operating costs, on-farm investment costs and prices of milk
and beef. The rate of return is relatively insensitive to other items such
as cost of vehicles, equipment, training and recurrent costs. Project gross
benefits could be reduced by 15 percent and the economic rate of return would
still be 12 percent.   The price of beef would have to decline by 30 percent
or the price of milk by 50 percent to get an ERR of 12 percent. The main
factors that could delay project benefits -- institutional problems and
adverse weather -- were also tested, indicating that a delay in benefits of
about two years would be required to cause the ERR to drop to 12 percent,
assuming that cost outlays would occur as planned.
56.       The proposed project, by raising efficiency, quality and output in
the livestock subsector, would help the Government to make fuller use of its
comparative advantage in livestock production through the expansion of the
grass-fed beef cattle industry. This would also enable the achievement of
one of the Government's principal policy goals of accelerating production of
goods for export. Recent pricing policy and trade liberalization changes
have established a more growth-inducive environment. The proposed project,
both directly and through its technical assistance components, will help
farmers to benefit from their environment by means of expanded credit
facilities and improved herd and pasture management. Four hundred and twenty
farm families are expected to receive subloans. The project would also
generate 840 man years of employment annually.
57.       The technical assumptions used in the project are based on actual
achievements on directly sampled farms of beneficiaries of the on-going
Second Livestock Project (Ln. No. 1397-PAN). Since the proposed project is a
continuation of the same strategy with the same TU for project management, no
technical problem is expected. Subloan demand remains strong under the
ongoing project. No adverse environmental risk is foreseen. On the
contrary, the project envisages erosion control on already exploited land.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and BNP, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Panama and the Bank, and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement are being distributed separately. Implementation of
the scheme for payment by milk processors to milk producers for Grade B milk
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Loan Agreement (para.
34). Special conditions of the loan are listed in Section III of Annex III.
0          59.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
60.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan,
