SECOND ON-FARM WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
Background
1.01    The Government of Pakistan (GOP) has included in its Sixth Five-Year
Plan (FY84-88) funding for a project to generally replicate the on-going
On-Farm Water Management Project (OFWM-I - Cr.1163-PAK). The concept for
this type of project evolved from numerous studies and water loss measure-
iments (paras 1.17 and 1.18) which determined that watercourse conveyance
losses are substantial and chak 1/ irrigation efficiencies low. Based on
these findings GOP, with USAID financing, undertook a pilot OFWM project
(FY77-81), followed by the IDA/IFAD assisted OFWM-I project (FY82-84). These
two projects have been highly successful as evidenced by strong GOP, Provin-
cial and farmer support. GOP and the Governments of Punjab, Sind, North West
Frontier Province (NWFP) and Baluchistan have requested IDA assistance in
financing a Second On-Farm Water Management Project (OFWM-II).
1.02    Project preparation was carried out by the National Engineering
Services, Pakistan Ltd. (NESPAK) with funding from the UNDP Project, Invest-
ment Project Preparation in the Water, Agriculture and Energy Sectors
(Pak/81I004) and the Bank as executing agency. Limited input was provided
by international experts in monitoring and evaluation. GOP invited IDA to
appraise the project on the basis of the feasibility report prepared by
NESPAK in August 1984. The appraisal was carried out during September and
October 1984.
Demographic and Physical Features
1.03    Pakistan's population of 92 million is growing at a rate of 3Z per
annum. Per capita income is estimated at US$390 (1983 prices) with
approximately 30% of the population having an income below US$110, which is
the estimated absolute poverty level in Pakistan.
1/ A chak is the lowest order irrigation command covering an average 162 ha
and 35 farm units. The watercourse is the communal irrigation delivery
system within a chak (see map IBRD 18818 - Typical Watercourse Layout).



-2-
1.04    Pakistan has a total land area of 79.6 M ha, of which 40%, or about
31.5 M ha is suitable for crop, range and forest production. Most of the
cultivable land is located in the Indus Plain. The soils of the Indus Plain
are generally deep river alluvium deposits of calcareous nature. About 85%
of the soils' texture is moderately coarse to moderately fine. These soils
are well suited for irrigated agriculture. About 10.9 M ha or 78% of these
soils are Class I or II, which are capable of relatively problem-free
irrigated agricultural production.
1.05    The climate of the Indus Plain is arid to semi-arid and sub-tropical.
Temperature in most areas allows all-year cultivation with maximum tempera-
tures reaching 490C in May and June. Annual precipitation is less than 200
mm over most of the Indus Plain, whereas annual pan evaporation may exceed
1,500 mm, making irrigation a necessity for agricultural production. Even
so, heavy rainfall does occur during the monsoon season causing substantial
flood damage (flood losses in excess of US$1,800 M in 1973 and 1976).
1.06    The Indus River is the main source of irrigation water in Pakistan,
providing about 60% of the irrigation supplies. The remaining crop water
requirements are met from effective rainfall (15%) and groundwater (25%).
1.07    The cultivable commanded area (cca) of the Indus Irrigation System
is about 12.0 M ha. An additional 8.1 M ha of cultivated land receives its
water supply from rainfall (barani), flood moisture (sailaba), isolated
irrigation systems, and groundwater. About 11.3 M ha are range and forest
lands. The remaining 48.1 M ha are made up of deserts, mountains, open
water, and wasteland.
1.08    The average farm size in Pakistan is 5.3 ha.  Approximately
two-thirds of these farms, however, are under 4.1 ha. Of the total 3.76 M
farms, 42% are owner operated, 34% are tenant operated and 24% mixed owner
and tenant operated.
ARtricultural Performance
1.09    Despite its gradually declining relative importance in Pakistan's
economy, agriculture remains the: (a) largest commodity-producing sector;
(b) principal source of income for a majority of the population (almost 55%
of labor force); (c) most important source of exports (about two-thirds);
(d) principal supplier of raw materials for industry; and (e) primary market
for the non-;gricultural sectors.
1.10    The agricultural growth rate decreased from an annual average of 6%
in the 1960s to 2% in the 1970s, in large part because of inappropriate
policies. Following the change in Government in 1977, agricultural policies
improved and growth rates rost to an averagz of 4.4% during FY79-83. A
temporary setback occurred in FY84 because of untimely rains and severe



-3-
insect infestation of the cotton crop. Available information indicates that
agricultural growth in FY85 will be more in line again with recent years.
1.11    Even with the recent significant increases in agricultural produc-
tion, average yields for major field crops in Pakistan remain well below
those of other developing countries. For example, in FY83 the average yield
of wheat was about 1.7 t/ha (Mexico 3.7), of rice 1.7 t/ha (Egypt 3.6), of
cotton lint 0.37 t/ha (Egypt 0.67), of sugarcane 37.1 t/ha (India 57.5) and
of maize 1.3 t/ha (Turkey 2.4). Hence there remains ample opportunity to
further improve Pakistan's agricultural production.
Irrigated Atriculture and Water Management
1.12    The bulk of Pakistan's agricultural production (about 90Z) comes from
irrigated land. Irrigation in the Indus Plain began more than 5,000 years
ago with the Mohenjodaro civilization, with summer floods being diverted to
adjacent lands for the growing of crops. The present system was started in
the late 1800s. Today it comprises the Indus river and its major tributaries,
three major reservoirs (about 18,500 M m3 of conservation storage), 19 bar-
rages/headworks, 43 canal commands, and some 89,000 chaks. The total length
of canals is about 57,200 km, with watercourses, field changels, and field
ditches running another 1.6 M km. Approximately 125,000 M m  of surface water
is diverted annually into this canal system. In addition, about 12,500
p3blic tubewells (TWs) and about 190,000 private TWs pump annually 43,000 M
m of groundwater for irrigation (see Plate I). This system commands about
14.0 M ha.
1.13    Through the years, the increased diversion of surface water for
irrigation has significantly altered the hydrological balance in the Indus
Plain. As a result, the groundwater table has risen to a critical stage over
a large area. 1/ Over the same period, other major issues have emerged in
the delivery of irrigation water and its use. Conveyance of water supplies
in excess of design capacities has placed great stress on the system. This
situation coupled with deferred maintenance has resulted in frequent canal
bank breaches and interrupted service. Overall system irrigation delivery
efficiencics are low. Various studies by WAPDA indicate that about 25Z of
diverted surface supplies are lost before reaching the chaks. The operation
and maintenance (O&M) of watercourses within chaks, which are the respon-
sibility of farmers, have been poor historically, resulting in excessive
delivery losses. The farmers in the mid and tail reaches, therefore,
generally receive less water than their planned share. In short, the
increasingly serious problems of waterlogging and poor water management
1/ Indus Basin Salinity Survey, WAPDA, 1981, indicates that 22% of the Indus
System (about 3.6 M ha) has a groundwater table within 2 m of the lard
surface.

militate against GOP's stated goal of increasing agricultural production
through increased yields.
Government Policy and Bank Group Assistance Strategv
1.14    GOP fully recognizes that the huge investments made thus far in
irrigation infrastructure would be wasted if they are not properly maintained
and rehabilitated. if the efficiency of water delivery and its use is not
improved, and if drainage is not provided to check waterlogging and
associated soil salinity. The water subsector policies pursued under the
Fifth Five-Year Plan (FY79-83) and now being continued under the Sixth
Five-Year Plan (FY84-88) address these issues. The policies grew out of a
UNDP financed Indus Basin Study in the 1970s for which the Bank acted as
executing agency. The study report, Revised Action Program for Irrigated
Agriculture (RAP), recommended numerous policy and institutional improve-
ments, many of which have been adopted by GOP, and placed priority on
drainage, rehabilitation, and water management projects. IDA has supported a
number of projects in these areas including drainage projects such as
Khairpur II (Cr. 648-PAK), Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP)
VI (Cr. 754-PAK), SCARP Mardan (Cr. 877-PAK), Fourth Drainage (Cr. 1375-PAK),
and Left Bank Outfall Drain (Cr. 1532-PAZ); the Irrigation Systems
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1239-PAK); and the OFWM-I and Command Water
Management Projects (Cr. 1163 and 1487-PAK).
1.15    Pakistan's development plans acknowledge that in order to increase
yields and production, investments in drainage, rehabilitation and water
management have to be accompanied by measures to strengthen agricultural
input and support services, to maintain appropriate input and output price
relationships, to strengthen irrigation and agricultural institutions, and to
widen the role of the private sector. The Bank Group has been supporting GOP
efforts to address these needs by financing projects in extension and
research (Punjab Extension Project, Cr. 813-PAK, and Sind Adaptive Research
and Extension Project, Cr. 922-PAK). In addition, through the Fertilizer
Import Credit (Credit 1066-PAZ, fully disbursed) and SAL (Loan 2166/Credit
1255-FAK, fully disbursed) progress has been made in rationalizing agricul-
tural prices and reducing input subsidies on pesticides and fertilizer.
1.16    Despite the policy reforms of recent years and GOP's essentially
correct priorities, a great deal remains to be done if the potential of the
agriculture sector is to be realized and its contribution to exports maxi-
mized. More attention needs to be given to the link between extension and
research, and to coordinating availability of agricultural information,
inputs, marketing, and credit. Of particular irportance will be the achieve-
ment of a balance between further investments in physical infrastructure and
programs to improve the delivery of inputs and services to the farmers. The
proposed OFWM-II project is intended to address one important part of this
agenda, namely the management of a key input (water) at the farm level. It
builds on extensive research in water management, the experience of the USAID



-5-
financed pilot project in the 1970s, and the IDA/IFAD assisted OFWM-I project
(FY82-84).
Water Manazement Research and Investifation
1.17    In 1973, WAPDA undertook a water management research project at the
Mona Reclamation Experiment Station. This project was funded by USAID with
expatriate research staff provided by Colorado State University. Repeated
"inflow-outflow" loss measurements at Mona determined that watercourse con-
veyance losses ranged between 31-57%, with the heaviest losses occurring in
SCARP areas where watercourses had not been adequately remodelled to carry
the additional water provided by publicly operated TWs. A field survey of 40
sample chaks in Punjab and Sind was carrIed out by Mona officials in 1976.
Its results indicated that conveyancq lo3ses in the sample watercourses
ranged between 35-67X, with a weighted mean conveyance loss of about 53%.
The average irrigation efficiency in these chaks was about 42%. 1/
1.18    To further ascertain the irrigation efficiency of chaks, WAPDA, in
the RAP studies, carried out measurements on 61 selected watercourses (Punjab
35, Sind 20, NWFP 5 and Baluchistan 1) during kharif and rabi (wet and dry
seasons) of FY77. The results indicated that: (a) about 40% of the water
entering watercourses was lost before reaching the field; and (b) chak
irrigation efficiencies were 37% for Sind, 42% for Baluchistan, 46% for NWFP,
and 51% for Punjab, with little variation between kharif and rabi. Based on
1973/74 irrigation deliveries, the RAP studies found that at the above
efficiencies, about 49,500 M m3 more water would be required at the water-
course inlet (mogha) to meet crop requirements than at efficiencies of 65%
attainable through watercourse improvements and better OFWM practices.
Another RAP study concluded that the cost of water saved through watercourse
improvements is about 25% of the cost of developing an equivalent volume of
new water supplies. 2/ Hence, water management projects are an efficient
vehicle for supplying additional water to the chronically water-short lands
of the Indus Basin.
Pilot On-Farm Water Management Proiect
1.19    Based upon the findings at Mona, and encouraged by farmer response
to watercourse improvement technologies developed at the station, GOP and
USAID agreed to a five-year (1976-80) nationwide OFWM Pilot Project. An
initial USAID development loan of US$7.5 M was made in FY77. The project was
1/ Chak irrigation efficiency is defined as the ratio of water stored in
the plant root zone to water supplied to the chak.

executed by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Cooperatives through a
Federal Water Management Cell with implementation by OFWM Directorates within
each Provincial Department of Agriculture. An innovative and successful
approach in this project was the provision that farmers would supply all
unskilled labor for construction of civil works. In turn, GOP supplied all
materials, technical assistance, and gave a 50% subsidy for precision land
leveling (PLL). Field work was carried out by teams assigned to the Provin-
cial OFWM Directorates. OFWM training institutes were established at Lahore,
Hyderabad, and Peshawar.
1.20    Civil works construction under the pilot project was ended in
December 1981. At that time, over 1,000 watercourses had been renovated (1OZ
masonry lining with pucca nuccas) and about 28,000 ha had received precision
land leveling. Although there were significant differences between targets
and accomplishments (33% shortfall in watercourse renovation and 85Z in PLL),
GOP and Provincial officials were well satisfied with accomplishments because
of: (a) the pilot nature of the project and numerous "start-up" problems;
(b) farmers' enthusiastic acceptance of the project; (c) increased awareness
in Pakistan of the need for water management; and (d) accomplishments in the
last year of the project which generally equalled those of the preceeding
four years. It had oeen a successful experience of learning by doing.
1.21    The major problems faced by the pilot project included:
Ca) shortage of graduate level personnel;
(b) inadequate facilities at the three training institutes (sub-
sequently Punjab completed a fine new facility at Lahore);
(c) deterioration of improved watercourses due to inadequate
maintenance;
(d) shortage of skilled extension workers;
(e) inadequate funds for procurement of required materials; and
(f) diversion of Provincial Annual Development Program (ADP) funds
to other projects.
OFWM-I Project
1.22    GOP requested IDA's assistance in financing an OFWM program as a
continuation of the pilot project. IDA and the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) agreed to a three year (FY82-84) US$80.0 M
OFWM Project (Cr. 1163-PAK) to be implemented in all four Provinces. The
institutional arrangements were generally the same as for the pilot project.
The civil works program emphasized watercourse renovation and PLL. OFWM-I



-7-
included the following changes to overcome many of the problems of the pilot
project (para 1.21) as well as to introduce some improvements. The project:
(a)  required formal Water Users Associations (WUA) to be organized
and registered under Provincial Ordinances prior to installation
of permanent (pucca) structures. The principal objective of
this action was to improve O&M of renovated watercourses;
(b) provided a civil works imprest account and subaccounts to
facilitate funding of civil works through advances from IDA
and IFAD;
(c) increased masonry lining to 152 of the total length of the
communal section of a watercourse in fresh groundwater (FGW)
areas and 30% in saline groundwater (SGW) areas. This was to
increase water savings and recognized the irretrievable loss of
deep percolated irrigation water in SGW areas;
(d) provided an accelerated program of earthen (katcha) improvement
of watercourses with installation of a limited number of pucca
nuccas in an effort to rapidly increase the area benefitted from
watercourse improvements;
(e) abolished the government subsidy for PLL (except in
Baluchistan);
(f) provided a program for recovery of construction material costs
in Punjab and Sind Provinces (para. 5.15); and
(g) established an O&M Section in Punjab's OFWH Directorate to aid
O&M activities and extension program.
1.23    The OFWM-I project has been very successful as indicated by the level
of civil works accomplishments and acceptance/support of farmers and the
government. As shown in Table 1.1, civil works completed by June 30, 1984,
generally met or exceeded the project targets. The only civil works item not
approaching the target was installation of trickle irrigation demonstration
systems, but recently two of the six systems procured have been installed in
Baluchistan. The project closing date was December 31, 1984. However,
because of farmers enthusiastic response and substantial savings resulting
from (a) lower than expected physical contingencies, (b) smaller than
estimated increases in local material costs, and (c) a 30% devaluation of the
Rupee since appraisal, IDA agreed to GOP's request for a one-year project
extension in June 1984. By the revised closing date (December 31, 1985), a
credit balance of about SDR 2 H may be left undisbursed. While project
evaluation is still in progress, WAPDA-s preliminary evaluation report on the
pilot project (March 1984) indicates that cropping intensities rose about



-8-
2-5Z and yields of rice, wheat and maize about 5-15% in chaks with renovated
watercourses.

1.24    There are, however, several deficiencies in OFWN-I that require
addressing and these include: (a) efficient translation of water savings
into increased agricultural production; (b) improved maintenance of renovated
watercourses by the WUAs; (c) emphasis on a broad range of OFWM practices
- especially at the farm level; (d) improved processing of reimbursement
applications and replenishment of civil works subaccounts; (e) proper project
auditing by GOP and timely submission of audits to IDA; and (f) an improved
evaluation program. The farmers and OFWM officials in Punjab, Sind, and NWFP
have not been satisfied with the accelerated watercourse improvement program.
This dissatisfaction stems from inadequate engineering associated with
installation of the pucca nuccas. In the Indus Plain, Baluchistan's OFWM
Directorate has been carrying out a fully engineered accelerated watercourse
improvement program, and government officials report farmers' acceptance and
satisfaction with this technology.
Status of Watercourse Renovation Program
1.25    OFWM projects offer a good example of a replicable concept.  These
projects have been so well received by the farmers and the merits are so well
demonstrated 1/ that OFWN components are now included in most water subsector
projects. Table 1.2 indicates that such components have been included in at
least ten separate projects, six of which are IDA assisted. As noted in
paras 2.04-2.06, all projects (financed by GOP, GOProvinces and various
donors) are based on similar standards and designs. As of June 30, 1984,
1J Measurements in the report Monitorin2 and Evaluation of On-Farm Water
lanagement Proszram (USAID-assisted), WAPDA (July 1984) indicate that
renovated watercourses reduce conveyance losses by 25 to 40%.



-9-
about 4,600 watercourses or about 5% of those requiring improvement have
been renovated. Plans have been made to renovate another 5,600 under
approved projects, which leaves about 79,000 watercourses without plans for
renovation.

* IDA assisted.
Rationale for IDA Financing
1.26    OFWM-II is considered of high priority for IDA assistance because it
provides an opportunity to consolidate the gains achieved under earlier
projects and to make necessary changes in the program to efficiently trans-
late water savings into increased agricultural production, improve main-
tenance of renovated watercourses, and emphasize a broader range of OFWM
practices (para 1.24). This project would assist the Provinces in sustaining



-10-
the life of improved works and in making the OFWM program an enduring
activity replicable nation-wide. Also, as shown in Table 1.2, a substantial
amount of OFWM work remains as only 4,600 of the 89,000 watercourses in
Pakistan have been renovated through June 30, 1984. While additional OFWM
components may continue to be funded under other projects, it is unlikely
that they would correct thd identified weaknesses. Thus a second
IDA-financed project is required to help the Provinces establish strong
sustainable OFWM programs.
II. THE PROJECT
Description
2.01    The proposed three-year (FY86-88) project would be implemented in
all four Provinces. Its size has been determined by available ADP funding.
Generally, it would be a continuation of the successful OFWN-I Project (paras
1.22-1.24). It would raise agricultural production by increasing the supply
of irrigation water through improved OFWM practices within chaks and by
emphasizing efficient use of saved water. The project would provide civil
works, equipment, technical assistance, training, and supervision and
administration.  It w_cld also strengthen the maintenance of installed civil
works. Cost estimates are in Annex 1.
2.02    The project would cover most of the irrigated districts in Pakistan
(Maps IBRD 18719 to 18722). It would be implemented in all or parts of 19
irrigated districts in Punjab (Sialkot, Gujrat, Mianwali, Khushab, Bhakkar,
Sargodha, Jhang, Faisalabad, Toba Tek Singh, Sheikhupura, Lahore, Kasur,
Sahiwal, Okara, Multan, Vehari, Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, and Rahim Yar
Khan); 11 in Sind (Nawab Shah, Khairpur, Sanghar, Hyderabad, Mirpur Khas,
Jacobahad, Larkana, Dadu, Thatta, Badin, and Shikarpur); nine in NWFP
(Peshawar, Mardan, Swat, Dir, Kohat, Bannu, Mansehra, Abbottabad and Malakand
Agency) and generally all of the irrigated area in 16 districts in
Baluchistan. Areas specifically excluded from this project are those covered
by other projects with OFWM components. They include the:
(a)  IDA supported Rhairpur II (Cr. 648-PAR), SCARP Mardan (Cr.
877-PAM), Fourth Drainage (Cr. 1375-PAM), Command Water Manage-
ment (Cr. 1487-PAK), Left Bank Outfall Drain-Stage I (Cr.
1532-PAK) projects, and the subareas under the SCARP Transition
and Improvement project currently under preparation; and
(b) ADB supported OFWM project--Leiah (Punjab) and Paharpur (NWFP)
areas plus proposed extensions--and North Rohri FGW tubewell
project (Sind), and the Ghotki FGW Tubewell project (Sind)
supported by the Federal Republic of Germany.



-11-
The project does include areas covered by the SCARP VI Project (Cr. 754-PAK)
because provision was not made in that project for financing an OFWM comi-
ponent.
Obiectives
2.03    The project has the following objectives:
(a) increasing agricultural production through effective use of
irrigation water saved by improved OFWM practices;
(b) improving the capability of the Provincial OFWM Directorates to
plan and implement an expanding OiNWM program;
(c) facilitating the coordination and co-operation between the
Provincial OFWM and Extension Directorates, and strengthening
the water management advisory capability of the Extension
Services; and
(d) strengthening farmer participation in WUAs in order to improve
water and non-water input management as well as to ensure ade-
quate maintenance of civil works.
Civil Works (base cost US$39.5 M, including US$13.0 M farmers' contribution)
2.04    The project would provide materials, precast structures, additional
personnel, and equipment for construction of required civil works. Farmers
would provide all unskilled labor. In Punjab, farmers would also provide
masons, whereas the project would provide the masons in the other three
Provinces. Assurances have been obtained from GOP that all civil works would
be designed and constructed in accordance with technical criteria established
in the On-Farm Water Management National Standards for Practices and
Materials, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Cooperatives, GOP, June 1980
(revised), which are satisfactory to IDA and the same used for OFWM-I. Plan-
ning and design of civil works is a continuing activity of the Provincial
OFWM Directorates. Works to be constructed early in the project period
(FY86) will have been planned and designed by field teams in FY85 under
OFWM-I. Hence completion of designs should not be a problem in meeting civil
works targets, even in the initial period of the project. Civil works under
the project include watercourse renovation (with and without lining), water
storage tanks, demonstration plots, and PLL, as well as limited housing,
office space, and rehabilitation of training facilities.
2.05    Watercourse Renovation with Pucca Lining (base cost US$35.4 M).  The
watercourse renovation program is targeted for about 2,400 watercourses. The
technology applied would generally follow that of OFWM-I. The communal
watercourse (sarkali khal) represents about 20% of the watercourse length,



-12-
the remaining 80X being farmer branches. The communal watercourse, which
involves nearly 85Z of the volumetric water conveyance, would be demolished,
realigned and rebuilt with clean compacted soil at the same site (Plate II).
Precast outlets (pucca nuccas, Plate III) would be installed (about one for
each 4 ha command) at junctions to reduce channel deterioration and water
loss, and to improve water control. Because pucca nucca lids occasionally
chip or break, and to facilitate their replacement, all manufacturers would
be required to utilize standard molds approved by the OFWM Directorates.
About four culverts would be installed at major crossings in each water-
course, and check/drop structures and a limited number of buffalo baths would
be installed as required. About 15% of the total length of the communal
watercourse in FGW zones and 30% in SGW zones would be lined with brick
masonry or concrete to reduce water losses and/or deterioration of the chan-
nels. In sandy soils about 30% of the communal watercourse would be lined.
The higher percentage of pucca lining in SGW zones recognizes that deep
percolated water in such areas is irretrievably lost whereas such water in
FGW zones becomes part of groundwater storage available for subsequent
pumpage. The higher lining percentage in sandy soils would reduce excessive
conveyance losses in these reaches. This technology would result in average
estimated savings of about 20% of the water supplied to each chak.
2.06    The following criteria would be used by field teams in determining
the lining percentage and selecting the reaches of communal watercourses to
be lined:
(a)  FGW would be defined as groundwater with less than 1,000 ppm
total dissolved solids (TDS) and SGW with more than 1,000 ppm
TDS in the upper 40 m of the soil profile.  For planning pur-
poses, the Atlas. Soil Salinity Survey, WAPDA, 1979 would be
used in making a generalized determination of FGW and SGW zones.
(b)  Sandy soils would be defined as soils with 70% grain size
greater than 0.2 mm, in the top two meters of the soil profile.
Test results certifying the existence of such soil conditions
would be maintained in the design file for eligible
watercourses.
(c)  Generally, the head reach of the watercourse, having maximum
usage and higher hydraulic head: would be pucca lined. However,
other reaches of a watercourse eligible for pucca lining would
include portions having excessive water losses because of eleva-
tion or soil conditions, having chronic sedimentation problems,
and high traffic areas around villages.
2.07    In selecting watercourses to be renovated preference would be given
to commands with high potential for increased agricultural productivity
(chaks located in SGW areas), and to chaks being cultivated by low income



-13-
farmers with smaller holdings. The following criteria would be used by field
teams in selecting watercourses to be renovated:
(a)  formally organized and registered Water Users Association
(required prior to installing pucca structures); and
(b)  willingness of the water users to improve their own water-
course branches and maintain improvements. Improvements on
farmers' branches and katcha sections of the communal water-
course should be completed prior to communal pucca installation.
Within these criteria, areas would be chosen where groups of five to ten
watercourses could be improved at one time to increase the efficiency of the
field teams and reduce transportation costs. Assurances have been obtained
from GOP and GOProvinces that criteria satisfactory to IDA for determining
the length of watercourse lining and selecting watercourses to be renovated
would be followed.
2.08    Watercourse Renovation Without Pucca Lining (base cost US$0.3 M).
A pilot program for renovating a limited number of watercourses would be
undertaken in Punjab (20 watercourses), Sind (20), and NWFP (10), which would
have the same features as that described in paras 2.05 to 2.07, except no
pucca lining would be provided. This program differs from the accelerated
watercourse improvement program in OFWM-I in that it provides for full design
and engineering. The program is included in OFWM-II to determine the rela-
tive efficiency of this approach. Hence, a rigorous monitoring and evalua-
tion (M&E) program is planned for these pilot watercourses (para 4.16). In
Baluchistan, the OFWN Directorate has constructed fully engineered watercour-
ses without lining in the Indus Plain. They find this less costly approach
successful and acceptable to farmers. Therefore, about 60 watercourses would
be renovated without pucca lining in Baluchistan's Indus Plain.
2.09    Water Storage Tanks (base cost US$0.1 H).  About 70 water storage
tanks would be built in NWFP and Baluchistan to conserve water by increasing
volumetric flows through intermittent and timely releases. Because the
discharge of available water sources in NWFP and Baluchistan is often small,
higher conveyance losses are encountered with direct application of these
low discharges. Construction of tanks has been successful under OFWM-I in
Baluchistan and has also been tested, on a pilot basis, in NWFP. The tanks
would be designed to store about eight to twelve hours of inflow from the
water source. They would be made of brick masonry walls with a bed of plas-
tic sheets on a compacted soil base.
2.10    Demonstration Plots (base cost US$0.4 M). The project would provide
one or more demonstration plots on each renovated watercourse to show farmers
effective ways of utilizing the increased water supply resulting from project
improvements. Under OWWH-I, sites near demonstration plots were selected for
celebrating "Farmer's Day". These lively social functions helped to convey
the demonstration message. Recognizing the benefits of demonstration plots,
the Provinces in OFWM-II intend to increase the plots to 1.2 ha per renovated



-14-
watercourse in NWFP, 0.8 ha in Punjab and 0.4 ha in Sind and Baluchistan.
Demonstrations would cover PLL, proper field layout, land preparation and
irrigation scheduling to better meet crop water requirements. These plots
would also highlight the effectiveness of improved cultural practices and
non-water inputs under proper water management. The project would provide
technical assistance. The OFWM Directorates would supply equipment without
charge for PLL of the plot. Incremental non-water inputs may be supplied by
some of the Provinces. Each Provincial OFWM Directorate would issue
guidelines for establishing and operating the demonstration plots. In
selecting demonstration sites, OFWM Directorates would consider both acces-
sibility and qualification of farmers on whose land the plots would be
located. The farmer associated with the demonstration plot should have the
enthusiasm and resources to carry out the required activities, be willing to
cooperate with other farmers in the watercourse command, be willing to apply
PLL to an additional 0.4 ha or more of land, and provide required inputs for
the additional land with his own funds, so that improved field and delivery
channel layout can be better demonstrated.
2.11    Precision Land Leveling (PLL) (base cost US$3.1 M, fully contributed
by farmers). The technology for PLL under OFWM-II would be the same as under
OFWM-I (e.g. + 60 mm in each basin). There would be no Provincial subsidy,
but the OFWM Directorates would provide assistance to the farmers for survey-
ing, planning, laying out, and inspecting the work. In Punjab, Sind and
NWFP, PLL would be implemented by contractors or farmers using private trac-
tors and renting project scrapers and other project equipment available
through the OFWM Directorates. In Baluchistan, due to the scarcity of
privately owned tractors, the OFWM Directorate would provide tractors and
implements on a rental basis. Rental rates would cover maintenance of the
equipment and would provide an incentive for farmers to adopt this practice.
2.12    Facilities (base cost US$0.2 M).  To allow expansion of the OFWM
program in the more remote areas of Baluchistan, the project would provide
office space and staff housing for two new field teams. It would also
rehabilitate facilities for the OFWM Training Institutes in Sind and NWFP.

Equipment (base cost US$1.4 M)
2.14    The project would provide vehicles, land leveling equipment including
laser controls, and survey and office equipment. Because most of the
vehicles procured under OFWM-I have only recently arrived in Pakistan, a
limited number of additional vehicles would be provided.
Technical Assistance (base cost US$3.0 M)
2.15    Technical assistance to be provided by the project and contracted by
the Federal Water Management Cell includes local supervisory consultants,
expatriate experts, and evaluation assistance (see paras 4.11-4.15 for more
details).
(a) Supervisory Consultants. About 504 man-months (mim) to assist
the Federal Water Management Cell and the Provincial OFWM Direc-
torates in supervising and monitoring progress, quantity and
quality control, and report preparation;
(b)  Expatriate Experts.  A full-time water management specialist
and part-time training and monitoring and evaluation specialists
would be internationally recruited (about 54 m/m); and
Cc) Evaluation Consultants. A qualified local agency would be
appointed to evaluate the project.
Training (base cost US$0.4 M)
2.16    The project would provide additional personnel, equipment and sup-
plies to complement the on-going USAID financed training program. The train-
ing program would emphasize a strengthened curriculum at the Provincial OFWM
Training Institutes (para 1.19) for Extension Service personnel, WUA offi-
cials and OFWM Field Assistants and Inspectors (para 4.05), as well as the
continuing training of other OFWM field personnel. Assurance has been
obtained from GOP that training under the project would be carried out in
accordance with a training program, details of which will be furnished to IDA
not later than December 31, 1985.
Supervision and Administration (base cost US$9.7 M)
2.17    The project would provide 46 field teams in Punjab, 15 in Sind, six
in NWFP and 12 in Baluchistan. In addition, up to four more teams in Punjab
and two in Sind would serve subprojects in the Command Water Management
Project (Cr. 1487-PAK). The project would provide salaries, allowances and
administrative and operating expenses for field teams and support staff in



-16-
the four Provinces, as well as for a small coordinating cell at the Federal
level. Starting in FY86, the Provinces plan to regularize their OFWM Direc-
torates' headquarters and training staff, which henceforth would be funded
under the current budget.
III. PROJECT COST. FINANCING AND PROCUREMENT
Project Cost
3.01    Total project investment cost over the three-year period (FY86-88) is
estimated to be Rs 930.0 M (US$57.8 M), with a foreign exchange component of
about US$8.5 M or 15x. A summary is given in Table 3.1, details are in
Annex 1. Estimates are based on April 1985 prices and include about US$4.7 M
taxes and duties. Project cash cost is estimated to be US$48.5 M and farmer
donated labor for civil works US$9.3 M. The cost of civil works is based on
the most recent unit costs for OFWM-I. The project is highly divisible, and
being a repeater project, the requirements for equipaent, technical assis-
tance, training, and supervision and administration are well known. Hence,
no physical contingencies have been included. Price contingencies are about
7% of base costs in US$ terms according to the estimated annual inflation
rates given in footnote c/ to Table 3.1.

FinancinlR
3.02    The proposed IDA credit of SDR 34.8 M (US$34.5 H) would finance 100%
of the foreign exchange cost and about 74% of the local cash cost or about
79Z of the total cash cost net of taxe& and duties and government procured
vehicles. The farmers would contribute about US$4.5 M or 10% of the total
cash cost net of taxes and duties. GOP and GOProvinces vould finance the
remaining US$9.5 M equivalent from their budgetary resources. Net of duties
and taxes on project items GOP and GOProvinces financing would be about 11%
of the total project cash costi In addition, farmers' donated labor would
amount to about US$9.3 H or about 16% of the total project cost. Approval of
the project PC-Is by ECNEC would be a condition of credit effectiveness. The
proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 3.2; details are in Annex 2.

3.03    To facilitate project financing, GOP would establish a Special
Account in the National Bank of Pakistan (a commercial bank) into which IDA
would advance funds according to standard IDA procedures for such accounts.
All eligible items would be financed through the Special Account. The ini-
tial deposit into the Special Account would be US$3.75 million, representing
IDA's share of approximately four months' project expenditures. Subsequent
replenishments would be made on the basis of applicationA submitted by the
four Provinces a-ad the Federal Cell. Assurances have been obtained from GOP
that the Special Account would be oDerated on terms and conditions satisfac-
tory to IDA.
Disbursements
3.04    The IDA credit would be disbursed for:
(a)  85% of the cost of civil works materials (except cement) and
skilled labor;
(b)  70% of the cost of cement;
(c)  100% of foreign expenditures, 1OOZ of local expenditures
ex-factory, or 75% of other local expenditures for equipment;
(d)  100% of the cost of expatriate consultants; and 90% of the cost
of local supervisory consultants and the monitoring and evalua-
tion program;



-19-
(e) 70Z of the cost of the training program; and
(f) 60% of the salaries and associated costs of field teams, OFWM
support staff, and the Federal Cell.
Disbursements for (a), (b), (e) and (f) would be made against statements of
expenditures (SOE). Supporting documents would be retained by the implement-
ing agencies for review by IDA. Within six months of the date of each reim-
bursement application for civil works, GOP and GOProvinces, assisted by the
supervisory consultants, would verify that watercourse improvements for which
the materials were procured met agreed standards, specifications and
criteria, and that procured materials for which IDA reimbursement had been
made were used for such improvements. Any deviations in quantities or inade-
quacies in construction would be readjusted against subsequent requests for
IDA reimbursement. Disbursements for (c) and (d) would be made against full
documentation. It is anticipated that the final disbursement would be made
by December 31, 1988, about six months after the end of project implementa-
tion. The estimated IDA disbursement schedule is in Annex 3. This schedule
differs from the historical disbursement profile for agricultural projects in
Pakistan (10 years), as it follows that of the OFWM-I project. After a
delayed start, disbursements under OFWM-I accelerated in each consecutive
12-month period, and despite lower than estimated Rupee costs and devaluation
of the Rupee (from 9.9 per US$ at appraisal to over 14 in 1984), the dis-
bursed amount reached SDR 18.91 M (572 of total) by the end of 1984, allowing
a one-year extension of the project period which is expected to absorb most
of the credit balance.
Procurement
3.05    Materials and skilled labor for civil works, equipment, and technical
assistance would be procured under the project.  Procurement methods are
summarized in Table 3.3 and Procurement Schedules are in Annex 9.
3.06    Civil Works.  Materials for civil works to be procured would include
cement, brick, sand, gravel, and precast concrete outlet panels (pucca
nuccas), and limited quantities of reinforcement steel bars, concrete and PVC
pipes and plastic sheets. Procurement of brick, sand, gravel and panels
would be carried out by local competitive bidding (LCB) in Punjab, Sind and
NWFP. Because civil works in Baluchistan are isolated, widely scattered, and
mostly located in tribal areas, procurement of brick, sand, gravel and
precast concrete panels would be carried out through local shopping by com-
paring at least three independent sources. Because of the extremely small
quantities of reinforcement bars, concrete and PVC pipes and plastic sheets,
procurement would also be by comparing at least three independent sources.
Skilled labor would be procured through direct hire. LCB procurements
exceeding US$100,000 would be sent to IDA for prior review.



-20-
3.07    Cement.  Cement for the project (about 90,000 t) would be procured
following GOP and GOProvincial procedures, which are satisfactory to IDA.
Under these procedures each Provincial OFWM Directorate is allocated a cement
quota to meet the civil works targets. The price is set by the government
for all public projects. The OFWM Directorates pick up the cement at the
factories and deliver it to the construction sites.  The same procedures have
been followed in OFWM-I.
3.08    Equipment.  GOP has decided to provide all project vehicles from its
own resources. Laser controls (for land leveling) would be procured by
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines.
The Federal Water Management Cell would coordinate the procurement of such
equipment. Because land leveling equipment, other than laser controls, is
manufactured in each Province and would not attract international suppliers,
these items would be procured separately by each Province using LCB proce-
dures. The aggregate amount of such LCB items would not exceed US$0.1 M.
Because of the relatively small amount of office and survey equipment
required in all four Provinces, these items would be procured following local
shopping procedures. The aggregate amount of such items would not exceed
US$0.4 M.
3.09    Consultants.  Employment of suitably qualified international
advisors, local supervisory consultants, and consultants for project evalua-
tion would be in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency published by
the Bank in August 1981, and would be reviewed by IDA accordingly.
3.10    Assurances have been obtained from GOP and GOProvinces that ICB
procedures for procurement of laser controls, and local procedures for
procuremeat of civil works materials, land leveling, survey, and office
equipment would be satisfactory to IDA, and that government procured vehicles
would be made available not later than March 31, 1986.  In addition, assuran-
ces have been obtained that employment of consultants and a project evalua-
tion agency would be on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.

Accounts and Audits
3.11    Accounting procedures followed by GOP and GOProvinces for the OFWM-I
project are satisfactory. However, consolidated audit reports have not been
submitted to IDA as required. Assurances have been obtained from GOP and
GOProvinces that (i) project accounts would be maintained separately by the
Provincial implementing agencies and consolidated annually by GOP; (ii) these
accounts would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; and
(iii) reports of such auditors would be sent to IDA within six months of the
end of each fiscal year. The audit reports would include an opinion whether
IDA funds disbursed on the basis of statements of expenditure have been used
for the purpose for which they were provided.
IV. PROJECT INPLEMENTATION
Institutional Arrangements
4.01    The project's institutional arrangements would generally replicate
those for OFWM-I. However, these arrangements would be strengthened to
improve O&M of civil works (paras 4.06 and 4.09) and irsrease agricultural



-22-
production through more effective use of saved water by facilitating coor-
dination bet'een the OFWM and Extension programs (para 4.08).  These arrange-
ments include: (a) the Federal Water Management Cell in the Ministry of Food,
Agriculture and Cooperatives to coordinate the project and ensure consistency
with agreed specifications, standards, criteria and procedures; (b) the OFWN
Directorate in each Provincial Department of Agriculture to implement the
project and to supervise the O&M of improved facilities; and (c) Water Users
Associations to provide farmer input into civil works construction, and be
responsible for O&M of completed communal civil works.
4.02    The Federal Water Management Cell (see Plate IV) would be headed by
a Director General reporting to the Additional Secretary in the Ministry of
Food, Agriculture and Cooperatives. This Cell would be responsible for:
(a) coordinating project activities and programs to be implemented in the
Provinces; (b) developing consolidated annual work plans based upon input
from each Provincial OFWM Directorate and submitting them to IDA by April 1
of each year as well as updating the project work plans as required; (c)
preparing consolidated quarterly and annual project progress reports, as well
as a project completion report, and submitting them to IDA within 60 days of
the end of the relevant reporting period; (d) maintaining consolidated
project accounts and monitoring the Special Account (para 3.03); (e) promul-
gating appropriate technical standards; (f) ensuring that completed civil
works meet agreed criteria and specifications; (g) coordinating international
procurement; and (h) arranging for technical assistance. To assist the Cell,
the project would provide supervisory consultants and technical experts
(para 4.11).
4.03    The OFWM Directorate organizations would vary slightly to accommodate
the circumstances in each Province (see Plates V to VIII). These Direc-
torates would be headed by a Director, except in Punjab where it would be a
Director General. The Directors would report to the Provincial Secretary of
Agriculture. The OFWM Directorates would be responsible for: (a) implement-
ing the project; (b) supervising O&M of renovated watercourses; (c) organiz-
ing, registering, assisting and maintaining liaison with WUAs; (d) preparing
annual Provincial project work plans by March 1 of each year as input to the
Provincial ADP and to the Cell's consolidated annual work plans; (e) submit-
ting quarterly and annual progress reports to the Federal Cell within 30 days
of the end of the relevant reporting period; (f) maintaining separate project
accounts (para 3.11); (g) verifying, with the assistance of the supervisory
consultants, the quantity and quality of completed civil works; and (h)
procurement of non ICB equipment and materials. In this project, GOProvinces
have begun to finance salaries and related expenses of administrative and
training staffs in the current budget, whereas in OFWM-I such costs were
funded in the ADP. Several of the Provinces plan to regularize this current
budget funded staff in permanent positions, which would provide greater job
security.



-23-
4.04    Field teams, responsible for carrying out engineering works, would
report to the Deputy Director (Field); however, in Punjab they would report
to the Deputy Director (area coordinator) through an Assistant Director
(Engr.). The 1980 edition (revised) of the publication OFWM National Stand-
ards of Practices and Materials would be the field teams' guide for planning,
designing, laying out and codistructing civil works.
4.05    There would be 79 field teams (46 in Punjab, 15 in Sind, six iu NWFP
and 12 in Baluchistan). The field teams would be similar to those presently
in place for OFWM-I, except about one-third of the Field Assistants (FA) in
Punjab and Sind would be Senior Field Assistants (Grade 9), and in
Baluchistan FAs would be upgraded through training to the position of Field
Inspector (FI). Teams in Punjab and Sind would generally consist of ten
members; one Water Management Specialist/Assistant Director (Team Leader),
three Water Management Officers (two with engineering and one with agricul-
tural training); four Subengineers and two FAs. The field team composition
in NWFP is generally comparable to Punjab and Sind except that only two Water
Management Officers (WMD) and two Subengineers would be provided making for a
seven member team. Because af widely dispersed project sites, Baluchistan's
field teams would be smaller and widely dispersed. These teams would be
limited to five members consisting of one Water Management Specialist (Team
Leader), one Water Management Officer, one Subengineer and two FIs. All
field team leaders would be experienced WHOs. WHOs would be either agricul-
tural engineering or agronomy graduates (BS or MS) with additional training
at the Provincial OFWM Training Institutes. Subengineers would be diploma
holders from engineering institutes as well as Provincial OFWM Training
Institutes. FAs and FIs would be metriculates with specialized training at
the OFWM Training Institutes. Availability of suitable staff is not expected
to be a problem.
4.06    Institutinnal improvements are provided in this project to address
the weaknesses in OFWM-I of: (a) unsatisfactory maintenance of renovated
watercourses; (b) inefficient translation of water savings into increased
agricultural production; and (c) inadequate application of OFWN practices at
the farm level (para 1.24). Specifically to address these deficiencies, the
Water Management Officer (Agriculture) would be assigned responsibility for:
(a) organizing formal WUAs; (b) serving as liaison in the field between the
OFWM Directorates and Extension Services; (c) monitoring the communal water-
course maintenance program of WUAs and taking appropriate action; (d) assist-
ing farmers in planning, introducing and operating simple irrigation prac-
tices on individual farms; (e) scheduling OFWM field teams to carry out OFWN
improvements; and (f) arranging for, and coordinating with Extension Service
personnel, the es.ablishment and operation of demonstration plots, and the
extension program associated with these plots (para 2.10). Each WMO would
have two FAs or FIs to assist him in these responsibilities.
4.07    Extension Service OFWM Responsibilities.  The continuing respon-
sibility in the project area for all non-structural water management services



-24-
and other non-water inputs and services would be with the Extension Services
in the Provincial Departments of Agriculture. It is envisaged that with
passage of time and following completion of major OFWM civil works within
chaks, the Extension Service personnel would gradually assume a greater role
in working directly with WUAs and farmers on maintenance of watercourses,
operation of demonstration plots, and introduction of simple OFWM practices
on individual farms. To develop the Extension Services' capability in the
project area to carry out this expanded role, the project would:
(a) provide specialized training in the Provincial OFWM Training
Institutes for all Agricultural Officers and Field Assistants;
(b) train Subject Matter Specialists in OFWM techniques for each
Training and Visit (T&V) district; and
(c) designate specific Field Assistants to renovated watercourses
for the phased handing over to the Extension Service of water
management responsibilities and liaison with WUAs.
4.08    Coordination between the OFWNM Directorates and Extension Services
would be strengthened by the following means:
(a) Each Provincial Secretary of Agriculture would establish an OFWM
Coordination Committee chaired by him with the Directors of OFWM
and Extension as members. These committees would meet at least
quarterly to resolve issues, as well as strengthen the OFWM
program for the Province; and
(b) the OFWM Directorates would be represented on each District's
Agricultural Extension Technical Committee.
Assurances have been obtained from GOP and GOProvinces on a program (pat-
terned after that in paras 4.07 and 4.08) to strengthen the OFWM related
capability of the Extension Services and to improve coordination between the
Provincial OFWM Directorates and Extension Services that would be satisfac-
tory to IDA.
4.09    Water Users Associations.  This project would continue the policy
that worked well in OFWN-I requiring that formal WUAs would be organized and
registered with the Provincial OFWN Directorates for all chaks with communal
watercourses to be renovated. Organization and registration of WUAs, as
provided by Provincial Ordinances, would be a prerequisite to installing
lining and permanent structures. WUAs would be responsible primarily for
(a) providing required labor for renovating watercourses; and (b) maintenance
of renovated watercourses. However, as provided in the Command Water Manage-
ment Project (Cr. 1487-PAK), WIAs would be encouraged to assume additional
responsibilities including: (a) participating in the development and



-25-
utilization of information obtained from demonstration plots; (b) facilitat-
ing distribution of non-water inputs; (c) advising on water allocation and
distribution within the chak; (d) undertaking OFWM work on watercourse
branches; (e) operating tubewells; aud (f) installing surface drains within
chaks.
4.10    All four Provinces have enacted WUA Ordinances and promulgated
related rules and regulations. These ordinances vary by Province, but in
general they provide for: (a) organizational procedures; (b) membership;
(c) general assembly of users; (d) voting requirements; (e) resolution of
disputes; (f) powers of the Association; and (g) election of a board of
directors along with powers and duties of the board. Provision is also made
for WUAs to organize into a federation along minors, distributaries and
canals. In addition, the Ordinances provide sanctions if an individual
member or Association fails to adequately maintain communal watercourse
improvements. The OFWM Directorates would have the authority to undertake
such maintenance and assess the members or Association for the costs
incurred.
4.11    Technical Assistance.  To strengthen the implementation and monitor-
ing and evaluation capacity of the implementing agencies, the project would
provide about 558 man-months of consultancy services, as well as the services
of a qualified evaluation agency as follows:
(a) 504 man-months of local supervisory consultants (para 4.12);
and
(b)  54 man-months of expatriate experts
- a full-time water management specialist to assist the Federal
Cell and OFWM Directorates in implementing the project,
improve technologies, and strengthen standards;
- a part-time training specialist to assist the OFWM Direc-
torates, specifically the Provincial Training Institutes, in
developing an appropriate curriculum, preparing training
materials, and procuring training equipment and literature;
- a part-time monitoring and evaluation specialist to assist
in project evaluation.
4.12    The project would provide about 504 man-months of supervisory con-
sultants plus supporting staff as follows:

Assistant Accountant               2               72
504
The supervisory consultants would report to the Director General of the
Federal Water Management Cell. However, the team's principal assignment
would be assistance to the Provincial OFWM Directorates. It is anticipated
that the Team Leader, Accountant and associated support staff would be
located in Islamabad. The engineers would be stationed in all four Provinces
(four in Punjab, two Sind, one each in NWMP and Baluchistan). Terms of
reference are in Annex 7. Services to be performed include: (a) review of
plans and designs for civil works to assure compliance with agreed criteria
and standards; (b) review of revised standards as proposed by the Cell; (c)
checking of completed works to determine quality and quantity of works; (d)
reporting to the OFWH Directors on compliance of completed works with agreed
criteria and standards; (e) verifying quantities and acceptable quality of
materials procured and civil works completed; (f) assisting the Cell in the
preparation of consolidated annual work plans, progress and completion
reports; and (g) assisting in procurement activities. Assurance has been
obtained from GOP that supervisory consultants would be appointed by Decem-
ber 31, 1985.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.13    Under the Pilot and OFWM-I projects, monitoring and evaluation are
being carried out by the Proviucial OFWM Directorates and the Watercourse
Monitoring and Evaluation Directorate in WAPDA's Planning Division. This
project would improve the existing arrangements in order to develop an infor-
mation system of greater usefulness to planners and donor agencies, and to
overcome the following deficiencies in the current evaluation program:
(a) measurements of irrigation supplies and conveyances losses did
not fully consider the time of measurement (crop season) or the
variations in deliveries to chaks;
(b) collection of socio-economic data was based on farmer recall;
production data were found inadequate to determine net farm
income;
(c) control watercourses lost their status because many received
OFWM improvements;



-27-
(d) analytical capacity (manpower and equipment) was inadequate to
undertake appropriate evaluation; and
(e) many of the data collected were not required, or were not in the
form needed for evaluation.
4.14    Monitoring of the project's physical and financial aspects would
continue to be carried out by the OFWM Directorates. This would provide
project management with early warning signals regarding current or potential
implementation problems. Each Directorate would have a Deputy Director,
Monitoring and Planning, who would be responsible for data collection and
analysis and preparation of quarterly and annual reports.
4.15    Evaluation would be carried out by a qualified independent local
institution under contract with the Federal Water Management Cell. The
project would provide a part-time expatriate expert (para 4.11) to assist in
this task.
4.16    In OFWM-II, it is proposed to employ a case study approach calling
for intensive monitoring of a limited number of watercourses which represent
the principal cropping patterns within the seven agroclimatic zones .nd the
tank irrigation system in Baluchistan. The program would specifically cover
the pilot watercourse renovation without pucca lining (para 2.08). Even
though problems have been encountered with maintaining the status of the
control watercourses, the proposed program would include a limited control
group representing without project conditions.
4.17    Assurances have been obtained that GOP would furnisb an M&E work
program for IDA review by October 31, 1985, and that a qualified local
evaluation agency satisfactory to IDA would be appointed by March 31, 1986.
In preparing this program, GOP would take into consideration the approach
outlined in para 4.16 and receive assistance from expatriate M&E experts
associated with the Pilot and OFWM-I projects.
Operation and Maintenance
4.18    Civil Works.  WUAs would be responsible for the O&M of the renovated
watercourses. Sanctions have been provided in existing ordinances to ensure
such maintenance (para 4.10). Individual farmers would be responsible for
the O&M of field channels and other improvements such as PLL and storage
tanks. Provincial OFWM Directorates would supply the necessary technical
services to assist the WUAs and farmers in carrying out these O&H respon-
sibilities (para 4.06).
4.19    Vehicle and Equipment Repairs and Service.  The Federal Water Manage-
ment Cell and OFWM Directors would be responsible for the repair and servic-
ing of vehicles and equipment procured under the project. Private workshops
and facilities are adequate in Pakistan for this work.



-28-
Implementation Schedule
4.20    Project implementation is scheduled for three years (see Annex 8,
Implementation Schedule). Procurement of all equipment would be substan-
tially completed during the first year. Most of the OFWM staff is in place.
Staff increases for field teams (from 70 to 79) would be completed during the
first year. Civil works construction is targeted as a time slice of a con-
tinuing program with the ultimate objective of improving all of Pakistan's
89,000 watercourses. Year-round construction of civil works would begin
immediately in FY86, based upon plans and designs completed in FY85 by field
teams associated with the OFWM-I project.
V. PRODUCTION. MARKETING AND PRICES, FARM INCOME AND COST RECOVERY
Apricultural Impact
5.01    General.  Additional irrigation water (about 25 m3/sec) through
reduced conveyance losses in the 2,500 watercourses to be renovated, combined
with other project improvements (precision land leveling, demonstration
plots, better water management), would increase crop yields, cropping inten-
sities and farm incomes in the project area (see para 1.23 for experience
under earlier projects). Farmers would also benefit from: (a) reduced time
and labor for irrigation; (b) easier watercourse maintenance; (c) water
reaching the tail-enders; and (d) fewer disputes over water distribution
within a chak.
5.02    Cropping Intensity.  Six farm models bave been chosen to represent
the project. Rice (Basmati and regular), wheat, cotton, maize, fodder (ber-
seem), pulses and sugarcane are the main crops grown. Present and projected
annual cropping intensities in the six models are given in Table 5.1. Under
present (P) and future without project (WI0) conditions, intensities range
from 83% to about 120%. Increases with the project (W) are estimated to be
6-12%. It is expected that most farmers would use the additional irrigation
water received through the warabundi system to expand their land under major
crops, such as cotton, wheat or rice.

/a  In calculating intensities, sugarcane is treated as an annual crop
and its planting acreage is only counted once.
5.03    Crop Yields.  With improved water management and extension services,
moderate increases in crop yields are expected as follows: rice 5-10%, wheat
6-12%, sugarcane 3-13%, cotton 5-6%, pulses 5-10%, maize 6% and fodder 5%.
Details on crop yields and cropping intensities by farm type are given in
Annex 4, Table 1.
5.04    Production.  As a result of the expected increases in cropping inten-
sities and yields, incremental production (at full development) in the
400,000 ha project area would amount to about 51,000 t of wheat, 12,000 t
of seed cotton, 27,000 t of paddy, 78,000 t of sugarcane, 2,000 t of maize
and 229,000 t of fodder. Table 5.2 shows future with and without project
production of major crops for the four Provinces and the project as a whole.
Including pulses, the value of incremental project production (in constant
FY85 prices; see para 5.13) would be about Rs 280 N (over Rs 485 M in
estimated current prices), of which wheat, cotton and paddy would contribute
Rs 190 M (or about two-thirds).

Farm Income
5.05    Illustrative budgets (in constant FY85 prices) have been prepared for
the six typical farms, which are assumed to be owner-operated. A summary is
given in Table 5.3, details are in Annex 4, Tables 2-8. The budgets show
increases in net production value with the project (at full development)
ranging from about 7% of present in farm model 3 -- Punjab Mixed Cropping,
FGW (5 ha cca) -- to about 17% in farm model 2 -- Punjab Cotton-Wheat, SGW
(6 ha cca). In absolute terms, the increases are between Rs 3,170 per year
in farm model 2 and Rs 890 per year in farm model 6 -- NWFP Mixed Cropping,
FGW (2ha cca). Net income per family workday would rise modestly in five
farm models, while it would remain unchanged in the other.  Net family
benefits would be between about Rs 40 and Rs 320 (depending on farm size)
lower during the five years when repayments of the farmers' share in the cost
of watercourse construction materials are being collected.  As evidenced by
farmers' current demand for watercourse improvements, these financial
benefits, together with the non-quantified benefits (para 5.01), would
provide sufficient incentive for farmers to participate in the project.

Marketin and Prices
5.06    In general, marketing, processing and pricing arrangements for the
project's inputs and outputs are satisfactory and are not expected to put
constraints on achieving its targets. Under the Government's expansion
program, foodgrain storage is being increased. Marketing and processing are
carried out increasingly by the private sector, with varying degrees of
Government intervention in selected areas.
5.07    Currently, about 60% of Pakistan's wheat production is consumed on
the farm. The remainder is sold (directly or through middlemen) to Govern-
ment procurement centers or private wholesalers and millers. Government
procured wheat is sold at the official price to authorized mills. To reduce
regional disparities in open market prices, restriction6 on the transporta-
tion of wheat between provinces have recently been removed. The current
Five-Year Plan projects gradual increases in both domestic consumption and
exports of wheat. Assuming unchanged domestic per capita consumption (121 kg
per year) and some reduction in the present population growth rate of 3%
p.al., incremental domestic demand for wheat would be about 3.6 M tons by
1995, of which total project production would represent 9%. Therefore, tnis
production is expected to find a market.
5.08    Seed cotton is sold either directly or through an intermediary to
ginneries, some of which have underutilized capacity. The larger part of the
ginned cotton is consumed domestically, the rest -- between 230,000 and
320,000 tons in recent years -- is exported by the Pakistan Export Corpora-
tion. A groving domestic and international market for the better quality
cotton varieties should provide a sufficient outlet for the project's produc-
tion.  For instance, an increase of about 13% in exports iy 1995 would absorb
the entire expected lint production.
5.09    About 40-50Z of total paddy production is currently consumed on the
farm, vhile most of the marketable surplus is exported through the Rice
Export Corporation of Pakistan. Producers sell most of tL-.eir surplus paddy
to husking mills, which are primarily privately operated. After two slack
years, exports of Basmati rice reached over 400,000 tons .i3ain in FY84, and
other rice exports rose to 859,000 tons -- exceeding the previous record by
3.5%. With the growth potential of the domestic market and the possibility
of further export gains, marketing the project's production should not pose a
problem. In the unlikely event that domestic demand would not grow at all,
an 8% increase in exports by 1995 would be required to sell the estimated
project output.
5.10    About 25-40% of total sugarcane production (depending on the ratio of
the price of unrefined brown sugar and the procurement price of sugarcane)
is sold to sugar mills, while the balance, net of seed and chewing require-
ments, is absorbed by cottage industries. Until 1983, farmers within



-33-
authorized mill zones had to sell 85% of their output to the mills. Follow-
ing a nearly 30% increase in procurement prices in FY81, which resulted in
record cane and sugar production at a time of depressed international prices,
large domestic sugar stocks accumulated. Therefore, the Government decided
to deregulate the sugar market and to limit its role to maintaining a reserve
stock and supplying "fair price shops" in Baluchistan and other remote areas.
Export prospects are not bright because of current low international prices
and the high cost of production in Pakistan, but the project's production
would be absorbed by increasing domestic demand. To assure the same level of
per capita consumption as at present (about 32 kg of sugar per year), cane
production would have to rise to about 46 M tons by 1995. Project production
would amount to about 9% of the increment.
5.11    Other project outputs -- berseem (fodder), gram, maize -  would
either be consumed on the farm or find a market locally.
5.12    Most agricultural prices are influenced by Government interventions,
although such interventions are being substantially reduced. Since GOP
announced the reorientation of its agricultural price policy in 1980, sub-
sidies on pesticides have been virtually eliminated, and fertilizer prices
have been significantly increased (urea by 38%, DAP by 33%) to reduce the
subsidy burden. With the help of the Agricultural Prices Commission, the
Government has increased crop procurement prices periodically to bring them
more in line with international prices and ensure adequate incentives to
farmers. In keeping with this policy and reflecting depressed world market
prices, the FY85 procurement prices for Basmati and IRRI-6 rice are unchanged
from the year before. GOP has announced only a small increase for
long-staple seed cotton, and sugarcane prices will remain at the FY81 level.
The 9% increase in the price of wheat (the first since FY83) has been jus-
tified by GOP by increased input costs and the need to increase procurement.
As international prices recover, GOP should be ab'le to increase crop prices
again.
5.13    The prices used in the farm budget analysis are shown in Annex 6,
Table 1. They are in FY85 values and are based on the latest GOP procurement
and support prices as well as findings of the appraisal mission.
Cost Recovery
5.14    Cost recovery for irrigation and drainage is a central issue in the
Bank's dialogue with GOP and GOProvinces. Under the Commnand Water Management
Project (CWM - Cr. 1487-PAK) GOProvinces reaffirmed their commitment to move
progressively toward full recovery of the cost of 01 of the irrigation
system by the following dates: Sind - July 1, 1988; Punjab - July 1, 1990;
NWFP - July 1, 1991; Baluchistan - July 1, 1992. Sind Province agreed under
the Left Bank Outfall Drain Project (LBOD - Cr. 1532-PAK) on a schedule to
recover the full cost of drainage OM in the project area. In addition to



-34-
paying irrigation water charges, farmers benefiting from this project would
repay a share of the cost of watercourse construction materials. 1/
5.15    GOP and GOProvinces are moving toward greater farmer participation in
the financing of OFWM works. The following is the position by Province on
cost recovery for construction materials under IDA assisted projects:
(a) All Provinces that have a recovery program allow a seven-year
repayment period (including two grace years) for the farmers'
share, and do not charge interest.
(b) Punjab currently requires repayment of 20% of the cost of
materials. 2/ For works carried out under this project, GOPunjab
would raise this share to 25%.
(c) Sind currently requires repayment of 251 of the cost of
materials. 3] For works carried out under this project, GOSind
would raise this share to 30%.
(d) GOBaluchistan requires no repayment under OFWN-I, but agreed to
recover 25% under CWM and would apply the same policy under this
project, except for water storage tanks.
(e) NWFP currently does not recover any cost of materials. However,
in accordance with its commitment under CWN and its participa-
tion in this project, the Province intends to introduce by July
1, 1985, a recovery program for the cost of materials to be
provided under all IDA assisted OFWM projects. jJ The proposed
recovery rate of 10% is satisfactory as a starting point.
Repayment terms would be identical to those in the other
Provinces.
Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the proposed recovery
rates would be put into effect in all four Provinces.
5.16    C-OPunjab has adopted collection procedures and in FY85 will collect
the first repayments for materials used in renovating 380 watercourses under
1/ No recovery is planned of the cost of storage tank construction
materials.
3/ The difference in rates between Punjab and Sind is due to the fact that
Punjab farmers hire the masons while Sind farmers do not.
3/  In addition to this project, the program would cover SCARP Mardan
(Cr. 877-PAK) and CWM.



-35-
OFWM-I during FY82. Expected revenue is about Rs 2.6 M (US$180,000). Since
Sind did not complete renovation of any watercourses in FY82, recoveries will
start there in FY86.
5.17    In present value terms, total investment and incremental O&M costs of
the project would amount to Rs 1,014 M. Farmers would contribute cash and
labor and are expected to assume full responsibility for watercourse O&M
(para 4.18). The cost to Government net of these contributions would have a
present value of Rs 586 M (Table 5.4). Irrigation water charges are levied
per cropped area and vary between crops. Incremental payments by
beneficiaries due to the expected increases in cropping intensities would
produce Rs 23 M. In addition, farmers would repay an increased share of the
cost of materials, which would bring the present value of total direct
recoveries to Rs 84 M, or about 14Z of that of net cost to Government. An
additional portion of Government costs, which has not been quantified because
of the uncertainties involved but may be considerable, would be recovered
indirectly through taxation of the project's incremental production.

VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Production and Employment
6.01    The project would raise crop production and farm incomes through
improvements in the water regime on about 400,000 ha. Nearly 90,000 farm
families, or about 540,000 people, would directly benefit. Their present
annual per capita incomes of between US$130 and US$240 equivalent compare



-36-
with a per capita GNP of US$390 (World Bank Atlas 1985). Total farm employ-
ment would reach 30 million man-days per year at full development -- an
increase of 11% over the present situation -- and demand for hired labor
vould more than double to about 2.5 million man-days, providing additional
employment opportunities in the project area.
Environmental Impact
6.02    The project would have a positive impact on the environment.  The
project builds upon existing infrastructure, therefore none of the adverse
effects sometimes associated with development of new infrastructure would be
present. Water management practices would reduce the area of stagnant water
resulting from surface seepage from deteriorated watercourses, buffalo baths,
and road crossings. This would reduce the habitat for mosquitos and decrease
the incidence of malaria. Improved water management would reduce deep per-
colation to the groundwater and offset or delay associated problems of water-
logging and soil salinity. The increased production and related benefits
accruing to project farm families would improve the general well-being of
these beneficiaries. The only detrimental effect, which would be marginal,
would be a reduction in irrigation return flows, which could result in a
slight increase in TDS in the Indus River and its tributaries.
Economic Analysis
6.03    The economic rates of return (IRR) for the four Provincial programs
and the project as a whole are shown in Table 6.1. At a discount rate of
10%, the assumed opportunity cost of capital in Pakistan, the project's
economic net present value would be Rs 519 million (US$33.9 million).
Economic benefits and costs presented in Annex 5 have been valued in constant
FY85 terms. The main assumptions made in the analysis are as follows:
(a) Project Life: Twenty years, with full development reached in
project year 10 (FY95).
(b) Prices: Farmgate prices for internationally traded goods are
based on the World Bank's commodity price forecasts, while those
for non-traded goods are based on domestic financial prices
(Annex 6). For all main outputs export parity prices have been
used, because Pakistan is expected to become either an exporter
of (wheat) or self-sufficient in (maize, sugar) those which are
not currently exported. Import parity prices have been used for
fertilizer. The market wage for unskilled labor has been dis-
counted about 25Z to allow for periods of slack demand. Domes-
tic prices and price components have been translated into border
prices through the application of a standard conversion factor
of 0.9.



-37-
(c) Proiect Costs: All investment costs and incremental O&M costs
have been taken into account. The cost of the Federal Water
Management Cell has been distributed proportionately over the
four Provincial programs. The estimates are net of taxes and
duties and allowances for inflation. Local costs have been
expressed in border Rupees by applying a standard conversion
factor of 0.9.
(d) Project Benefits: Benefits consist of the expected incremental
crop production described in Chapter V. In each group of
improved watercourses, cropping intensities would increase as
soon as additional irrigation water becomes available, and the
yield build-up would take about six years.
Table 6.2: INTERNAL RATES OF RETURN (IRR)
Punjab Program                           21%
Sind Program                             26%
NWFP Program                             15%
Baluchistan Program                      25%
Total Project                            22%
Sensitivity and Risks
6.04    The sensitivity of the project to changes in benefits and costs has
been tested using switching values as a measure. 1j The results show that at
a discount rate of 10% (the assumed opportunity cost of capital) total costs
could rise about 29Z or total benefits fall about 23% from their appraisal
values without making the project economically unacceptable. The acceptable
variations in benefits or costs of individual Provincial programs are
similar, except in the case of NWFP. Details are in Table 6.2. Further
tests show that a two-year lag in benefits would reduce the project's IKR to
12%, and a three-year lag in benefits or a one-year lag in benefits combined
with a 20% increase in costs would decrease it to about 9%.
j/ The switching value is the value of the variable tested for which the
project's net present value is zero, of for which the project's rate of
return (IRR) is equal to the discount rate (usually the opportunity cost
of capital).

6.05    The project would not involve any unusual risks.  Implementation
techniques are well established, as this would be a follow-up to the OFWM
Project (Cr. 1163-PAK) which itself followed generally the Pilot OFWM Project
assisted by USAID. Monitoring results on project benefits are still insuffi-
cient to draw firm conclusions, but on the basis of the data which do exist
it seems unlikely that with the planned improvements in input management and
maintenance of works the relatively modest production increases should not be
achieved within the estimated time.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
