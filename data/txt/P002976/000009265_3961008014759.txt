MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR AN INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
1.     I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Uganda for SDR 25.0 million (US$36.4 million equivalent) on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a project for institutional capacity
building.
Sector Background
2.     Capacity building in Uganda is particularly challenging because the economic mismanagement
and political chaos of the 1970s and the early 1980s in Uganda severely decimated one of the most
respected and effective public administrations in Eastern Africa. With migration, Ugandan human
capacity was further eroded. The National Resistance Movement (NRM) Government assumed power
in January 1986 and capacity building efforts in Uganda commenced in concert with the Economic
Recovery Program through the Civil Service Reform (CSR) program. Recognizing that the lack of
capacity in Uganda could as much be attributed to the lack of sufficient remuneration and proper
incentives as to the absence of skilled staff, GOU began an aggressive effort to increase remuneration
in the Civil Service. The initiative was constrained by the lack of revenue collected by Government
and, of necessity, increasing salaries meant reducing the total complement of staff through
rationalizing Ministerial structures. Capacity Building in Civil Service is discussed in paragraphs 3
and 4 below. Even as the CSR program was being implemented, GOU began a systemic evaluation
of its approach to Technical Assistance which resulted in the Uganda Policy on Technical Assistance,
issued in May 1993 (discussed in paragraph 5 below). GOU also began determining, in addition to the
overall CSR program, the priority areas upon which it should focus and this resulted in the Uganda
Capacity Building Plan published in February 1994 (discussed in paras. 6 to 10 below).
3.     Capacity Building in the Civil Service Reform: As discussed above, the initial attempts at
reform focused on reducing the numbers of part time employees and rationalizing the numbers, roles
and functions of ministries. In October 1990, a policy framework for a comprehensive civil service
reform was presented by the Public Service Review and Reorganization Commission (PSRRC). Its
implementation has so far resulted in: significant real increases in salaries (although salary levels are
still far below a living wage); a reduction in the number of ministries from 38 in 1989 to 21
currently; and the rationalization of ministerial structures to remove duplications and overlaps as well
as to reduce encroachment on the private sector. Significant progress has also been achieved in
reducing staff from 1990 payroll payments of 320,000 employees to some 148,000 as of December
1994. Despite the substantial achievements, the following issues need to be addressed: continuing
insufficiency of remuneration i.e. pay and benefits (including non-monetary benefits) and major
design weaknesses in the current pay and grading system; insufficient management and supervisory
skills; inadequate personnel management and training; lack of a Code of Conduct for Civil Servants;
and inadequate facilities management and lack of a maintenance culture.
4.     Decentralization: Efforts to build capacity in the Civil Service have been extended to local
governments due to the Government's decentralization program. Political decentralization was



introduced, beginning in 1987, through the Resistance Council (RC) system which consists of a
hierarchical structure of Councils and Committees. After considerable study over the next several
years, decentralization of administrative authorities and responsibilities to match the RC structure was
approved through the Local Governments (Resistance Councils) Statute of November 1993. The
implementation of this Statute will result in Central Government functions being reduced to policy
formulation, planning, inspection and the management of national programs with all other services
being provided at or below the District level. The implementation of the reform is well underway
and the commitment of Central and local Governments to its implementation is evident. Personnel
decentralization is being undertaken immediately. Financial decentralization is being implemented in
a phased manner: (a) the recurrent budget is being decentralized first; (b) there is a phasing of
districts (thirteen districts beginning in 1993/94, fourteen districts in 1994/95 and twelve districts in
1995/96); and (c) implementation is in two stages i.e. in the first year there is only a transfer of
control over line item expenditures followed in the second year with decision making on budget
priorities. Successful implementation of the decentralization program is likely to remain extremely
challenging because of shortcomings in resources and human capacities in the local governments.
5.     Uganda Policy on Technical Assistance: The Uganda Policy on Technical Assistance (TA)
was prepared by GOU as part of a UNDP funded National Capacity Planning exercise. The report
notes that the majority of the free standing TA has so far been in the form of "small disjointed project
interventions that usually have little impact on the overall economic performance". Consequently, the
new policy defines a process which would: (a) at first, ensure that TA priorities meshed with national
plan and budget priorities and, later, include TA projects as part of the budgeting process; (b) ensure
that GOU takes the lead in project identification and that all TA projects are channelled through the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP); (c) focus on the motivation of nationals and on
the provision of an enabling environment specifically in the civil service; (d) follow a country
program approach as opposed to a project approach; (e) use national execution by Government as the
primary modality for implementing TA projects supplemented by use of local consultants and
expatriate nationals. Use of long term expatriate advisors would be reduced to the minimum
necessary with an increase in the use of short-term consultants, where necessary; and (f) TA would no
longer focus only on the public sector but could be extended to the private sector (including non-
governmental organizations).
6.     Uganda Capacity Building Plan: The preparation of the CBP was preceded in 1990 by a
comprehensive sector report on Capacity Building prepared by the Ugandan Government and IDA
together with the participation of a number of other donor agencies concerned with capacity building
in Uganda. In 1991, Government set up a Capacity Building Secretariat (CBS) in the Ministry of
Planning and Economic Development (now merged into the new Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning). While being organizationally within one Ministry, the CBS had participation from a
number of key ministries, the private sector and the major training and higher educational institutions
in the country. The CBS commissioned various local consultancies to study a range of options and
possibilities which formed background papers for the development of a Capacity Building Plan for
Uganda. From the total program identified in the plan, IDA focused its assistance towards three key
areas i.e. the legal, accountancy and training sectors as discussed in paras 7 to 9 below.
7.    Legal Sector: The Constitution of Uganda and the Judicature Act of 1967 constitute the
foundation of the Ugandan legal system as it exists today. The Act provides for the continued
application of the received English law in Uganda and its coexistence with customary law. There are
two major weaknesses: the legal framework and in the institutions. Laws which affect business,
industry and private sector development are in dire need of modernization. The problem of outdated



- 3 -
laws has been exacerbated by the absence of timely and rigorous enforcement of these laws due to
weaknesses in the major institutions in the sector which are caused by: insufficient staffing of
lawyers, paralegal and secretarial staff; outdated office equipment and technology and the lack of
proper office facilities; absence of in-service and other training programs; absence of easily available
documentation with regard to the Laws of Uganda and the latest Court decisions; and lack of office
supplies. So far, the Government has been able to address the problems only on a limited basis.
Donor assistance has been mostly confined to the provision of office equipment, vehicles and books,
the upgrading of selected physical facilities, especially courts, and the supply of expatriate technical
assistance to fill vacancies. Recently, the Government has increased salaries of lawyers in the Civil
Service to living standards which should provide a major impetus to improving the quality of staffing
in the sector.
8.     Weaknesses in Financial Accountability Framework and Institutions: Uganda has a very small
accounting profession, with fewer than 100 professionally qualified accountants and a similarly
serious shortage of accounting technicians. The demand for accountants is very high, but most
accounting jobs are filled by staff with no formal accounting qualifications. As a result of the
mismatch between supply and demand, there is a heavy demand for accounting education in Uganda
and the only accounting courses currently offered in the public sector are heavily oversubscribed.
The only professional accounting qualification available to Ugandans are foreign ones: i.e. a Kenyan
Certified Public Accountancy qualification or a UK qualification. The Accountants Statute was passed
in 1992 to organize the profession and introduce a local professional examination. Implementation
had been mired in disputes between professional accountants and practicing accountants as to who
should lead the profession. This has now been resolved and implementation of the Statute has
commenced.
9.     Weaknesses in Local Training Institutions: Training of Civil Service staff has in the past been
undertaken in an ad hoc manner. There has been no overall training plan for GOU staff and a large
proportion of the training has been undertaken through donor funding, often in the context of specific
projects. Further, the past approach to the improvement of delivery of training in Uganda has
focused upon improving the available supply of training. Specific institutions were chosen and
assisted, primarily by donors, through provision of: civil works, equipment and technical assistance
(including twinning arrangements), overseas training and study tours. This approach had two main
shortcomings. First, public and private sector entities, which constitute the demand for training, have
had only a marginal input into the structure of courses being provided by the training institutions.
Hence, the available local supply of training determined the demand for local training rather than the
demand for training determining the supply of training. Second, other than the few institutions
supported by donor funding, there was no broad based development of local training institutions since
there was no functioning market for matching demand and supply of training.
Project Objectives
10.    The objectives of the project are to establish greater local institutional and human capacity to
develop and implement public policy and support the growth of the private sector through: (a) support
for the continuation of the Civil Service Reform; (b) assistance to the Government of Uganda in its
decentralization program; and (c) strengthening the legal and financial accountability framework and
institutions.

Project Description
11.   The project will consist of five components: central and local government capacity building,
legal sector reform and accountancy strengthening, and training.
12.    Central Government Capacity Building Component ($6.62 million): Support to the Civil
Service Reform program which is currently being provided through the Economic and Financial
Management (EFM) Project (Cr. 2418-UG) would continue by: assisting streamlining of the civil
service, improving the transparency of personnel management and focusing the civil service on
efficient and effective service delivery.
13.   Support to the streamlining of the civil service would be provided at two levels. First, the
overall program being managed through the Ministry of Public Service would be supported especially
in the areas of: (a) improving central personnel management systems; and (b) undertaking a civil-
service-wide classification of personnel from the perspective of identifying candidates for termination
as a result of restructuring/redundancy activities. Second, at the level of the individual ministries, (a)
the implementation of the Ministerial Reviews (which are the restructuring plans for those ministries)
would be supported; and (b) ministry level personnel management functions would be strengthened.
Transparency of personnel administration would be improved. Specifically, improved personnel
management practices would be established. A new salary structure would be put in place by July
1996. Other key activities would include: establishment of civil service examinations, development of
a performance recognition system, and revision and issuance of new Standing Orders. To support the
move towards greater transparency and accountability, all Civil Servants will be expected to adhere to
a new Code of Conduct which would be developed and issued by July 1996. To ensure compliance
with the new procedures, the MPS Department of Inspection would be strengthened primarily through
development of inspection procedures and staff training.
14.   Results Oriented Management (ROM) which focuses civil servants on service delivery through
the achievement of definite objectives within specified time targets will be introduced. A baseline
service delivery survey would be carried out to establish the reference point of measurement;
separately specific performance standards for each Ministry would be defined. From FY97, ROM
would be introduced into GOU budgeting processes including annual measurements and evaluation
against the goals.
15.   The focus on efficiency will come through improvement in two important support services
underlying service delivery i.e. facilities management and records management. For facilities
management, a study would be undertaken to recommend better policies for the management of
physical facilities i.e. buildings, physical plant and equipment. Taking into account the findings of
this study, GOU would introduce the new facilities management policies in its budgeting processes
commnencing from FY98. The study would also review the utilization of Ugandan Government
physical facilities abroad, and recommend the optimal size of such facilities and approaches to
managing them. The Records Management assistance provided under the project would complement
ongoing activities being undertaken through ODA funding; staff training would be provided and the
establishment of a National Records Centre assisted.
16.   Local Government Capacity Building ($12.74 million): This component would continue the
process of assisting local governments to improve their abilities to manage and administer
responsibilities entrusted to them. It would complement assistance already being provided by
DANIDA. The assistance would be phased in line with the phasing of Government's decentralization



- 5 -
program. The project would assist in implementation of the agreed changes in the system of inter-
governmental finance and develop implementation plans for future changes to be implemented
including: studying and making recommendations for decentralization of the development budget by
June 1996; and proposing establishment, capitalization and management of a revolving development
fund by June 1996. Phased decentralization of the development budget would commence from July
1997. Simultaneously, the process of strengthening financial and personnel management structures,
systems and procedures would continue. The credit would also support training in: planning, basic
computer skills and records management. A substantial portion of other training (sensitization and
skills development) would be undertaken through DANIDA funding and from the EFM Project.
Finally, the credit would support the introduction of Results Oriented Management into local
government budgeting procedures by FY97 at the district level in a manner similar to that envisaged
for the Central Ministries (see para 14 above).
17.   The credit would support physical retooling. The basic improvements required to establish a
reasonable level of physical infrastructure for the district administrations would be financed. This
would consist of refurbishing building exteriors and interiors, making windows burglar proof, etc.
The end product would be modest offices out of which District Administrations could operate.
Essential inputs (e.g. office, computing equipment and furnishings) would also be provided.
18.   The project would also provide modest financing for the transportation needs of districts
related to revenue collection and monitoring and supervising district-wide activities. The cost of the
vehicles would be completely recovered from the districts over a five year repayment period and
deposited into a Revolving Fund dedicated for purchase of vehicles. The cost recovery approach is
expected to encourage the districts to choose the lowest cost solutions for their needs.
19.   Legal Sector Reform Component ($8.24 million): This component would focus upon the
commercial aspects of law and on the settlement of civil disputes.
20.    The project would fund a study to evaluate the existing status of legal education in Uganda
with a view to finding ways and means of making it more relevant and responsive to the changing
conditions in the country. Currently, the system of legal education is based on the Report of the
Gower Commission (1969). All prospective lawyers in Uganda have to undergo training in
professional skills (after completing the substantive study of law) for a period of one year at the Law
Development Centre (LDC) which limits its intake of students to sixty per year. LDC has also been
unable to dedicate any significant level of resources to Continuing Legal Education (CLE) for the
profession and this situation has been exacerbated by the absence of any mandatory requirements for
CLE for lawyers as a requirement to maintain their ability to continue in practice. Upon completion
of the study, GOU would issue its Policy on Legal Education.
21.    Law revision (i.e. the process of consolidating various Laws of Uganda into a series of
volumes) would be undertaken through parallel donor financing; USAID would fund the consolidation
of laws and ODA would fund the printing of the laws. Law reform (i.e. the amendment of specific
laws from the perspective of modernizing these laws within the socio-economic context prevalent in
Uganda) would be financed through the credit to help the Government remove impediments to GOU's
stated objective of making the private sector the focal point for growth in the economy. Draft laws
would be presented to the legislature by July 1996. Assistance would also be provided in reforming
the Domestic Relations laws which primarily impact on the rights of women and have bearing on the
position and treatment of women within society and their ability to engage independently in



- 6 -
constructive commercial/economic activity. The draft Domestic Relationis law would be presented to
the legislature by December 1996.
22.    The Ugandan legal system is based on common law which has a legal theory that is deeply
rooted in the precedent system. The main series of Uganda Law Reports is presently out of
production; the backlog dates back to 1958 although between 1971-1973 three volumes were produced
which are also currently out of print. The preparation and publication of Law Reports would be
supported and the backlog of over three decades would be removed.
23.   Institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs (MJCA) and
the Judiciary would be undertaken by providing: substantial staff training; access to legal information,
i.e. law books; updated and revised Laws of Uganda; the latest case law, as embodied in the Uganda
Law Reports; and access to inputs necessary to accomplish the job.
24.   Increased cost recovery for services delivered by the legal sector would be piloted
conmnencing with two Departments which are being devolved from the MJCA i.e. the Administrator-
General's Department (AG), which administers deceased persons and insolvent estates and acts as the
Public Trustee for minors and legally incapacitated persons; and the Registrar-General's Department
(RG), which registers all businesses and companies, births, deaths, etc, and intellectual property such
as patents, copyrights and trademarks. Both departments already partially recover the cost of service
provision and have considerable scope to improve service delivery outside Kampala. Studies are
being conducted to examine the modalities for the establishment of the new entities, improving service
delivery through streamlining (e.g. computerization of systems and delegating service delivery) and
improving cost recovery. On the basis of these studies, three year Business Plans would be prepared
for both entities.
25.    Accountancv Strengthening Component ($0.98 million): The component would support the
accountancy profession by: (a) assisting the Institute of Certified Public Accountants to commence
operations and fulfil its statutory functions, including issuance by June 1998, of local accounting and
auditing standards in a phased manner; (b) developing a local professional qualification and associated
examination, with the first examination being held by June 1997; and (c) undertaking training for
Continuing Professional Education of accountants.
26.    7raining Funds Component ($7.02 million): This component will help pilot a system to:
(a) establish a demand based approach to improving the quality of training in implementation skills;
and (b) improve the quality of training institutions supplying training in implementation skills. The
component's objectives would be met through the establishment of two separate training funds. The
first fund (the Public Sector and Private Sector Matching Grant Fund) would acquire competitively,
from the local market, the training requirements of public and private sector institutions. Cost
sharing is expected; 10 per cent of the cost of training from public and 50 per cent from the private
sector respectively. The second fund (the Training Suppliers' Strengthening Fund) would be available
to selectively identified weak training institutions which have potential. Their strengthening would be
assisted on a cost sharing basis for staff training (90 per cent funding), acquisition of study materials
(50 per cent funding) and equipment (25 per cent funding).
Project Costs
27.    The program cost is estimated at US$42.19 million equivalent (U Sh 39 billion) inclusive of
$1.85 million of taxes and duties. The foreign exchange component of the program is estimated at



- 7 -
44% of the total cost. Base cost estimates, US$36.29 million are in August 1994 prices. Physical
contingencies on the project are estimated at US$2.91 million (8% of project costs). Price
contingencies are estimated at US$2.99 million (8% of project costs); for foreign costs, the Unit
Value Index of Manufactured Exports (MUV Index) of 2.2 per cent has been utilized and for local
costs, projected local inflation rates have been utilized. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement, disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. The key processing events are shown in Schedule
C and the status of Bank Group operations are shown in Schedule D. The Staff Appraisal Report
(13610-UG) is being distributed separately.
Project Financing
28.   The proposed IDA credit of US$36.35 million equivalent will finance 90% of project costs
net of duties and taxes; of this, US$1.11 million would be provided by GOU to the ICPAU to
implement the Accountancy Strengthening component. The local contribution provided directly by
Government will be for an estimated amount of US$4.88 million. In addition, the private sector will
share in the costs of the training funds component by contributing $0.96 million. There are also
several donor initiatives which will run parallel to this project and for which close coordination is
being undertaken. DANIDA has projects which support the Government's decentralization program
and also a project to provide support to the judiciary. ODA has programs supporting the judiciary,
records management in the Central Government and is committed to funding printing of the Revised
Laws of Uganda. UNDP will finance some elements of the Civil Service Reform Program and is
preparing a project for building capacity of Community Based Groups. USAID plans to finance the
law revision activities which will constitute preparation of the Revised Laws of Uganda.
Project Implementation
29.    The overall management for implementation and supervision of the project will be the
responsibility of the Project Steering Committee (PSC), which is to be established within sixty days of
credit effectiveness. The PSC will be chaired by the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to the Treasury,
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and also consist of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of
Local Government; Permanent Secretary/Solicitor General; Secretary to the Administrative Reform
Commission, Ministry of Public Service; and the President of the Institute of Certified Public
Accountants of Uganda. A working level Technical Committee which has been established for project
preparation will continue to remain responsible for project implementation and will report to the PSC.
The Technical Committee would be chaired by the GOU Task Manager and its membership would
consist of the Component Managers for all five components who will be responsible for supervising
the substantive aspects of the project. The Capacity Building Secretariat (CBS) in the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning will provide the administrative support for the project. A Project
Administration Group would also be established and trained within the Ministry of Local Government
with the objective of developing a capacity within that Ministry to manage, inter alia, future district
level projects and disseminate good procurement practices in the districts.
Project Sustainability
30.   The project is expected to be sustainable since it supports and is consistent with GOU policy
and legal frameworks for the sectors concerned. The overarching policy framework within which the
project is set is the GOU Policy on Technical Assistance and the GOU Capacity Building Plan.
Further: (a) the Central Government Capacity Building component supports GOU's Civil Service



- 8 -
Reform program which was defined by the Public Sector Review and Reorganization Commission
(PSRRC) and for which an administrative structure has been in place for a few years now; (b) the
Local Government Capacity Building component supports GOU's decentralization program as enacted
in the Local Governments (Resistance Councils) Statute of November 1993 and for which also an
administrative structure has been is in place; and (c) the Accountancy Strengthening component
supports implementation of the Accountants Statute of 1992.
Lessons from Previous IDA Experience
31.   IDA's Second Technical Assistance Project (FY84-92) and Third Technical Assistance Project
(FY87-94) had as their prime objectives the strengthening of the core agencies of Government, the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development and the Central Bank.
There were some important lessons learned from these two successful technical assistance projects
which were incorporated into the follow-on Economic and Financial Management Credit (FY93):
subprojects/interventions were targeted to areas closely coupled with the ongoing reform effort and
were in some cases upstream sector work for further reform efforts; and TA was designed and
implemented with utmost flexibility, consistent with the Development Credit Agreement, which
required greater amounts of supervision. The approach utilized in the proposed project for the
upstream activities which precede project preparation is similar to the successful approach under the
earlier projects. First, the upstream sector work was undertaken at an early stage and in a
collaborative manner with GOU and other interested donors. Second, the problems/issues identified
were prioritized into key areas to be addressed in the process of developing the Capacity Building
Plan. From the overall list of GOU's priorities, IDA selected a few areas of assistance. While
building upon the successful accomplishments of the past projects, the project's emphasis has shifted
for two reasons. First, the focus has shifted from addressing areas requiring immediate improvement
to strengthening local institutions/building capacity for the future. Second, given the decentralization
of activities to the district level, the project has expanded its focus to include local governments.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
32.    The project is closely linked with the objectives of the Bank Group Country Assistance
Strategy (being presented together with this Project to the Executive Directors) which is to help
the country reduce poverty by: (a) maximizing labor-intensive economic growth; (b) strengthening
economic and social infrastructure; (c) supporting human resource development; and (d) enhancing
provision of public services with emphasis on ensuring that these services reach the poor and
vulnerable groups. The strategy is designed to be both gender and environmentally sensitive and is
consistent with the maintenance of macroeconomic stability.
33.    The project focuses on the key areas of the Country Strategy i.e. enhancing the provision of
public services, supporting human resource development through capacity building and improving
economic growth. As capacity building is being extended to local governments at the district level
and below, this is likely to improve resource mobilization and management and consequently enhance
service delivery at the level at wlhich most of the population (and the poor) live in Uganda. The
project's secondary focus is on developing the legal and financial accountability frameworks for
public and private sector development. The focus on training in implementation skills would also
contribute towards raising the standards of public administration while supporting the development of
stronger private sector institutions.

b. The following are the conditions of disbursement: (i) for the entire legal sector component
GOU furnishing a statement defining its Policy on Legal Education; (ii) for the offices of
the Administrator-General and Registrar General - the provision of a satisfactory business
plan covering at least the first three years of operation; (iii) for the Training Funds
component - agreement between GOU and IDA that : (a) the CBS staff have demonstrated
capability to implement the Training Funds component through (i) participation in the
preparation and implementation of at least two rounds of training under the Central or Local
Government Capacity Building components and (ii) satisfactory management of at least one
round of training under the Legal Sector Reform or Accountancy Strengthening components;
and (b) the detailed guidelines in the Implementation Manual pertaining to the
implementation of the Training Fund component have been reviewed and, if warranted by
the review, amended in the light of experience; (iv) for the Accountancy component - (a)
appointment of the Secretary of the ICPAU; (b) the Council of the ICPAU would have
furnished to IDA a satisfactory business plan covering at least the first three years of
operation; (c) GOU and the ICPAU would have concluded the Subsidiary Grant Agreement.
Environmental Impact
35.    The project is rated as Category C since its objectives and implementation will not have any
direct impact on the environment.
Program Objective Categories
36.    The program objective categories are economic management (primary emphasis) and private
sector development (secondary emphasis). The reform of domestic relations law would also have an
impact on women in development issues in Uganda.
Participatory Approach
37.    The involvement of the Ugandan counterparts in all aspects of project processing has been an
integral part of the capacity building envisaged under the project. The sector work was prepared by
GOU, IDA and other interested donors in a collaborative manner. Subsequently, IDA also financed
GOU's activities related to the establishment of the Capacity Building Secretariat and the preparation
of the Capacity Building Plan. Upon the commencement of project preparation, GOU appointed a
team (headed by a Task Manager) which has been responsible for all aspects of project preparation
and which will also be responsible for project implementation. Appraisal commenced with the arrival
of this team in Washington D.C. in June 1994 and was completed with the visit of the IDA project
team to Uganda in August 1994. The Ugandan team, having been substantially involved in the
preparation of the Yellow Cover Staff Appraisal Report also participated in the Bank's Yellow Cover
Review Meeting in November 1994.

Project Benefilts
38.   In the area of public administration, the project would begin to focus the civil service on
service delivery and measurement of outputs provided to the public at large. There would also be
increased transparency in salary administration and increased accountability. The project will begin
the process of redressing the critical skill shortages in the accountancy and legal sectors. These
changes, and those that will result from improvements in the commercial code and the operation of
the Judiciary should provide a stronger base for private sector development. Additionally, the
intended emphasis on implementation skills and increased service delivery, particularly at the
district/rural level, should have a long term beneficial impact on the poor.
Project Risks
39.    The project has been designed to support the key elements of Government's reform agenda
(i.e. civil service reform, decentralization and private sector development). The underlying
assumption therefore is that GOU's reform agenda (including constitutional reform which is outside
the purview of this project) will remain unchanged in the medium-term. It is also assumed that other
measures being undertaken outside of this project to support the CSR program will continue (i.e. the
move towards the Minimum Living Wage and the voluntary and involuntary retrenchment programs
which have been supported by donors). Further, while decentralization will relieve pressures on
limited capacities in the Central Government in the medium-term, short-term pressures on the Central
Government agencies implementing the reform will tend to be exacerbated. Finally, while the
disputes in the accountancy profession have been sorted out prior to commencement of the project,
some risks remain that a future recurrence may delay implementation of that component. As a key
component of risk management a detailed but flexible supervision program, directly involving
Government agencies, resident mission staff, and headquarter staff will be used during the project
life.
Recommendation
40.    I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
