INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECCiri'MDATI^N OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMEN2T CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $7.3
million to the Republic of Uganda.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The first IDA credit to Uganda for education (Credit No. 101 UG),
signed in April 1967, provided $10 million to help the Government expand
secondary school enrollment and improve the curricula in secondary schools
by adding science subjects and practical courses. Under the project, 24
new secondary schools are being constructed and 15 existing schools are
being provided with additional facilities. Construction work on these
schools is expected to be completed shortly, and despite delays in pro-
curing furniture and equipmentall the new facilities should be fully ready
for use by mid-1972.
3.        Uganda is unusual in that a very substantial proportion of the
students at primary and general secondary level are enrolled in private
schools. Taking account of these schools and the additions to the public
school system being provided under the First IDA Education Project, there
is no need for a number of years for any significant further expansion at
primary or general secondary level. The shortage of trained manpower, how-
ever, is acute in almost every field and is steadily worsening as the econ-
omy expands. At the same time, despite the extensive private school system,
the Government has been spending quite heavily on public education, which
accounted for 16 percent of total capital expenditure and 28 percent of
recurrent expenditure in the 1970-71 budget. Thus, while an urgent need
exists to improve specialized training facilities to gear the education
system more adequately to Uganda's manpower requirements, careful planning
is required to achieve a better balanced system within the limits of avail-
able resources.
4.        The Uganda Government has been working on plans for some time to
help  meot   this problem.  In February/March 1969 a UNESCO mission visited
Uganda to draw up preliminary proposals for further development of the edu-
cation sector. The UNESCO report was discussed with the Uganda Government
by an IDA/UNESCO mission in December 1969, and a formal request for finan-
cial assistance for a Second Education Project was submitted to the Asso-
ciation by the Government in February 1970. The project was appraised in
the field in June 1970.



- 2 -
5.        Negotiations for the proposed project were held in W4ashington
from March 29 to April 2, 1971. Uganda was represented by the Honorable
Emanuel B. Wakhweya, Minister for Finance; Mr. W.W. Rwetsiba, Permanent
Secretary, Ministry of Education; lMr. J. Geria, Permanent Secretary desig-
nate, IMinistry of Finance; Mlir. A. Ocaya, Commissioner for Economic Affairs,
MHinistry of Finance; Dr. N.O. Edyegu, Ministry of Health; Mr. B.M. Kalemera,
Attorney General's Chambers; Mr. J. Lwabi, iMinistry of Education; Mr. M.
Okai, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Cooperatives; Mir. F. Sali,
Project Director, First Education Project; Mr. F.H. Scholey, lMinistry of
Labour; and Mr. C. Sentongo, Ministry of Planning and Economic Development.
6.        A faction of the army seized power in Uganda on January 25, 1971,
deposed former President Obote and established a military government under
General Idi Amin. In early February General Airiin dissolved parliament,
dismissed the former cabinet, assumed all executive and legislative powers,
and announced that he would rule by decree until the country could be re-
turned to civilian rule; all political activity has been banned for two
years. A largely civilian Council of Ministers, eight of them senior civil
servants of the previous Government, has been appointed. Day-to-day admin-
istration of the country appears to have continued substantially uninter-
rupted.
7.        The major action so far taken by the new Government in the econ-
omic field has been to modify substantially the program of nationalization
announced by President Obote in May 1970. Under the May 1970 pronouncement
a 60 percent Government participation was to be acquired in all banks,
insurance, oil, bus and major manufacturing companies, and in industrial
estates; about 80 companies were expected to be affected by this decision.
Agreements Ior compensation have already been reached with eight major con-
cerns on that basis. The new Government has announced that it is vjilling
to renegotiate these agreements on the basis of a Government participation
of 49 percent if the companies concerned so wish and that it also intends
to limit its participation to 49 percent in another 11 major companies with
whom agreements have not yet been completed. The other companies covered
by the May 1970 pronouncement will now be left entirely in private hands.
8.        The Government has announced its intention to honor all existing
obligations. No legislation of significance to the consummation of the
proposed credit or to any existing agreement between the Bank/IDA and Uganda
has been suspended or altered. WIork on Bank Group financed projects has
not been affected by the change in Government. I find no reason why the
Bank Group should withhold assistance for projects that are, as in this
case, essential to the country's long-run progress and should not be post-
poned.



PART II - CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE OPERATIONS
9.        The proposed credit would be the seventh IDA credit to Uganda.
In addition, before Independence in October 1962, Uganda received a Bank
loan of $8.4 millon for powTer !'evelopment, which ;ras guaranteed by
the United Kingdom. The s-mmary statement of' the loan and credits thus
far provided to Uganda is contained in Annex 1 to this report. Uganda is
also guarantor, jointly and severally with Kenya and Tanzania, of six Bank
loans for common services in East Africa (see Annex 2). The first of these
loans is also guaranteed by the United Kingdom.
10.       The Smallholder Tea Project (Credit No. 109 UG) has gone well and
the planting pro-ram of 9,700 acres provided for in the Development Credit
Agreement was successfully comipleted in 1970. Actual expenditures on leaf
collection, planting materials, nurseries and fertilizer proved to be less
than were estimated and the Association has agreed to the Government's re-
quest that the consequential savings under the credit of about $630,000 be
made available to help finance the planting of a further 3,800 acres of
smallholder tea during 1971. The Closing Date of the credit has accordingly
been postponed from December 31, 1971 to June 30, 1972.
11.       Vhile the performance of the Government and the consultants under
the First Highway Project (Credit No. 108 UG) has been satisfactory, the
reconstruction of one of the main roads in the project has fallen behind
schedule as a result of a delay by the contractors in transferring required
staff and plant to these works from another project in Uganda being carried
out under bilateral assistance. Execution of the project is now proceeding
satisfactorily, and costs are within the estimates. The Association has
agreed to postpone the Closing Date for the credit from December 31, 1971
to June 30, 1972.
12.       Work on the Second Highway Project (Credit No. 164 UG) is on
schedule, and after some initial slowness the rate of disbursements has
picked up considerably. However, project costs are on average about 30%
higher than estimated. The Association has reviewed the situation and con-
cluded that the Conditions of Contract currently in use in Uganda place a
high element of risk on the contractors, who in many cases attempt to cover
themselves by raising their bids.  The Association has advised the Govern-
ment to adopt some form of international standard conditions of contract
for civil engineering works, such as the FIDIC conditions(Federation Inter-
nationale des Ingenieurs Conseils) already used in many African countries.
The Government has undertaken to review existing contracts to see whether
economies might be effected consistent with the terms of the contracts.
13.       The Development Credit Agreement for the Smallholder Tobacco
Project (Credit No. 212 UG), which was signed in July 1970, has not yet
become effective. This has been principally due to delays in Uganda in
making certain required modifications to the Cooperative Society Rules and



- 4 -
consequently in finalizing the Subsidiary Loan Agreements for on-lending
the credit between the Government and, respectively, the Uganda Produce
Marketing Board and each of the three tobacco unions involved. The Asso-
ciation is actively pursuing this matter, and it is hoped that all the
actions necessary prior to effectiveness of the credit will be corapleted
in the near future.  Meanwhile, preliminary work on the project has been
proceeding satisfactorily.
14.       As indicated above, some delay has occurred in procurement of
furniture and equipment under the First Education Pro-iect (Credit No. 101 UG).
This may necessitate a postponement of about nine months in the Closing Date
for the credit beyond the present date of December 31, 1971.
15.       Performance under the First Beef Ranching Project (Credit Mo.
130 UG) has been good, and it is expected that all funds will be committed
by the end of 1971, about nine months ahead of schedule.
16.       A Second Livestock Project, which would continue and expandc the
scope of commercial ranching operations started under the first project,
has recently been appraised, and an application for a second smallholder
tea proiect has been received.
17.       IFC's only investment in Uganda so far has been in the Hulco
Textile Company. This investment was sold to the Government in September
1970 following the Government's announcement in lMay 1970 of its intention
to acquire 60 percent of the share capital of Nvlulco.  IFC is currently
considering a loan of about $1.0 million to the Tourist Promotion Services
of Uganda (TPSU). TPSU, in a joint 60:40 venture with the Uganda Develop-
ment Corporation, plans to builc twzo loc.ges at a total cost of about $2.2
million.

SE.RVICE CIARGE:        3/4 of l% per annum.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
19.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education Project in
Uganda" (No. PE-25a) is attached. The project, which would help redress
the present lack of balance in Uganda's education system, consists of:
(a)  a teacher training program, including the provision of
accommodation and equipment, to fill a serious gap in the
supply of secondary school teachers in commercial, technical
and agricultural subjects;
(b) a major expansion of specialized training facilities in the
fielcs of industry, agriculture, and health and extensions
to four upper secondary and five technical secondary schools
in accordance with projected manoower needs; and
(c)  technical assistance for certain of these items and for the
establishment of a planning group to assist the Government
improve its long-term educational planning by identifying
education priorities and accommodating them w^sithin the limits
of the country's resources.
20.       The total estimated cost of the proposed project is $10.4 million,
of which the foreign exchange component is estimated to be $5.5 million.
For the reasons set out in paragraph 33, the proposed credit, in the amount
of $7.3 million, would finance a h,gh prbport on of the totLl projoct cU_'ts,
that is, the whole of the foreign exchan- costs and $1.8 rmllion of the
local costs.
21.       The proposed amount of IDA lending includes approximately $2
million equivalent for technical assistance comprising approximately 80
man-years of specialist services for educational planning, the secondary
teacher training program, the proposed new vocational training center and
health education institutions, together with 18 man-years of fellowships
to train Ugandans to take over from the foreign specialists as soon as
possible. Some of this assistance may be made available from other sources,
such as UNDP, ILO, IOHO and the U.K. Government, which have been approached
by the Uganda Government and have shown interest in principle.   Since,
however, it is unclear at this stage how much assistance will in fact be



- 6 -
obtained from other sources or how quickly, finance for the required tech-
nical assistance has been included in the IDA credit, with the provision
that the Association shall cancel $26,000 of the credit for each man-year
of the services of educational specialists and $3,500 for each man-year of
fellowship grants obtained from other donors; these amounts represent the
estimated f-oreign exchange cost of the tec!nical assistance concerned if
financed by the Association.
22.       It is estimated that the recurrent costs of the project insti-
tutions and programs, when fully operative in 1975/76, would constitute
1.3 percent of the Central Government's total recurrent expenditures on
education, which would in turn represent an estimated 29 percent of the
Government's recurrent expenditures in all sectors together. That would
be high but still within the Government's capacity.
23.       The proposed project, while including a range of educational
institutions, concentrates primarily on teacher and vocational training.
To meet the urgent need for teaching staff in existing and proposed insti-
tutions, the project would expand the Niational Teachers College in Kampala
to allow for the training over a five-year period of 40 teachers for com{-
mercial subjects in secondary schools, 30 for agricultural subjects, and
120 teachers for industrial arts subjects. In addition, 132 teachers of
technical subjects for vocational institutions would be trained at the
Uganda Technical College. Some 33 man-years of technical assistance spe-
cialists wxould be provided for this teacher-training program to fill the
gap until a sufficient number of qualified Ugandans are available.
24.       At the secondary level, the project provides for the extension
of four upper secondary schools to create places for additional science
students for whom  the manpower demand is strong and growing.   It also
provides for additional facilities at five technical secondary schools,
including workshops, classrooms, and other equipment, to enable enrollment
to be increased by about 50 percent and instruction to be improved and
broadened. The curricula of the technical secondary schools, which are at
presenat geared to craft training, will be reformed to enable students with
the necessary ability to follow a course of study emphasizing science and
technology leading eventually to higher education, such as that provided
at the Uganda Technical College.
25.       Facilities for vocational training in Uganda would be substan-
tially improved by the establishment under the project of a new vocational
training center at Jinja with some 680 places. This center would offer
courses in such subjects as automobile repairing, machine fitting, machine
assembly, welding, carpentry, brick-laying and electrical installation
within a four-year apprenticeship program combining on-the-job and class-
room training; upgrading courses would also be provided. The Government
is introducing appropriate regulations for apprenticeship training to sup-
port this program.



- 7 -
26.       Account has been taken of the manpow-.er needs of the agricultural
sector by the inclusion in the project of- tihe expansion of agricultural
training facilities at intermediate and farmer level.  The project would
provide aucitional lecture rooms and other facilities at Uganda's two agri-
cultural colleges at Arapai and Bukalasa in order to increase the number
of trained agricultural officers, who are particularly needed to strengthen
the Government's extension services.  Experience in East Africa, however,
indicates that dependence on extension personnel alone is not sufficient
to reach the majority of farmers and that residential farmer training is
of immense value in supplementing the work of the extension services. The
project accordingly provides for the establishment of farmer training facil-
ities in the three districts of Uganda where such facilities do not at
present exist. Bus and truck transportation would also be provided under
the project to allow for the widest possible use of the new facilities.
27.       Uganda has a serious problem in providing adequate health care
for a population that is exposed to virtually all the diseases of temperate
climates as well as most major tropical diseases. The economic benefits
of more effective health services are difficult to quantify, but there can
be little doubt that they would be substantial in terms of reduced sickness
and hence lower absenteeism and higher productivity.   Two major obstacles
to irmiproving health care in Uganda are the lack of adequate facilities and
qualified tutors for training paramedical staff. The proposed project
would establish a small medical tutor training college to train profession-
ally qualified medical personnel of various categories to become teachers
in paramedical training schools and a training school for nurses and mid-
wives adjacent to one of the principal hospitals.   The Government has agreed
to upgrade facilities for training purposes at the hospital by extending
the maternity and pediatric wards.
28.       The existing project unit for the First Education Project does
not have the capacity to carry out the more complex second project.   A new
project unit will therefore be established in the i4inistry of Education to
be responsible for implementing the proposed project as well as completing
the first project.  The new unit will consist of a project director, an
architect, both to be acceptable to the Association, a procurement spe-
cialist and an accountant. Establishment of the project unit and the ap-
pointment of the project director and architect will be conditions of ef-
fectiveness of the credit. Because the proposed project involves several
Ministries in addition to the Ministry of Education, a Project Mianagement
Committee, consisting of the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministries respon-
sible for finance, planning, education, agriculture, labor and health, has
already been established for general supervision of the project and coor-
dination among the Ministries involved.
29.       All contracts for the supply of furniture and equipment and for
construction would be awarded in accordance with the Association's normal
international bidding procedures. It is unlikely that firms not already



- & -
operating in Uganda would submit bids, except for equipment, due to the
varied locations and diversity of types of project institutions. At the
Government's request, it is proposed to accord domestic manufacturers a
preference cf 15 percent or the appropriate customs duty, whichever is lower.
PART V - LZGAL INSTRUMEITS AND AUTHORITY
30.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the Republic of Uganda, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit are being distrib-
uted to the Executive Directors separately. The Agreement is drafted along
the lines of similar agreements relating to education projects.
PART VI - THE ECONOMY
31.       An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Uganda" (No. AE-2, in two volumes) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on June 2h, 1969 (R69-145).   In November/December 1970
an economic and preinvestment studies mission from the Bank visited Uganda.
Its report till be distributed to the Executive Directors in the near future.
A Country Data sheet is attached as Annex 3 and a map of Uganda as Annex 4.
32.       Uganda's Second Five-Year Plan (1966-71) is the first phase of a
15-year perspective plan aimed at transforming the structure of the economy
and at doubling real per capita income between 1966 and 1981.   During the
first four years of the Plan, the growth of the economy fell considerably
short of Plan targets in nearly all sectors.  The principal reason for the
slow growth was the shortage of high-level manpower, which impeded the
preparation and execution of projects.  Record coffee and cotton crops due
to favorable weather resulted in exceptionally high GDP growth (11.0%) in
1969 and led to a large increase in Uganda's exports in 1970. However, the
growth in GDP in 1970 is estimated to have been between 1.5 percent and
2.0 percent.
33.       Gross capital formation fluctuated widely during the past decade
but its trend has been upward.  Over tle period 1965-69, which corresponds
roughly to the first four years of the Second Plan, Uganda devoted about
14.5 percent of its Gross National Product to capital formation. Some 69
percent of the Central Government's development expenditure was financed
from internal sources, and it is not likely to be easy for Uganda to finance
a larger proportion from its own resources if an adequate and growing volume
of investment is to be maintained in the future. Since many of the projects
likely to be suitable for external financing have a relatively low foreign
exchange component, the external assistance obtained for them will need to
cover a proportion of their local costs.



34.       A substantial surplus was generated in the recurrent budget
during the first two years of the Second Plan, but this record of finan-
cial management has not been maintained. Increases in recurrent expend-
iture have been the principal factor behind the lower current surpluses
in the later years. Mqeanwhile development expenditure has increased rapid-
ly, especially since FY68/69. Consequently, the overall budgetary deficit
increased from Sh 89 million in 1966/67 to Sh 1431 million in 1969/70. The
original estimates for 1970/71 provided for an overall budgetary deficit
of Sh 625 million, of which Sh 448 million was expected to be covered by
foreign aid and internal borrowing. The indications are, however, that
the actual deficit will be larger than was planned. The budget estimates
for 1971/72 are not yet known, but the new Government has prepared the
budget with the assistance of experts provided by the International Yonetary
Fund, and the budget will be published shortly.
35.       At the end of 1969 the total external public debt of Uganda
(including a notional one-third liability for the debt of the East African
Community) was $245.2 million. The debt service ratio has been rising
over the last few years and reached nearly 10 percent in 1969. However,
this reflects a peak in debt service payments for that year. In the past
Uganda has obtained substantial aid on concessionary terms, and, assuming
that the average terms of aid in the future are similar to those in the
past, the debt service ratio should remain around 7 to 10 percent for the
next ten years. Hence, in order to prevent an increasing debt burden in
the long run, and in view of its low per capita income, it is appropriate
for aid to be made available to Uganda on IDA terms.
PART VII - C0MPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREE;1NT
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VIII - RECOMENDATION
37.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
