MEMORANDUM AND RECO)MENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO INDIA
FOR THE MAMARASHTRA POWER PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
India for US$400 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be at the standard IBRD variable interest rate, and be
repayable over 20 years, including a five-year grace period. The loan
would help finance a project designed to alleviate power shortages, expand
and modernize electricity transmission and distribution systems, and
strengthen the finances and organization of the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board (MSEB).
2.       Background.  The power sector playe a key role in meeting the
energy needs of the Indian economy (electricity provides 302 of comnercial
energy consumption). However, with severe shortages of power remaining a
serious constraint to economic growth, India must continue to invest in new
generating capacity while, in parallel, increasing the efficiency of
existing power systems.
3.       To meet a higher proportion of demand, improve the quality of
supply, and further extend rural electrification, Government of India (GOI)
plans to install an additional 80,000 1W of capacity by the turn of the
century (an increase of about 150S from present installed capacity). This
would cost about US$150 billion at present prices and claim between 252 and
302 of total allocations under the Eighth and Ninth Plans (compared to
about 20? in the Seventh Plan). Implementing such a large program would
add sharp pressures to government finances and sector entities' managerial
capabilities.
4.       Recent improvements in sector efficiency have been encouraging.
over the last seven years, plant load factor has increased from 42Z to 522,
the rate of fuel consumption in thermal power stakions has been cut by 10?
(saving approximately 12 million tons of coal per annum), and the number of
employees per thousand consumers has been cut 34X. Sector efficiency has
also increased through improvement in retail tariffs which now represent
60-70? of marginal cost, as compared to less than 501 in 1981.   However,
tariff structures remain badly distorted, with heavy cross-subsidies in
favor of low voltage consumers, in particular in agriculture.
5.       Despite these gains, India's power utilities remain relatively
inefficient by international standards. Key constraints are the divided
responsibility for power development between GOI and the States, political
interference in the operations of the State Electricity Boards, and
weaknesses in the financial structure of the SEBs, which undermine
financial performance and hold down resource mobilization.
6.       GOI has mounted several initiatives to tackle sector development
and efficiency constraints. Most notable amongst these are initiatives tot
(i) bring financial discipline to t*  SEBs; (ii) accelerate development of



-2-
the more efficient central utilities, in particular National Thermal Power
Corporation (NTPC); (iii) establish the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) to
mobilize additional resources for SEBs willing to make needed institutional
reforms; (iv) relax existing regulatory and financial disincentives to
private sector participation in power supply and distribution; and (v)
review the fuel supply policy for the sector, including fuel import
options, and sanctioning of more domestic natural gas for power generation.
While each of these GOI initiatives are desirable, additional efforts are
needed to address constraints in the areas of sector planning, power
pricing, load management and SEBes' finances. The Bank maintains a close
dialogue with GOI on these aspects of its policy which it intends to pursue
further in the context of the Bank's sector work which will review, inter
alia, investment planning, power pricing as well as the environmental
aspects of power development.
7.       Maharashtra, where the proposed project is located, is the largest
industrial state in India. It experiences power shortages because of
inadequate supply capacity, estimated to be equivalent to about 142 of
maximum load met and 2X of energy consumption. The Central Electricity
Authority (CEA) projects that, in future, maximum load demand will increase
more slowly (6.92 per annum) than in the past, while maximum generating
capacity will increase more quickly (about 8.82 per annum). Together,
these effects are expected to close the gap to about 6? of peak demand by
1999-2000. Energy supply is projected to keep pace with energy demand
increase. Koyna IV is one of the key projects that will facilitate this
improvement. For a relatively modest investment (about US$300/kW compared
with about US$1,100 for new hydro stations), the project will permit being
able to concentrate Koyna power supply into periods when demand is at its
highest.
8.       Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) is the largest of
India's State Electricity Boards (SEBs) and provides 13S of India's total
power supplies. Mhharashtra SEB also is one of the best managed and most
efficient SEBs. In 1987/88, MSEB was also one of the only two SEBs which
reached the 3t minimum rate of return (after interest and taxes) stipulated
in the Electricity (Supply) Act. This relatively healthy financial
performance is attributable both to the quality of MSZB's management and to
careful consideration by the Government of Mbharashtra CGOM) of the
financial needs of the sector. Continuing strong increases in demand mean
that in future M3EB will have to manage unprecedented growth in its
operations. To meet this objective, MSEB recognizes that key elements will
be to achieve productivity gains of at least 52 per annum and to increase
internal cash generation (inter alia, through continuing real increases in
tariffs) to over 20X of investment requirements - a level unprecedented
amongst India's SEBs.
9.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's sector strategy
includes addressing sector constraints in the areas of planning, pricing,
load management, institutional development, and finances. The prevalent
nature of these constraint% suggests a sector-wide approach. However, the
comparative autonomy of the States and SEBs makes it difficult to achieve
progress through involvement exclusively with central government agencies.
Hence, the Benk strategy includes direct operations with selected SEBs,
which, together with their State governments, are cc,mitted to efficiency



-3-
reforms. The Bank is already suppurting the development of MiAharashtra's
power network by providing financing to both public and private utilities.
Four Bank financed operations with the private utility, Tata Electric
Companies, have been undertaken and further Bank Group financial assistance
to Maharashtra's private utilities is under consideration. The first Bank
project with MSEB focussed on reducing transmission losses, training, and
financial accounting. The proposed project would consolidate and extend
initial progress by strengthening MSEB's management organization and
management information systems, improving the structure of MSEB's tariffs,
and improving the Board's financial performance.
10.      Proiect Obiectives.  The Project objectives are to improve power
supply in the Western Region and the operating efficiency of MSEB.
11.      Project Description, Costs and Financing.  The p'oposed project is
part of the Western Region power development program, and eonsists of: (a)
construction of a 1,000 MW (250 KW x 4) fourth-stage addition to the Koyna
hydroelectric power plant; (b) inspection and repair, as needed, to the
existing Koyna dam, (c) supply and erection of equipment and material for
MSEB's transmission and distribution investment program between 1990191 and
1992/93, and strengthening of MSEBs capabilities for planning of
distribution systems; (d) implementation of plans to strengthen MSEB's
management, operations, and finances; and (e) consultancy and training
services, as well as computer hardware and software required to implement
the project. The proposed project, which would be carried out over seven
years, has an estimated total financing requirement of ES$1,344 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of USS608 million equivalent
(45Z). The proposed Bank loan would provide financing for civil works,
equipment and materials, training and consulting services. GOI will be
seeking about US$150 million equivalent from co-financiers to supplement
Bank financing for equipment or civil works. Schedule "A' shows the
estimated cost and financing plan. Schedule 'B' gives details of amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements. Schedule 'C' shows a
timetable of key project processing events, and Schedule "DO gives the
status of Bank Group operations in India. Maps (IBRD 21492 and 21493)
highlighting the project are attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
7713-Il is being distributed separately.
12.      Resettlement and Environment.  Construction of the Koyna IV power
plant requires resettlement of six landless families, who have agreed to
move to lands provided by GOM. About 480 hectares of land are required for
spoil areas, access roads, quarries, temporary storage, etc., for Koyna IV.
No houses or villages would be affected. Families owning this land, who
reside in nearby villages, may lose income derived from exploitation of
this land. These families will be compensated in accordance with the
provisions of the Maharashtra Project Displaced Persons Act of 1976. The
provisions of the Act are consistent with the Bank's guidelines for
resettlement and rehabilitation. MSEB will have to compensate and
rehabilitate any persons displaced for construction of transmission and
distribution sub-stations. In these cases, compensation will be in
accordance with the Act as well. The environmental effect of the Koyna IV
power station are negligible because no new reservoir is needed and works
are underground. AAy adverse effects resulting from construction
operations will be suitably treated by sealing and landscaping.



-4-
Transmission line routing will be selected to minimize crossing of forest
land. Moreover, the Bank will not finance any lines that are not cleared
in advance by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MEP), GOI. The
environment guidelines of ME? are consistent with the Bank guidelines.
13.      Actions Agreed. Agreement has been reached with GOM that it will
furnish a report to the Bank, by December 31, 1989, on compensation to be
given to families who may lose income as a consequence of the construction
of Koyna IV. Agreements have also been reached with both GOM and MSEBs (a)
that they will furnish to the Bank by June 30, 1990 proposals for load
management initiatives and tariff adjustmwnts; (b) on the cor snt and
implementation timi table of an Action Plan for Managerial Dev..Lopment; (c)
on the content and implementation timetable of a Financial Action Plan,
including, inter alia, that MSEB's self-financing rttio will be raised
gradually from 0.52 to 212 by fiscal year 1994/95, and that its workforce
will not increase by more than 2t per annum (corresponding to a 5t per
annum productivity increase); (d) that MSEB's financial rate of return
after interest will be no less than 3S in financial year 1989/90 and
1990191, 3.S in financial year 1991/92 and 1992/93, and 41 thereafter; te)
that MSEB's debt service coverage will be more than 1.2 from financial year
1990/91 onward; (f) to reduce commercial receivables to less than 2.5
months of revenues from March 31, 1990 onward; (g) to reduce gradually
commercial payables to less than 2 months of consumption from March 31,
1992 onward; (h) to discuss annually revisions to MSEB's five-year
investment and financing plan; and (i) to prepare and furnish to the Bank,
by December of each year, the resettlement and rehabilitation plan for
persons displaced by any substation proposed for Bank financing.
14.      Benefits. Extension of the Royna scheme by 1,000 MV is part of
the least-cost development program for the Western Region. The extension
will help meet a higher proportion of peak power demand from public supply,
and so, displace expensive captive power generation. It will also firm-up
existing generating capacity and thereby improve the quality ci power
supply. Transmission and distribution investment included in the proposed
project complement MSEB's least-cost development of generation and will
reduce power losses and improve the quality and reliability of supply.
The Western Region development program is conservatively estimated to have
an economic rate of return of about 142.
15.      Risks. The proposed Koyna IV scheme presents the usual risks
associated with major underground works, such as unexpected geological
conditions that may adversely affect project costs or the construction
schedule. However, the geological exploration program carried out thus far
and the excavation works carried out for the neighboring Stages I to III,
which are also underground, indicate that the geological setting is
adequate for the proposed works. The size of the turbogenerating units
proposed for Koyna IV is unprecedented in India. To minimize the risk of
technical problems, GOM has agreed to hire consultants specialized in this
field. Implementation of MSEB's proposed five-year investment plan may be
affected by delays in administrative approvals, forest clearances and land
acquisition. Budgetary constraints may also require rescheduling of
investments included in the plan. To deal with.these risks, adequate
allowances for administrative processing have been incorporated in the
implementation schedule. Moreover, MSEB agreed to review with the Bank



-5-
every year the updated investment program for the following five years. As
part of the review, the Bank will need to be satisfied as to the nature and
scope of any revisions needed and the integrity of the updated program in
terms of its internal consistency, technical adequacy, and economic
justification. It is possible that as a result of rescheduling of
investments, HSEB may be unable to commit the entire loan amount before
December 31, 1992. To keep this risk at a low level, the Bank will finance
only 25 of MS1B planned investment during the initial three years of the
plan. Hence, MSEB will have ample flexibility to select for Bank financing
those schemes that are not constrained by possible issues of the nature
described above.
16.      There is also some risk that the financial objectives set for MSEB
may not be achieved because of Insufficient tariff adjustments. However,
past GOM record in this respect is good, with average annual tariff
adjustments 5S above inflation over the past three years. Envisaged future
tariff adjustments are modest in comparison and therefore are not expected
to present a major risk.
17.      Recomendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
