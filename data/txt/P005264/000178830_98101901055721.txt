I. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Socio-Economic and Sector Background
1.01     In view of its sparse endowment of water and mineral resources,
Jordan rightly considers its labor force to be its most important productive
asset. Population and labor force in Jordan are growing at an extremely rapid
rate despite heavy labor emigration. The total East Bank labor force grew at
about 3.5% per year during the 1960s and early 1970s, but has grown at about
6% per year since 1975. This very rapid growth of the labor force results
partly from the rise of male participation rates which occurred during the
1970s, and from the continuing movement of working-age Palestinians from the
West Bank to the East Bank. Most of it, however, arises from the high rate of
natural population increase in the East Bank since the 1960s and the
consequent youthfulness of the Jordanian resident population--more than half
of which is less than 15 years old. Rapid growth of population, particularly
in the youngest age groups, has strained and will continue to strain the
Government's capacity to provide school places to the expanding school-age
population.
1.02     The Ministry of Education (MOE), under the guidance of the National
Board of Education, is responsible for formal education and training which
includes primary, preparatory, general and vocational secondary and
post-secondary polytechnics and community colleges. School attendance by boys
and girls is compulsory through the 9th grade. The universities are governed
by their own boards which are responsible for establishing general policy
guidelines and determining each year the number of students to be admitted to
the different faculties. A number of other ministries, in particular the
Ministry of Health and the Vocational Training Corporation (VTC), an
autonomous government agency affiliated with the Ministry of Labor, are active
in training related to their special fields. The VTC is responsible for the
in-plant apprentice program conducted with the cooperation of employers and
for a skill upgrading program. In addition, there is a vigorous effort in
job-oriented vocational training in the private sector. There are, for
example, 20 private community colleges which offer post-secondary courses
principally in commercial specializations, under the coordination of the
Higher Education Council.
1.03     The Government has a strong commitment to human resource development,
as is evident in the striking progress achieved by MOE programs in improving
access to education since 1975. Enrollments have increased by about 30% at
the primary level (grades 1-6), 88% at the preparatory level (grades 7-9), and
178% at the secondary level (grades 10-12). Female school enrollment was
already high in 1974/75 by comparison with other Middle East countries and
rose further in the subsequent years. Since 1975, female enrollments as a
percentage of total enrollments have risen from 46% to 48% at the primary
level, from 43% to 46% at the preparatory level, and from 37% to 46% at the
secondary level.



- 2 -
1.04      These gains were achieved through a significant expansion of
educational infrastructure, both in permanent facilities and in temporary
facilities. During the previous Plan period (1976-1980), the MOE opened
nearly 300 schools comprising about 5,000 classrooms in the compulsory,
secondary and post-secondary education cycles. Half of these are rented
facilities which do not meet the Government's standards for permanent schools
(para. 1.09).
1.05     The Ministry also continued its efforts to diversify education and
link it with the needs of socio-economic development during this period
through two important measures: the establishment of general vocational
secondary schools, and the development of prevocational instruction courses
for students pursuing general studies in preparatory and secondary schools.
With support from the Fourth and Fifth Bank Education Projects, the Government
is establishing a network of general vocational secondary schools (GVSSs)
which will combine in a single institution the vocational courses formerly
offered in specialized vocational secondary schools and in the vocational
streams of comprehensive secondary schools. Job relevance of training
provided in the general vocational secondary schools is to be assured through
a supervised job experience program, career guidance counseling, and
continuous modification of specialization offerings based on a tracer study
follow up of graduates.
1.06     The Government also acted decisively during the previous plan period
to provide an employment orientation for students in academic programs, most
of whom would not receive actual vocational instruction during or after their
formal studies. In 1979, the National Board of Education ruled that students
in grades 5 through 12 were to receive at least 2 hours per week of
prevocational instruction, and students in grades 1 through 4 were to receive
2 hours per week of practical activities instruction. Suitable curricula for
the prevocational instruction and practical activities courses have now been
prepared, but implementation is being hampered by lack of suitable facilities
for the programs (paras. 1.10, 1.11).
1.07     The Government's education and training policy as presented in the
1981--85 Development Plan aims to continue and extend these achievements of the
previous Plan period. The objectives of the current Plan are; (a) to improve
the quality of education, particularly in science, through upgraded teacher
qualifications, improved curricula and teaching materials, replacement of
rented schools, and elimination of double shifting; (b) to expand compulsory
schooling (grades 1-9) from 91% of the relevant age group in 1980 to 94% in
1985; (c) to generalize the pilot program of prevocational instruction in
grades 5 through 12 (paras. 1.11, 2.01a); (d) to channel more secondary level
students into vocational specializations in order to achieve 30% vocational
secondary enrollments by 1985; (e) to reduce by more than 20% by 1985 the
propcrtion of illiterates among the population less than 60 years old; and
(f) to provide the necessary trained manpower to meet the evolving demands of
the Jordanian economy and of other Arab countries. A closely related goal is
to expand labor-force participation, particularly by Jordanian women - a goal
provided by institutions financed under previous Bank projects, as well as
under the present project (paras. 1.10, 1.19). These are reasonable and
feasible educational goals which address the principal education and training
issues (para.1.08).



-.3-
Education and Training Issues
1.08     Although the Government's strategy for educational development has
been pursued with significant success in increasing educational opportunities,
improving quality and correcting an earlier under-emphasis on vocational/
technical education, further steps are being taken to address the key issues
relating to; (a) improving the quality of and expanding school buildings,
(b) increasing the relevance (external efficiency) of general education, and
(c) improving the quality of science instruction through the provision of more
and better equipped science laboratories.
Quality of School Buildings
1.09     The problem of providing suitable school buildings necessary to
accommodate the increasing number of students in the compulsory and secondary
cycles is still acute. The unprecedented growth in the number of students has
not been matched by a similar growth in suitable school facilities,
particularly in urban areas. The MOE has had to resort to the extensive use
of rented buildings which lack the appropriate facilities for use as schools.
In particular, these temporary school facilities are usually seriously
overcrowded, have no space for science or workshop equipment, and lack
adequate sanitary facilities and playgrounds. The MOE has also been compelled
to reduce the daily hours of instruction (from 5 1/2 hours to 4 1/2 hours) to
apply a two-shift system in about 41% of compulsory and secondary schools in
order to provide the necessary number of school places with the limited
facilities available. In the academic year 1979/80, rented classrooms
constituted about 55% of total compulsory and secondary classrooms, and the
number of classrooms used on the basis of a two-shift system was 2,974. The
acute need to replace improvised, rented school facilities with suitable,
permanent facilities tends to be supplanted by the need to accommodate a
rapidly growing school-age population. The need arising from this source
alone for the period 1981-1985 is estimated at 46 additional compulsory
schools (grades 1-9) with a total capacity of about 24,000 students and 11
general secondary schools with a total capacity of about 6,700 students, in
addition to the expansion of existing secondary schools. The extent of the
need for new and upgraded school buildings is such that the very significant
school construction program of the 1981/85 Five-Year Plan (about JD80 million
for compulsory and secondary school construction) would meet only half the
estimated need to replace all unsuitable rented facilities and accommodate
projected enrollment increases.
Relevance (External Efficiency) of General Education.
1.10     To provide an employment orientation for the bulk of compulsory and
secondary level students who would not receive vocational instruction, the
National Board of Education in 1979 ruled that two periods per week of
practical activities were to be introduced into grades I through 4 of primary
school and a new integrated program of prevocational instruction (also two
periods per week) was to be offered to students pursuing academic studies in
grades 5 through 12. The objectives of the new prevocational instruction
program are: (a) to provide a positive orientation towards productive
employment, (b) to guide the choice of subsequent work or studies based on
student aptitudes, (c) to provide a basis for eventual on-the-job training,



- 4 -
and (d) to equip students with basic mechanical skills to solve daily
problems. The combination of subjects to be offered in the program varies
between schools according to availability of staff and facilities.
Prevocational subjects are introduced into a single stream (or
nonvocationally-based multiple streams) as one component of a general
curriculum with no direct occupational aims. In selecting courses for the two
periods per week of prevocational instruction, students may take the same
practical subjects or choose several among them, depending upon their
availability.
1.11     In response to the Board of Education ruling, the MOE has developed
suitable courses both for students and for teachers who are to teach the new
courses. The MOE is now in the process of progressively implementing the new
program in MOE schools. A pilot program offering 2 hours a week of
prevocational instruction was introduced in 100 preparatory schools in 1981.
After its first successful year, the program was extended to an additional 90
preparatory schools in 1982. Prevocational instruction courses of 2 hours a
week were also introduced in 100 general secondary schools during the 1982/83
school year. Adequate numbers of teachers for the prevocational instruction
program are being trained at the Shaubak Teacher Training Institute, supported
under the Third Education Project. The main constraint to fuller
implementation of the prevocational instruction and practical activities
programs is lack of suitable workshops and equipment, an issue which the
proposed project would address by providing facilities for implementing the
program in both new and existing schools (for 47 new schools and 49 existing
ones) (paras. 2.03, 2.06, 2.10).
Improving the Quality of Science Teaching
1.12     The problem of unsuitable facilities in rented schools is compounded
by the absence of needed science and workshop spaces in permanent MOE
schools. Science instruction in secondary schools suffers from overcrowded
classrooms, virtually no science laboratories and equipment, and from a
reduction in hours of science instruction (from an average of 6 hours to 3
hours) to accommodate double shifting. Provision of improved science
facilities in the form of suitable laboratories and science equipment is a
basic prerequisite to the planned reinforcement of science instruction at the
secondary level. The MOE recognizes this, and accordingly plans to construct
and equip during the 1981-85 Plan period 140 new laboratories in 70 general
secondary schools, (including the 51 laboratories in the proposed project),
and to provide laboratory kits to over one thousand compulsory schools. In
addition, it plans to strengthen the one hundred existing secondary school
laboratories through the provision of additional science instruments and
equipment. The proposed project would play an important role in contributing
to this effort (para 2.10). There is a sufficient supply of university
science graduates to provide the necessary science teachers for the proposed
project laboratories. The effectiveness of science teaching in the project
institutions would be closely monitored by the on-going system of science
inspectors.

MOE Implementation Capability
1.13     The proposed expansion of general education and prevocational
instruction will require a modest further strengthening of MOE capabilities to
execute effectively the Government's program for expanded compulsory and
secondary education. The proposed project would provide technical assistance
(TA) for this purpose (para 2.11). It would also support other priority areas
for institution building in the Directorates of Education, in-service Teacher
Training (especially vocational, science and mathematics teachers), Planning
and Research, Examinations, Education Technology, Community Colleges, and the
MOE Computer Center.
Education Finance
1.14     The Government has adopted an ambitious program of investment to
expand education and training capacity at all levels. The Plan allocates
about $700 million to implement priority projects in education and training,
including university education. This expansion implies an increase in the
recurrent costs of the education system. Between 1975 and 1979, the recurrent
cost of public education under the Ministry of Education (MOE) increased at
the rate of 11.6 percent per annum in real terms, compared to a 7.5 percent
yearly increase in enrollment.  The share of educational expenditure
stabilized at around 11 percent of total public recurrent expenditure during
1975-79. Based on projected enrollment increases, recurrent expenditures in
education in 1980-85 are estimated to increase by about 6 percent per annum to
a total of about $157 million or about 9 percent of total public recurrent
expenditure in 1985. Total recurrent and capital expenditures for education
would amount to about $185 million in 1985 (in 1979 prices), which represents
about 5 percent of the projected GNP and about 10 percent of the Government
budget. The Government can be expected to sustain this expanded level of
expenditure, in view of the high priority attached to education.
Bank Strategy and Lending for Education
1.15     The Bank endorses the Government's education strategy and has
supported it through its lending program. Bank Group lending in the education
sector has focussed particularly on teacher training and the vocationalization
of secondary and post-secondary education, because of the visible need to
expand productive employment opportunities for the rapidly increasing labor
force.
1.16     The first IDA-assisted education project (Credit 285-JO, approved in
1972 for US$5.4 million and completed in 1979) was designed to improve the
quality of education and to address deficiencies in the supply of skilled
manpower. Particular emphasis was given to vocational training for women in
order to improve their employment potential. The project was innovative and
assisted in providing two comprehensive secondary schools, a polytechnic and
teacher training center, a co-educational teacher training institute, training
of agricultural teachers and TA for institutional support, curricula



- 6 -
development and teacher training. A system to trace the placement of
graduates from the project institutions was also developed and is presently
operational. The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR, No.2494) for the
First Education Project in Jordan stated that "the project has been catalytic
in that it stimulated educational planning, the concept of diversification of
secondary education, and the better integration of technical/vocational
programs with the needs of the labor market. It has helped to develop project
implementation capabilities and procedures." The recommendations in the
project completion report, have been adopted, in particular, the introduction
of improved equipment procurement procedures, better coordination of TA, more
effective scheduling of required inputs and timing of implementation, and
arrangements for training in management and administration of the Project Unit
and project institutional staff.
1.17     Continuing this strategy, the Second IDA Education Project (Credit
534-JO, approved in 1975 for US$6.0 million) has assisted in providing a
polytechnic, three comprehensive secondary schools, extensions (workshops and
laboratories) to 16 preparatory and secondary schools, a trade training
center, a hotel training school and a rural development center, and includes
appropriate TA for each component. Implementation of this project was
completed satisfactorily in 1982. The Project Completion Report (PCR No.4261)
observes that the project is contributing to the expansion of vocational and
technical education in Jordan at a time when demand for skilled labor is
increasing. It also notes that the physical components of the project were
well executed, that the quality of construction and equipment was very good
and that all major technical assistance components were fully implemented.
However, delays and cost overruns were encountered during implementation--a
problem which institutional development measures included in subsequent
projects, as well as in the proposed project, are designed to overcome.
1.18     The Third Education Project (Loan 1781-JO, approved in 1979 for
US$19.0 million) includes five comprehensive secondary schools, one
pre-vocational teacher training institute, an extension to one secondary
agricultural school, one community college, one teacher training center, and
eight mobile building maintenance units. The project also provides support to
strengthen the planning and management capability of the MOE by providing a
research and evaluation mechanism and a computerized management information
system to be used as tools for planning and management. TA related to the
project institutions and for project management support is being funded by the
UNDP and executed by the Bank. Implementation of the project is proceeding
satisfactorily.
1.19     The Fourth Education Project (Loan 2068-JO, approved in 1981 for
US$25 million) provides for the construction and equipping of four GVSSs (two
for girls and two for boys), a trade training center, a nursing/paramedical
institute, a second polytechnic institute, and a technical teacher training
center attached to one of the existing IDA-supported polytechnics. In
addition, the project provides for the conversion of two teacher training
institutes into community colleges, and includes technical assistance for
these project components as well as for further curriculum refinement for the
comprehensive secondary schools and polytechnics financed under the first
three projects. The project is being implemented satisfactorily.



- 7 -
1.20     The Fifth Education Project (Loan 2246-Jo, approved in 1983 for
US$18.8 million) continues the thrust of the first four Bank Group education
projects upon increasing the supply of well-trained skilled workers to meet
manpower needs both within and outside Jordan. Continuing the support
provided under the Fourth Project, it includes 15 of the 23 new GVSSs
programmed in the 1981-85 Development Plan. In additions it promotes regional
equity by supporting the extension of preparatory and secondary schooling for
students from the more remote areas, areas with very limited school resources
beyond the primary level. The fifth project also provides technical
assistance to reinforce the implementation capability of the Directorate of
Projects and to develop the mechanism necessary to assure the continuing job
relevance of MOE's expanding program of secondary vocational education.
121     The proposed project, a Bank loan of USt4O.O million, would provide
for the construction and equipping of 31 compulsory schools (25 for girls, 6
for boys) and 16 general upper secondary schools (7 for girls, 9 for boys),
and for the provision of 48 science laboratories, 50 multi-purpose workshops
and 49 libraries for existing secondary schools. Support would also be
provided to continue the institution building program, already begun under
earlier Bank Group education projects and now being extended under the fifth
project. Technical assistance to be provided under the proposed project would
complete the strengthening of the MOE directorates for future independent
sector and project actions.



II. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Scope
2.01     The proposed project is designed to support key Five-Year Plan
objectives--in particular, improving conditions in compulsory and general
secondary schools whilst simultaneously increasing the vocational content of
the curricula, as well as completing the program begun under earlier projects
for strengthening MOE capacity in the area of project preparation and
implementation. Accordingly, the project would:
(a) support the extension of the prevocational instruction program for
grades 5 through 12, which has been satisfactorily implemented on a
pilot basis, and the implementation of the practical activities
program for grades I through 4 through the construction of new
schools and the provision of adequate workshop facilities for 50
existing schools (paras. 1.10, 1.11);
(b) initiate the upgrading of compulsory schools, particularly for girls,
by the construction of 31 new schools to replace unsuitable rented
facilities;
(c)  improve the quality of compulsory and secondary instruction through a
reduction of about 30% in the number of classrooms operating on a
double shifts and through the provision of 48 additional science labs
and 49 additional libraries in existing secondary schools;
(d) widen the opportunities for secondary schooling in all the
governorates, with special consideration for female students in rural
areas, by constructing 16 new schools with additional student places;
(e) continue the MOE institution-building program, notably in the sectors
of pre-service and in-service training of teachers, planning and
research, examinations, and educational technology, thereby
strengthening the MOE directorates for better project preparation and
implementation; and
(f) prepare for possible future lending by supporting pre-investment
studies.

Comulsory Schools (grades 1-9)
2.03     This component would help expand and improve educational
opportunities through the financing of construction, equipment and furniture,
including multi-purpose workshops for practical activities and prevocational
instruction, for 31 new compulsory schools (25 for girls and 6 for boys) in
the governorates of Amman, Irbid, Balqa, Ma'an and Karak. The proposed
schools would help: (a) replace unsatisfactory facilities (about 150
classrooms) (para. 1.09); (b) provide for increased enrollments (about 30,000
students by 1989/90); (c) replace about 270 rented primary and preparatory
classrooms with consequent cost savings of JD 52,000 per year; (d) reduce the
number of students per classroom (from currently 60-70 students per room in
some existing schools to 40-50 students); and (e) cater to on-going population
expansion, particularly in areas experiencing rapid growth of mining and
industrial capacity; and (f) support the extension of the new practical
activities program in grades 1 through 4 and the prevocational instruction
program in grades 5 through 9 (paras. 1.10, 1.11).
2.04     Total enrollments in the proposed compulsory schools would be 28,670
(22,200 girls and 6,470 boys) with an average utilization rate of 88 percent.
The enrollment represents 4% of the total compulsory school population. These
schools would provide improved access to education and would better prepare
studtents, particularly girls in rural areas/small towns, for entry into
vocational and general secondary schools. About 90% of the students
completing compulsory schooling in these schools (a total of about 2,900
students) would enter the first year of secondary education.
2.05     About 60% of the required teachers for the new schools would come
from the classes to be relocated from inadequate and rented facilities. The
remaining teachers required for general subjects and for most of the
pre-vocational instruction courses would be available from the community
colleges and from the Pre-Vocational Teacher Training Institute at Shaubak,
supported under the Bank Third Education Project. In addition, graduates of
the vocational secondary schools would continue to be recruited to teach
prevocational courses at the preparatory level (grades 7-9).
New General Secondary Schools (grades 10-12)
2.06     This proposed component would help expand and improve educational
opportunities through the financing of construction, equipment, and furniture,
including multi-purpose workshops, for 16 new general secondary schools in the
governorates of Amman, Balqa, Irbid, Karak and Ma'an. Seven would be for
girls and nine for boys. The proposed schools would assist in: (a) replacing
a number of improvised and educationally inadequate general secondary
classrooms currently housed in rented buildings (about 110 classrooms) (para.
1.09); (b) improving the quality of instruction, particularly in sciences, by
cancelling the second shift in about twelve rented secondary schools (para.
1.12); (c) improving access to secondary education by establishing nine
secondary general schools in areas where none currently exists; (d) reducing
the pressure upon existing secondary schools (50% of the project institutions
are expected to help reduce this pressure); and (e) improving the relevance of
secondary education by extending the prevocational instruction program (paras.
1.10, 1.11).



- 11 -
2.07     The curriculum for the proposed schools would include two hours per
week of prevocational instruction--consisting of general prevocational
instruction in grade 10 and a single vocational option in grades 11 and 12.
Each of the project schools would provide four vocational options chosen from
electricity, woodwork, metalwork, agriculture, home economics and commercial
specializations, on the basis of qualifications of available teachers.
2.08     The size of each proposed school has been determined by the MOE's
Planning and Research Directorate on the basis of detailed mapping of
projected preparatory school outputs and secondary school intake capacity in
each region. Total enrollments in the 18 general secondary schools would be
15,860 (6,450 girls and 9,410 boys), with an average utilization of 73 percent
(including workshops and laboratories). About half of the vacated rented
facilities would be used to accommodate an expansion of primary enrollments by
about 4,600 places.
2.09     The schools would require a total staff of 780, about one-third of
whom would come from the classes to be relocated from inadequate facilities.
Most of the remaining two-thirds would be recruited from the community
colleges and universities, the outputs of which are fully adequate to meet the
need for general subjects teachers arising from the new schools in the
proposed project. Teachers for the prevocational instruction courses in most
specializations in the project secondary schools would be drawn from the
graduates of Marka Polytechnic and the vocational specializations of the
Community Colleges. For other prevocational instruction specializations to be
offered in the project secondary schools, an adequate supply of instructors is
to be assured through the 183 months of instructor fellowships included in the
project.
Extensions to Existing General Secondary Schools
2.10     This component would help improve the quality of instruction,
particularly of science instruction (para. 1.12), and would support the
expansion of the prevocational instruction program at the secondary level
(paras. 1.10, 1.11) through the financing of construction, equipment and
furniture for 48 additional science laboratories, 49 additional libraries, and
50 multi-purpose workshops for 53 existing upper general secondary schools (24
for girls and 29 for boys--representing about 15% of the total and the least
equipped). Twenty-three laboratories of physics, 20 of chemistry, 4 of
biology and one of general science, including appropriate science equipment,
would be added to schools that currently do not have such a facility. In
addition, a total of 49 libraries and 50 multi-purpose workshops would be
added to those schools among the 53 secondary schools which currently lack
these facilities.
Technical Assistance
2.11     The proposed project would provide 183 months of fellowship training
for instructors in the project secondary school prevocational instruction
courses, and 48 months of specialist services for feasibility studies and
engineering designs for a possible follow-up project. In addition, it would
complete the reinforcement of MOE implementation capability (para. 1.13) by
providing TA in seven priority areas:



- 12 -
(a) In-Service Teacher Training. The Directorates of Education and
In-Service Training and Certification are planning a substantial
strengthening of their in-service teacher training programs,
including the establishment of pilot Teacher Development Centers
which would provide a variety of learning resources to teachers for
their own development and training. The success of these efforts
would depend on the appropriate support and strengthening of
supervisory and in-service training services. To ensure the success
of these programs, the proposed project would provide 21 man-months
of specialist services.
(b)  Education and Planning. In the interest of improved efficiency, the
five Regional Directorates of Education, under the Ministry's new
policy of devolving educational planning responsibilities to the
governorates, are preparing to progressively assume planning
responsibilities formerly held by the MOE central administration.
The TA to be provided to the Directorates of Education and Planning
under the proposed project would contribute to this effort through
the provision of 27 man-months of suitable training and study visits
for planners and trainers in the MOE and regional directorates.
(c) Exanminations. The proposed development by MOE of standardized student
aptitude and performance tests for preparatory-level students (grades
7-9) would be an important adjunct to the student guidance program
supported by the previous project. This component in the proposed
project would help extend the development of career and occupational
guidance services initiated under the Fifth Education Project through
the provision of appropriate fellowships (6 man-months) for training
of senior staff of the MOE Directorate of Examinations and Student
Guidance.
(d) Educational Technology. The newly created Directorate of Educational
Technology is developing a program to integrate the use of media and
materials into the teaching-learning process. Training and study
visits (12 man-months) for staff of the Directorate would be provided
under the proposed project to acquaint staff with production
techniques for educational television programs, animation and
scientific photography techniques, and utilization and maintenance of
precision science laboratory equipment.
(e) Community Colleges. The Government's network of community colleges,
supported in part under the third and fourth education projects,
require additional staff training inputs to enable them to fulfill
their role as a resource for the particular needs of surrounding
communities. To provide such training, the proposed project includes
12 months of fellowships and study visits.



- 13 -
(f) Computer Center. The MOE Management Information System (MIS), created
under the third education project, requires additional support for
manpower training in order to make fuller use of MIS facilities. For
this purpose, the proposed project includes 12 man-months of
fellowships and study visits.
(g) Project Implementation. The proposed project would complete the
strengthening of the MOE's Directorate of Projects (DOP) by providing
support for fellowships and study visits (16 man-months) for
upgrading staff in procurement procedures and technical assistance
management.
2.12     During negotiations, the Government confirmed its intention to assign
responsibility for implementation of the the TA program to the MOE's DOP. The
Government agreed that the MOE would assure staffing of the DOP Division in
charge of TA implementation with the number and qualifications of staff
necessary to effectively implement the TA program. The TA program is to be
implemented according to a plan to be provided to the Bank for review and
cmment by June 15, 1984 (paras. 3.18, 5.01(b), and 5.01(c)).

3.03     Basis of Cost Estimates.  Construction costs were estimated on the
basis of:  (a) schedules of accommodation for extensions to be provided under
the project; (b) final sketch plans for typical project institutions; and (c)
unit costs of other recently constructed comparable buildings. The areas per
student place allowed for in the project schools are similar to the median
unit areas in Bank-assisted school construction in other countries (Table
3.3). The estimated costs per square meter of gross construction area, which
average US$255 equivalent, are reasonable for the utilitarian standards of
construction allowed for. Furniture costs were estimated as a proportion
(10%) of construction costs, and equipment costs were derived from master
equipment lists prepared for comparable institutions. These were reviewed
during appraisal and found appropriate in scope and cost. Technical
assistance costs (about 1.5% of total project base cost) are estimated at an
average of US$10,300 per man-month for specialist services and US$3,100 per
man-month of fellowship training. The man-month costs for specialists include
housing and other benefits as well as recruitment and relocation costs. Fees
for design and supervision (10% of estimated construction costs) were
estimated on the basis of a draft consultancy contract and typical supervision
fee scales of Jordanian consulting architects.
3.04     Customs Duties and Taxes.  Estimated project costs do not include
direct taxes and custom duties, from which the project is exempt, but they
include about USt10 million in indirect taxes on locally purchased project
items.
3.05     Area and Cost per Place.  The following table shows unit areas and
costs for new project institutions, net of contingency allowances and
professional fees:

3.06     Contingency Allowances.  A physical contingency of 7.5% of base cost
(US$6.8 million) was added to the cost of all project items to allow for
unforeseen events. A price contingency allowance of 26.3% (US$24.0 million)
was added to the base cost plus physical contingencies. This figure is based
on the implementation schedule shown in Annex 2 and the following local and
foreign annual price escalation rates, starting from October 1983;
Table 3.4 PROJECTED ANNUAL PRICE ESCALATION
(Local and foreign costs)
Annual Price Escalation (in percent)

Technical assistance       7.0        7.0        6.0            6.0
3.07     Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange component of
US$61.2, representing 50% of estimated total project costs, was estimated on
the basis of the following estimated foreign exchange proportions for
individual categories of project expenditures: (a) site development, 30%;
(b) construction, 45%; (c) furniture, 62%; (d) equipment, 90%;
(e) professional services, 10%; and (f) technical assistance, 90%. These
percentages have been derived by: (a) determining the proportions of civil
works and furniture costs attributable to material, local and foreign labor,
overhead and profit; (b) reviewing awards for equipment and civil works made
under earlier loans; and (c) estimating the composition of the technical
assistance program.l/
Recurrent Cost
3.08     When fully operational in 1989, the project schools are estimated to
generate about JD 1.9 million in incremental recurrent costs (evaluated in
1983 prices). This amount would constitute a modest 2.0% addition to
projected recurrent costs of education, which is expected to be fully within
the Government's fiscal capability.
Financial Plan
3.09     The proposed Bank Loan of US$40.0 million would finance 65% of the
foreign exchange component of the project. As shown in Table 3.5 below, the
Bank Loan would finance all of the foreign costs of civil works and equipment
for the 31 new compulsory schools and for the extensions of the 53 existing
secondary schools, as well as all of the costs of technical assistance.
1/ It is estimated that 60% of civil works and furniture contracts would be
awarded to local firms and all equipment to overseas suppliers.

Disbursements
3.10     The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of six years, as
shown in Annex 4. Although this disbursement period is one year shorter than
the actual implementation periods for the first and second projects, which
closed in 1979 and 1982, respectively, it is consistent with the more recent
implementation experience of subsequent education projects in Jordan.
3.11     Disbursements would be made against:
(a) 45% of the total cost of civil works;



- 19 -
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures on directly imported equipment; 100% of
local expenditures ex-factory for locally manufactured equipment; 90%
of local expenditures for off-the-shelf equipment expenditures; and
(c) 100% of the total cost of fellowships and specialist services.
Disbursements are expected to be completed by December 31, 1989.
Accounting and Auditing
3.12     The Directorate of the Projects (DOP) maintains project-related
accounts in accordance with sound and generally recognized accounting
principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank. The Directorate would
submit to the Bank annual financial statements reflecting the financial
performance and position of the project. Such financial statements would be
the basis of annual auditing of expenditures by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank. The Government's Bureau of Audit is such an auditor. Beginning
with the first year of disbursements, annual audits would be submitted to the
Bank within eight months of the end of each fiscal year of the Government.
These audits would provide adequate apid timely information of the supervision
of loan disbursements and of the project in general. During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances that audited project accounts would be submitted
to the Bank annually (para. 5.01(e)).
Management
3.13     The project would be managed by existing organizational units in the
MOE. Principal implementation responsibility would rest with the DOP, which is
in charge of preparing and implementing all externally financed projects. The
DOP is organized into five sections; civil works, procurement, technical
assistance, accounts and a clerical support section. Functions of the DOP
sections can be summarized as follows:
(a)  Civil Works.  Selection of consultants and preparation of architects'
briefs; review of designs and bid documents and calling of tenders;
general supervision of construction; and monitoring of implementation
schedules.
(b)  Procurement.  Formation of technical committees to prepare equipment
lists and specifications; preparation of bidding documents,
organization of bidding, deliveries and installation; and monitoring
of implementation schedules.
(c)  Technical Assistance. Organization of programs for training experts
and recruiting fellows.
(d)  Accounts.  Keeping project accounts; dealing with the World Bank, the
Central Bank and commercial banks in respect of project finances;
arranging payments to suppliers and contractors and preparing
quarterly financial statements.
Other Government agencies with important implementation responsibilities
include MOE's Directorate of School Buildings which is, inter alia,
responsible for site acquisition. A tender committee organized by the Public
Works Department is responsible for the award of all civil works contracts.



- 20 -
3.14    The DOP staffing is being strengthened through staffing provisions
that were introduced under the Fifth Education Project (Loan 2246-JO): Two
procurement officers, two accountants, two quantity surveyors, an experienced
architect, and an experienced engineer have been added under the provisions of
that loan. To expedite equipment procurement, further strengthening and
streamlining of the procurement division would be required as follows:
(a) study tours of procurement staff to acquaint them with computer-assisted
procurement; (b) acquisition of word processing/microcomputer equipment
(including training); and (c) contracts with commercial freight forwarders to
assist in clearing project financed goods through Aqaba port.  The Government
has prepared a plan satisfactory to the Bank to improve the efficiency of the
Procurement Unit through use of the MOE's Management Information System. The
MOE is expected to start implementing this plan by September 30, 1984.
Status of Preparation
3.15    Sites.  Suitable sites for all project institutions have been
identified. Currently, 33 of the 47 sites have been acquired. During
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that all remaining sites
would be acquired by June 1984, and no problems are foreseen in acquisition of
these sites (para. 5.01(a)).
3.16    Designs and Supervision.  To augment the design capacity of its Public
Works Department, the Government has established an independent design office
at Yarmouk University. This office has a complete array of architects and
engineers engaged as full time senior staff, capable of conducting research,
preparing designs, drafting tender and contract documents and supervising
construction.   This design office has prepared prototype designs for the
project, based on educational and architectural research work conducted by the
office. Prototype designs were reviewed by the Bank in August 1983 and found
satistactory. Adaption of these approved prototype designs to individual
sites is in progress and is expected to be completed by mid 1984. Substantial
economies in construction costs will be realized when the new prototypes are
put into use: earlier standard designs in Jordan provided about 7.1 m2 (gross
area) per enrolled secondary school student, whereas the new designs are
expected to provide only about 4.9 m2 (gross area) per secondary school
student--a reduction of 31%.
3.17    Equipment and Furniture Needs.  Preliminary equipment lists for the
project institutions have been prepared by MOE technical committees and
approved by the Bank.  Final lists are under preparation by the DOP and are
expected to be completed by March 1984.
3.18    Technical Assistance.  Terms of reference and an implementation
schedule for technical assistance were prepared by the MOE, reviewed by the
Bank during appraisal and found satisfactory. The proposed schedule for
fellowship training and expert assignments is shown in Annex 3. The
Government plans to execute the technical assistance program through the
Technical Assistance section of the DOP. During negotiations, the Government
provided assurances that, for that purpose, the MOE would assure staffing of
the DOP Division in charge of TA implementation with the number and
qualifications of staff necessary to effectively implement the TA program.
The TA program is to be implemented according to a plan to be provided to the
B&nk for review and comment by June 15, 1984 (paras. 2.12 and 5.01(c)).



- 21 -
Implementation
3.19    To distribute the large implementation workload, the project would be
implemented in two phases. Phase I would incorporate the 21 new schools for
which sites were acquired as of appraisal (about 37% of total) and about 50%
of the extensions to existing facilities. Phase II would comprise the other
26 new schools and the remaining extensions.  Tender documents for Phase I and
Phase II schools are scheduled to be completed by July 1984 and January 1985,
respectively. Equipment and furniture procurement would be coordinated to
follow the pace of construction.  Recruitment of technical assistance would
start in July 1984.
3.20    The Project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1989; the proposed
Closing Date is December 31, 1989.
3.21    ICB Procurement.  Civil works contracts for most of the 31 new
compulsory schools to be financed under the loan (averaging US$1.9 million
each, including contingencies) would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines. The aggregate
amount of civil works contracts to be awarded under ICB is estimated at
US$45.3 million equivalent. Equipment to be financed under the loan would be
grouped to the extent possible in large packages for bulk procurement. All
equipment to be financed under the proposed loan would be procured under the
following procedures: Contracts for bid packages exceeding US$100,000
equivalent estimated vaLue would be awarded on the basis of ICB. Items which
cannot practicably be grouped in bid packages of more than US$lO0,000
equivalent estimated value, or items of a specialized nature for which ICB
would not be appropriate, would be procured under government procedures to be
satisfactory to the Bank and to include, to the extent posible, quotations
from at least three manufacturers or suppliers. Such procurement of equipment
items by means other than ICB would be subject to an aggregate value limit of
US$l.0 million equivalent (corresponding to about 9% of the total estimated
value of equipment to be financed under the loan, including contingency
allowances). In the comparision of bids obtained on the basis of ICB, local
manufacturers would be allowed a margin of preference equal to the existing
rate of customs duties applicable to competing imports or 15% of the CIF
price, whichever is lower. Prior Bank review of procurement documentation and
contract award recommendations would be required for all equipment and civil
works contracts awarded on the basis of ICB.
*      3.22    Other Procurement Procedures.  Civil works contracts for the small,
dispersed extensions to existing institutions (averaging about US$0.23 million
equivalent and aggregating US$12.3 million) and for the two most remote
compulsory schools (up to a total contract value of US$3.0 million) would be
unlikely to interest international contractors and could therefore be awarded
in accordance with local bidding procedures to be acceptable to the Bank.
Expert services would be acquired in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants.
3.23    Maintenance.  Earlier Bank-assisted school facilities have, with few
exceptions, been acceptably maintained. Maintenance facilities have recently
been strengthened through the introduction of eight mobile maintenance units,
financed under the Third Education Project (Loan 1781-JO).

IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01     The proposed project would make an important contribution to
achieving the Government's plan to upgrade school facilities and to increase
the vocational orientation of general instruction at the primary, preparatory
and secondary levels. The project responds to a specific Government request
that future Bank involvement in the education sector go beyond its past
support of teacher training, vocational education and institutional
development, to directly assist in improving the quality of primary school
facilities and to provide an employment orientation for the majority of
students who will never pursue actual vocational training.
4.02     Substantial economies in secondary school construction costs will be
realized when recently developed prototypes are put into country-wide use.
These new designs are expected to provide only about 4.9m2(gross area) per
secondary school student--a reduction of 31% from earlier standard designs in
Jordan.
Risks
4.03     There are no undue risks anticipated with the proposed project.  The
couponents are identical or similar to those already being implemented
satisfactorily under the Government's own program. However, due to frequent
spacing of education projects at the Government's request, the current project
might tax the current implementation capacity of the MOE. For that reason,
the project provides for sufficient strengthening of MOE implementation
capacity in vital areas (paras. 2.11, 2.12, 3.18 and 5.01).
4.04     The timely availability of the substantial Government contribution
(about US$76 million) would be essential for smooth project implementation.
This matter was discussed with the Government who confirmed that in view of
high priority given to this project, all necessary measures would be taken.
The expenditures for the first two implementation years have been budgeted and
those for future years programmed.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01     During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:
(a)  The remaining sites would be acquired by June 1984;
(b)  The MOE's DOP would implement the technical assistance program in the
proposed project (paras. 2.12 and 3.18);
(c)  For that purpose, the MOE would assure staffing of the DOP Division
in charge of TA implementation with the number and qualifications of
staff necessary to effectively implement the TA program. The TA
program is to be implemented according to a plan to be provided to
the Bank for review and comment by June 15, 1984 (paras. 2.12 and
3.18).
(d)  The TA program would be carried out in accordance with a time
schedule satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 2.12 and 3.18); and
(e)  Project accounts would be audited annually by the Government's Audit
Bureau and the audited accounts submitted to the Bank within eight
months of the end of each fiscal year, beginning with the first year
of project disbursement (para 3.12).
5.02     Subject to the above conditions, the project provides a suitable
basis for a Bank Loan of US$40.0 million equivalent to the Hashemite Kingdom
of Jordan for a term of 17 years, including a grace period of four years.
