KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
NATIONAL WATER REHABILITATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:       Kingdom of Morocco.
Loan Amount:   US$60 million equivalent.
Terms:          Twenty years,  including five years of grace, at the standard
variable interest  rate.   US$15.5 million and US$39.0 million
would be onlent to ONEP and the Regies, respectively, under the
same terms and conditions.   ONEP and the Regies would assume
the foreign exchange risk and the variable interest risk.
Beneficiaries: The National Water Production Authority (ONEP) and the sixteen
Water Supply Companies (RWgies), the Regies' Directorate (DRSC)
of the Ministry of Interior and the Hydraulic Administration
(AR) of the Ministry of Equipment.
Project
Description:   The  proposed project constitutes  the least cost solution to
rehabilitate  water  supply  systems  in  Morocco.    It  would
introduce long term policy reforms that would strengthen the
overall development of  the  sector.   The  project  would:  (a)
rehabilitate and improve the efficiency of the existing
production  and  distribution  systems;   (b)  strengthen   the
financial policies of the sector to gradually increase cost
recovery of operating and investment expenditures; and (c)
strengthen   sector   institutions   through   institutional   and
administrative   reforms,   training  programs   and   investment
planning. The proposed project includes (i) provision of leak
detection equipment and pipe and valve locating equipment; (ii)
rehabilitation   of   existing   production   facilities   and
distribution networks; (iii) acquisition of water meters; (iv)
studies to develop and/or update water master plans, prepare
systematic preventive maintenance programs and identify future
investment   programs;   (v)   introduction  of  new  financial
policies; (vi) studies of sector organization, cost accounting,
management   information  systems  and  provision  of  related
computer equipment; (vii) training and technical assistance to
ONEP, the R6gies and Ministry of Interior; (viii) development
and implementation of an appropriate system to develop and
coordinate water resource management; and (ix) development of a
program to improve the procurement process in the R4gies. The
project would directly benefit about 8.6 million people by the
year 1992. The risks associated with the project are low due
to the commitment of the implementing agencies to the project
and the relative simplicity of the works to be carried out.
Timely implementation of institutional, administrative and
financial reforms would be a function of the political
feasibility of those reforms.  Given the fact that Government
has initiated actions and expressed its full commitment to the
implementation of these reforms, the risk of delays in their
implementation would be minimal.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY REHABILfTATION PROJECT
STAFF APRASAL REPORT -
L THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Country Baekground
1.01     Morocco  is  situated  in  the northwestern  corner  of  Africa.   The
Mediterranean Sea forms its boundary to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the
east, and the narrow fertile strip of Algeria to the northeast. Elsewhere the
country is bordered by the Sahara. The country's four climatic zones reflect
this setting: the coastal areas, the interior plains, the mountains, and the
desert.   The  interior  plains  and  the coastal  zone enjoy a Mediterranean
climate with the interior having greater seasonal and diurnal temperature
variations.   Summers  are  hot  and  dry,  while  spring and  fall  rains  are
generally light and irregular with the main precipitation concentrated in the
few winter  moaths.   Hence  either natural  or artificial  water  storage  is
required to compensate for the seasonal and irregular rainfalls.
1.02     According to the 1982 Census, 8.7 million persons, or almost 432 of
the total population of 20.4 million, were urbanized, with urban growth rates
averaging 4.5% over the preceding decade. Natural growth accounted for about
601 of the increase,  in-migration from rural areas for the remainder.  In
spite of the preeminence of Casablanca (2,530,000 inhabitants) and the
capital, Rabat-Sale (990,000 inhabitants), Morocco has a well-balanced network
of small and medium-sized cities. About two-thirds of GDP is generated in
urban areas, and urban incomes are at least 302 higher than (and have been
increasing twice as fast as) those in rural areas. The urban population is
expected to reach 55-602 of the projected national total of 31 million by the
end of the century.
1.03     Urban growth has increased the severity of urban deficiencies.  The
old urban cores have become overcrowded and insufficiently serviced; housing
development, especially at the urban periphery, has occurred faster than the
Governments capacity to control and manage it.  This development is of two
types:   substandard   slum  areas   (72  of   the   urban   population)   and
informal/illegal  housing  settlements  (132 of  the urban population).   Both
types harbor low-income groups, although the slum dwellers have slightly lower
incomes than those in informal settlements. In spite of a slowdown in urban
population growth during the last decade, additional urban growth and
rural-to-urban migration is inevitable given the country's present state of
economic  development  and  socio-economic  determinants.   Urban  growth  is
expected to average 3.42 over the period 1987-2000.



Water Resources
1.04     Water   is  scarce  in  Morocco.    The  annual  rainfall  averages
30 billion ma, out of which 22.5 billion m3 are drained by the rivers and
7.5 billion m3 infiltrate and recharge acquifers.  About 8X of the exploited
resources  is  used  for  domestic  and  industrial  purposes  and  92£  for
agriculture. The overall national water balance is relatively well known and
with the completion, by the end of 1987, of the water resources master plans
for the major river basins, financed under the Second and Third Water Supply
Projects (Loan 1724-MOR and 2006-MOR), about 902 of the potential water
resources will have been surveyed.
1.05     Most of the potable water supplied to settlements up to medium-sized
cities is groundwater.   However,  as  existing  sources become exhausted  or
deteriorate in quality, surface water sources are exploited, requiring
conveyance over greater distances, as well as the provision of storage
reservoirs,  treatment  and  large; transmission  pipelines.   The  physical,
chemical and bacteriological quality of drinking water supplied in most of
Morocco's urban areas is acceptable. However, this is not the case in most of
the rural areas where groundwater is often contaminated through unsanitary
domestic waste disposal.
Seotor Organization
1.06     Study and  development of water resources  for  all  users  is  the
responsibility of the "Administration de l'Hydraulique" within the Ministry of
Equipment.   This  Administration  is  also  responsible  for  the  operation,
maintenance and control of all major dams.  Allocation of water resources
amongst various consumers is, at present, determined by a special commission
within the Prime Minister's office.
1.07     Production   of   potable   water  and   conveyance   to  the  larger
agglomerations is ensured by the "Office National de l'Eau Potable" (ONEP)
under  the  tutelage  of  the  Ministry  of  Equipment.   Municipally-owned
enterprises, the "Regies", are in charge of water distribution in the sixteen
largest urban agglomerations.- Ten of these Regies are also responsible for
electricity distribution.  The Regies are under the tutelage of the Ministry
of Interior and are managed adequately. However, there is scope to improve
further the operations of the Regies, in particular of those that are recently
established.   Whilst  some  Regies  still  exploit  their  own  groundwater
resources, the quantities produced are small and are increasingly being
supplemented by ONEP's water.  In the small- and medium-sized agglomerations
where water is not yet supplied by intercommunal or regional R6gies, ONEP or
occasionally municipal services operate the water production as well as the
distribution facilities.  This is considered an interim arrangement pending
the growth of these water supply systems to a size warranting the creation of
independent Regies, or their incorporation in an existing one.
1.08     The  construction and,  to some extent,  the  maintenance  of  water
systems in rural areas has traditionally been the responsibility of the
Ministry of Agriculture with the rural communities ensuring day to day
operations.  However, with the implementation of the communal reform dating
back to 1976, the Ministry of Interior, as the controlling authority of the



-3-
communes, is now starting to play a more active role in identifying basic
infrastructure needs including water supply in the rural communes. Defining
and implementing adequate &rrangements to ensure proper operation and
maintenance of rural water supply systems is an issue addressed on a pilot
basis by the on-going regional water supply component of the Third Water
Supply  Project  (Loan 2006-MOR)  currently under  implementation.   Follow-up
action in rural areas will be considered after completion of this component
and review of its impact.. on the quality of services.
Water Suply
1.09     Relatively high per capita  investment costs  in  rural  areas  and
budgetary constraints have so far directed most of the investments to the
densely populated urban areas where limited financial resources can yield
maximum benefits.   Presently, most of  tne urban population has access to
public water with about 631 served by house connections and 201 by public
standpipes.   The remaining population,  or about 171, is served by private
wells. Operation and maintenance of the standpipes is adequate, as well as
the quality of water, although potential risks of contamination from sewage
exist due to leaking water pipes and the discontinuity of services. In the
rural areas, only about 282 of the total population has access to a safe water
supply.   Countrywide  improvement  in  the  service  levels  is being achieved
through the responsible agencies, namely ONEP and the Regies in urban areas,
and the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Interior in rural areas.
The Government policy is to maintain service levels and cater for growth in
urban areas and gradually increase the service level in the rural areas. This
policy is consistent with the Moroccan stabilization program and institutional
reforms envisaged for the sector.
1.10     The number of households connected to the water distribution system
in the urban areas increased on average by 9.3X per year from 1980 to 1985,
while the total urban population increased by about 4.51 per year. During the
same period, the service level (for the population with household connections)
increased from 481 to 631. The introduction in 1980 of credit facilities for
low income customers for financing the cost of individual house connections
has contributed more -than 20% of the improvement  in the service level.  A
recent assessment of the investments needed to meet future water supply demand
showed that this would require, depending on the desired service level,
between  0.6%  and  0.3%  of  GNP,  or  between  72  and  31  of  gross  fixed
investments.  A high service level foresees that by the year 2000, 751 of the
urban population and 251 of the rural population would be connected to a water
distribution system and that the remaining 25% of the urban population and 751
of the rural population would be served by standpfpes.  A low service level
would accommodate the increases in populatica at existing service levels. For
the next Five-Year Plan (19a8-92), investments of about US$430 million would
be required to meet the lower alternative objective.
Sewera e
1.11     The development of sewerage services has not been commensurate with
that of water supply.  Although  sewage  collection systems exist  in most
medium-sized and large cities, they have not been extended to cope with the
rapid growth of the population and industry and in most cases are insufficient



-4-
and poorly maintained.    Communities  of  the  interior  discharge  untreated
sewage into rivers which are usually not perennial, while coastal communities
discharge  effluents  at  the  shore  line.   This  practice  entails  serious
pollution of the environment and creates a health hazard to the population.
Sewerage  80  far has been  the  reponsibility of  the municipalities  which,
because  of  financial  constraints,  have  been  unable  to  ensure  proper
functioning let a.one the required expansion.  The systems are generally in a
serious state of disrepair and maintenance is often limited to repairs after
breakdowns.  Lack of personnel with adequate technical skill is common and
compounds  maintenance  deficiencies.   The  Government  has  been  examining
modalities to improve the management of the sewerage subsector in cooperation
with the Bank (para 1.18) and,  in January 1985, as a pilot operation the
Government transferred the sewerage responsibility in the Greater Casablanca
area from the municipal authorities to the water distributing R6gie (RAD).
Seetor Constrits
1.12     The  four  main  issues  constraining  sector  development  are  (i)
institutional, (ii) financial, (iii) administrative, and (iv) technical.
1.13     At the institutional level, the sector is characterized by:
(a)  a need to improve planning and coordination for the development
and allocation of water resources;
(b)  inadequate legal framework to ensure effective water resources
management;
(c)  a need for better coordination of investment planning between
ONEP, the Regies and the local industries;
(d)  a need to create clearer contract-ial relationships between the
Government and ONEP;
(e)  a tendency towards unclear responsibilities for water production
and water distribution between the various authorities involved
in the sector (ONEP, Regies, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry
of Interior and local communities); and
(f)  a strong political influence in the Regies' Board of Directors.
1.14     Financially, the sector faces the following constraints:
(a)  absence of a standard national accounting system;
(b)  inadequacy of financial control and auditing for the Regies;
(c)  inadequacy of existing cost accounting systems in ONEP and the
R6gies;
(d)  high  level  of  arrears  from  the  Administration  and  public
enterprises;
(e)  insufficient distribution cost mark up of the Regies to ensure
adequate operation and maintenance; and
(f)  inadequate fixed assets inventory and valuation by the R6gies.
1.15     The daily management of ONEP and the Regies could be improved by:
(a)  standardized  performance  monitoring  criteria  to  be  used  by
variouts miristries which constantly require information;
(b) a standard management information system within the R6gies and
improved organizetion of the Tnter R6gies Computer Center
(SIRTI); and



-5-
(c) an awareness by the Regies Directorate ("Direction des Regies et
Services Concedes" - DRSC) of the need to improve coordination,
policy guidance, projectal evaluation and monitoring.
1.16     Technically,  the RMgies,  particularly those created since 1976 to
take over poorly managed municipal water supply systems, are characterized by
a relatively high level of unaccounted-for water (25 to 55%) in some areas,
inadequate leak detection equipment and maintenance programs, insufficient
distribution reservoir capacity and intermittent water supply services.
Furthermore, existing water supply master plans have become outdated and do
not accurately reflect present and expected urban development.
Bank's Involvement in the Sector
1.17     The Bank has been active in the development of the sector since 1968
with three loans for water supply projects and one for a aewerage study.  In
conjunction with the First Water Supply Project (Loan 850-MOR), which was
completed  in  1980,  ONEP  was established  and  the  construction  of  water
production facilities along the Mid-Atlantic Coast was financed.  The Second
Water Supply Project (Loan 1724-MOR), under implementation, is contributing to
the financing of the expansion of water production facilities for the
mid-Atlantic Coast and Greater Agadir.  In addition this project is providing,
on a pilot basis, the means for low income customers to finance the cost of
individual house connections through the establishment of a revolving fund.
The Third Water Supply Project (Loan 2006-MOR), which became effective in
March 1982, directs Bank financial assistance to the construction of regional
water supply systems, water supply systems in medium-sized towns in the
country's interior and a substantial expansion of credit facilities for house
connections. As in the case of the first Bank loan, the two projects under
implementation  are  contributing  to  develop  ONEP  into  a  prominent  and
efficiently managed organization.
1.18     The first and only Bank loan t, the sewerage sector is an Engineering
Loan (S-7-MOR), which assisted in the financing of a sewerage study for the
Greater Casablanca area.   A  follow-up project was  recently appraised  for
possible Bank financing.
1.19     Seven Bank financed projects in the agricultural sector relating to
irrigation and/or rural development contain water supply components providing
potable water at public standpipes in villages within the relevant project
areas.    Two   urban   development   projects   contain   the   provision   of
infrastructure, including water distribution and sewers in the project area.
The Pilot Project for the Communal Infrastructure Fund (FEC) (Loan 2272-MOR)
is geared to building up this institution by financing infrastructure
investments including water and sewerage in urban centers. This project also
includes the strengthening of FEC's organization and staffing, improving Loan
preparation,  appraisal  of  sub-projects,  projects'  pipeline  development,
programming of operations and financial planning.
Bank's Experience with Past Lending
1.20     The Bank has in the past oriented its lending to improve the access
to  a  safe  water  supply  of  the  low-income  population  in  urban  and



-6
semi-urbanized areas thtrough individual house connections and has begun, on a
pilot basis, financing water systems that aiso benefit the rural population.
The first Bank-financed project (Loan 850-MOR of US$48.0 million, dated July
1972) was to ensure a safe and reliable water supply to the coastal area
extending from Casablanca to Kenitra. As mentioned in the Project Performance
Audit Report NO. 3721 dated December 16, 1981, the project achieved its
objectives and was instrumental in developing ONEP into a competent water
production authority. The main project components (dam, pumping, transmission
and water treatment facilities) were completed by mid 1976 according to
schedule, while construction of staff housing and training center took four
more years than anticipated to complete. Apart from the creation of ONEP as a
national authority responsible for the planning, execution and operation of
water production works, the project substantially improved the capability of
local manufacturers, the local construction industry and local engineering
consultants  in  the  field  of  design  and  supervision  of  construction.
Particularly  noteworthy  was  the  adoption  by  the  Government  of  the
recommendations of the tariff study in the formulation of a tariff structure
based on the long run incremental cost of providing water services. This has
fostered the development of the sector as a whole. The second loan (S-7-MOR
of August 1977) provided for the financing of a feasibility study, including
preliminary designs for the sewerage facilities of the Greater Casablanca
area.   Substantial  delay  in  start  up  was  incurred  due  to  the  lengthy
coordination problems between the various administrations involved. However,
once this problem was solved, consultants mobilized rapidly and project
implementation progressed smoothly. The Completion Report (No 5131 of June
14, 1984) concluded that the project studies have been successfully completed
and will assist the Government to address the major aspects of the sewerage
sector in general. The third and fourth Loans (1724-MOR and 2006-MOR) are
under implementation.   They include further expansion of ONEP's bulk water
production and transmission facilities in both urban and rural areas and
introduce a credit facilities mechanism to finance house connections and
related charges of the low income customers of the Regies and ONEP.
Tmplementation of these components is now progressing satisfactorily after
initial delays due to cumbersome administrative procedures.  Under the first
Bank pilot project (Loan 2272-MOR), the Communal Infrastructure Fund (FEC) is
responsible for the preparation, appraisal and supervision of all FEC financed
projects with the Regies and local communities. FEC is slowly developing into
a well organized and adequately staffed institution. However, large projects
for transportation Regies and major land development schemes still far
outstrip its present capacity to appraise and follow-up projects.  Corrective
measures currently under discussion with the Bank, such as the implementation
of financial restructuring measures and the introduction of a new organization
structure, staffing development and training, should assist FEC in developing
further into a well managed and more efficient financial intermediary. At
this stage of FEC's development, it is however premature to designate FEC as
the lead coordinating agency  for  implementing  the proposed  project.   The
proposed project reflects the Bankl'  experience with past lending for water
supply in Morocco.
Sectoral Strategy
1.21     The  Bank's  overall  sector  lending  strategy  is  to  assist  the
Government in resolving major sector issues (paras 1.12 to 1.16) through
policy reforms and sector £djustment measures, such as strengthening of cost



-7-
recovery principles, pursuit of sound financing mechanisms including financial
resource mobilization, and to foster the development of a strong institutional
framework in order to effectively contribute to the country's overall
development process. This strategy aims also at institutionalizing a rational
decision  process  for new investments in water production and distribution
facilities. Whereas in the past investments were geared to the development of
water production to cope with the rapid growth of urban population, future
Bank involvement should concentrate first on the improvement of the use of
searce resources, particularly by reducing water losses in the production and
distribution networks. The proposed project with the Regies would ensure that
new investments in water production and distribution facilities are the result
of coordinated and rational planning between ONI.P and the Regies.   Greater
efforts would also be made  to find in the medium term a more equitable
tradeoff between investments in urban areas and rural agglomerations thereby
ensuring that existing service levels are at least maintained, However, in
view of the country's budgetary constraints, the Government has decided to
approve only investments that maximize the return on existing facilities and
do not depend on allocations  from  the Government's  budget,  and  to delay
implementation of costly new investments in large water production and-
conveyance schemes.
1.22     In the sewerage subsector, the Bank's major long-term objective is to
assist the Government, through the establishment of appropriate financial
policies and tariff structure, in the creation of competent and financially
viable institutions which can implement sound policies and efficiently manage
the sector, safeguard the environment from po'lution and health hazards by
applying  appropriate  technologies  for  sewage  collection,  treatment  and
disposal, and plan and implement adequate expansion programs.
1.23     This  sectoral  strategy will be  implemented  through  the  proposed
National  Water Supply Rehabilitation Project.   This strategy is consistent
with the Government's objectives for rationalizing Public Enterprises (PEs),
as supported by the recently approved Public Enterprise Rationalization Loan
(PERL), These objectives and the specific actions to be undertaken in the
water supply sector are presented in Annex 1. Since ten out of the sixteen
Regies are responsible for water supply and electricity, many of the
restructuring  actions  proposed  for  the  R6gies,  i.e.  cost  accounting,
management  information  system  and  technical  assistance  to  the  Regies'
Directorate, integrate specific requirements of both sectors.
HI THE PROJECT AREA
Location - Special Features
2.01     The project area (Map IBRD No. 19448 and Map IBRD No. 19449) covers
thirty five of the forty-one provincial capital centers.  In 1985, thirteen
out of a total of sixteen R6gies were operating their own production
facilities to supplement ONEP's bulk water supply. The combined volume of
water produced by the R6gies amounted to 101 million cubic meters, mainly from
groundwater.   In the same year. ONEP produced 378 million cubic meters of
water of which about 51S from surface water. The population living in the
project area is estimated at 8.7 million inhabitants or about 85% of the total
urban population of Morocco.



Existing Water SUPPI,Y Sstems
2.02     All centers included in the project area have  central  or  inter-
connected water supply systems consisting of conventional water production and
treatment works, reservoirs and distribution networks. Many of these systems
were installed during the first half of this century. Regular maintenance was
not carried out satisfactorily when the systems were operated by municipal,
services.   The  Regies  and  ONEP  thus  inherited  badly  neglected  systems
operating  well  below  their design  capacity.   With  the  creation of water
distributing Regies from 1961 to 1980 and the establishment of ONEP in 1972,
the most urgent repairs or replacement works have been carried out.  Water
meters have also been installfd on every house connection and public
standpipe. However, water losses in the distribution systems recently taken
over are still relatively high (32% on average) and about 12% of the water
meters are constantly out of order. Detailed data on individual water supply
facilities of the Regies are presented in Annex 2.
Population Served and Levels of Services

Overall, 832 of the total population is served, 632 by house connections and a
further 201 by standpipes.
Population Projections and Water SuPPlY Demand
2.04     Based on the 1982 census and projected population growth patterns
specific to each urban center estimated to average 3.4% per annum, the total
population of the project area is expected to reach 12.1 million by year
1995. Detailed projections are presented in Annex 3.
2.05     The water demand at the end of the project implementation period is
presented   in  Annex  4.    The   projected   water   production,   including
unaccounted-for water,  and water consumption are based upon (i) projected
population  served  and  (ii)  unit  water  consumption  per  capita  including
industries and administration hater consumption. In view of the continuation
of tL.e house connection program implemented by ONEP and the R6gies (para
1.20), the projected population served by house connections would reach 8.8
million by the end of 1995. Taking into account a price elasticity of 0.3 and
a projected GDP growth of about 31 per year, the average daily water
consumption would increase from 176 lcd in 1985 to 195 lcd in 1995.  It is
assumed that the water losses will be gradually reduced from 321 in 1985 to
26% in 1990 and 20% in 1995 through the proposed leak detection and repair
works, rehaoilitation of the water works and implementation of a systematic
preventive maintenance program.   As a result,  the average  projected gross
water production for the project area is expected to reach 1.9 million
m3/day in 1995 or a 50% increase over the 1985 level of 1.3 million
m3/day. This progression represents an annual average increase of about 41
which is reasonable when compared to previous growth pattern of 6% per year.
m. THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01     The severe budgetary constraints existing in Morocco for the past
four years have prevented the Government from undertaking new investment
projects  with  a  significant budgetary  impact.   Government sector  lending
strategy was redirected towards the optimization of the efficiency of existing
production and distribution facilities before considering further expansion
programs.  This approach is fully consonant  with  the water supply sector
strategy paper prepared by the Bank which was discussed with the Government in
early  1984.   The  proposed  project  was  identified  in  February  1984  and
preparation started immediately thereafter.
3.02     The Regies and ONEP, assisted by consultants, have prepared detailed
rehabilitation work programs, cost estimates, statistical data and financial
statements  for  the  last  four years.   Only  simple detail design work was
required for the proposed rehabilitation project. No feasibility stt-dies -were
required.   The Regies' engineering consultants prepared detailed design and
tender documents for the distribution reservoirs and their related equipment.
Individual technical reports on the proposed rehabilitation works were
completed in June 1985 and reviewed in July 1985 by engineering consultants



recruited by the Rhgies' Directorate (DRSC) of the Ministry of Interior. The
reports were reviewed and updated by Bank staff in February 1987. They served
as a basis for the appraisal of the proposed project.
RPo*ect Objectives
3.03     The need to increase the productivity and the coordination of Public
Investments in the water supply sector calls for a set of restructuring
actions whose objectives are to:
(i)    develop the Government and water supply companies' capabilities
to identify, prepare, appraise and monitor projects which meet
strictly defined economic and financial criteria;
(ii)    improve the performance of the water supply companies through
organizational, financial and management reforms;
(iii)    reduce  progressively  the  dependence  of  ONEP  on  budgetary
transfers;
(iv)    rehabilitate existing installations to increase the quantity of
water available for distribution and reduce operating costs; and
(v)    improve the overall sector management and investment planning
through the creation of a National Water Council, a sector
investment coordination committee and the enforcement of a Water
Code.
3.04     A  systematic  reduction  in water  losses will  allow  the increased
average water demand to be met over an additional period of two to three years
after the existing production facilities have reached full utilization
capacity. This, combined with the construction of distribution reservoirs to
ba_ance daily peak demands, will postpone the need for future investment in
water production capacity and thereby result in a rational planning process
which will ensure that higher returns on existing investments could be
achieved.   The updating of the water master plans, the upgrading  of cost
accounting procedures, the introduction of a management information system and
the proposed technical assistance component will contribute to the improvement
of sector development planning and control. The project will therefore have a
major impact not only on the efficiency of the institutions involved in the
sector but also on the water resources development and overall sector
management.
Proiect Description and Related PoicY Measures
3.05     Policy  reforms= and sector adjustment measures discussed with the
Government to alleviate the constraints facing the sector (paras 1.12 to 1.16)
address the rehabilitation and restructuring needs of ONEP, the sixteen water
supply Regies, the Hydraulic Administration and DRSC. They will consist of
the following components:*



-ll-
(i) Technical Restructuring (detailed description is given in Annex 10)
(a)    rehabilitation of existing production facilities and water
distribution systems;
(b)    construction and rehabilitation of distribution reservoirs
and  related  equipment  uecessary  to  provide  adequate
pressure zones and to meet daily peak demand;

water meters and miscellaneous equipment;
(d)    provision of leak detection equipment, and pipe and valve
locating equipment;
(e)    studies  to  develop  and/or  update  water  master  plans,
prepare systematic preventive maintenance programs and
identify future investment programs for the Regies and ONEP
(para 3.23);

of potential water resources already carried out by the
Hydraulics Administration (para 3.34);
(ii) Institutional Restructuring
(a)    development and implementation of a system to develop water
resource management strategies and to regulate the use and
disposal of water (paras 3.29 and 3.30);
(b)    creation of a technical committee to coordinate long-term
investment planning between ONEP and the Regies (paras 3.31
and 3.32);
(c)    study  of  the optimum  institutional  organization of  the
water supply sector (para 3.33);
(d)    improvement of the procurement decision making process of
the Regies (para 3.37);

(contrat plan) between the Government and ONEP (para 5.09);
(iii) Financial Restructuring
(a)    accounting studies for ONEP and the Regies (paras 4.13 and
4.15);
(b)    inventory  and  valuation  of  existing  assets  within  the
Regies (para 4.15);
(c)    enforcement  by  Government,  starting  in  FY1987,  of  a
mechanism   to   settle   public   administrations   arrears
vis-k-vis ONEP and the Regies, as well as implementation of
measures to prevent future build-up of arrears (paras 4.19
and 4.20);



-12-
(d)    introduction of independent external audit of the Regies
(paras 4.21 and 4.22);
(e)    introduction of new financial policies for the R6gies and
ONEP (paras 5.06 and 5.08);
(iv) Administrative Restructuring
(a)    technical  assistance  for  the  appraisal  of  the  Regies'
sub-projects and coordination and control of sub-project
implementation (para 3.26);
(b)    study  of  standard  monitoring  criteria  to  be  used  by
Government   for   controlling   the  Regies'   and   ONEP's
performance (para 4.06);
(c)    study of a standard management information system for the
R6gies and reorganization of the inter-Regies' computer
center (SIRTI) (para 4.09);
(d)    provision  of  computer  equipment  for   the   Hydraulics
Administration, ONEP and the R6gies (paras 3.34, 4.06 and
4.09); and
(e)    study  of  the  Regies'  training  needs,  assessment  of  a
comprehensive    training   program   and   provision   of
fellowships,   training  experts  and  training  equipment
(para 4.12).
3.06     The above-mentioned policy reforms and sector adjustment measures are
specific  to  the  Water  Supply  sector.   In  the  framework  of  the  Public
Enterprises Rationalisation Loan (PERL) (para 1.23), the Government envisages
broader restructuring measures to further improve the management of its public
enterprises.  These measures are as follows:
(i)    design and implementation of a National Accounting system.  This
will allow a consistent presentation and a better understanding
of the PEs' financial situation;
(ii)    introduction  in  the  PEs of a posteriori  control  procedures
instead of the existing prior controls of expenditures.   This
will accelerate, within the framework of performance contracts
("contrats  plan") and agreed annual  investment  budgets,  the
implementation of the PEs' projects and reduce the level of
arrears towards the companies' suppliers. These measures will
be supplemented by annual external audits of the PEs;
(iii)    tariff  studies  based  on  long-run  marginal  cost  for  the
electricity, water supply and transportation sectors; and
(iv)    general settlement of Public Enterprises' arrears up to December
31, 1986 with measures to prevent future build-up of arrears.
3.07     The matrix of  restructuring actions developed under PERL and the
proposed National Water Supply Rehabilitation Project are presented in Annex 1.

Status of Project regaration
3.08     The Regies and ONEP have prepared technical reports indicating the
location of defective and obsolete facilities, the rationale for repair or
replacement, the physical characteristics of their individual rehabilitation
components  and  the  cost  estimate  of  the  proposed  works.   The  proposed
rehabilitation of distribution networks is not a complex operation, but the
works are small, scattered over a wide area and should be executed in close
coordination with ongoing operations to avoid disruption of services. About
50S of the pipelaying works will therefore be executed under force account and
will represent about 7% of the total project cost (para 3.38).  Where the
R6gies and ONEP will not have at their disposal the necessary heavy
construction equipment, works will be carried out under contracts using Local
Competitive Bidding procedures (para 3.41).  The bidding documents for these
works will be prepared by their technical staff during the first year of
project implementation. The Regies and ONEP's staff have proven in the past
their capability for carrying out works under LCB procedures.
3.09     Some  Regies  are  experiencing  high  service  pressure  in  their
distribution networks, unbalanced distribution patterns and high growth rates
in consumption. On the basis of existing masterplans and technical studies,
they have prepared detailed designs and bid documents for the construction of
distribution reservoirs. The reservoir capacity in several ONEP distribution
centers will be supplemented through provision of additional distribution
reservoirs. Detailed designs and bid documents have been prepared by ONEP in
accordance with standard documents developed in the framework of the Third
Water Supply Project (Loan 2006-MOR).
3.10     The replacement or repair of distribution system appurtenances, water
meters   and  miscellaneous  equipment  is  based  on  available  technical
specifications and estimated costs are based on recent quotations obtained by
the water supply companies. Bidding documents will be prepared by ONEP and
the Regies as required during project implementation.
3.11     For the Regies sector loan component, the Government confirmed during
negotiations that the "Direction des Regies et Services Conce'd6s" (DRSC) of
the Ministry of Interior will establish in cooperation with ONEP and FEC a
Project Unit to assist the Regies in completing the appraisal of sub-projects
(paras  3.24  to 3.26).   Individual  appraisals  will be based on  technical
documents and updated cost estimates already prepared by the R6gies.
3.12     The proposed project will provide funding for a number of studies and
for technical assistance and training. Terms of reference have been prepared
for water resources development studies, for water master plan studies,
including the development of leak detection and preventive maintenance
programs, for a management information study, for studies to introduce
standardized cost accounting procedures among the R6gies and for studies to
assess the R6gies' training needs and prepare a comprehensive training
program. The training component will include about 250 nanweeks of staff
attendance at seminars organized by international training institutes and the
provision of training equipment for the Regies' and ONEP's training centers in
Casablanca and Rabat.



-14-
3.13     Finally, a draft Decree for the creation of a National Water Council
which  would  be  responsible  for  developing  water  resources  management
strategies and a draft Water Code which would govern the use and disposal of
water  in  Morocco  (para  3.28)  have  been  prepared  by  the  Hydraulics
Administration of the Ministry of Equipment.   The proposed legislation has
been circulated among all Ministries and is expected to be submitted to
Parliament during its 1988 spring session.
Cost FEthates
3.14     The total project cost is estimated at DR1,076.8 million (US$128.3
million)   with   a   foreign   exchange   component   of   DH503.7   million
(US$60.0 million) equal  to 47S of the total cost.   Identifiable taxes and
duties amount to DH226.6 million (US$27.0 million) or about 21% of the total
cost. The estimated cost which is detailed in Annex 5 is summarized as

The base Cost8 are expressed in January 1987 prices and have been calculated
on the basis of cost estimates prepared by the staff of ONEP and the Regies.
The cost estimates were reviewed during the appraisal mission and found
acceptable.    Equipment   prices   were   determined   by   analyuing   recent



-15-
international and local bid awards in Morocco. Civil works and pipelaying
estimates are in line with construction price levels in Morocco.   Physical
contingencies  for all  project  components  have been estimated at 102.  As
remaining technical designs and bid documents will be prepared and works be
supervised by fully capable permanent staff of ONEP and the R6gies, no
provision has been made for consultant services relating to these activities.
Price contingencies for local aid foreign cost estimates are based on price
increases of 7% for 1987, 6S for 1988 and 1989, and 5% annxally onwards for
local costs and on price increases of 3% for 1987, 1% from 1988 to 1990 and
3.5% annually onwards for foreign cost elements.
3.15     The project provides for an estimated 1,200 manmonths of consulting
services and technical assistance to carry out studies and hydrogeological
surveys and to assist the DRSC and ONEP in coordinating the activities of the
R4gies and in reviewing project reports and bidding documents.

The net internal cash generated by ONEP and the R6gies will finance about 47%
of  the  total  requirements.   The  Government  will  provide  as  capital
contribution about 41 of the total project financing or 100% of the local
currency requirements of the Hydraulics Administration and DRSC's components
and of the sector organi2ation study. Financing of local costs in addition to
the internally generated funds of the Regies and ONEP will be provided by FEC
and will represent about 21 of the total financing. The proposed Bank loat' of
US$60 million will finance 1001 of the foreign exchange cost or about 471 of
the total nrnlert enat (oAraa V@ nC  2l Af-n)



-16-
3.17     The proposed Bank loan of US$60 million will be made to the Kingdom
of Morocco, for a term of 20 years including 5 years of grace at the current
variable -interest rate.  The Government will onlend part of the Bank loan
under the same conditions to the sixteen water supply Regies and ONEP (para
4.01).  The Regies will be the major beneficiaries of the proposed loan with
US$39.0 million representing 652 of the total loan amount. Another US$15.5
million corresponding to about 26% of the loan amount will be onlent to ONEP
to finance about 494 of the cost of its rehabilitation program.
3.18     The remaining US$5.5 million of the Bank loan will be made available
by the Government to the Hydraulic Administration for financing its data
processing equipment, water resources development studies and the sector
organization study and to AH and the "Direction des Regies et Services
Conc6de&st (DRSC) of the Ministry of Interior for staff training.  Assurances
were obtained during negotiations from the Government that it will enter into
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with ONEP and sub-loan agreements with the R6gies,
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.  Signing of the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement with ONEP will be a condition of effectiveness.   Signing of a
sub-loan agreement with a Regie and a loan agreement on terms and conditions
satisfactory  to  the Bank between  the FEC and  that Regie  requesting  its
financial assistance will be a condition for disbursing the relevant portion
of the Bank loan.
3.19     ONEP and the R6gies will assume the variable interest risk and the
foreign exchange risk on their individual share of the Bank loan.
3.20     FEC,  within  the "Caisse de Dep8t et de Gestion" (CDG), plans to
mobilize funds to meet eventual gaps in local cost financing of the R6gies'
rehabilitation sub-projects. The total requirement is expected to reach abou.
US$3 million over  the project  implementation  period.   The Government has
confirmed that CDG will provide FEC with a US$3 million equivalent line of
credit to finance part of the local currency needs under the proposed
project.  Requests for funding will be subject to FEC's normal procedure for
granting credits.
Project Implementation
3.21     The various project components will be implemented from 1987 to 1994
by the following agencies:
(a)    the sixteen water distribution companies (RWgies) which operate
at the retail level municipal water supply systems under the
tutelage of the R6gies Directorate (DRSC) of the Ministry of
Interior;
(b)    the   National    Water   Production   Authority   (ONEP),    a
semi-autonomous parastatal organization which is responsible for
the  development,  operation  and  maintenance  of  all  water
production facilities under the tutelage of the Ministry of
Equipment;
(c)    the Hydraulics Administration (AH), an Agency of the Ministry of
Equipment responsible for national water resources; Pnaa



-17-
(d)    the Directorate of Public Enterprises and Participations (DEPP)
of the Ministry of Finance,  responsible  for controlling  the
financial and administrative aspects related to the operations
of the Regies and ONEP.
A project implementation schedule covering all project activities has
been discussed with the relevant authorities and is attached in Annex 6.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government and ONEP on a
detailed action program which forms part of the Loan Agreement (Annex 7).
The Rgies - Sector Loan Component IMplementation
3.22     The Regies will be responsible for the implementation of:
(i)    the rehabilitation of production and distribution facilities;
(ii)    the construction of distribution reservoirs;
(iii)    the  repair  and  the   replacement  of  distribution   system
appurtenances and water meters;
(iv)    the acquisition of miscellaneous equipment including computer
hardware and software; and
(v)    staff training.
In addition, the Regies will be responsible for carrying out the master plan
studies (para 3.23), the inventory and valuation of their assets (para 4.15),
and the acquisition of leak detection and maintenance equipment. On behalf of
all the other RMgies, the Regie of Casablanca (RAD) will be responsible for
the studies on management information systems (para 4.09) and training needs
(para 4.12) and the R6gie of Rabat-Sale will carry out the cost accounting
study (para 4.15).
3.23     During  the  proposed  studies  for  updating  water  production  and
distribution master plans, the consultants will develop adequate leak
detection and repair procedures. They will also define and draw up technical
specifications for leak detection and other equipment necessary for future
adequate preventive maintenance and systematic survey. Bidding documents for
such equipment will be prepared by the consultants in cooperation with the
Regies' technical staff.  During negotiations, the draft terms of reference
for the proposed studies were reviewed and found acceptable to the Bank. In
accordance with the agreed action program (para 3.21), the R6gies will, by
July 1, 1988 at the latest, engage consultants to carry out these studies on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank and consultants' recommendations,
after review by the Bank, will be implemented by July 1, 1990.
3.24     A key control activity  in the project is the review by DRSC of
sub-projects proposed by the R6gies to ensure that the proposed rehabilitation
designs  offer  the  best  technical  and economic  solutions.   To  this end,
agreement was reached during negotiations that DRSC will establish a Project
Unit (PU) with membership and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. PU
will receive assistance from FEC and ONEP.   The establishment of PU is a
condition of disbursement of the portion of the Loan related to the R6gies.



-18-
The R6gies will prepare for each sub-project a design report which will
provide population and water consumption data, describe the present water
supply situation and problems, describe alternative solutions and costs,
present estimates of capital and operating cost and a financing plan for the
selected alternative.   All sub-projects will meet the eligibility criteria
indicated  in  Annex  8  and  represent   the   least   cost  solution   for
rehabilitation.  All reports on sub-projects prepared by the R6gies will be
reviewed by DRSC's Project Unit and submitted to the Bank's approval. Reports
on proposed sub-irojects which do nct meet the criteria will be submitted with
additional justifications for possible approval by the Bank. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the Regies' sub-projects will be appraised
and approved in accordance with criteria and procedures acceptable to the
Bank.  The format for the design reports and the approval criteria have been
discussed with the Regies and DRSC.
3.25     DRSC has assisted the R6gies in  the preparation of  the proposed
project since its identitication.  The Project Unit will be responsible for
the  coordination  between  the  various  Regies  and  for  the  total  project
accounting of the Regies. In particular, PU will assist the Regies in:
gi)    reviewing sub-projects appraisals;
(ii)    coordinating procurement activities;
(iii)    supervising sub-projects imple.nentation;
(iv)    centralizing disbursement requests;
(v)    monitoring and reporting the Regies general activity; and
(vi)    developing a least cost multi-year investment program.
3.26     In order to perform this task, the Project Unit will be reinforced
during the first four years of project implementation by technical assistance
in the form of two experts to assist in completing the appraisals of the
R6gies'sub-projects, coordinating project execution, implementing a monitoring
system  of  the  Regies  and  training  national  counterparts  in  DRSC.   Two
additional experts will also assist ONEP in supervising the implementation of
its  rehabilitation  components.   Technical  assistance  financing  will  be
provided jointly by the French bilateral aid agency and by UNDP which will be
the executing agency.   ONEP,  which has been given responsibility for the
recruitment of the four experts, has already established contacts with
specialized water supply agencies and a draft technical assistance contract i6
being prepared by UNDP and the French bilateral aid agency. This contract is
expected to be signed by November 1, 1987. Employment of consultants, under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to assist in appraising and
supervising the R6gies' sub-projects, will be a condition of disbursement of
the portion of the Loan allocated for the R4gies' sub-projects.
ONEP - Sub-Project Component Implementation
3.27     ONEP will have prime responsibility for implementing the physical
components  of  its sub-project  (para  3.05).   In  order  to  streamline  its
relations with the Government, ONEP has prepared a corporate development plan



-19-
("contrat-plan") which defines its development objectives, performance targets
and spells out Government obligations, i.e. actions and resources to achieve
these objectives and targets (para 5.09). ONEP will also be responsible for
the update of its bulk water tariffs on the basis of the new financial
policies  (para 5.08).  ONEP will  also install and develop new integrated
computer and Management Information systems (pars 4.06), provide staff
training (para 4.11), implement new accounting systems (para 4.13), and
rehabilitate its production and distribution facilities (Annex 10).
Institutional and Administrative Reforms
3.28     Under  the  Project,  the  Borrower will  develop  and  introduce  an
appropriate system: a) to regulate water resources use; b) to develop suitable
water resources management strategies; and c) to coordinate water resources
development. The Hydraulic Administration in its water resource management
capacity has been charged with preparing a Water Code and a draft Decree for
the creation of a National Water Council.  A draft Water Code was completed in
February  1987.   It  has  been  circulated  for  comments  to  all  Ministries
concerned. The final document is expected to be completed by the end of
December 1987 and to be presented to Parliament during the spring 1988
session. The proposed Water Code represents the first attempt in Morocco to
rationalize   and   strengthen   existing   legislation  on  water   resources
management. In particular, it provides a regulatory framework covering:
,)    the "Domaine Public Hydraulique" (public property pertaining to
water resources);
(ii)    the protection and conservation of public water resources;
(iii)    the conditions for water utilization;
(iv)    the quality standards to be applied to wastewater discharges;
(v)    the quality standards acceptable for water to be used for human
consumption;
(vi)    the  type and frequency of  quality controls  to be  used  for
potable water;
(vii)    the conditions of extraction and utilization of water to be used
for irrigation, including potential waste water reuse;
(viii)    the public and private water extraction authorization; and
(ix)    prosecution procedures and penalties applied for non-compliance
with the water policy.
3.29     The concept of a National Water Council ("'Conseil Superieur de 1'Eau"
- CSE) was developed for the first time in April 1981 to: (i) elaborate a
strategy to allocate, manage and develop water resources; (ii) define
appropriate water policies and prepare related legal instruments; and (iii)
coordinate the Government's and public enterprises' activities with respect to
'he development of water resources.  Although CSE has not been  formally
established yet, its members have been nominated. They include all Ministers



-20-
concerned with water development related activities such as the Ministers of
Planning, Equipment, Agriculture, Energy and Mines, Industry and Tourism,
Interior,  Housing and Urban Planning -and Finances.  Other members include
Governors, representatives of local communities and General Directors of
Public Enterprises such as ONEP and the National Company for Electricity
(ONE).   A  Permanent  Secretariat  was  also  established  to  support  CSE's
activities.  Since 1981, CSE has met only twice.  CSE has so far failed to
function  effectively,  mainly  because  its  decision  power  and  operating
procedures have yet to be formalized and because a budget for Permanent
Secretary's staff has not been alloceted.   To correct this situation,  the
present Minister of Equipment has recently been nominated as Permanent
Secretary. The Hydraulic Administration (AR) was also requested to assign
qualified staff to support the Permanent Secretary.  The AH has prepared a
draft Decree for the creation of CSE. This document was recently reviewed by
all parties concerned and its final version is expected to be ready at the
same time as the Water Code.
3.30     In accordance  with  the detailed action  program  agreed  with  the
Government during negotiations (para 3.21), the Borrower will :
(i)    furnish  to  the Bank  for  review and comments nlot later than
April 1, 1988 its proposed system to develop water resources
management strategies and regulate the use of water resources;
and
(ii)    thereafter  promptly  take all measures  required  on  its  part
(incuding   presentation   of   any   required   legislation   to
Parliament) to introduce and apply such system on the basis of
the  Bank's  comments  in  accordance  with  a  time  schedule
satisfactory to the Bank.
3.31     Since December 1981, a coordination commiesion, drawn from the Board
of Directors of ONEP, has been responsible for the planning and coordination
of investments in the urban water supply sector between the Regies, the
industries and ONEP. However, the limited leverage of this commission on the
various agencies involved has led to the financing of economically suboptimal
investments.   In  particular,  the  adequacy of budgetary  resources  of  the
industrial public enterprises wishing to build new industrial facilities has
not been ascertained before agreeing to expand water production facilities.
This  led  to  the construction of oversized water production plants.   The
capital budget cuts required by Morocco's economic stabilization program call
for obtaining the highest possible returns  on future  investments.   It is
therefore essential for the water sector to establish an Investment Planning
and  Coordination  Committee  with  full  authority  to  prioritize  sectoral
investments based on criteria such as operational efficiency of existing
facilities,  availability  of  required  budgetary  resources,   demand  for
investment output, foreign exchange requirement, identification of sources of
funding and expected rate of return. The establishment of such a Committee
under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister or the Permanent Secretary of the
National Water Council should ensure that the Committee's work reflects
national priorities.   The Committee's responsibility would also cover rural
water supply. This committee would be staffed with representatives from the
Ministries of Finance, Planning, ,Equipment, Interior, Industry, Electricity,
Agriculture and Housing. ONEP's planning division, which, over the years, has
considerably developed its appraisal capability, would assist the Investment



-21-
Planning and Coordination Committee in evaluating, selecting and programming
water supply sector investments.
3.32     In accordance  with  tthe detailed action  program  agreed  with  the
Government during negotiations (para 3.21):
(i)    a technical committee responsible for planning and coordination
of water in-vestments at the national level will be established
not later than April 1, 1988; and
(ii)    this  comnittee  will  prepare  annually  a  five-year  roll-over
investment plan for the water supply sector and submit such a
plan to the Bank's review not later than December 1 of each year.
3.33     The  water  supply  organization  study will  be executed under  the
responsibility of the Prime Minister's office.  The main objective of the
study is to review the present organizational structure in the Water Supply
sector upon completion in June 1988 of the water resources studies carried out
by ONEP and AK. These water resources studies, financed under the Second and
Third Water Supply Projects (Loans 1724-MOR and 2006-MOR), will provide a 90%
coverage of all major river basins in Morocco and will serve as a basis for
optimizing the utilization of existing water resources through appropriate new
institutional structures.  In particular, the water supply organization study
will (i) analyze the rationale for having combined Water Supply and
Electricity R6gies;  (ii)  assess the optimal economic organization structure
of the sector; and (iii) propose an institutional framework to operate and
develop water supply systems in rural areas. Draft terms of reference for
this study were reviewed during negotiations and found acceptable by the
Bank.  The agreed action program (para 3.21) envisages that the Government
will, by January 1, 1989, engage consultants to carry out the Water Supply
Organization Study on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank and that the
findings of the consultants will be made available to the Bank for comments.
Implementation of the recommendations will be initiated by the Government no
later than January 1, 1991.
3.34     In order  to strengthen  its  resource  management  capabilities  and
develop its own management inform&tion system, the Hydraulic Administration
(AN), assisted by consultants, prepared in July 1984 a master plan for the
development of its computer and info.mation systems. The existing computer
equipment, which was installed in 197P, was outdated and had an inadequate
volume capacity  to process existing national water resources data and to
develop a comprehensive water resources management system. In November 1985,
the Ministry of Equipment therefore requested the Bank to assist in financing
new data processing equipment and related software. AH subsequently prepared
bidding  documents  and  called  for  bids  in August  1986.   All  procurement
documentation  was  reviewed  and  found  acceptable  by  the  Bank.   The  bid
evaluation report was received in December 1986 and a US$1.1 million contract
was awarded in January 1987 upon receipt of the Bank's no objection. The data
processing equipment is currently being installed. Retroactive financing of
US$0.6 million is therefore proposed for this component. In accordance with
the agreed action program (para 3.21), AN will complete implementation of its
new data processing system not later than January 1, 1988. Furthermore, in
order to achieve a complete coverage of all potential water resources, the
Project includes (i) a water development study of the river basins south of
the Atlas mountains and (ii) a national water resources master plan to



-22-
optimize allocation and usage of water among the various users; both will be
carried out by Al.
3.35     The Government controls the water supply companies through a double
tutelage consisting of the technical Ministries (Ministry of Equipment for
ONEP and Ministry of Interior for the Regies) and the Ministry of Finance.
The technical Ministries are responsible for the development and investment
policies and technical performance of the water supply companies, while the
Ministry of Finance, through its Directorate of Public Enterprises and
Participations (DEPP), is responsible for controlling their administrative and
financial management.   Other Government agencies, such a&  the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Planning and the Central t            are also
involved  in  the financial monitoring of the water supply companies.   The
number of controlling agencies, their different and sometimes conflicting
interests and the insufficient coordination among these agencies, has led to a
situation where the water supply companies are constantly requested to forward
information based on unclear indicat' s and therefore of limited value for
adequate  Government  control.   The  proposed  project  will  streamline  the
relations between the Government and the water supply companies through the
preparation  and  implementation  of  standardized   management   information
systems.   In a first stage, DEPP will prepare, in collaboration with the
technical Ministries and other Government agencies concerned, a list of
standard performance monitoring criteria and reporting documentation to be
published regularly by the Re8ies and ONEP to permit the monitoring of the
performance of these companies by the Government. In carrying out this task,
DEPP will ensure that the information to be transferred to the Government's
agencies concerned are clearly defined. In a second stage, ONEP (para 4.06)
and the Regies (para 4.09) will improve and/or develop their own individual
management information systems and will ensure that the information to be
transferred to the Government is readily available.
3.36     In  accordance  with  the  agreed  action  program  (para  3.21),  the
Government will:
(i)    design standard monitoring criteria for controlling the Regies
and ONEP by November 1, 1988;-
(ii)    forward to the Bank its recommendations and, on the basis of
Bank's comments, implement the Government monitoring system of
the R6gies and ONEP and on April 1 and November 1 of each
subsequent year, send to the Bank a monitoring performance
report.
3.37     The efficiency of the procurement process of the R6gies is severely
limited by Moroccan regulations. Under the present system, any contract award
proposed by the R6gie's ad hoc bid evaluation committee must be referred to
the Board of Directors (BOD) of the Regie for decision if the contract's value
is equal or superior to DH500,000 (US$60,000). For contracts with a value
between DH50,000 (US$6,000) and DH500,000, the proposed award is referred to
an ad hoc procurement committee composed of an elected member of the BOD
(Chairman), a municipal engineer, the financial controller of the Regie, an
agent for the Ministry of Finance, and two BOD's members. For Contracts under
DH50,000, the proposed award is referred to the Director General. This system
creates delays in the award process.



-23-
Within the limits of their annual investment budget discussed and agreed with
their  BODs,   the  R6gies'   General   Directors   should   have   sufficient
administrative autonomy while being held accountable for their managerial
decisions. Under the project, the Borrower and the R6gies will develop and
implement a program to simplify and improve the efficiency of the procurement
decision making process.   In accordance with the agreed action plan  (para
3.21): (i) the Government will, not later than January 1, 1988, furnish to the
Bank its proposed program and thereafter promptly implement such program on
the  basis  of  the Bank's  comments and  (ii) each Regie will  establish a
permanent procurement committee by January 1, 1988.   The system  currently
envisaged is as follows:
(i)    an evaluation  comittee staffed with permanent technical and
financial  staff  of  the  R6gie   (including   its   financial
controller) under the chairmanship of the General Director would
be created in each Regie;
(ii)    the autonomy of decision based on the recommendation of  the
evaluation comuittee would be given to: (a) the R6gie's General
Director for contracts with a value equal or inferior to
DH200,000 (US$24,000) and (b) the procurement committee, in
which the R6gie's General Director would have a vote, for
contracts higher than DH200,000; and
(iii)    the General Director of a R6gie would convene his BOD to make
the decision of either awarding a contract or calling new bids
when the bid price of the lowest evaluated bidder is 202 higher
than  the  administrative  estimate  included  in  the  Regie's
investment budget.

3.39     The  rehabilitation  of  distribution  networks,  the  replacement  of
watermeters and the installation of disbribution system appurtenances will be
carried out by the Regies and ONEP under force account.  These organizations
have the necessary equipment and  trained workers available.   Since their
establishment, the Regies and ONEP have constructed most of the house
connections and extensions of the distribution systems and acquired the
necessary skill. As flexibility in scheduling the rehabilitation works, which
are small -in size and scattered in location, is required in order to avoid
disturbances in the day-to-day operations, the execution of these works under
force account is justified.   For the more complex and larger civil works,
procurement under Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) will be the optimum when
considering their size and dispersal both in terms of time and location.
Recent experience with International Competitive Bidding (ICB) shows that only
those firms represented in Morocco have submitted bids for similar type of
civil works contracts. Local manufacturing industries for pipes, water meters
and appurtenances are well developed in Morocco. For such equipment, local
suppliers are expected to win about 60% of all supply contracts awarded
through ICB. The supply of pipes and equipment contracts will be grouped as
far as practical in order to encourage international competition.  For this
type of contract, a minimum individual grouping of US$100,000 will be
retained. Contracts for the supply of equipment, other than pipes, for which
the minimal individual grouping of US$100,000 is not feasible, will be awarded
through LCB up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$3,500,000 (US$2.0
million for the R6gies and US$1.5 million for ONEP). Repair services will be
procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of price
quotations from at least three eligible suppliers, in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. In addition, the project as a whole will
be advertised internationally so that interested foreign firms will have an
opportunity  to  participate  in  the  bidding  process.   For  bid  evaluation
purposes in the case of goods procured under ICB, a 152 margin of preference
on the CIF price of imported goods or an amount equal to the customs duties,
whichever is lower, will be applied to equipment manufactured in Morocco. All
procurement documentation for ICB and LIB will be subject to the Bank review
prior to their submission to bidders. With respect to LCB documents for works
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$1.0 million or more, the same Bank
prior review will apply. The Hydraulic Administration, ONEP and the Regies
will furnish to the Bank copies of all other contracts, together with the
analysis of the respective bids and the recommendation for award.
3.40     Consultants for the various studies included in the proposed project
will be engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers.
3.41     Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures currently applied by ONEP
and the R6gies will allow  these  companies  to carry out  the  procurement
activities  required  for  the  project  economically  and  efficiently.   LCB
procedures were discussed during negotiations and agreement was reached that
ONEP and the Regies will apply procedures acceptable to the Bank.

3.43     A disbursement profile for rehabilitation projects in Morocco is not
available  for  reference.   The  implementation  period  for  this  project  is
estimated at seven and one half years (July 1987 - December 1994), based on
the R6gies' and ONEP's financial and technical implementation capacity and the
relative  simplicity  of  the  rehabilitation  works  to  be  carried  out.
Disbursements  are  expected  to  be  completed  six  months  after  project
completion, hence the Closing Date of the proposed loan will be June 30,
1995. In order to ensure that the R6gies and ONEP will have ready access to
foreign exchange, assurances were received during negotiations that a Special
Account in US dollars will be established in the Bank of Morocco to which the
World  Bank will  make  an  initial  deposit  of  US$2.5 million.   The  Special
Account will be replenished against withdrawal applications of at least
US$100,000 equivalent at monthly intervals or, as appropriate, when the
undisbursed balance of the Account is equal to 50 percent or less of the
amount of the initial deposit. All disbursements under the project will be
made against standard documentation except for contracts below US$100,000
equivalent and force account to be claimed under Statements of Expenditures
(SOE) which will be made available for examination by Bank supervision
missions. Agreement was reached that the Government will have its Project
Accounts, SOEs and the Special Account audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank.

Land Acquisition
3.44     ONEP and the Regies have already acquired all the land needed for the
construction of the distribution reservoirs, as well as for the laying of
pipes included in their proposed rehabilitation programs. No further action
is required at this time.
Monitore Svem
3.45     During project execution,  appropriate  indicators will be used to
monitor the financial and technical performance of ONEP and the R4gies.  Annex
9 provides the list of indicators which were discussed during negotiations.
Under the project:
(i)    ONEP and each of the Regies will report quarterly to the Bank on
the  progress  of  project  components  for  which  they  are
responsible and semi-annually on the evolution of the relevant
indicators; and
(ii)    the Hydraulic Administration will report quarterly to the Bank
on progress made in the development of its data processing
equipment and water resources master plan studies.
3.46     Finally, agreement was reached during negotiations that within six
months following the closing date of the loan, ONEP, each Regie and the
Hydraulic Administration for their respective project components will prepare
and submit to the Bank a completion report reviewing the planned objectives
and the achievements of the project, including the costs and benefits derived
and the performance and contribution of all parties associated with the
project execution and systems operations.
IV. THE BORROWER AND TEHE IMPLEMENT[IG AGENCIES
4.01     The proposed loan of US$60.0 million will be made to the Kingdom of
Morocco which will onlend a part of the loan to ONEP and the Regies (para
3.17).
4.02     ONEP  and  the  Regies  will  have  prime  responsibility  for  the
implementation of the physical components of the project which are described
in detail in Annex 10 and for their respective management and financial
studies.
ONEP - Organization and Maaement
4.03     ONEP was established in 1972 by taking over the responsibility for
bulk water production from the former "Regie des Exploitations Industrielles"
(REI).  The objective was to build up specific  managerial,  technical  and
financial resources for water production. ONEP is owned by the Government,
under the tutelage of the Ministry of Equipment.   It has the status of a



-29-
financially antonomous public enterprise managed in accordance with principles
applicable to a commercial undertaking. ONEP was the borrower of Bank loan
850-MOR, and the beneficiary of Bank loans 1724-MOR and 2006-MOR, made to the
Government  .  The original objective for establishing ONEP has been met.
Today, ONEP has an experienced technical staff, a result partly of foreign
training  and  partly  of  the  work  of  its  own  training  center.   Further
strengthening is still needed, however, in ONEP's cost accounting and
management information system.
4.04     ONEP's water sales have increased from 66 million m3 in 1972 to 344
million m3 in 1985 and are expected to reach 496 million m3 by 1995. With
the exception of those on the Mid-A4.lantic Coast, the water production
facilities (mainly ground water) which existed at the time of ONEP's creation
have remained under the responsibility of the Regies or the municipalities.
As a result, in earlier years, ONEP only met peak water demand out of
expensive new sources whilst the base demand was satisfied by the distributing
R6gies out of their less expensive sources. However, population growth and
the associated increasing water demand are gradually reducing the relative
importance of the Regies' own sources.
4.05     A board of 20 members supervises ONEP's activities.  Delegates from
ministries and government agencies as well as ONEP's customers are represented
on the Board. A technical committee composed of four Board members maintains
a follow up on Board decisions. The overall control exercised by Government
covers major decisions such as approval of investments, operating budgets,
borrowings, tariff levels, code of employment and major procurement. ONEP's
General Director iv appointed by the King and is responsible for day-to-day
operations. ONEP's original organizational structure which was developed by
consultants  under  the  First  Water  Supply  Project  (Loan  850-NOR),  was
implemented  in  1978.   It  was  modified  in  June  1984  by  ONEP's  General
Inspection  Department  to  reflect  the  growth  of  ONEP's  operations  by
decentralizing operational responsibility and accountability to Regional
Centers. The implementation of the new organization structure was completed
by the end of 1986 (Annex 11). ONEP's Management Information System (MIS)
which was also developed by the General Inspection Department since 1981 ties
into the new organization structure. ONEP's MIS is comprehensive and his been
producing,  since  January  1985,  valuable  monthly  performance  indicators
("tableau  de  bord")  both  at  the  regional  and  national  levels.   These
indicators are discussed with regional managers every quarter and are
instrumental  in  the  evaluation  of  their  performances.   As  a  result,
substantial cost savings have been generated, particularly in the use of fuel,
chemicals, materials and personnel.  ONEP's staff actually decreased from 1983
to 1986 while its total water sales increased by 17X.
4.06     ONEP's  objective  is  to  further  improve  its  MIS  through  the
development of "standards" to be used for performance comparisons and the
implementation of a new integrated computer system.  ONEP prepared, with the
assistance of consultants, bidding documents in accordance with Bank's
Guidelines  for  the acquisition of new  integrated  computer  equipment.   In
September 1985, Limited International Competitiv Bidding (LIB) was conducted
by direct invitation to the three computer sup,  ers represented in Morocco.
Bids were opened on December 12, 1985 and contract award, after prior Bank
review, occured in August 1986. The new computer equipment is currently under
installation.   Due to the very limited number of  computer  suppliers with
permanent representation and maintenance facilities in Morocco and in view of



-30-
the small amount involved (US$0.6 million), LIB was the appropriate
procurement method.  Retroactive financing of US$0.4 million is proposed to
finance ONEP's expenditures on computer equipment expected to occur before
loan signature.
4.07     Under the agreed action program (para 3.21), ONEP will:
(i)    prepare and submit for Bank's review, no later than November 1,
1988, standards to be used as comparators for its performance
indicators; and
(ii)    install and develop a new integrated computer system to be fully
operational by January 1, 1988.
The RA!es - Organizbaton ad Mnagemedt
4.08     The regulatory provisions governing the management and operation of
the water supply and electricity Regies are set out in Decree No. 2-64-394 of
1964. The R6gies have the status of autonomous municipal utilities and are
managed in accordance with commercial rules under the tutelage of the Ministry
of Interior.  The first ten R6gies created during the period 1961-1971 have
developed into well-experienced technical institutions, partly as a result of
the transfer of well-trained technical staff from the former "R6gie des
Exploitations Industrielles" (REI) and from the "Societe Marocaine de
Distribution" (SMD).  The most recently created R6gies are only responsible
for water supply. They have benefited from the Inter-Regie training center,
created in 1975, to build up their technical capability. The R6gies are the
beneficiaries of two previous Bank loans (Loan 1724-MOR and 2006-MOR) which
have assisted in the financing of revolving funds for the construction of
house  connections  for  low-income  customers.   This  program  is  being
satisfactorily implemented with the construction of more than 118,000 house
connections since 1980.
4.09     A board of 10 members supervises the operations of a Regie.   The
provincial Governor is the Chairman of the Board of Directors which also
includes representatives of the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance and
six elected members from the local municipal council. The R6gies' General
Directors are well-qualified engineers with wide professional experience in
the public utility sector. They are appointed by the Prime Minister and are
responsible for the day-to-day operations, although with some restriction as
mentioned in para 3.37. Existing organization structures vary with the size
and sectoral responsibilities of the Regies.   In order  to  introduce  some
standardization  in  the  R6gies'  managerial procedures and  to  implement  a
comprehensive Management Information System (MIS), the "Direction des R6gies
et Services Con6edes"  (DRSC) of the Ministry of Interior has requested the
R6gie of Casablanca (RAD) to carry out a MIS study under the proposed
project. Such a study will review the present organization of the Regies and
of the Inter-Regie computer center (SIRTI), make recommendations for
introducing  a  standard  information  system  and  assess  the  need  for
decentralized  computer  equipment.   RAD,  which  houses  SIRTI,  will  be
responsible for the MIS study under the coordination of DRSC. Draft terms of
reference were discussed with RAD and DRSC and found acceptable by the Bank.
Consultants will be engaged to carry out this study.  Preparation of the
study, including bid documents for the Regies' data processing equipment is



-31-
estimated to take 15 months. It is essential that after review and adoption
by DRSC, the consultants recommendations be implemented. Under the proposed
-agreed program (para 3.21):
(1)    RAD will, by March 1, 1988, engage consultants to carry out the
HIS study on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank;
(ii)    the findings of she consultants will be made available to the
Bank for comments by June 1, 1989; and
(iii)    after review and adoption, implementation of the recommendations
will be initiated by the R6gies by September 30, 1989.
Personnel and T
4.10     ONEP and the Regies' salary structure,  though somewhat lower than
that  of  the  private  sector,  is  adequate  when  considering  the  whole
compensation package designed to attract qualified personnel interested in the
career prospects of these fast-growing organizations. ONEP's permanent staff
has increased from 1,300 in 1972 to 3,028 at the end of 1986. Of these 100
were senior positions. In 1972, ONEP employed 51 expatriates, most in senior
positions.   Today, only two expatriates are employed at professional level.
The same rapid staff development occured in the Regies.  However, with an
average of six technical staff employed per thousand house-connections in
1985, the R6gies are not overstaffed when compared to other mediterranean
countries which average 7 to 9 staff per thousand connections.
4.11     Faced with a shortage of skilled operators and workers capable of
being promoted to foreman positions, ONEP has within the scope of the First
Water Supply Project (Loan 850-MOR) established a training center that offers
one to two-year training courses for mechanics, treatment plant operators and
equipment  specialists.   Since  1982,  when  the  training  facilities  were
completed, 120 students have graduated every year. In order to acquaint newly
recruited staff with job requirements, ONE? also organizes each year several
three months familiarization courses. To complement ONEP's latter training
activity, the proposed project provides for fellowships.
4.12     In 1975, RAD was entrusted by the Ministry of Interior and the other
R6gies with the responsibility for managing an Inter-Regie training center
(CIRF) to train newly recruited staff for the operation and maintenance of the
water and electricity distribution networks. CIRF has been operating since
July 1977 and offers two-year training courses from which 395 staff have
graduated so far. This initial training, however, represents only part of the
training needs of the Regies.  RAD carried out in July 1985 a preliminary
assessment of the R6gies' training needs and concluded that existing CIRF
training capacity of 116 students a year should be increased to 344 to allow
the recycling of administrative and accounting staff as well as specialized
technicians. The extension of existing CIRF training facilities estimated at
DH15.5 million is included in RAD's 1987 investment budget. The proposed
project provides for consultant services and technical assistance to RAD and
the  acquisition  of  material  and  equipment  for  the  training  center.
Consultants will assess the training needs of the R6gies, analyse the skill
and knowledge required to perform all tasks identified as requiring training,
and design and ass8st in the implementation of new appropriate training



-32-
technical assistance.  Terms of reference were discussed during negotiations
and found acceptable by  the Bank.   In accordance with the agreed action
program (para 3.21):
(i)    RAD will, by January 1, 1988, engage consultants to carry out
the Regies training study on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank; and
(ii)    after  review and  comments by  the  Bank  of  the  consultants'
recommendations, each Regie will initiate implementation of such
recommendations by July 1, 1989.
Aecntixut Systems
4.13     ONEP's accounts are kept on an accrual basis and follow the 1957
French General Accounting Plan. Bookkeeping transactions are computerized and
the closing of accounts at year end is performed on a timely basis.  Cost
accounting, cash flow forecasting, budgeting and inventory controls devel4,ped
by ONEP's management consultants under the First Water Supply Project (Loan
850-MOR)  have  been  implemented.   However,  since  ONEP  has  implemented  a
decentralized organization structure, the existing cost accounting system,
which classifies O&M expenditures by nature rather than by destination, is no
longer  relevant.   ONEP  has  recently,  with  UNDP's  technical  assistance
(MOR/CWS 004), initiated the revision of its cost accounting plan to reflect
its  new  organizational  policy  and  respond  to  its MIS  requirements.   In
accordance with the action program agreed with the Government and ONEP during
negotiations (para 3.21), ONEP will use consultants acceptable to the Bank to
complete its cost accounting study and initiate implementation of a new cost
accounting system satisfactory to the Bank by January 1, 1988.
4.14     The  accounting  systems  of  the  Water  Supply  and  Electricity
Departments of the R6gies are entirely separated, with appropriate cost
centers and overhead allocations. Accounts are kept on an accrual basis. The
general and cost accounting systems, which were inherited by the Regies from
their previous concessionary owners, have a general common nucleus but vary in
specific features from Regie to R6gie due to the absence of a standard
manual. While the accounting system itself is logical and coherent, it does
not provide readily answers to classical financial analysis.  In particular,
there is no specific account for work in progress and with the exception of
assets which have a less than five year life span, depreciation is replaced by
a renewal reserve which bears no relation to the value of assets in
operation. Assets are accounted for at their historical value. The R6gies'
accounting systems need to be upgraded to international standards in order to
provide adequate management information and Government control.
4.15     Aware of the above deficiencies which affect all Public Enterprises
(PE), the Government prepared a new National Accounting Plan with the
assistance of independent experts financed under the PERL project with PPF
funding.  A first draft Accounting Plan was completed in February 1987 and is
circulated among Ministries and PEs for comments. It is envisaged under the
Water Supply Rehabilitation Project to test by January 1, 1988 within ONEP and
the Regie of Rabat-Sale (RED), on behalf of the other R6gies, the new National
Accounting System. A cost accounting study will also be executed by RED, on
behalf of the other R6gies, under the supervision of DRSC. Consultants will



-33-
assist RED in carrying out the study and will develop an appropriate fixed
assets valuation methodology. In accordance with the detailed action program
agreed with the Government during negotiations (pcra 3.21),  the Government
will cause ONEP and RED to implement, by January 1, 1988, the National
Accounting System and to prepare and send to the Bank a report on its
implementation not later than April 1, 1989. The National Accounting System
will be implemented by the other Regies not later than January 1, 1990. To
complete the restructuring of the Regies' accounts, the agreed action program
also envisages that:
(i)    RED will, by January 1, 1988, engage consultants to carry out a
cost accounting study on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank and to develop an appropriate fixed assets valuation
methodology;
(ii)    a  fixed  assets  inventory  and  valuation  committee  will  be
established within each Regie no later than January 1, 1988; and
(iii)    the R6gies will, by January 1, 1989, implement a cost accounting
system satisfactory to the Bank.
Bling and CoUection
4.16     ONEP bills the R6gies every month for the volume of water sold in
bulk and the private customers which its supplies every quarter. A fixed fee
covers meter rental and connection maintenance.   Public Administrations are
billed every semester. All households connected to public water systems are
metered. Bills are produced by ONEP's computer mainframe within two to three
weeks of meter reading.
4.17     Billing is carried out on behalf of the sixteen Water Supply and
Electricity Regies by the Inter-Regie computer company  (SIRTI).   SIRTI  is
owned by all Regies, with RAD owning a 48% share and RAD staff and local
officials  from  the Greater  Casablanca  Community  2.2X.   The  period  which
elapses between SIRTI's receipt of the meter readings from the Regies and its
return of the bills to the Regies varies between 3 and 30 days depending on
the quality of the meter reading.  Bills are sent out monthly to industrial
customers,  quarterly  to  domestic  customers  and  half-yearly  to  Public
Administrations.
4.18     Collection  from  domestic  and  industrial  customers  is  generally
adequate mainly because of the possibility of cutting off water services
and/or  collection  through  the  judicial  system.  However,  collection  from
Government agencies and municipalities has rapidly deteriorated in the early
1980's. As a result, ONEP's and the R6gies' finances have been affected by
sizeable arrears for water sold, leading them to withhold payables to other
Government agencies. At the end of 1985, the overall balance for the sector
was positive. To prevent future build-up of accounts receivable, the Prime
Minister's Office recently issued two instructions on payment procedures. The
first instruction issued in May 1984 compels all administrations and public
enterprises to account for water consumption expenses in their current budget
starting  with  Fiscal  Year  1985.   The  second  instruction  transfers  the
responsibility for payments of public utility bills in Government-owned
housing from the public authorities to the tenants. The deferred payment of



-34-
these bills by the public authorities accounts for at least balf of the
arrears in the water sector and this measure in itself should considerably
reduce  the  arrears.   Moreover,  the  instruction  allows  the  water  supply
companies to cut off water supply in case of non-payment of water bills by the
administration. However, these instructions have not been fully enforced in
1985 and 1986, mainly because of the Treasury's inability to transfer to
Public Enterprises and Government agencies the resources committed under
existing legislation or agreed programs, i.e. current budge.s and operating
subsidies.   To  avoid  the  recurrence  of  such  a  situation,  a  special
Interministerial Committee (Comitk de Vigilance) prepared with Bank and IMF
assistance a comprehensive scheme to clear past arrears and identify measures
to prevent their recurrence. Such a scheme, which includes all water supply
companies, has been developed in the framework of the PERL project. During
negotiations, assurances were received that all water supply arrears owed by
public agencies to ONEP and the llegies, as of December 31, 1986, will be paid
in accordance with guidelines and a schedule satisfactory to the Bank and that
budgetary allocations would be made in amounts sufficient to enable public
agencies to pay future water supply bills promptly when due. The guidelines
to be used for settling arrears as of end 1986 will be the same as thore
developed under PERL.
4.19     The main objectives of the PERL scheme for the settlement of arrears
are to treat all enterprises equally and fairly, clear their mutual
obligations, minimize the cost of mobilizing resources to the Treasury, and
limit money creation caused by increased liquidity in the PE sector, while
meeting  Morocco's  fiscal  and  economic  stabilization  objectives.    The
implementation of the scheme will start in 1987 and is as follows:
(i)- mutual obligations between the Government and PEs will be
cross-cancelled through entries in a special arrears clearance
account to be maintained and supervised by the General Receiver
of the Kingdom (Tresorerie Generale) within the Ministry of
Finance;
(ii)    the Government will provide net creditor PEs with Treasury bonds
for the amount of the net balance. The bonds will be redeemed
over 5 years starting from 1987;
(iii)    for the first two years, the bonds will not pay any interest and
have only limited negotiability. Starting with the beginning of
the third year from their issuance, expected on July 1, 1987,
the bonds will bear an  interest  rate  of  62  and  be  fully
negotiable; and
(iv)    the operations related to the issuance and exchange of bonds
would be monitored by the Bank  f Morocco in a special ledger.
The liquidity positions of PEs and of the Treasury will be
determinant in the Bank of Morocco's decision to authorize the
banking sector to discount the bonds during the period of
limited negotiability.
4.20     Under PERL, the Government has also committed itself in a letter of
Development Policy that beginning in 1987, arrears will not accumulate. The
Government will also continue its efforts to eliminate waste in the public
consumption of services and goods provided by PMs, and will determine



-35-
budgeteary allocations for its purchase of utility services, mainly water
supply and electricity, on the basis of actual billings of the preceding year
plus an allowance for price increases. The Government has also recognized
that the risk of new arrears accumulating would remain in the absence of
continuous improvements in Government finances as well as programs to correct
the structural operating deficits of PEs. The proposed National Water Supply
Rehabilitation Project addresses this issue through the control of overall
levels of investment in the water supply sector, combined with correction of
pricing rigidities.
Audit and Insurance
4.21     The existing agreement between ONEP and the Bank (Project Agreement
for Loan 2006-MOR) provides for the external audit of ONEP by independent
auditors. The agreement foresees that audited financial statements should be
submitted to the Bank within six months after the close of the fiscal year.
This was restated in the proposed project agreement. The quality of the audit
performed by independent auditors has been adequate.  ONEP's accounts have not
been certified so far due to the complexity of establishing titles of ONEP's
assets related to its operation in the country's interior. However, ONEP has,
in compliance with existing covenants, already taken inventory of all its
assets and initiated the necessary legal actions to establish legal titles to
its assets.
4.22     The Regies' accounts are verified by various Government auditors but
only  for  compliance  with  official  regulations.   A  priori  controls  of
expenditures and authorization of payments are exercised by a financial
controller and an accounting agent from the Ministry of Finance.  Independent
external audits are not required by the R6gies' by-laws. During negotiations,
agreement was reached that the Regies' accounts will be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank and that their financial statements and audit
reports will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each
fiscal year.
4.23     ONEP and the R6gies carry insurance adequately covering the risks of
public  utility  organizations.   The  policies  are  with  Moroccan  insurance
companies and relate to workman's compensation and third party liability of
their operations.
V. FUIANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Resdts and Pesent Situation
5.01     In addition to the bulk water supply to the Regies, ONEP is entrusted
with the operation of water supply systems in 123 small towns and rural
centers. Unit production costs in some of these centers are up to ten times
higher than those found along the mid-Atlantic coast because of lack of
economies of scale. Tariffs in line with these costs would be prohibitively
htgh.   Recent  improvements  in the operating efficiency of  these centers,
implemented by ONEP under existing agreements, have already generated some
cost savings (para 4.08).  Instead of providing operating subsidies to ONEP
for its small centers which would provide a negative incentive to further



-36-
improve ONEP's operating efficiency, the Government authorized ONEP in March
1985 to levy a qpecial charge valued for three years at DHO.07 per cubic meter
sold to the Regies. This charge, together with revenues collected by ONEP in
these small centers, is expected to finance their entire operation and
maintenance costs from 1985 to 1987.
5.02     The  Government  has  contributed  heavily  in  the  past  to  ONEP's
investment program through equity contributions. A substantial part of these
contributions came from a variety of water supply related taxes, such as the
7% VAT tax on water sales, the 12% tax for services rendered on meter rental
and construction and maintenance of house connections, and the tax on goods
procured which- varies from 4.17% to 15% according to the nature of the goods
and services procured for carrying out ONEP's investment program. From 1983
to 1986, the Government contributed about 60% of ONEP's investment program.
In 1985, ONEP met its working ratio covenant of 66% or less as agreed under
the  Third  Water  Supply  Project  (Loan  2006-MOR).   According  to unaudited
accounts, ONEP also met this covenant for 1986.
5.03     The Regies are financially self-supporting companies.  They finance
their water supply operations from revenues derived from water sales, customer
contributions and to a lesser extent, from long term loans.   In 1985, the
overall  Regies'  capital  expenditures  were  financed  53%  by  customers'
contributions which cover not only the cost of house connections but also a
share of the water supply network extension costs, 35% by net internal cash
generation and  12% by  long-term  loans  from FEC.   The Regies  receive  no
contributions from Government.   A review of the financial position of the
sixteen Regies reveals that they have been underinvesting or delaying
investment  expenditures,  particularly  for  the  rehabilitation  of  their
facilities.  This has led to high unaccounted-for water (para 1.16).  From
1980 to 1984, the share of the Regies' net internal cash generation in their
investments declined from 57% to 35%. This resulted from the rapid build-up
of their receivables (para 4.18) and from the absence of significant revision
to their distribution mark-up since March 1983.
Facial Policies and Objectives
5.04     Over the years, Morocco has made good progress in applying a rational
cost recovery policy based on  the  long-term average  incremental cost of
water.  Following a 1976 comprehensive study of the cost of developing future
water resources, new tariffs were implemented in October 1977 and since April
1982 have been revised every year by ONEP as agreed under Loan 2006-MOR.
Although ONEP's bulk tariff have increased by about 90% during the period
1983-1986, the R6gies' distribution markup has been adjusted only once for
inflation.
5.05     The tariff structure is adequate.  The bulk tariff is uniform and the
retail tariffs differentiate between domestic, administration and industrial
usage. The domestic tariff provides a quarterly maximum consumption of 30ms
at a concessionary rate.  This quantity is considered sufficient to meet the
basic water needs of an average sized family.   The highest tariff bracket
applies to domestic and administration use in excess of 60m3 per quarter.
ONEP's retail tariffs for its customers in the smaller centers in the
country's interior apply the same principle but are much lower than those
along the Mid-Atlantic Coast. To keep its tariff in line with its long-term



-37-
average incremental cost, ONEP has put forward to the Government in December
1986 a new proposal to increase its tariff by 102 in 1987. The Government
recently authorized ONEP to implement such a tariff increase which was
subsequently passed on at the retail level. The R6gies Directorate of the
Ministry of Interior assessed in July 1986 the present markup of the water
distribution Regies.   Following its review, DRSC proposed for each Regie a
financial restructuring action program for FY1987 that will allow the R6gies
to finance at least their operation and maintenance cost and the higher of
depreciation or debt service.
5.06     The present self-financing policy of the R6gies  will be  pursued.
However, to ensure adequate funding for the R6gies' rehabilitation program and
for the construction of additional reservoirs and ancillary installations not
financed   by   customers'   contributions,   agreement   was   reached   during
negotiations that under their sub-loan agreements, the Government will cause
the Regies to adjust their tariffs annually so that from 1988 onwards they
will, after covering their operating and maintenance expenditures, debt
service, and working capital requirement, finance from net cash genera.ion at
least 302 of their annual capital expenditures not prefinanced by customers'
or developers' contributions.
5.07     The 1987 tariff adjustment for ONEP will ensure that the resulting
level of tariffs is adequate to meet its financial covenants. However, as the
long-term  average  incremental  cost  concept  only  takes  indirectly  into
consideration the financial position of ONEP, additional efforts should be
made to adjust tariffs to levels such as to enable ONEP not only to meet its
debt service requirements but also to increase its contribution from
internally generated funds to the construction of new systems and to the
renewal of existing networks. ONEP's new financial policy (para 5.08) aims at
reducing Government contributions to finance its investment program. There
will be no equity contributions for the proposed rehabilitation works to be
carried out by ONEP.  These works are considered deferred maintenance and
will, therefore, be financed by ONEP's net cash generation for the cost
portion not financed by the proposed Bank loan.
5.08     The most efficient way to link ONEP's tariff levels to its operations
will be achieved through a cash generation covenant which will measure its
ability to finance an increased portion of its investment requirements, while
reducing  Government  equity  contributions.   Such  an  approach  is  readily
understood by elected representatives and Government officials overseeing the
sector, while supporting one of the Government's objectives. Moreover, these
arrangements will further support the current dialogue between the Bank and
Government aiming at strengthening the management of public finances.
Previous arrangements required ONEP to meet, starting in 1982, a working ratio
lower than 66%. A cash generation covenant of 152 from 1987 to 1990, 202 in
1991 and 30% in 1992 and thereafter of ONEP's annual investment program will
progressively decrease Government contributions to these investments from 512
in 1987 to 102 in 1995 and will result in a working ratio varying from 60X to
45% during the same period. This will also result in a average rate of return
of  about  5%  on  ONEP's  net  fixed  assets  in  operation.   Under  existing
agreement, ONEP maintains a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.3 and
prepares and submits to the Bank every year by October 31, a list of
indicators to monitor the efficiency of its operation. This has been restated
in the Project Agreement. Agreement was also reached during negotiations to
replace ONEP's other existing covenants by the following covenants:



-38-
(i)    ONE2 will achieve a net cash generation of at least 15% from
1987 to 1990, 202 in 1991 and 30 in 1992 and thereafter of its
annual investment program not prefinanced by customers' and
developers' contributions; and
(ii)    ONEP will prepare by the end of October of each year, a forecast
of its revenues, operating costs and investment expenditures for
the next year that will enable the Government to approve tariff
levels for meeting the covenanted cash generation and that a
copy of such forecast be furnished to the Bank.
5.09     In  order  to  monitor  the  progressive  reduction  of  Government's
contributions to its investments, ONEP has prepared a core annual investment
program for the period 1987-1995. The cost of this program is estimated at
DH6,148 million.  The program will accomodate  increases  in water demand
resulting from population growth only while maintaining existing service
levels. Under the present financial constraints of the Moroccan economy, this
low scenario represents the only feasible alternative (para. 1.10). In order
to systematize its relations with the Government, ONEP prepared at the
Government's request, a corporate development plan similar to that already
introduced  with  Royal  Air  Maroc.   This  plan  defines  the  respective
responsibilities  of  the  Government  and  ONEP.   In  particular,  ONEP?s
development objectives and Government administrative and financial obligations
have been clearly established. Agreement with the Government on this plan
will help promote  the financial and managerial autonomy of ONEP.  During
negotiations, the Government confirmed that the proposed 1987-1995 core
investment program of ONEP is acceptable. Agreement was also reached with the
Government and ONEP that:
(i)    an annual review of ONEP's development plan for the next five
years will be carried out by ONEP and submitted every year, by
October 31, to the Bank for comments; and
(ii)    ONEP will prepare and furnish to the Bank, by October 31 of each
year, an updated corporate development plan agreed with the
Government and satisfactory to the Bank. Furnishing to the Bank
of such a plan for the 1987-1989 period will be a condition of
effectiveness.

5.11     During the project implementation period, ONEP's net internal cash
generation  would  provide  about  24%  of  its  investments  and  customer
contributions 22. Government's contribution towards ONEP's overall investment
program of DH5,539.6 million (US$659.5 million) would amount to DH1,931.3
million (US$229.9 million) or about 35X. Proceeds from other existing loans
refer to six loans from the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) totalling
DH232.4 million (US$27.7 million), one loan from the African Development Bank
amounting to DH61.2 million (US$7.3. million), one from a joint financing of
the Islamic Bank, the Kuweit Development Fund and the Saudi Development Fund
for DH401 million (US$47.7 million), and one suppliers credit for DH90 million
(US$10.7 million). These loans are associated with specific investments for
which agreements have been finalized. Other loans, as yet unidentified, are
assumed to become available by late 1988 for financing the third phase water
production scheme on the Mid-Atlantic Coast, for which ONEP has started to
approach potential financiers.
Future Fiancia Performance of ONEP
5.12     Forecast  financial  statements  appear  in  Annex  12.   Financial
assumptions  are presented  in Annex  13.   The  investment  plan  (1987-1994)



-40-
includes investments other than the proposed project for DH5,274 million or
about DH660 million per annum in current value. This objective is realistic
and aims at maintaining the service level in the urban sector.
5.13     Projections of ONEP's revenues have been made according to the new
financial policy discussed in paras 5.08 and 5.09. From 1987 to the end of
the project implementation period, i.e. December 1994, ONEP's total revenues
are expected to grow in current terms about 2.6 times from DH494 million to
DH1,286  million.   During  the  same  period,   operating  expenses  before
depreciation will grow from DH296 million to DIRz64 million, or about 1.9
times, leaving a gross margin sufficient to finance all the projected debt
service and an average of 24% of investment costs.  Government contributions
to ONEP's annual investment program will progressively decrease from 512 in
1987 to 202 in 1994. The working ratio will remain below 662. Total fixed
assets in operation will increase from DH4,383 million to DH9,355 million,
i.e., about 2.1 times. The debt equity ratio will average about 28:72 and the
debt service coverage ratio will always remain higher than 1.3. The financial
rate of return on ONEP's net fixed assets in operation will increase from 1%
in 1987 to 62 in 1994.

5.15     During the project implementation period, the Regies' net internal
cash generation will provide about 252 of their overall investments and



-41-
customer contributions 401. This translates into a self-financing ratio for
the Regies of about 421 of the portion of investments not financed by their
customers and is in line with their future financial policy (para 5.06). The
proposed IBRD and FEC loans for the Regies' rehabilitation program will
finance   about   81   of   their   total   investments   or   DH327.6 million
(US$39.0 million) and DH25.2 million (US$3.0 million) respectively. Existing
loans are associated with specific investments for which agreements have been
finalized between FEC and the Regies. Other loans, as yet unidentified, are
assumed to be made by FEC, starting in 1988, for financing the development of
the R6gies' water supply system.
Future Financial Performance of the RUgies
5.16     Forecast financial statements  have been  prepared  by  the  sixteen
Regies for the period 1987-1994 and are available in the Project Files. Total
investments other than the proposed project, which are expected to reach
DH3,757 million or about DH470 million per year in current value, will enable
the Regies to maintain their service level during the project implementation
period. Customer contributions will represent about 40%.
5.17     As an example, the financial performance of the R6gie of Casablanca
(RAD) which sells about 47b of the total water sold by the Regies, reflects
the new financial policies discussed in paras 5.06, 5.08 and 5.09. From 1987
to 1994, when most of the project benefits become available, RAD's total
revenues are expected to grow in current terms about 2.7 times from DH335
million to DR927 million. During the same period, tariffs will increase on
average by about 61 per annum in real terms and the unaccounted-for water will
decrease from 34% to 24%. Operating expenses before depreciation will grow
from DH309 million to DH696 million, leaving a gross margin sufficient to
finance all the projected debt service and an average of 301 of investment
costs not  prefinanced by customers  contributions.   Total  fixed assets in
operation will increase from DH751 million to DH1,816 million, i.e. about 2.4
times. The debt equity ratio will increase from 13:87 in 1987 to 35:65 in
1994 and the debt service coverage ratio will always remain higher than 1.2
The financial rate of return on RAD's net fixed assets in operation will
average 61.
VI. JUSTIFICATION
Project Benefits
6.01     The proposed combined efforts of leak detection,  rehabilitation of
production and distribution facilities, construction of reservoirs and water
conservation measures to be implemented by the Regies and ONEP will bring
immediate relief to approximatively 83% of the total population or about 7.2
million inhabitants living in the project area. It will also bring relief to
commercial and industrial enterprises whose development has been hampered by
past  intermittent  service.   Furthermore,  the expected  reduction  in  water
losses will permit the deferral of the expansion of some water production and
transmission facilities, thus resulting in a better utilization of existing
investments.  Exposure of ONEP's and the Regies' staff as well as the staff
from the Regies' Directorate of the Ministry of Interior to medium and



-42-
long-term planning techniques and appropriate Management Information System
will foster managerial efficiency of the sector as a whole and contribute to
the economic recovery of the country.
6.02     Parallel to the physical improvement of services provided by ONEP and
the Regies, the project will also promote institutional, financial and
administrative restructuring-of the sector. The introduction of a Water Code,
the creation of a National Water Council, the preparation of a water supply
organisation study, the updating of the water master plans, the completion of
the potential water resources surveys at the national level, the upgrading of
accounting and financial policies, the Government agreement on a corporate
development plan for ONEP and the proposed technical assistance components
will restrain the dependence of the water supply companies on public financing
and improve Government capability to monitor and control sector development.
The project will therefore have a major impact, not only on the efficiency and
viability of the institutions involved in the sector, but also on the water
resources development and the overall sector management.
Lest Cost Solution
6.03     In a  rehabilitation  project,  the least cost solution consists of
either repairing and/or replacing parts of the facilities or completely
abandoning  facilities  and  constructing  new  ones  .   In  most  cases,  the
rehabilitation of the existing facilities is the obvious least cost solution.
Where the present value of replacement and future operation and maintenance
costs is lower than comparable costs for rehabilitation, existing plants or
parts of them will be abandoned.   Besides the analytical aspects, such as
sensitivity to discount rates and cost variation, great importance is attached
and preference given to facilities which can be easily operated and maintained
and are less dependent on spare parts.  The Bank mission and  the Regies
Directorate (DRSC) have reviewed and accepted the R6gies' designs and
proposals on the basis of these criteria.
Envirommental npaet
6.04     The proposed project is not expected to have any adverse effect on
the environment.   Practically all towns in the project area have partial
sewage  collection  systems,  and  those  inhabitants  living  in  legalized
settlement areas or on the fringes thereof, and who are not connected to these
systems, dispose of their waste water through septic tanks or seepage pits.
Although this may occasionally pollute the nearby wells, this problem will be
overcome through the ongoing development of the R6gies' water distribution
systems which will result in the relinquishment of these wells for human
consumption.
6.05     Health benefits although not quantifiable will be significant in view
of the proposed leak detection and repair programs which will considerably
decrease  the  present  risk  of  pollution.   The urban environment  will  be
improved in parallel with the leak repairs provided under the proposed
project, thus reducing the incidence of stagnant water bodies throughout the
cities. The value which the population attaches to these improvements and the
resulting decrease in health hazard should not be underestimated. A recent
survey of teaching methods in primary schools and teacher training colleges



-43-
suggests that health education is adequate and that the population appreciates
the value of safe water and acceptable methods of waste disposal. This fact
is underlined by another investigation carried out in shantytowns where the
local population contributes to the construction of sewers in order to
eliminate health hazards.
Economic Rate of Returu (ERR)
6.06     Since the institution building, health and environmental benefits of
the project cannot be quantified, they have been excluded from the rate of
return  analysis.   The  quantity  of  water  saved  as  a  result  of  the
rehabilitation program, i.e. 287 million m3 per annum from 1994, valued at
the current ONEP's retail tariff, has been taken as a minimum indicator of
benefits. Capital costs include the annual investments for the rehabilitation
of the water supply systems and are based on January 1987 prices plus
appropriate physical contingencies; incremental operating and maintenance
costs are based on present costs.   In the cost calculation, taxes, custom
duties and shadow pricing have been excluded. Based on these assumptions, the
overall economic rate of return for the project is equal to 18S. The rate of
return is sensitive to a 102 increase in costs or a 10% reduction in benefits
by about 31. A combined 101 increase in costs and 10% reduction in benefits
will result in an ERR of 131. Details of the calculation are given in Annex
14.
6.07     The average incremental cost of water supply for the project area is
estimated at DHO.92/m3 at an opportunity cost of capital of 10X.  The  fact
that the average incremental cost is lower than the expected average selling
price to the Regies of DHI.63/m3 ( in real terms) in 1994 when the benefits
become available indicates that tariff level will be adequate.
Poverty Impact and Affordability
6.08     The proposed rehabilitation programs and restructuring actions will
benefit the poorer districts of the cities served by public standpipes, mainly
the non-formal housing developments, and the population which was connected to
the public water supply system through the social house connection program
established under the Second Water Supply Project (Loan 2006-MOR).
6.09     The urban poverty threshold income is estimated at DM1,190 per month
for a family of 6 persons in 1985 prices. It is estimated that the poverty
group in the municipalities served by the Regies represents about 1.7 million
inhabitants or about 20% of the total population living in the project area.
This estimate is based on the assumption that all of the population served by
public standpipes is below the poverty threshold. Since standpipe water users
have a free access to the service which is paid for by the municipalities,
this group will profit most from the project. In addition, the beneficiaries
from the social house connection program represent 1.0 million inhabitants of
whom about  500,000 have incomes below the poverty threshold.   It is thus
estimated that about 25% of the total population in the project area has an
income under the current urban poverty threshold, and that about 22% of the
project cost and related benefits will be devoted to the rehabilitation of
water supply services provided to these users.



-44-
6.10     The water consumption of the low-income group averages about 10 m3
per month per household of 6 persons. Assuming that the income of the poorest
aegment of tbe population is equal to the urban poverty threshold, the total
monthly payment for water supply services in 1994, when the project's physical
components will have been implemented, will be about DH21 or about 1.8% of the
monthly  income of  the urban  low-income  group.   This is considered to be
affordable. Future water tariff adjustments should not change this forecast,
since no increases in'real terms are expected for low-income consumers.
Risks and Safeguards
6.11     The  projected  tariff  adjustments  are  not  expected  to  have  a
substantial impact on water consumption as the major part of these increases
will affect the more affluent water users consuming more than 30 m3 per
quarter. ONEP, the Regies and DRSC have proven to be highly committed to the
proposed project during the preparation process, and the risks of not
achieving the technical -and organizational restructuring which fall within
their  responsibility  are  low.   For  the  Regies'  sector  loan  component.
individual rehabilitation works have been identified and the Regies have
already started the preparation of individual appraisals in accordance with
acceptable  criteria.   Furthermore,  the technical assistance to be provided
under the project to DRSC to review sub-projects appraisal will help to
minimize  project  risks.   Design and  construction  of  the sub-projects are
straightforward and should pose no difficulties.
6.12     The  main  risks  to  a  timely  implementation  of  the  proposed
institutional,  financial  and  administrative  restructuring  relate  to  the
effective political support for reforms such as:
5i)    the  overall  plan  of  economic  stabilization  to  settle  in
particular existing Government and public enterprises arrears
and prevent their recurrence (paras 4.19 and 4.20);
(ii)    the adoption of a water code and the creation of a National
Water Council (paras 3.28 and 3.29);
(iii)    the introduction of a standard Management Information System to
control ONEP and the Regies at the Central Government level
(para 3.36);
(iv)    the greater managerial autonomy for procurement to be given to
the Regies' General Directors (para 3.37); and
(v)    the implementation of new financial policies and related tariff
increases   and   the  Government   agreement  on  a  corporate
development plan for ONEP (paras 5.08 and 5.09).
These  risks will  be minimized by  strengthening  the  Bank's  macroeconomic
dialogue with Morocco and planning intensive project supervision. However,
should some delays occur in the implementation of these reforms, they would
still provide effective support for the integrated development of the sector.

VIL AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     During negotiations,  agreement  and understanding  were  reached  on
various issues referred to in chapters III through V of this report.
7.02     The proposed loan will be declared effective after:
(i)    conclusion of a subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the
Bank between the Borrower and ONEP (para 3.18); and
(ii)    furnishing  to  the  Bank a  corporate  development  plan  agreed
between the Government and ONEP under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.09).
7.05     Agreement having been reached on the issues set forth in this report,
the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$60.0 million to the
Kingdom of Morocco for a term of 20 years, incluling 5 years of grace.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT
SUB-PROJECTS EIIGIBILITY CRITERIA
L Selection Criteria
1.01      The Regies, assisted by DRSC, will prepare individual sub-project
appraisal reports for their proposed rehabilitation works with the objective
of attaining 20% of unaccounted-for water by 1995. The selection of
sub-projects components will be based on a number of criteria described
hereunder.
1.02      Priority should be given to the rehabilitation or replacement of
facilities which have a low operating efficiency since normally the discounted
investment and operation cost per cubic meter saved decreases as the
unaccounted-for water before rehabilitation increases.
1.03      The selection criteria are as follows:
(i)   provision for the acquisition and replacement of water meters
should be made only if the number of water meters currently out
of order is higher than 52 of the total number of water meters
installed;
(ii)   provision for the acquisition and installation of valves should
be made either if the actual number of broken valves is higher
than 5% of the total number of valves instaLled in the network
or when needed to execute a leak detection program;
(iii)   construction and/or rehabilitation of distribution reservoirs
should be proposed if (a) the static pressures in the
distribution networks is in excess of 60 meters (installation of
pressure reducing valves should be considered as an alternative)
and (b) the total reserve capacity of the network is lower than
12 hours of the average daily water consumption expressed in
m3/hour. In such a case, the total reservoir capacity to be
retained should not normally exceed 12 times the average water
consumption per hour, as estimated five years after completion
of distribution reservoirs' construction. In exceptional cases
when repairs of long supply lines take more than 12 hours, the
distribution reservoirs' capacity could be increased up to 24
times the average water consumption per hour;

(iv) rehabilitation of existing network facilities should take into
account the age of the network, the state of corrosion and
tuberculation, the number of annual repairs, the quality of
fittings and the pressure losses resulting from the insufficient
capacity of the network;
(v) electromechanical equipment should be repaired or replaced when
thair current efficiency is lower than 20% of the nominal
efficiency at optimal utilization, i.e.
0-200 kw      100-1000 kw       1000 kw
Transformers               95%          95-97% .90
Motors                  85-90X             902             95%
Pumps                   70-75%          75-802          80-85%
(vi)   for the Regies with an unaccounted-for water equal or higher
than 20X, leak detection programs should include at least one of
the following elements:
(a)    permanent district metering for 2,000 to 5,000 house
connections;
(b)    water waste metering for 1,000 to 3,000 connections;
(c)    combined district and water waste metering; and
(d)    routine or systematic sounding;
(vii)   meter testing and repair facilities should allow the annual
control of 10? of water meters installed provided that the
number of metered connections is at least equal to 15,000;
(viii)   laboratory equipment should be limited to that necessary to
carry out verification of residual chlorine and of absence of
test germs.
1.04      The decision to rehabilitate an existing water supply facility
should be based on comparing the present value of the benefits attributable to
the rehabilitation after deduction of the capital investment and related
operation and maintenance costs, with the operation and maintenance costs of
existing facilities. These costs should be assessed, excluding taxes but
including physical contingencies, over the economic life of the sub-project
and should be discounted at 10%. All costs and benefits should be expressed
in 1987 prices. In relevant cases, the benefits of the proposed sub-project
should include the annual volume of water expected to be saved in m3
multiplied by the average tariff expressed in 1987 value.
1.05      The option to replace or repair-water supply facilities should be
based on the alternative presenting the least cost solution. The least cost
solution should be determined by comparing the present values of the capital
investment and operating expenses of each feasible alternative at a discount
rate of 10? over the economic life of the proposed sub-project. The basis for
calculation will be as follows:

(i} all investment cost will be expressed in 1987 price values
before taxes but including price contingencies;
(ii)   repairs and/or replacement costs will be asse8sed to fully
utilize the sub-project facilities over their life span; and
(iii)   the incremental operating expenses resulting from the proposed
rehabilitation of the systems should be calculated for each year
of the sub-project life span and expressed in 1987 price levels.

ONEP'S FINANCIAL ASSMIMFwONS
REVENUES
ihWater Charges
Water charges have been calculated on the basis of projected water
consumption of ONEP's customers, taking into account population growth and the
rate of connections of the R6gies' customers. In the 1987-1995 period, ONEP's
bulk water production, taking into account the decrease in unaccounted-for
water and the ongoing investment program to develop its water resources, will
increase from 1.1 to 1.5 million m3/day. Reflecting ONEP's financial
objectives (discussed in body of SAR), average revenues from the water charge
in DR per m3 of water sold in bulk to the Regies will gradually increase, as
follows:
1987     1988     1989      1990     1991      1992      1993     1994      1995
1.20     1.34     1.54      1.82     2.09      2.26     2.33      2.44      2.50
Connection and Related Charges
Connections are the property of customers.  The costs of making the
connection is billed to consumers. The cost per connection which in 1986
averaged DHI,920 includes materials and labor, plus 20% for overhead, plus a
service tax of 121 on labor. Projections from this base assume annual price
increases of 71 in 1987, 62 in 1988 and 1989 and 52 thereafter.
Miscellaneous
This covers sale of equipment and materials, and the interest earned
on the credit facilities offered to customers for house-connections.
Interest on Bonds
Bonds to be issued in the framework of the PERL project will bear a
61 interest starting in 1988.
EXPENSES
All expenses subject to price increases of 71 in 1987, 61 in 1988
and 1989 and 51 thereafter except otherwise specified. Projected
volume/quantities are explained below.

ANNEX 13
Tage 2 of 3
Energy
Based on operating requirements, mainly pumping stations and
treatment plants with an annual price increase of 6£.
Materials
Quantities based on projected number of new connections, lengths of
main extension and works made on force account and, in the case of
maintenance, an amount equivalent to about 0.4% of gross fixed assets in
operation.
Administrative and Other
In line with general activity of ONEP.
Taxes
Based on a 7? tax on water sales plus a service tax of 12S for meter
rental, maintenance of house connections and labor, ONEP is not liable for
income taxes.
Capitalized Expenses
These cover the cost of extensions carried out by ONEP.
Depreciation
Calculated on a straight-line basis during the estimated useful
asset life. An average rate of 3.75% has been used for new projected
investments.
CASHFLOW STATEBENTS AND BALANCE SHEETS
Equity Contribution from Government
These are the Government's expected contributions towards the cost
of ONEP's investment program set in accordance with ONEP's new financial
objectives.
Capital Contributions from Customers
Contributions paid by house owners, industries, touristic facilities
and other public administration towards financing of secondary network on the
basis of property superficy. A fixed fee is assessed on the square root of
the plot and payment of actual cost is charged beyond the first 60 meters.
Projected amounts have been adjusted for annual inflation.
Other Reserves
These represent ONEP'8 revaluation reserve for DH154.4 million and
other reserves for staff pension.

ANNEX 13
Page 3 of
Cash
Cash on hand has been forecast at levels sufficient for normal
operations.
Foreign Exchange Risk ProviUion
This represents the provision for foreign exchange losses on
long-term debt repayments.
Receivables
These have been factored at the equivalent of 2 months of sales for
private customers. Existing arrears of Government agencies at the end of 1986
would be settled over a five year period (1987-1992). Arrears of
Administrations for future water bills are estimated at six months of sales up
to 1987 and at four months thereafter. Bad debts have been estimated at 1.5%
of revenues from water charges, and have been deducted from each year's gross
revenues.
Inventories
During 1986, inventories were equivalent to sixteen months of
materials, fuel and chemical requirements. These have been projected at
twelve months equivalent for 1987, ten months for 1988, nine months for 1989
and eight months thereafter.
Payables
Existing payables to Government agencies at the end of 1986 would be
settled over a five year period (1987-1992). Future payables are estimated at
equivalent of (i) three months of capital expenditures; and (ii) retention
money.
Long Term Debt
The projected Long-Term Debt includes:
(a)   the proposed Bank loan of US$15.5 million, for 20 years,
including five years of grace, at the current variable interest
rate;
(b)   existing Bank Group loans and other International Lenders' loans
included in the projections on the basis of existing contracts;
(c)   as yet unidentified borrowings for ONEP's expansion after 1988.
These have been assumed to be repayable in 15 years after an
initial grace period of three years and to bear interest at 8%
per annum.
