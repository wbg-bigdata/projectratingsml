MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY REHABIITATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to Morocco for the equivalent
of US$60.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a
term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, and would support water supply rehabilitation works throughout
Morocco and introduce long-term policy reforms.
2.       Background.  Water is scarce in Morocco and existing groundwater
sources are becoming exhausted or are deteriorating in quality as a result of
over-exploitation. ireated surface water is therefore brought from greater
distances to supply the larger cities. Although about 802 of the urban
population receives piped water, and about 302 of the rural areas has access
to piped water, most of the water supply systems installed during the first
half of the century need urgent repairs and rehabilitation to reduce water
losses and improve the service. Sewerage services, which have not kept pace
with the development of water supply, also need remedial attention and are the
subject of a proposed loan for the R6gie I/ of Greater Casablanca (RAD) and
six additional Regies.
3.       Institutional, financial, administrative and technical limitations
restrain the efficient management of the water supply sector in Morocco
These limitations seriously impair the rational financial and investment
planning of the sector as well as the monitoring of its development. The
Government and the Bank seek to resolve these issues through policy reforms
and sector adjustment measures, such as strengthening cost recovery, and
fostering the development of a strong institutional framework in order to
effectively contribute to the country's overall development process. This
strategy is also designed to institutionalize a rational decision process for
new investments in water production and distribution facilities.
4.       Project Objectives.  The project includes of a number of sector
restructuring actions, the objectives of which are to: (i) develop the
Government's and the Regies' capabilities to identify, prepare, appraise and
L'    Regies are public enterprises which supply water throughout Morocco, and
are expected to provide sewerage services eventually.



- 2 -
monitor projects which meet strictly defined economic and financial criteria;
(ii) improve the performance of the water supply companies through
organizational, financial and management reforms; (iii) progressively reduce
the dependence on Governmental budgetary transfers of the Office National de
l'Eau Pobable (ONEP), an organization unier the Ministry of Equipment,
responsible for potable water production and conveyance; (iv) rehabilitate
existing installations to increase the quantity of water available for
distribution and reduce operating costs; (v) improve overall sector management
and investment planning through the creation of a system for the planning and
coordination of investments in the sectors; and (vi) establish a regulatory
framework to control the use and disposal of water.
5.        Project Descript on.  The project, to be implemented over an eight
year period, introduces policy reforms and sector adjustment measures designed
to alleviate constraints facing the sector, by restructuring ONEP, the sixteen
water supply Regies, the Hydraulic Administration (AH) of the Ministry of
Equipment and the Regies' Directorate (DRSC) of the Ministry of Interior. The
proposed project and related policy actions include the following:
(i) technical restructuring, including rehabilitation and replacement of water
production and distribution facilities, studies to complement existing water
resources surveys and water supply master plans in major urban areas, and
formulation of maintenance and investment programs for ONEP and the Regies;
(ii) institutional restructuring, including the establishment of a system to
develop strategies for water resources management, to regulate the extraction,
use and disposal of water, and to coordinate long-term investment planning
between ONEP and the Regies; a study to optimize the institutional
organization of the water supply sector; development of a program to improve
the procurement process in the Regies; and establishment of a corporate
development plan (Contrat Plan) agreed between the Government and ONEP; (iii)
financial restructuring, including introduction of new financial policies and
restructuring of the financial position of the Regies, the settlement of
Government's arrears to ONEP and the Regies, as well as implementation of
measures to prevent future build-up of arrears, and the improvement of
accounting and auditing; and (iv) administrative restructuring, including
development of management information systems and training programs within the
sectcr, provision of computer equipment for the Regies, ONEP and the Hydraulic
Administration, and provision of technical assistance for subproject appraisal
and supervision.
6.        The total project cost (net of taxes and duties) is estimated at
US$101.3 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$60.0 million. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Morocco are given in Schedules C and D
respectively. Two maps of the locations of the Regies and of the ONEP centers
are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6087-MOR dated April 28,
1986, is being distributed separately.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Since 1968, the Bank has been
active in lending to Morocco to improve the access to a safe water supply,
particularly for the low-income population in urban areas. Severe budgetary
constraints in the Government have encouraged the Bank to orient sector
lending towards optimization of the efficiency of existing water production
and distribution facilities, before conisidering significant program



- 3 -
expansion. Such an approach is reflected in both the Bank's water supply and
severage sector strategies.
8.        Agreed Actions.  Agreement was reached on: (i) the financial,
technical and economic criteria and procedures to be used by DRSC to appraise
the R6gies' subprojects; (ii) the implementation of Management Information
Systems and performance indicators to monitor the development of ONEP and the
Regies; (iii) settlement of public arrears in the water supply sector in
accordance with guidelines and a schedule acceptable to the Bank and budgetary
allocations sufficient to avoid a build up of future arrears; (iv) achievement
by the Regies of a net cash generation equivalent to at least 30% of those
annual capital expenditures which are not prefinanced by customers' and
developers' contributions, and achievement by ONEP of a net cash generation of
at least 15% from 1987 to 1990, 20% in 1991 and 30% in 1992 and thereafter of
its annual investment program; (v) annual updating of an investment program
for ONEP satisfactory to the Bank; and (vi) annual review of the government's
5-year investment program for the water supply sector.
9.        As conditions of effectiveness, (i) the Borrower will enter into a
subsidiary Loan agreement with ONEP, satisfactory to the Bank; and (ii) ONEP
and the Government will agree on a corporate development plan, satisfactory to
the Bank. In addition, the following conditions of disbursement are proposed:
(i) for the portion of the loan related to a particular Regie, approval by the
Bank of the Regie's subproject and the conclusion of a subloan agreement
between the Government and that Regie on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank. If additional funding is required for financing a R6gie's
subproject, the signing of a financing agreement on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank between FEC and the Regie concerned would also be a
condition of disbursement of the portion of the Bank loan to that Regie; and
(ii) for the entire portion of the loan related to the Regies, the employment
of consultants, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to
provide technical assistance for subproject appraisal and supervision, and the
creation of a project unit in DRSC.
10.       Justification.  The institutional, financial, and administrative
reforms under the project would improve the efficiency and viability of sector
institutions, reduce their dependence on public financing, and foster better
water resource development and overall sector management. By rehabilitating
the water supply systems, the project would bring immediate relief to about 80
percent of the urban population or about 7.0 million inhabitants, as well as
to commercial and industrial enterprises experiencing an intermittent water
supply service. The reduction in water losses expected under the project
would permit deferral of some facility expansion and better investment
utilization.  The project represents the least cost solution to improve the
efficiency of water production and distribution facilities and would not
create any adverse effect on the environment; on the contrary, leakage
detection and repairs would yield health benefits through reducing the
incidence of stagnant water bodies and consequent pollution risks.
11.       Risks.  The risks, which are considered minimal, relate to possible
delays in the Government's performance of institutional, financial and
administrative reforms in the sector. The government has so far however,
expressed its full commitment to the implementation of such reforms.

12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve this loan.
