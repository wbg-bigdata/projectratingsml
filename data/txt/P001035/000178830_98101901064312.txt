REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
CONAKRY URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMTlvARY
Borrower:              Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea.
Beneficiaries:         The Ministry of Construction, Housing, Urban Planning and
Domain (MCHUD); and the Conakry Administrative Region
(RAC).
Amount:                SDR 10.1 million (US$10.7 million).
Terms:                 Standard.
Project Description:  The proposed project will strengthen the operational
capacity of Central and Local Government institutions
responsible for urban development planning and urban
service management in Conakry. To this effect, the project
will fund: (i) technical assistance, training, and
provision of essential equipment to enhance MCHUD's and
RAC's capacity to plan, coordinate and control urban
development in the Greater Conakry area; (ii) technical
assistance, training and provision of essential equipment
to develop RAC's ability to perform adequate technical and
financial management of basic urban services (stormwater
drainage network maintenance, garbage collection and
service vehicle maintenance); and (iii) rehabilitation of
existing and construction of new stormwater drainage
networks to improve city-wide environmental conditions.
Project Benefits:      The proposed project will contribute to Guinea's overall
economic development objectives by strengthening key
urban sector institutions and by introducing significant
changes in the financial management procedures for urban
services, especially with regard to the funding of the
foreign exchange component of operating costs. As
immediate benefits, creating technically and financially
sound operating conditions for urban services will
contribute to the improvement of living conditions of at
least 60% of city residents. Construction of new and
repair of existing stormwater drainage networks will
help to ensure satisfactory transport conditions
throughout the year in economically important downtown
areas. Reorganization of garbage collection services
will double the volume of daily collected waste.
Introduction of a mechanism to assure availability of
needed foreign exchange will substantially reduce waste
of local resources in the form of idle local tax
receipts. Project activities will provide a focus for
other donor and private sector opportunities in the
urban sector. As a long-term benefit, the reduction of



- v -
disorderly sprawl, through increased control over urban
growth and improved coordination between authorities
involved in urban development activities will contribute
to improving the operation of public utilities. Both
urban services and urban planning improvements will lay
the ground work for increased efficiency of investment
in infrastructure and services, and will improve the
overall functioning of the city as an economic center
therereby enabling it more effectively to provide vital
support to the country's overall development.
Project Risks:         The potential risk that entrusting the responsibility
for project management to existing institutions could
affect the efficiency of implementation, is mitigated by
the intense use of technical assistance and on-the-job
and course training for Guinean staff. The risk
inherent in any project designed to promote
institutional development that the departure of
technical assistance personnel could weaken the project
agency and compromise future project benefits, is offset
by the keen interest in the urban sector shown by other
international and bilateral donors and thus the strong
likelihood of continuing technical assistance and
training programs in the years ahead. Due to the
novelty of the project funding approach, RAC, the main
implementation agency, could be exposed to cashflow
shortfalls. This risk is mitigated by the availability
of substantial surpluses in the CPPE budgets throughout
the project period, as well as by the Government's
strong commitment to the proposed reforms for urban
service management.

REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
CONAKRY URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. SECTORAL BACKGROUND
A. The National Economic Context
1.01     Guinea has a land area of about 246,000 km2 and a population cur-
rently estimated at 5.8 million with an annual growth rate of 2.8% a year.
Although exceptionally endowed with agricultural, mineral and water resources,
the country is among the least developed in West Africa. Average GNP per
capita was less than US$300 in 1981, and average life expectancy at birth was
about 44 years.
1.02     Guinea's overall economic performance since independence in 1958 has
been poor. Economic policies have been governed by the socialist development
philosophy of the ruling party (Parti Democratique de Guinee). This has led
to replacing a market-oriented rural economy with a centrally planned economy
promoting state ownership of land and means of production, collectivized
labor, and allocation of resources through central decision making. Though
agriculture is the most important sector in the Guinean economy, employing
about 80% of the total population, agricultural production has, in per capita
terms, fallen far below pre-independence level. Mining production (Guinea is
one of the world's largest bauxite and aluminium producers) has become the
country's almost exclusive source of foreign exchange earnings. However,
because of depressed external markets and levelling in production capacity,
revenues from mining have stagnated over the last few years.
1.03     Attempts to protect the domestic economy from international infla-
tion through state control of prices have led to chronic distortions in
pricing and production, persistent over-evaluation of the national currency,
and the development of a flourishing parallel market. Erratic availability of
foreign exchange--a consequence of chronic balance of payment problems--limits
access to critical imported inputs, jeopardizes otherwise economically viable
projects, and blocks efficient functioning of services.
B. The Urban Sector
1.04     While agricultural production has fallen and economic and living
conditions in rural areas have deteriorated, there has been a steady increase
in the importance of the urban sector. Indeed, probably around 50% of GDP is
now generated in urban areas. Although population data are scarce and--where
available--of doubtful accuracy, the urban population is estimated to have
growr. at 6% annually during the last 25 years. While the share of population
living in centers of 10,000 and more was only 7% of total population at
independence, it now probably exceeds 25%, or 1.5 million Guineans. According
to the February 1983 census, around 45% of this total urban population is
concentrated in Conakry, Guinea's capital (705,000 in 1983), while the next
three largest towns shelter only another 10% to 12% (Annex 1-1).



-2-
C. Conakry
1.05     Conakry is located on a narrow and ridged peninsula that extends more
than 35 km through mangrove swamps into the open sea. At independence, the city
had a population estimated at about 100,000.  Growing rapidly at an annual rate
of over 6.5%, its population reached around 440,000 in 1972, and exceeded 700,000
in 1983. This explosive population growth was accompanied by geographical expan-
sion, with the city more than quadrupling in size since independence, from about
650 ha in 1958 to almost 3,000 ha in 1981 (Annex 1-2). Should the existing
growth trends prevail, Conakry's population is likely to double by the year
2000 to 1.4 million inhabitants or about 70% of the country's total urban popula-
tion. Geographically, the city will more than triple in area, reaching
10,000 ha.
1.06     Conakry is Guinea's main economic and industrial center.  Over 60% of
all state industrial enterprises are located in the Conakry area and they
account for about 50% of employment in the secondary sector. Proportions are
similar for trade and public administration. Reliable data on employment and
income distribution are scarce. According to a 1981 survey, average monthly
household 1/ income in Conakry was estimated at GSY 11,800 (US$510) 2/, a fig-
ure which does not include frequent additional non-monetary incomes
(Annex 1-2). It is difficult, however, to establish cost of living indices,
since prices vary widely according to the availability of vital goods, and
absolute poverty may be more widespread than the wage figures indicate
(para. 6.11).
1.07     Today's urban conditions in Conakry largely reflect the problems and
shortcomings of Guinea's overall economic development process since indepen-
dence: weakness of key institutions arising from the dearth of adequately
trained staff; shortfall of investments in basic infrastructure and utilities;
and lack of maintenance of existing assets due to chronic unavailability of
foreign exchange for recurrent cost financing.
1.08     Conakry's growth since independence has taken place with only little
urban development planning or control 3/. Authorities in charge of urban
planning and management have met increasing difficulties to plan for spatial
expansion and land development, to identify, coordinate and carry out the most
critically needed investments in basic infrastructure and services, or to
ensure proper maintenance of existing assets. As a result, the city's older
1/   Average household size 10.9 persons.
2/   US$ equivalent at the exchange rate of US$1 = GSY 23.  (The
overvaluation of the Guinean currency suggests that the official
dollar equivalent may be significantly overstated.)
3/   An urban development plan was prepared by an Eastern European
consultant group in the early 1960s, but being based on unrealistic
assumptions regarding population growth and economic development did
not provide useful guidance.



- 3 -
districts have become critically overcrowded with densities exceeding 1,000
habitants/ha in various areas (Annex 1-2 and Maps IBRD 17436/41). Urban
spread has been very uneven, with population growth concentrated along the two
main roads which lead from the city inland along the two edges of the
peninsula. Newer settlements stretch as far as 25 kms along these roads while
the hilly areas in between are but sparsely inhabited.
1.09     Most of the post-independence urban extension has been undertaken on
an ad hoc basis. Land is state property in Guinea and is allocated to indi-
viduals in the form of perpetual, non-tradable occupancy rights. Land
division and allocation procedures are cumbersome, and allocation of plots
areas has barely filled more than one-third of actual demand during the last
years. In addition, efficient land management has been persistently hampered
by the lack of cartographical documents and the break-up of basic topograph-
ical networks. Currently, it is in many areas nearly impossible to ascertain
actual tenure status which would be necessary to implement a functioning
cadastral system. Although an official allocation is, in principle, required
to obtain construction materials at official prices by state-run agencies,
probably more than two-thirds of new houses have been built outside the
legally subdivided areas.
1.10     Investment in urban infrastructure, services and public utilities, in
Conakry has remained far below minimal requirements. Except for some recent
street resurfacing works, road investment has been insignificant over most of
the last two decades, and the currently existing network barely exceeds the
one that existed at independence (at least with respect to roads suited to
vehicular access). Transport, a crucial issue given the city's 'strip'
development pattern, has become an overwhelming problem in the day-to-day life
of city inhabitants since public transport companies, hampered by inadequate
management and poor road infrastructure, have virtually ceased to operate.
Though steadily improving as a result of recent IDA projects 1/, conditions of
water and power supply remain largely unsatisfactory. Over 60% of Conakry
households are still deprived of access to safe water and have to resort to
supply from wells or contaminated rivers. Power supply is plagued by chronic
breakdowns which severely affect the functioning of the city's economic
activities. A 45 km stormwater drainage network built in pre-independence
days in the older parts of the city has never been extended.
1.11     The lack of systematic maintenance and the erratic functioning of
urban services have caused a steady deterioration of environmental conditions
in both the city's older districts and the recent extensions. Deficiencies in
maintenance of the stormwater drainage system is, given the heavy annual
rainfall 2/, one of the most crucial problems. Due to almost total lack of
maintenance, much of the drainage network has fallen into disrepair. Severe
1/   First Water and Sanitation Project (870-GUI) and First Power
Project (1085-GUI).
2/   Annual average rainfall is 165 inches (4,200 mm) with 80% of it con-
centrated in the period of June to September, peaking in July with an
average of 51 inches (equivalent to 30% of annual precipitation).



- 4 -
flooding occurs yearly in several areas and leads to extended road blockages
on even major transport links, and rapid deterioration of road surfaces.
Encroachments by other utility networks, mud deposits, combined with indis-
criminate waste disposal owing to ineffective garbage collection further
contribute to restrict the effectiveness of stormwater drainage. Recent
attempts undertaken through the First Water and Sanitation Project (870-GUI)
to establish routine maintenance on the network have, however, shown promising
results. Insufficient garbage collection contributes significantly to
Conakry's hazardous health conditions. Lack of suitable road access,
particularly in the more recently developed areas, deprives large portions of
the city with the possibility of any collection service. Even in serviced
areas, collection is at best erratic, and only about one-fifth of daily
produced waste is actually collected.
D.  Sector Policy and Institutions
1.12     While the Government's political philosophy still emphasizes a strong
commitment to the improvement of rural productivity, urban concerns are
capturing an increasing share of development attention. Although
comprehensive urban development and urban management policies have yet to be
defined, the Government has become increasingly aware of the necessity to
prevent further decline of living and operating conditions in urban areas and
to assert the role of cities in the country's overall economic development
process. While the Government has initially directed its main efforts to
attempts (thus far unsuccessful) to overcome the problems of housing shortage
through public, large-scale shelter construction programs, it has also
acknowledged the need for establishing appropriate institutional mechanisms to
ensure proficient planning, coordination and control of urban development and
growth.
1.13     Despite the centralized structure of the Guinean institutional frame-
work, authorities involved in urban development activities have frequently
encountered difficulties in coordinating effectively. Though in principle the
institutional structure provides for such a coordination, conflicts arising
from overlapping responsibilities often affect the implementation of otherwise
worthwhile projects. To eliminate the adverse effects of this lack of co-
ordination, the Ministry of Construction, Housing, Urban Planning and Domain
(MCHUD) was created in 1979 and vested with the responsibility to control and
coordinate urban development activities, whether undertaken by its own
services or those of any other authority, and to ensure consistency of such
activities with overall sector development objectives. In reality, MCHUD has,
however, met considerable difficulty in fully carrying out these responsibili-
t;ies, mainly because of the lack of experience of its predominantly locally
trained staff or the unavailability of critically needed equipment and supplies.
1.14     Urban management in Conakry is a responsibility of the Conakry
Administrative Region (RAC) and the three Conakry Municipalities (CPPEs) under
its administrative control. This institutional system is relatively new. It
is the result of a reform of the local administrative system undertaken in
1980, in the course of which urban management responsibilities--and the cor-
responding resources--were largely shifted from RAC, until then the sole
mlunicipal authority in Conakry, to the newly created CPPEs.



- 5-
1.15     The goal of this reform was to bring administrative management into
closer contact with the constituency, and to allow the latter to participate
more actively in actual management and decision making. This shift of respon-
sibilities has boosted the yields of tax collection, especially of the
Pegional Development Tax, a head tax established in 1980. In most other
spheres, the decentralization scheme served only to accentuate pre-existing
constraints to effective service delivery, namely lack of qualified manpower
and essential equipment. As a consequence of the spreading of resources and
of the chronic shortage of foreign exchange to import critically needed
materials and supplies, the CPPEs have not been able to spend more than 15% to
40% of their annual capital budgets 1/. These problems have been compounded
by administratively rigid, though in principle reasonable, budgeting
procedures and regulations. As a result, the CPPEs have accumulated rapidly
increasing budgetary surpluses, equivalent in 1982 to their entire recurrent
income. In this context, RAC has remained the only capable local
administrative body, despite its limited operational responsibilities.
Benefiting from its prior experience with city-wide operation of urban
services, it has continued to ensure city-wide maintenance of drainage
networks and to participate actively in the operation of garbage collection.
1.16     While the Government has no intention of reconsidering the decentra-
lization scheme, it has become increasingly aware of its drawbacks for the
management of technical services.  It has recognized the need to search for
new and more realistic solutions which, without disrupting the existing
institutional context, would lead to better technical and financial management
and performance by both RAC and the CPPEs.  In particular, it has decided, in
connection with the proposed project to pool various technical services at the
RAC level, and to amend the regional and local financial management procedures
so as to assure the financial viability of these new structures.
E. Bank Strategy and Project Rationale
1.17     The main thrust of the Bank Group's development strategy is to sup-
port major reforms of the Guinean economic management system as a preliminary
condition for improving the prospects of economic development. In line with
this, more specific targets of this strategy are to: (a) give priority to
projects that increase production and exports; (b) improve the absorptive
capacity in those social and infrastructure sectors which support the produc-
tive sectors, through rehabilitation and technical and managerial training;
(c) introduce technical assistance directed toward policy reforms, improved
economic management, and resource allocation; and (d) improve capital flows
through the promotion of private investment.
1/   The RAC's record on capital expenditure prior to the decentraliza-
tion was generally better but deteriorated over time: about 65% in 1977,
40% in 1978 and 20% in 1979 (actual expenditure as percent of amount
budgeted).

1.   Bank Lending Program and Other Donors
1.18     Two IDA projects have provided assistance to the Conakry urban
sector. The First Water and Sanitation Project (870-GUI, FY79,
US$12.5 million), financed in association with the African Development Bank,
helped to relieve immediate water supply shortages and to carry out the first
stage of a priority drainage reconstruction and extension program in
Conakry. The First Power Project (1085-GUI, FY80, US$32.5 million) is
financing part of a large power network rehabilitation program in cooperation
with the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and the
German Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau (KfW).
1.19     Other projects are providing indirect assistance to the sector:
the Industrial Rehabilitation and Promotion Project (1234-GUI, FY82,
SDR 16.6 million), financed in association with various other donors, includes
funding for the rehabilitation of construction material industries, such as a
quarry and a floor tile factory located near Conakry; the Conakry Port Project
(1392-GUI, FY83, SDR 12.1 million) provides funding for major port
rehabilitation works; and the Third Highway Project (FY84) participates in the
financing of the reconstruction of the Conakry-Mamou Road, Conakry's sole link
to the country's agricultural hinterland.
1.20     The United Nations' agencies UNCHS and UNCDF are currently carrying
out an urban development project. This project was initially set up as a
pilot for the present IDA project, but due to the high standard of housing
eventually provided, was deemed inappropriate for expansion through a Bank
project. The European Economic Community (EEC) is considering the possible
financing of an urban development project amounting to an estimated
US$5.85 million equivalent. This project which has been prepared in close
coordination with the Bank would be targeted primarily at urban development
p:Lanning in various major secondary cities, and would be complementary to the
proposed IDA financed project. The German Association for Technical
Assistance (GTZ) is contemplating an urban transport project consisting
essentially of the provision of van-buses for passenger transport and
technical assistance to driver cooperatives.
2.   Project Rationale
1.21     Guinea's cities, in particular Conakry, will play a pivotal role in
the country's overall economic development. Even if efforts to spur
dievelopment in rural areas meet with success in the years ahead, the impact on
the present migration trends will remain marginal with no significant slow-
dDwn of urban growth likely to occur over the short- and medium-term. More-
over, the beginning of economic liberalization is likely to enhance the city's
appeal and prompt an even faster growth rate in the years ahead. Therefore,
reversing the steady, city-wide decline in living and operating conditions in
Conakry, and commencing to create the basic conditions for future economic
expansion, have become of utmost urgency.



- 7 -
1.22     Sustained success in this endeavor will largely depend on the
Government's ability to identify and implement a consistent and comprehensive
development strategy for the city as a whole. Establishing conditions for
adequate functioning of urban services represents a fundamental first step
in such a strategy. Improving management efficiency in municipal services
requires action both to increase immediate technical capacity and to improve
the financial structures supporting sustained long-run service operation.
Identifying directions for future urban growth is a complementary element in
such a strategy. Establishing a consistent set of long-term objectives based
on a realistic assessment of available economic and human resources is a pre-
requisite for securing the conditions of the city's adequate functioning in
the long run.
1.23     The proposed project will assist the Government in its attempts to
implement the first steps of such a strategy. Designed in line with the Bank
Group's overall country assistance strategy in Guinea, it reflects the concern
that in the initial stages of sectoral dialogue, strengthening the operating
capacity of urban management institutions in Conakry should be given priority
in order to create the absorptive capacity for future investment projects. At
the present time, an urban project, involving other priority areas such as
housing, urban transport or road infrastructure, is premature given the weak
institutional capacity. Thus the project's main thrust is to lay the
essential groundwork for more extensive involvement, either by IDA or other
donors.
1.24     At the moment, IDA is the only donor in a position to support these
first steps towards improving the policy and technical arrangements for making
future investment in Conakry more feasible.  Guinea's dialogue with the
international donor community is still in an early stage, but EEC and other
donors have given a firm indication that they would be willing to support
urban investments in Guinea in conjunction with IDA. This project will be the
first effort by any agency to assess the multiple problems in the urban sector
and to propose a strategy for dealing with it. The proposed project will give
key Guinean administrators and technicians their first experience with viable
service delivery operations and with the process of practical urban
development planning, and will leave them in a position to run these
activities and identify those specific external inputs which they may continue
to need.
II. PROJECT BENEFICIARIES
A. General Institutional Framework
2.01     Guinea's institutional framework is characterized by a highly
centralized politico-economic system patterned on the organizational concepts
of centrally planned economies, and defined as a Party-State (Parti-Etat).
Administrative, economic, and technical Government entities, thoroughly



- 8 -
intertwined with the political system at all levels of the hierarchy, are
structured into two fundamental bodies: the Central Government (Pouvoir
R6volutionnaire Central) comprising ministries and other central authorities;
and a Territorial Government system consisting of a pyramidally organized
politico-administrative apparatus of regional and local authorities, encom-
passing from the bottom to the top approximately 2,500 Local Revolutionary
Powers (Pouvoir Revolutionnaire Local or PRL), 320 Districts (Arrondissement),
33 Administrative Regions (Region Administrative) and 7 General Commissariats
of Revolution (Commissariat Gen6ral a la Revolution or CGR). Constitu-
tionally, Central Government authorities are responsible for sector policy,
programming, and coordination at the national level, whereas responsibility
for actual administration, technical and financial management is within set
limits and under tight control of the relevant Central Government authorities
entrusted to the regional/local authorities. In a context of persistent
shortage of human and financial resources, this division of responsibilities
remains largely theoretical, however, and contributes to confusion, overlaps,
and ambiguity in actual responsibilities and competences, since many local
functions continue to be ensured by either Central Government and/or other
level local entities.
3. The Ministry of Construction, Housing, Urban Planning and Domain (MCHUD)
2.02     The Ministry of Construction, Housing, Urban Planning and Domain
(MCHUD) was created in 1979 as part of the reorganization of the former
Ministry of Public Works and Construction. As a Central Government authority,
MCHUD is primarily responsible for nationwide planning, coordination, and
promotion of development activities in the areas of construction, housing,
urban planning and land management.
2.03     MCHUD is composed of five Directorates General (World Bank Chart 25388
on following page) for (a) Urban Planning, (b) Topography, (c) Land
Management, (d) Housing and Construction, (e) Equipment and Acquisitions, of
which only the first two will be directly involved in the proposed project.
2.04     The Directorate General of Urban Planning has three departments:
(EL) urban planning; (b) land development; and (c) coordination and supervision
of regional urban planning departments. Among its main responsibilities range
the preparation of long-term urban planning studies (master plan studies) and
the review of detailed urban planning and design studies prepared by the
relevant service departments of regional and local authorities. The
Directorate's staff consists of about 34 architects and engineers, of which
approximately two-thirds are permanently seconded to regional and local
authorities. Most staff have been locally trained at the Conakry
Polytechnical Institute Gamal Abd-el-Nasr (IPGAN), although some have had
additional training in Eastern European and Cuban universities.

2.05     The Directorate General of Topography is responsible for preserving
and extending general topographical networks required as a basis for sub-
divisions executed under its control by the respective service departments of
regional and local authorities. The Directorate's staff consists of five
foreign trained topographical engineers and several auxiliary engineers
locally trained at Ecole Nationale des Arts et M6tiers (ENAM).
C. The Conakry Administrative Region (RAC)
2.06     Within the pyramidal structure of Territorial Government
(para. 2.01), the Conakry Administrative Region (RAC) acts, under the institu-
tional control of the Conakry CGR 1/, as an overseeing and coordinating
authority over the three Conakry CPPEs (Communes Populaires de Plein
Exercice) 2/. These CPPEs result from the federation, three by three, of
the nine Districts of which RAC was constituted prior to the 1980 reform of
the local administrative system (para. 1.14). The Districts, in turn, are
split into a total of 151 PRLs.
2.07     RAC is headed by an appointed Governor and is organized into four
secretariats (World Bank Chart 25387 on following page): (a) Finance
and Planning; (b) Rural Development; (c) Social and Cultural Affairs;
(d) Infrastructure and Trade. Only the latter two secretariats will
participate directly in the proposed project. Through their respective
technical departments, these secretariats ensure operation of various services
provided at a city-wide level (Services Communs). The Secretariats of Social
and Cultural Affairs include a Drainage Maintenance Unit, a Sanitation
Department responsible for overseeing garbage collection currently operated by
the CPPEs, and a Vehicle Maintenance Yard. The Secretariat of Infrastructure
and Trade encompasses a (currently) non-operational Street Maintenance
Department, and the Regional Departments of Topography and Urban Planning.
2.08     The Drainage Maintenance Unit was created through the IDA project
870-GUI. Its responsibilities include maintenance, primarily through
cleaning, of the existing drainage network. The Drainage Maintenance Unit is
headed by a locally-trained engineer who directs about 30 workers organized in
several small units. The Regional Department of Topography with one topo-
graphical engineer and a few auxiliary engineers, is responsible for all non-
primary topographical engineering work within RAC's administrative area (land
su'bdivisions, topographical surveys).  The Regional Department of Urban
Planning, a recently created department comprising an architect and a few
auxiliary staff, is responsible for design and implementation control of all
land subdivisions. The Vehicle Maintenance Yard is, in principle, responsible
for maintenance and repair of about 100 vehicles which comprise the RAC and
1/   Besides RAC, the Conakry CGR includes the Administrative Regions of
Coyah, Fria, and Forecariah.
2/   CPPE I covers about 18% of the Conakry population, CPPE II about
31%, and CPPE III about 51% (Annex 1-2).

CPPEs' fleet. Operations at the yard have come to a virtual standstill,
however, due to absence of qualified management, pilfering of essential
equipment, and chronic unavailability of critical supplies and spare parts.
2.09     The CPPEs are headed by elected mayors and are structured in a way
similar to RAC into four secretariats. In accordance with the 1980 reform of
local administration, the CPPEs are responsible for operating all urban
services except for those delivered by RAC (Services Communs). Services to be
provided theoretically by the CPPEs include, among others, street maintenance
(cleaning), sanitation and garbage collection, and construction and
maintenance of public facilities. Delivery performance in most of these
areas, however, is extremely low due to the lack of means and technical
staff. Garbage Collection Services, since their removal from RAC's direct
responsibility in 1980, have functioned extremely poorly. The CPPEs have
about 30 collection vehicles available, only 30% of which are operable. Their
average age is close to eight years, and with the exception of two new
vehicles from UNDP, most of the fleet consists of refurbished surplus vehicles
provided through a city twinning agreement with a German municipality. The
operable vehicles are able to collect only 20%-25% (20-30 tons daily) of the
waste produced in the serviced areas, while the remainder piles up on streets
and open spaces.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Main Project Features
3.01     The primary objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)  to strengthen the ability of Central and Local Government institu-
tions to proficiently plan, coordinate, and control urban growth and
development in the Greater Conakry area;
(b)  to establish the basic mechanisms for adequate funding of urban
service operations from local revenues; and
(c)  to improve the management of city-wide garbage collection and
drainage maintenance operations.
3.02     To achieve the above objectives, the project will support the
Ministry of Construction, Housing, Urban Planning and Domain (MCHUD) and the
Conakry Administrative Region (RAC) in form of: technical assistance, equip-
ment, operating expense funding, training and studies, and drainage infra-
structure repair and constructive works. More specifically, the project will
include the following components:
(a) Urban Development Planning. Assistance to MCHUD and RAC:
(i) to create within MCHUD's Directorate General of Urban Planning
an Urban Planning Unit specifically responsible for urban



- 13 -
development planning, control, and coordination in the Greater
Conakry area 1/;
(ii)  to undertake, through MCHUD's Directorate General of Topo-
graphy and RAC's Departments of Topography and Urban Planning
area-wide re-establishment of basic topographical networks and
updating of land subdivision records; and
(iii) to provide foreign and local training in urban planning to
MCHUD staff.
(b) Urban Service Management. Assistance to RAC:
(i) to establish a Technical Coordination Unit attached to the
Governor's office to oversee overall technical management and
improve internal coordination;
(ii) to develop the operational capacity of the existing Drainage
Maintenance Unit to strengthen its technical management and to
ensure supply of critical working materials;
(iii)  to reorganize the Garbage Collection Services on a city-wide
level, to strengthen its administrative and technical
management, to renew the collection vehicle fleet, and to
provide essential collection equipment;
(iv) to upgrade the Vehicle M4aintenance Yard to ensure improved
routine maintenance and repair for service vehicles and to
provide technical maintenance expertise and tools, equipment,
and supplies; and
(v) to strengthen financial management in both RAC and the CPPEs,
to provide technical assistance for annual budget preparation,
and to undertake the preparation of a medium-term urban
management action plan.
(c) Drainage Infrastructure Works. Construction of about 3.2 kms of
roadside stormwater drainage channels in two high density downtown
areas subject to frequent roadblocks during the rainy season.
B. Summary Project Cost Estimates
3.03     The Table on the following page sets out the summary of total
estimated project costs. Detailed Costs are in Annex 3-1. The total cost
of the project, including contingencies, is estimated at US$16.4 million
equivalent. The foreign exchange component is US$12.1 million or 74% of total
project cost. The local cost component is GSY 100.0 million
(US$4.3 million). ProvisionsJfor contingencies are included and amount

to US$2.1 million (foreign component) and GSY 32.0 million (local component),
representing 21.2% of total project costs (2.9% of total costs for physical
and 18.3% for price contingencies). Physical contingencies of 10% for
equipment and tools, and of 15% for drainage infrastructure and other civil
works, are included. No physical contingencies were estimated for technical
assistance, training, and operating expenses. Consistent with other recent
IDA projects for Guinea, price contingencies have been estimated on the basis
of the following annual percentage increases for expenditures in local
currency and foreign exchange respectively.

3.04     Base costs are based on consultant and mission estimates updated to
July 1983. Cost estimates for drainage infrastructure works are based on
final designs prepared under the First Water and Sanitation Project (870-GUI)
and revised by consultants in October 1982. Cost estimates for infrastructure
maintenance and repair works are based on unit costs for similar works
undertaken recently by RAC. Cost estimates for vehicles, equipment, tools,
and spare parts, are based on quotes from local and international suppliers
and are consistent with estimates of other recent IDA projects in Guinea.
Cost estimates for consultant services and technical assistance are also
consistent with estimates for similar services in other recent IDA projects in
Guinea. The average man-month rate (including salaries, overhead, fees,
travel, and other reimbursable expenses) has been assumed at US$11,500 plus
GSY 20,000.  The cost of fellowships is estimated at US$1,600 per month and is
consistent with recent experience of international and bilateral agencies.
Operating costs are based on consumption estimates for consumable materials.
3.05     All cost estimates shown are net of tax liabilities since the Govern-
ment, in line with the usual policy for IDA financed projects, will exempt the
proposed project from all taxes and duties. Salaries for permanent Government
employees working on the project in both MCHUD and RAC have not been included
in the cost estimates since they are already included in the regular operating
budgets of the respective entities, and the project will not require the
creation of new permanent employment. Salaries for auxiliary personnel needed
to temporarily reinforce the operational capacity of topographical and
drainage maintenance services have been included in the respective components
and are based on the prevailing official salary schedules for employment by
government entities.

3.06     The proposed IDA credit of US$10.7 million will finance 65% of
the total project costs and 88% of its foreign exchange costs, estimated at
US$12.1 million. The total Government contribution has been estimated at
US$1.4 million in foreign exchange and GSY 100.0 million (US$4.3 million) in
local currency. To assist in preparation of the project and completion of
various preparatory tasks, two advances totalling US$450,000 were financed
under the Bank's Project Preparation Facility (PPF). The proposed project
does not involve any co-financing. The reason for this is that the few other
donors interested by Guinea and its urban sector are at the present time
already involved in various other projects in this country (para. 1.20).
3.07     The credit will be made to the Government of the Revolutionary
People's Republic of Guinea. Proceeds of the credit will be passed on to
MCHUD (US$2.6 million) and RAC (US$8.1 million) as a grant. Local currency
c(Dst (GSY 31.0 million) of the MCHUD sub-components and the drainage infra-
structure works will be funded through Government contribution. Local capital
expenditure for RAC (GSY 33.4) will be supported by the RAC capital budget. A
Government foreign exchange facility (US$1.4 million) for RAC operating
expenses (para. 3.21) will be made available to RAC against reimbursements by
the latter in local currency equivalent. These reimbursements, together with
tthe local currency expenditure of RAC project components (GSY 35.6 million),
will be funded under a cost-sharing agreement (para. 5.06) through the capital
budgets of RAC and the CPPEs.
3.08     Since the proposed project will essentially involve financially
autonomous Local Government entities, it will not cause significant increases
in future Central Government spending. Project impact on the short- and
medium-term (1990) financial position of both RAC and the CPPEs has been
assessed and found acceptable (para. 5.08).
D. Detailed Project Description
1.   Urban Development Planning
3.09     Urban PlanningUnit. The project will assist MCHUD in setting up,
within its Directorate General of Urban Planning, an Urban Planning Unit
specifically responsible for all aspects of urban planning in the Greater



- 17 -
Conakry area 1/. Technical objectives to be achieved by this unit include the
preparation of (i) a preliminary land-use plan for the Greater Conakry area;
(ii) short- and medium-term urban investment programming exercises linked to
the preparation of the next Five-Year Development Plan; and (iii) other
technical or urban design studies in support of the Government's attempts to
regain control over urban development. To ensure proper start-up and working
conditions for this unit, the project will provide:
(a) technical assistance (totalling 85 man-months), including 60 man-
months of expatriate experts (urban planners) on assignments of about
three years (Terms of Reference, Annex 3-2), and 25 man-months of
specialist services in transport planning, economic and/or financial
project analysis or other specific needs likely to arise during
project implementation;
(b) office equipment and furniture, vehicles, and the funding of
operating expenses (para. 3.20); also included will be the provision
(inclusive of installation works) of a prefabricated office facility
(approximately 200 m2) to be established in a conveniently
accessible downtown location; and
(c) mapping documents at scales 1/5,000 and 1/2,000 for an area of
approximately 15,000 ha to be processed from recent (1981) aerial
surveys.
3.10     Topographical Works.  In conjunction with the urban planning works
done by the Urban Planning Unit MCHUD's Directorate General of Topography will
undertake, on the basis of a three-vea- work program, the reestablishment and,
where needed, completion of the basic topographical network, preservation of
which has been severely neglected during the last two decades. This job will
entail checking and/or surveying anew the basic triangulation and traversing
network, restoring and/or repairing existing ground marks, and establishing
suitable conservation procedures for surveying records and data. RAC's
Departments of Topography and of Urban Planning will use the basic data
provided by MCHUD to resurvey and map existing land divisions. The project
will provide support to the above entities in the form of:
(a) technical assistance (15 man-months of a surveyor on a series of
short-term assignments) for preparation and supervision of work
program execution (Terms of Reference, Annex 3-2);
(b) essential topographical equipment and devices, office furniture and
equipment, vehicles, miscellaneous supplies, and the funding of
operating expenses (para. 3.20); and
(c)  funds for auxiliary personnel to be hired for the forming of two
project-specific surveying teams, one each in MCHUD and RAC.
1/   A similar unit, responsible for urban planning in secondary cities,
will be concurrently created under an EEC-financed urban development
project (para 1.20).



- 18 -
3.11     Training.  The project will provide fellowships totalling 18 man-
months for foreign training of MCHUD staff in urban planning. Funded through
the PPF advance (para. 3.06), such training which is currently taking place,
will help to familiarize key project staff with basic urban planning
techniques prior to project start-up. Technical assistance to the Urban
Planning Unit will be largely devoted to further intensive training of Guinean
project staff. To this end, the unit's work program (Terms of Reference in
project file) has been specifically designed to provide extended on-the-job
training opportunities. Further training activities will be developed by
organizing, with the assistance of unit staff and foreign training consultants
short training workshops for other MCHUD staff. Broadening of training impact
will be sought through associating local training institutions, in particular
the Conakry Polytechnical Institute Gamal Abd-el-Nasr (IPGAN), with the unit's
activities. This will be done through the institute's direct participation in
various parts of the work program, and/or the temporary incorporation of
individual students with the project team. Possible extension of teaching
services to the institute by the technical assistance staff will also be
considered.
3.12     Studies.  The project will provide funding for consulting services
(10 man-months equivalent) to study the technical, financial, and
institutional aspects of the creation of a land development agency for the
Greater Conakry area. This feasibility assessment will be undertaken in
conjunction with the preparation of a medium-term urban management action plan
by RAC and the CPPEs (paras. 3.18 and 5.09).
2.   Urban Service Management
3.13     Technical Coordination Unit.  To improve technical coordination and
management among its own departments and to better advise and supervise the
CPPEs, RAC intends to create a Technical Coordination Unit at the level of the
Gcvernor's office. In this regard, the project will provide:
(a) technical assistance (totalling 40 man-months) by a municipal
engineer to act as technical coordinator (Terms of Reference,
Annex 3-3); and
(b) essential office furniture and equipment, miscellaneous supplies, and
funding of operating expenses (para. 3.21).
3.14     Drainage Maintenance Unit.  The project will assist this unit by
providing funding for:
(a) technical assistance (totalling 35 man-months) by a civil engineer
(Terms of Reference, Annex 3-3) in order to strengthen technical and
administrative management of the unit, and to ensure supervision of
the drainage infrastructure works component (para. 3.19);
(b) essential complementary technical equipment and vehicles, office
furniture and equipment, and funding of operating expenses
(para. 3.21);



- 1 9 -
(c) funding of drainage network repair works to be subcontracted whenever
possible to local construction cooperatives and small private con-
struction enterprises. However, since the private construction
industry sector in Guinea is still very small and of limited
capacity, execution of part of the program by force account will have
to be considered; and
(d) funds will also include provision for network relocation works to be
carried out by, or under supervision of, public utility corporations;
and funds for auxiliary personnel to be hired in conjunction with the
execution by force account of repair works.
3.15     Garbage Collection Services.  In support of RAC's efforts to
reorganize on a city-wide level the garbage collection services currently pro-
vided by CPPEs and to reassume direct responsibility for their management and
increase the delivery capacity of the service vehicle flet., the project will
provide funding for:
(a) technical assistance (totalling 30 man-months) by an engineer/
specialist in waste collection management (Terms of Reference,
Annex 3-3); and
(b)  collection equipment including about 15 container trucks, 2 other
vehicles, about 90 containers, miscellaneous supplies, and funding of
operating expenses (para. 3.21).
3.16     Vehicle Maintenance Yard.  To assist RAC in its attempts to
rationalize the use and composition of the disparate RAC and CPPE service
vehicle 1/ fleet, and to restore satisfactory maintenance conditions by
rehabilitating the existing, but currently non-operational maintenance service
the project will provide:
(a) technical assistance totalling 70 man-months by two expatriate
experts (one garage manager, one administrative officer) on
assignments of four and three years respectively (Terms of Reference,
Annex 3-3), to ensure proper implementation of the rehabilitation
plan and, subsequently, management of the maintenance yard;
(b) funding for building repairs, yard fencing, fuel and gas storage
tanks, vehicles, garage equipment, miscellaneous repair tools, and
funding of operating expenses (para. 3.21); and
(c) proprietary and non-proprietary spare parts for vehicles purchased under
the project, as well as for other RAC or CPPE vehicles for which
maintenance proves economically justifiable (List of Vehicles, Annex 3-4).
1/   Rationalizing will include the gradual disposal (scrapping or
selling) of approximately 60 worn-out vehicles (out of a total RAC and
CPPE fleet of about 100 units). Rationalization will also be linked to
the establishment of a Regional Equipment Renewal Fund (para. 5.07).



3.17     Training.  The project wLl- provide funding for up to four months of
foreign t-rainingin maintenance manag;snu,alt tachnli5ces for the heads of the
Drainage Maintenance Unit and the Garbage Collection Service.  Training
opportunities in this area will be prefe2rentially sou.ght within similar
services of other West African citie  Tfith comparable urban conditions.
Training for other technical RAk  staff w11 be Drovided essentially in the
form of on-the-job training.  The prc i; ;A, lo include funding for the
organization, with the assistance of proect stgaff and foreign training
consultants, of short workshops intanded to familiarize RAC and CPPE technical
staff with technical service managemenfr issues0  Programs for local training
of vehicle maintenance workers will be developed and implemented in close
collaboration with local vocationae  trairing restitutions such as Centre
Pilote Matoto, ISFORPET, and cthers.
3.18     Studies.  The project wvil l include funding for financial advisory
services      ana-months) to assist, RAC and 'PPR financial staff in the prepara-
tion of annual budgets. The project wili also fund consulting services
(14 man-months equivalent) to support RAlC or the CPPEs in undertaking the
preparation of a medium-term urban management action plan (para. 5.09).
3.   Drainage Infrastructure Vlrks
3.19     The project will finance wcrlke, in tvwo downtown areas plagued by
severe annual flooding and poor anvironmeintal conditions: 'ia' and  W4  (maps
IBRD 17422/23).  Area '1a' -as a small basln area, the outlet of which has been
closed by the construction of th  ALrport -igghuway.  Accumulating stormwater
now regularly blocks this highrs~a'      is one of the city's most important
transport links. Works will includP  e o  w`a.caAi@  landfill, construction of around
1.2 km of secondary and primazry edrainage channels, and a culvert under the
Airport Highway to connect the area s,ith an existing outlet to the western
shore. Located on the eastern shore of the paninsula, area '4' (Madina) is a
high density (over 700 res/ha), poorly serviced neighborhood of about
70,000 inhabitants.  Its main access road (Corniche Sud), because of its
hillside location, is, during the rainy season, frequently blocked by floods
and mud deposits.  The project wi.ll provide funding for the construction of
about 2 km of roadside channel-s and vari-o.s sea outlets.
E. Operating Cost Support
3.20     MCHUDo  The proposesd -1r1ojsti-       funid foreign exchange expenses of
MCHUD project components (US$cQ1 mil^lion, 0.8% of total foreign exchange
project costs). Local currency operating costs amounting to GSY 4.9 million
(4.9% of total local currency pro ject vost) arill be borne by MCHUD through its
regular recurrent budget.
3.21     RAC.  Chronic unavail1a-bi"'' try fw'yf foreign exchange funding for import
of critically needed inputs is a major obsltacle for establishing sound
operating conditions for urban services.  The Goverrment has become
increasingly aware that no definitivve e7olultioa to these problems can be found
unless appropriate refor. s are introdueed in the prevailing management procedures
for foreign exchange allocat.ions.  Consecuently, it has, in conjunction
with the proposed project, talen mleasures according to which RAC will be



- 21 -
permanently entitled to a minimal annual foreign exchange facility. The
amount of this facility will be fixed annually according to RAC's budget
forecasts. Proceeds from this facility will be made available to RAC against
reimbursements to the Government in local currency under terms and conditions
reviewed and agreed with IDA at negotiations (para. 4.20).  Given the
country's acute foreign exchange constraints, and the possible problems the
implementation of new financial management procedures are likely to experience
in the beginning, IDA will participate in the funding of foreign exchange
expenses of RAC project operating costs (US$0.6 million, 5.0% of total foreign
exchange project cost) on an annually decreasing basis (year 1: 75%, year 2:
50%, year 3: 25%, year 4: 0%). The complementary funding (US$1.4 million,
11.6% of total foreign exchange project cost) will be made available to RAC
through proceeds from the Government's foreign exchange budget.  Apportionment
of IDA and Government contributions for the project period is shown below.

3.22      Local currency operating costs (GSY 35.6 million) will be entirely
supported by RAC and, under a cost-sharing agreement (para. 5.06), by the
CPPEs. These costs will consist of expenses for purchase of domestic and
imported goods, and materials available on the local market at suitable condi-
tions. Local currency operating cost contributions are estimated as follows:

be easily absorbed by RAC and CPPE capital budgets throughout the project
period and in the years beyond (para. 5.08).

3.23     Appropriate procedures required to establish and, subsequently,
operate the foreign exchange facility have been established by the
Government. Opening of a RAC foreign exchange account and deposit therein of
US$30,000 by the Government as a first instalment corresponding to the foreign
exchange expenses during the first six months of project implementation--upon
payment by RAG of local currency equivalent--will be a condition of credit
effectiveness (para 4.22)
IV. MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementing Agencies and Project Management
1.   Project Coordination
4.01     The project will be implemented through the existing institutional
framework (World Bank Chart 25704 on following page) and the creation of a
specific project implementation unit will not be required. In accordance with
prevailing legislation (para. 1.13) the Ministry of Construction, Housing,
Urban Planning, and Domain (MCHUD) will assume the responsibility for overall
project coordination and supervision. As regards individual project
components, prime responsibility will be as follows:
(a)  MCHUD--with limited assistance from RAC for topographical work--for
the Urban Development Planning component; and
(b)  RAC for both the Urban Service Management and the Drainage
Infrastructure Works components.
2.   Technical Assistance: Role and Responsibilities
4.02     Due to the absence of any major investment or maintenance program,
most Guinean technical staff have almost never had an opportunity to famili-
arize themselves with the implementation of sizeable projects or techniques
of efficiency-oriented service management. To ensure proper execution of the
proposed project and adequate on-the-job training for the Guinean staff, the
project will provide extended technical assistance to service management
positions in several key areas. In the three of five project units to receive
support, and where management will be ensured by incumbent Guinean staff or
for which staff could easily be found (Urban Planning Unit, Drainage Mainte-
nance Unit, Garbage Collection Services), the role of technical assistance
will be limited to an advisory function. In the Technical Coordination Unit
and the Regional Vehicle Maintenance Yard for the management of which quali-
fied Guinean staff is not available at present, technical assistance staff
will be appointed to managerial positions. In these cases, the initial
bearing of a heavier share of responsibility and authority will be required

because of the relatively greater need to train the Guinean counterpart in
these two specific activities, namely, oversight and coordination of diverse
ty-pes of project activities, and garage management.
4.03     The technical assistance arrangements have been designed with a view
to Guinean takeover of all responsibilities following project completion. In
particular, participation in skills training courses has been included for key
staff where relevant practical courses are available. The urban planning and
drainage maintenance counterparts will go for short work-study programs abroad
and local workshops will be organized for other planning and vehicle
maintenance staff (paras. 3.11 and 3.17). However, given present Guinean lack
of experience in all areas addressed by the project, only the most critical
training needs will be met during the project period. Further training needs
identified over this period, as well as specific technical inputs requiring
continued outside support, will constitute the basis for follow-up activities
which could be attractive to other international and bilateral donors, or
which provide an opportunity for city-twinning agreements.
4.04     These arrangements have been extensively discussed and agreed with
the Guinean authorities as being the most effective way of starting up
project-supported activities. Agreement was obtained at negotiations on Terms
of Reference (see Annexes 3-2 and 3-3), conditions of employment, and duties
of technical assistance personnel, including their position and responsibili-
ties within the Guinean administrative structure. Concurrently, assurances
were received on the appointment of adequately qualified counterpart staff.
5.   Urban Development Planning
4.05     Implementation of the urban development planning component under
MCHUD will be technically and administratively coordinated and controlled by
the Directorate General of Urban Planning. Direct project management will be
a responsibility of the Guinean project leader in the Urban Planning Unit.
Project management will consist of the overall technical coordination of works
to be undertaken by the Urban Planning Unit, the Directorate General of
Topography as well as by RAC's Department of Topography and Urban Planning.
4.06     The existing urban planning division of the Directorate General of
Urban Planning will be reorganized and strengthened. In accordance with a
legal order issued in connection with this project, the Urban Planning Unit
will be set up as a separate unit within the urban planning division to focus
on the planning needs of Conakry. It will be staffed with a team comprising,
at the initial stage, at least six Guinean professionals qualified in the
areas of architecture, engineering, sociology, economy, and geography, and
appropriate support staff. If necessary, staff from other ministries will be
seconded to the Urban Planning Unit for limited short-term assignments.
4.07     The topographical and surveying works will be technically coordinated
and supervised by the Directorate General of Topography, with the assistance
of an expatriate expert recruited under the project. To carry out



- 25 -
their respective work programs, MCHUD and RAC will each set up and maintain
two surveying teams until project completion, as well as teams of qualified
draftsmen for the corresponding office work.
4.08     Urban development planning is an intersectoral activity which re-
quires regular consultation among the administrative and technical authorities
involved. In the past, coordination among these authorities has frequently
been poor and the Government has acknowledged the need to improve prevailing
coordination mechanisms. In connection with the proposed project, the Govern-
ment has agreed to establish, as a condition of Credit effectiveness, an
Interministerial Urban Planning Advisory Group chaired by the Minister of
Construction, Housing, Urban Planning and Domain, and comprising
representatives of all ministries and other public authorities concerned with
urban development problems in the Greater Conakry area. The essential tasks
to be performed by this body will be:
(a) to follow progress of work program execution by the Urban
Planning Unit;
(b) to coordinate and review other projects and programs prepared by
Government authorities and/or foreign donors;
(c) to formulate recommendations for implementing decisions;
(d) to examine problems of technical and institutional coordination; and
(e) to participate in the preparation of urban development policies and
investment programs, particularly with regard to the next Five-Year
Development Plan.
4.   Urban Service Management
4.09     Overall project coordination within RAC will be ensured by the
Technical Coordination Unit to be established in the office of the Governor.
Given the lack of skilled local staff, the Government has agreed to appoint
(through the technical assistance provided by the project) an expatriate
municipal engineer in the post of technical coordinator, and to nominate a
Guinean engineer as a deputy coordinator. The Technical Coordination Unit
which has been created by legal order issued in conjunction with this project
will provide tebhnical and administrative support, including, in collaboration
with the Secretariat General of Finance and Planning, financial control of all
project components executed under direct responsibility of RAC, as well as
administrative and financial control of services provided by RAC's Departments
of Topography and Urban Planning under the technical control of MCHUD.



- 26 -
4.10     Maintenance and repair of drainage infrastructure will be handled by
the Drainage Maintenance Unit. This unit will also be responsible for
coordinating and supervising the implementation of the Drainage Infrastructure
Works component. Garbage collection will be reorganized. Though routing and
scheduling will remain under control of CPPEs, general responsibility for the
coordination of collection services and administrative and technical manage-
melnt of the vehicle fleet will revert to RAC. To this purpose, RAC has
created within the Secretariat of Social and Central Affairs a division
responsible for the management of garbage collection services. This division
hac been placed under the responsibility of a Guinean engineer appointed by
RA( and whose professional skill and experience are agreeable to IDA.
Ma:nagement of the Vehicle Maintenance Yard will be the responsibility of a
team of two technical assistants (a garage manager and an administrative
officer) appointed by the Government under the proposed project. The Vehicle
Maintenance Yard will provide routine preventive maintenance and minor repair
works for RAC and CPPE vehicles for which maintenance remains economically
justifiable. Major repairs will be subcontracted to other specialized public
entities or private garages. It will also be responsible for supply
and distribution of gas, fuel, and lubricants to RAC services.
B. Implementation
4.11     In keeping with the focus of the project on start-up of a number of
different service operations rather than on execution of a civil works pro-
gram, the project implementation period has been set to be long enough for
se-vices to be fully operational and for counterparts to become familiar with
all aspects of the work, but short enough that Guinean takeover will remain a
clear objective from the outset. Because this project will essentially
finance a four-year time slice of technical assistance and related operational
support for MCHUD and RAC services (84% of total foreign project cost), it can
be expected to be implemented within a period not exceeding four and a half
years from credit signature by the Government. The schedule of project imple-
mentation, based on an assumed project start-up by January 1985, is shown in
Annex 4-1. Key indicators for project supervision which were reviewed and
agreed with the Government at negotiations are in the Project File.
4.12     Final design and bidding documents for drainage infrastructure works
were prepared under the IDA Project 870-GUI. To avoid initial delays, the
Govrernment has agreed to use PPF proceeds to hire the services of a consultant
to prepare and/or finalize bidding documents for works, goods, and technical
assistance before June 30, 1984. Mapping works and foreign training for urban
planners has been financed through PPF proceeds and are in progress. Terms of
reference for technical assistance were agreed in substance with the
Govrernment at appraisal and finalized at negotiations.
4.13     Topographical and land record updating works by MCHUD's Directorate
Geeneral Topography, and RAC's Departments of Topography Urban Planning and
drainage maintenance works by RAC's Drainage Maintenance Unit, will be
implemented on an annual work program basis.  Detailed programs for the first



- 27 -
year of implementation will be submitted to IDA no later than three months
after the project start-up, and subsequently at the beginning of each
project year.

(Parentheses represent the amount to be financed by IDA).
4.15     Technical Assistance (US$4.6 million) will be supplied in accordance
with IDA guidelines. The amount shown for Studies includes refinancing of PPF
advance (US$0.4 million), plus consultant services (US$0.4 million) during the
project period which will be procured individually or through reputable firms
in accordance with IDA guidelines. Equipment, tools, and vehicles will be
procured through ICB (US$2.0 million), while miscellaneous equipment items,
below US$80,000 in value and for which potential suppliers are limited, will
be procured by inviting quotes from at least three reliable suppliers
(US$0.8 million). Miscellaneous supplies include non-proprietary vehicle
spare parts (US$0.6 million) which will be procured through ICB, and
proprietary spare parts (US$0.6 million) which will be obtained through direct
procurement. This item also includes fuel, gasoline, lubricants, cement and
other construction materials (US$1.4 million) which will be needed in
quantities too small to justify procurement under ICB. In the absence of a
private market for these goods, they will be purchased free of duties from



- 28 -
ONAH and BATIPORT, the sole state-owned suppliers. Drainage infrastructure
works will be executed through one contract. Eligible domestic bidders will
be given a preference of 7.5%. Drainage repair works will be split into
several small contracts to be awarded through LCB (US$1.3 million) or executed
by force account (US$0.9 million) (para. 3.14). Other construction works
include construction of small office facilities and repair works for existing
buildings which are too small to interest foreign bidders, and will therefore
be undertaken on the basis of LCB. (Not applicable includes salaries for
auxiliary labor and funding for local training.) Only contracts of over
US$100,000 will be submitted to IDA for review prior to award. Remaining
contracts will be subject to random post-review by IDA after contract award.
I). Disbursements

TOTAL                              10.7
All disbursements will be fully documented, except for disbursements of local
expenditures for (a) civil works executed by force account, and (b) MCHUD's and
RAC's operating costs. These disbursements will be made against statements of
expenditures, documentation of which will be retained by the implementing
agencies and made available to IDA for review during project supervision.



- 29 -
4.17     Given the particular features of this project, a large part of which
will consist of technical assistance and equipment to be purchased during the
first two years of project implementation, the use of neither the historical
Bankwide disbursement profile for urban projects nor the general disbursement
profile for West Africa IDA projects has been deemed inappropriate. Rather,
the schedule of estimated disbursements set out in Annex 4-2 has been based on
general project experience in Guinea, taking into account delays in project
start-up, and assuming an average interval of six months (increasing to one
year and a half towards the end of the project) between expenditure and
disbursement.
E.   Supervision and M4onitoring
4.18     Supervision by IDA staff during the four and a half years of project
implementation will require about 60 staff-weeks.  Given MCHUD's and RAC's
lack of experience with management of IDA projects, at least 70% of this time
will be required during the first two years of project implementation. Bank
supervision missions will require an architect/planner, a municipal engineer,
and a municipal finance specialist. Provision will also be made for
consultant services in the areas of topographical works and municipal
management techniques.
4.19     Monitoring of project execution of the MCHUD component will be the
responsibility of the Director General of Urban Planning. The RAC component
will be monitored by the project coordinator in the Technical Coordination
Unit. Quarterly reports on project progress will be prepared by these project
coordinators and submitted to IDA and the relevant Government authorities for
comment. A comprehensive evaluation report reviewing the project's impact and
suggesting modifications in project design, where necessary, will be submitted
to, and jointly reviewed by, the Government and IDA at the end of each
implementation year. The implementing agencies will, within the BiX months
following the project completion, prepare a project completion report.
F.   Special Accounts
4.20     To avoid problems the Government may encounter in refinancing foreign
currency expenditures to be reimbursed under the IDA credit, special accounts
of US$30,000 and US$100,000 will be established for MCHUD and RAC respec-
tively. These accounts will be opened in a local commercial bank and operated
under terms and conditions acceptable by IDA. They will be used for the
purchase of small items such as office equipment and supplies, spare parts for
vehicles, and operating expenses eligible for financing by the IDA credit.
Following the initial deposit by IDA, the accounts will be replenished on receipt
of evidence of disbursements for allowable expenditures. Should any payments be
made from these accounts that are not acceptable to IDA, the Government would be
responsible for replenishing the account in the corresponding amount.
4.21     MCHUD and RAC will similarly establish revolving accounts in local
currency of GSY 0.5 million and GSY 1.5 million respectively, for financing
the anticipated local contribution to the project. These accounts will be
replenished quarterly from the MCHUD budget and the RAC investment budget
under terms and conditions which were found acceptable to IDA. Evidence that



- 30 -
(a) foreign exchange and local currency accounts have been established, and
that (b) GSY 0.5 million and GSY 1.5 million respectively, have been deposited
in the local currency revolving accounts, will be a condition of Credit
effectiveness.
4.2?     To allow RAC to draw on its permanent foreign exchange facility for
operating expenses (para. 3.21), the Government will open a special foreign
exchange account in a local commercial bank acceptable to IDA. This account
will be replenished periodically by the Government upon payment by RAC of the
equivalent amount in local currency. Detailed operating arrangements for
this account were submitted to and reviewed with IDA at negotiations. Evidence
that this account has been opened, and an amount of US$30,000 equivalent
corresponding to the foreign exchange expenses during the first six months of
project implementation, will be a condition of Credit effectiveness.
G.   Accounts and Audits
4.23     In accordance with prevailing accounting regulations in Guinea, both
MCHUD and RAC will set up accounting systems to record all project expendi-
tures. Consistent with current legislation, all accounts will be regularly
audited by the Ministry of State Audit. Assurances were obtained at negotia-
tions that separate accounts will be set up for the proposed project, and that
the accounts and audit report will be submitted to IDA no later than six
months after the close of each Government fiscal year, starting with the first
complete fiscal year following the Credit effectiveness. The accounts and the
audit will be of such a scope and in such detail as IDA should reasonably
request. They will include a review of the operation of all special accounts
and revolving fund amounts, and a separate opinion on whether the expenditures
withdrawn from the IDA credit on the basis of statements of expenditures have
been used for the purpose for which they were provided.
V. REGIONAL AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE
A.   Local Government Finance
5.01     Prior to a general reform of the regional/local administrative system
in 1980, the Conakry Administrative Region (RAC) was the sole municipal autho-
rity in Conakry. As shown in the following table, its resources amounted to
between GSY 100 and GSY 125 million annually (in 1982 GSY) during the 1977-79
period, or about GSY 230 per inhabitant. Its main internal sources of oper-
ating revenue were market taxes, business fees (patente), housing taxes, and a
tax on commercial fishing tonnage. All but the latter were locally assessed
and collected. A local head tax (Taxe de Region) and a percentage of the
national wage tax, which together constituted about a quarter of 1977 income,
were discontinued in 1978 in favor of a new Government grant fixed at
GSY 30 million a year.

5.02     Only about 85% of each year's income was actually spent during this
period due to foreign exchange shortages and poor administrative and technical
management. By 1979, the accumulated unspent annual surplus amounted to about
40% of income received during the year (GSY 39 million out of GSY 112 million).
5.03     In 1980, as part of the major restructuring of regional and local
administration and finance (para. 1.15), the head tax was reimposed in the
form of a new Regional Development Tax levied on all employable adults at a
rate of GSY 500 per person. This increased municipal income by 60%. This tax
is enjoying an 80% collection rate compared to 10% for the housing tax and 50%
for the business tax. In May 1981, the tax base was widened again with a new
law raising license fees for business activities and increasing the number of
taxable activities. This move resulted in a further rise in total revenues 1/
to GSY 235 million in 1982. The revenue rise is expected to continue,
reaching about GSY 250 million in 1983. Although the increase in revenues has
been in large part a result of the imposition of new taxes, a contributing
factor has been the transfer to the three Conakry Municipalities (CPPEs) of
the responsibility for tax collection. Mainly because of their proximity to
the population, they have proved far more effective than RAC.
5.04     Currently, the CPPEs receive some 75% of the total regional revenues,
a percentage which is expected to increase as a result of the expansion of the
tax base. RAC's portion is limited to the GSY 30 million government grant,
the fish tax, and a 20% share of the Regional Development Tax.
5.05     Although both operating and capital expenditures have increased over
the past two years, the annual surplus generated is currently about 40% of
current income. In fact, by 1982, the cumulative consolidated surplus reached
a level equal to RAC's entire 1979 annual income--GSY 112 million. The CPPEs'
experience with execution of their capital budgets has been markedly less
favorable than that of RAC; they have been able to use only 15% to 40% of
their capital budget compared to RAC's 70%. Nonetheless, actual capital
expenditure has increased from an average of about GSY 14 million a year over
the 1977-79 period (in 1982 GSY) to GSY 104 million in 1982, with the largest
increases in school and health facilities, and road works.
B.   Cost Allocation
5.06     As shown above, budgetary surpluses have continued to be
generated by all four entities involved in urban management in Conakry
since 1980, when most of the functions--and the corresponding resources--
previously held by RAC were transferred to the CPPEs. Since the CPPEs
currently collect the bulk of local revenues intended to fund service,
which they are unable to fulfill, the Government has agreed, in connection
with this project, to modify, as a condition of Credit effectiveness, existing
procedures in a way that will allow RAC to be reimbursed for 85% of operating
expenses (except for costs of labor) incurred for the three project supported
services--drainage network maintenance, garbage collection, and vehicle
maintenance--through proceeds of the CPPE capital budgets. Apportionment of

reimbursements has been tentatively fixed in proportion to the population
served (CPPE I: 18%, CPPE II: 31%, CPPE III: 51%).  Given the probably unequal
population growth among the three CPPEs (CPPE I population is likely to
stagnate, while CPPE III will absorb the bulk of growth in the years ahead),
the proposed current apportionment will be periodically revised and readjusted
on the basis of regular administrative census results.

5.07     In addition, to secure the adequate renewal of existing service
vehicles and/or the possibly required fleet expansion in the years after project
completion, the Government has agreed to set up no later than June 30, 1985, a
Regional Equipment Renewal Fund. Based on the depreciation rates of both the
already existing and the newly acquired equipment, total annual contribution to
this fund has been estimated at GSY 15.0 million (in 1983 constant terms), but
will be revised periodically. Contributions will be shared by RAC and CPPEs on
the same basis as established for operating costs (para. 5.06).

C.   Project Impact
5.08     To determine the impact on current RAC and CPPE budget surpluses of
the gradual assumption of project operating costs (para. 3.21), projections (in
1983 constant terms) were made to 1990 of revenues and expenditures both with
and without the project (see following table and Annexes 5-1 and 5-2). These
projections assumed in regard to revenues:  (a) a modest growth in internal
revenues equal to the 6.5% population growth rate; and (b) no change in grant
levels, tax, or collection rates; and in regard to expenditures: (i) a 10%
annual increase in personnel expenditure; (ii) a 9% annual increase in operat-
ing expenditure (for other than project-related operations); (iii) no change
in the average 50% rate of actual capital budget execution; (iv) no change in
the 20%-80% split between RAC and the CPPEs of the Regional Development Tax;
and (v) no change in the budgeting procedures. These projections show that
project costs to be repaid by RAC and the CPPEs will progressively increase
from 7.4% of total annual consolidated expenditure in 1985 to 14.2% in 1987,
and stabilize at that level in the years immediately beyond.
D.   Medium-Term Urban Management Action Plan
5.09     While the amounts required to cover the project costs and set aside
the reserves for a Regional Equipment Renewal Fund will be easily absorbed
during the project period due to high levels of cumulated budget surpluses,
the amount of these surpluses will be gradually dwindling. In 1990, CPPE III
is likely to be the only municipal body to still enjoy a comfortable surplus,
whereas the financial situation of RAC and the CPPEs I and II could become
critical unless corrective steps are taken as outlined below. Generation of
additional revenue by either improving the collection performance or raising
tax and fee levels will therefore become a necessity in the medium-term (i.e.,
by the end of the project period). The Government has agreed on the need to
closely monitor the evolution of the financial situation of both RAC and
CPPEs, and to prepare with the help of the technical assistance provided under
the project (para. 3.18), a medium-term urban management action plan. The
objective of this plan will be to prepare a comprehensive set of measures to
be taken in the areas of technical, administrative, and particularly,
financial managemnet in order to improve overall delivery of urban services
and secure their operational capacity in the long run, to increase local
resource mobilization, and to prevent possible deterioration in RAC's and the
CPPE's financial conditions in the years beyond completion. Preparation of
this action plan will form a credit covenant and assurances were obtained at
negotiations that its implementation schedule will be submitted to IDA for
review no later than June 30, 1986.
5.10     The potential for increase in revenue is substantial.  Apart from the
Regional Development Tax, collection rates are low (para. 5.03), particularly
with respect to the housing tax which averages a rate of 10%. The development
of a proper fiscal cadastral system, which is likely to be undertaken on the

basis of the preliminary topographical works executed under the proposed
project, (para. 3.10) should allow improvement of property valuation and
increase the housing tax revenue. Raising the rate level of taxes in general,
and of the development tax in particular, though a politically sensitive
issue, is also possible.
5.11     At the currently prevailing collection and tax rates, the incidence
of local taxes is relatively light. Internal resources collected in 1982
amount to about GSY 300 per capita per year, or about GSY 3,700 per average
household. With a monthly average household income estimated at about
GSY 11,800, the local tax burden is about 2.6%. Assuming either modest
increases in nominal per capita income or acceptability of a local tax inci-
dence of up to 5%-6%, it should not be difficult to plan for an increase in
internal resources which would need to be at least about 10% over 1990 levels
to generate the additional revenue needed annually to operate the urban
services introduced in the project.
VI.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, AND PROJECT RISKS
A.  Project Justification
6.01     Due to the lack of familiarity of most Guinean authorities and their
technical staff with large-scale projects, the scope of the proposed project
has been kept deliberately narrow. Designed in line with the Bank's overall
development strategy 1/ for this country (para. 1.17), it will primarily
address various priority sector needs not addressed by other donors or through
other IDA projects: institutional support for urban planning and urban service
management.
6.02     The choice of components in the project also reflects an analysis of
alternatives subject to the criterion of a realistic and feasible initial
package of activities which, if successful, could lay the groundwork for later
investments. Tackling urban road maintenance problems was examined at project
appraisal and judged beyond the scope of this project for technical, cost and,
most importantly, institutional reasons. The decision to focus on garbage
collection instead of road maintenance was based on a decision that it was
more important to bring garbage collection up to minimum levels because
collection of garbage (which clogs drains) and maintenance of drains (which
need to function in order to prevent erosion) would both need to be opera-
tional for road maintenance to be expanded.
6.03     While the goals of the project have been deliberately kept limited,
they are both worthwhile and feasible in the light of Government's minimal
experience with implementation of such projects. The goal of strengthening
the Government institutions responsible for urban planning will markedly
reduce currently irrational land use and thereby reduce losses in productivity
arising from disorderly spatial expansion, excessive transport distances, and
operational constraints for public services and utilities. More intensive

- 37 -
coordination between authorities in the area of investment planning and decis-
ions will generate a significant improvement in the management of scarce
foreign and local human and financial resources. Reinforced control over
conditions of land development will help to prevent further decline of living
conditions in a large number of areas, and allow more efficient planning for
future growth.
6.04     Strengthening of urban service management will be a key element in
restoring satisfactory functioning of the city as a whole and will generate
extensive benefits, both social and economic. Intensified drainage mainte-
nance, and construction of new drainage infrastructure, will significantly
contribute to satisfactory transport conditions throughout the year, in both
high-density residential and economically important downtown areas, and
prevent further loss and untimely depreciation of valuable capital assets,
including not only the drainage system itself, but the accompanying road
network. Reorganizing the garbage collection services and renewing their
equipment will allow a doubling in volume of daily collected waste and the
extension of collection service into most areas currently accessible to motor
vehicles. Reducing indiscriminate waste accumulation in streets and open
spaces will significantly contribute to improved overall performance of the
drainage network, and help to improve city environmental conditions. Imple-
menting efficient permanent vehicle and equipment maintenance will be a key
factor in securing adequate functioning of all urban services. Daily avail-
ability of vehicles will, on the basis of project activities, be increased by
a factor of three, and thus generate an important gain in urban service
productivity. Most importantly, the financial management reforms implemented
as part of this project will significantly reduce the waste of local resources
in the form of unused local tax receipts which have hitherto lain idle due to
the unavailability of needed matching foreign exchange resources and key
technical know-how.
6.05     Apart from benefits generated by specific operations to receive proj-
ect support, perhaps the most important benefit will be the attention which
Bank involvement will bring to focus on the importance of urban services
delivery, management, and financial planning. Beyond the specific financial
and technical inputs, the project will put forward for the first time an
overall strategy for addressing urban deficiencies which could be used to
attract other sources of financial and technical support. Discussions with
other donors (EEC and others) and private firms interested in defining
specific follow-on programs have begun under this project. The improvement in
the physical appearance of the city will also contribute to Guinea's efforts
to attract external capital.
B.   Economic Analysis
6.06     From the above qualitative description of project benefits, four
types of project benefits were identified which are expected to materialize,
and which, in principle, are quantifiable. These are:
(a) increase in number of service hours during which municipal vehicles
are available to collect garbage, maintain drains, and perform other
services;



- 38 -
(b) increase in property values due to improved environmental conditions;
(c) increase in worker productivity due to improved environmental
conditions; and
(d) elimination of seasonal flooding at two important road links.
The first of these benefits was quantified in terms of number of additional
service hours, summarized in the following table. It reflects the assumption
that rationalizing the RAC and CPPE vehicle fleet by disposing of old vehicles
for which maintenance has become economically unjustifiable, improving the
maintenance of about 40 existing operating vehicles, and acquiring 20 new
units under the proposed project, would raise the average utilization rate
from 20% to about 60%, thus generating an increase in available service hours
of around 160%.

Drainage maintenance unit       4       20    1,200          6       60    5,400
Garbage collection unit        30       20    9,000         23       60   20,700
Other municipal services       64       20   19,200         31      60   27,900
Total                          99       20   29,700         62       60   55,800
If Guinea had a private market for truck and heavy equipment rentals, this
increase in service hours could be converted to a dollar benefit stream.
However, no such market exists yet in Guinea and the distortions in the
economy are such that it is not meaningful to compute a true economic rate
of return.
6.07     The three other types of benefits enumerated above cannot be quan-
tified due to lack of data. In contrast to other recent urban projects 1/,
imputed changes in land or rental values cannot be used in this project as a
measure for benefits resulting from improvements in environmental sanitation
and drainage infrastructure because there are no comparator areas where
conditions are comparable to expected post-project conditions in the areas
affected by the project; nor is there any basis on which the increases in
worker productivity could be estimated in the areas where garbage collection
and drainage maintenance will be improved. In the case of road user savings,
no traffic counts are available to permit their estimation.

The Gambia:   Urban Management and Development Project.



- 39 -
6.08     Other types of quantifiable benefits, which were used for calculating
an ERR in other recent projects, do not provide a meaningful basis for such
calculations under the conditions that prevail in Guinea. Savings in fleet
replacement costs due to reduced vehicle downtime resulting from better
vehicle maintenance 1/ are not meaningful as benefit measures since, as a
consequence of persistent foreign exchange shortages, vehicle replacement is
likely to take place at an irregular pace, at best. Likewise, savings in
vehicle maintenance costs 1/, or in operating costs per ton of garbage col-
lection 2/, would not be realized in practice because so little has been spent
on these services in the past. The project will actually increase expenditure
for these services, the result being that worn-out vehicles can be disposed of
and the remaining vehicles will be able to collect twice as much garbage.
6.09     Thus, although substantial improvements are expected in the overall
efficiency of the Conakry economy through improved transport and health con-
ditions, and though there are in principle fleet replacement and vehicle
operations and maintenance cost savings, estimation of an economic rate of
return is not practical.
C.   Distribution of Benefits
6.10     The garbage collection and drainage maintenance operations will
affect conditions primarily in the older districts of all three CPPEs where
most of the paved road network is located.  About half of Conakry's residents
live in these CPPEs (about 350,000 persons), and both the poorest and richest
districts are located there as well as the most densely settled areas
(Annex 1-2).
6.11     As mentioned in the sector background chapter (para. 1.06), assess-
ment of poverty income levels is difficult. Absolute poverty (GSY 6,500 per
household per month) may affect only 10% of Conakry's population, if it is
assumed that staples (rice, fish, oil, and sugar) can be purchased at
government controlled prices (which are about a third of market prices),
minimum nutritional needs can be satisfied by a market basket costing about
GSY 400 per person per month, and food expenditures are about 60% of a poor
household's expenditures. However, the 10% figure could go as high as 60%
during periods of shortage when basic staples are only available at market
prices. Whatever the urban poverty threshold, roughly half of those below
it live in CPPE I and III, and thus the project will affect the residential
areas of about half of the urban poor and the work areas of virtually all
residents.

D.   Project Risks
6.12     Urban planning and urban service management in a capital city are
traditionally politically sensitive issues, and the launching of a first
operation inevitably entails various risks. This is particularly so in
Guinea, where experience is limited and resources are of utmost scarcity.
These risks can, however, be considered worthwhile in view of Conakry's
importance as Guinea's capital and its primary center for industry and trade,
and the key role it is likely to play in a future economic recovery of the
country.
6.13     A first risk associated with this project revolves around the struc-
ture of implementation arrangements. In an effort to develop the execution
capacity of existing institutions, no separate project unit will be created.
Rather, responsibility for project implementation will be entrusted to the
normal executing agencies. The risk that working through existing
unexperienced institutions could reduce the efficiency of project
implementation will be mitigated by providing training and technical
assistance to both MCHUD and RAC for project execution.
6.14     A second related risk is that departure of technical assistance per-
sonnel at project completion might weaken the operational units supported by
the project, and compromise continued realization of project benefits. This
risk is inherent in any effort designed to initiate new activities. It is
offset by the deliberate choice of a short project implementation period to
underline the dependence of ultimate operational success on Guinean initia-
tive. It is likely to be further moderated by the keen interest in the urban
sector shown by other international and bilateral donors, and thus the strong
likelihood of continued technical assistance and training programs in the
years ahead.
6.15     A third risk relates to the novelty of the proposed approach to urban
service delivery and financing. The proposed funding of centralized urban
service operations through tax revenues of decentralized entities will require
a strong discipline in complying with agreed cost-sharing mechanisms. This
introduces the risk of untimely delays in payment transfers from CPPEs to RAC,
and resulting possible cashflow constraints for the latter. This risk will be
moderated by the technically sound accounting practices in use in the local
Government institutions, as well as by the Government's strong commitment to
the proposed urban service management reforms.
VII.  AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     Prior to negotiations, the following agreements were obtained from
the Government:
(a)  formal agreement on the principle of establishing a permanent foreign
exchange facility to RAC for financing foreign exchange expenses in
operating costs (paras. 3.07 and 3.21); and



- 41 -
(b) formal agreement on the principle of changes in regional and local
financial management procedures to establish a cost-sharing mechanism
between RAC and the CPPEs for urban service operations, and a
Regional Vehicle Renewal Fund (paras. 3.07, 5.06, and 5.07).
7.02     At negotiations, the following were reviewed:
(a) terms of reference for all technical assistance (Annexes 3-2
and 3-3);
(b) draft legislation creating the Urban Planning Unit (para. 4.06), the
Interministerial Urban Planning Advisory Group (para. 4.08), and the
Technical Coordination Unit (para. 4.09);
(c) proposals for changes in regional and local financial management
procedures to establish a cost-sharing mechanism between RAC and the
CPPEs for urban service operations (paras. 3.07, and 5.06);
and agreement was obtained on:

personnel, including their position and responsibilities
within the Guinean administrative structure (para. 4.04);
(ii) conditions of creation and operation of special
foreign exchange and local currency project accounts
(paras. 4.20 and 4.21);
(iii) establishment of of a permanent annual foreign exchange facility
for RAC, and operating conditions of a RAC foreign exchange
account created to this effect (paras. 3.21 and 4.22);
(iv) preparation of a medium-term urban management action plan
intended to improve and secure delivery of urban services in
the long run, to increase local resource mobilization, and to
ensure the sound financial state of both RAC and the CPPEs in
the years beyond project completion (para. 5.09);
(v) key indicators for project supervision (para. 4.11); and
(vi) conditions of project accounting and auditing (para. 4.23).
7.03     Conditions for Board presentation were:
(a) creation of the Urban Planning Unit and the Technical Coordination
Unit (paras. 4.06, and 4.09);
(b)  establishment of a permanent annual foreign exchange facility for RAC
(paras. 3.07 and 3.21);
(c) reorganization of garbage collection services (para 4.10).



- 42 -
7.04     As a condition for Credit effectiveness, the following will be
required:
(a) opening of a RAC foreign exchange account for the use of the foreign
exchange facility for service operations, and deposit of US$30,000 by
the Government--upon payment by RAC of the local currency equivalent
(paras. 3.21 and 4.22);
(b)  opening of special foreign exchange project accounts for MCHUD and
RAC, and establishment of local currency revolving funds for MCHUD
and RAC including the deposit of GSY 0.5 million into the MCHUD fund
and GSY 1.5 million into the RAC fund (paras. 4.20 and 4.21);
(c) creation of an Interministerial Urban Planning Advisory Group (para.
4.08); and
(d) introduction of changes in the regional and local financial
management procedures to establish a cost-sharing mechanism between
RAC and CPPEs for urban service operations (paras. 3.07 and 5.06).
7.05     As Credit covenants, the following will be required:
(a) establishment of a Regional Equipment Renewal Fund no later than
June 30, 1985 (para. 5.07); and
(b) undertaking of a study to prepare a medium-term urban management
action and submitting its implementation schedule to IDA for review
no later than June 30, 1986 (para 5.09).
7.06     On the basis of the above agreements, the proposed project will
be suitable for an IDA credit of US$10.7 million on standard terms to the
Government of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea.

ANNEX: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
1.   Triangulation
The new triangulation network should have an average density of one
control point per 100 ha and be calculated according to the UTM system from
the Doppler No. 39 point located at the center of the peninsula north of the
Conakry-Gbessia airport.
For control purposes, the network should as far as possible
incorporate the points set by the Guinean-Japanese team which was working in
November 1980, and those used by IGN-France for its aerotriangulation
operations.  (Not all these points are accessible, some being defined by
corners of buildings.)
2.   First-order Traversing and General Leveling
A primary traverse control network composed of closures with sides
measuring 500-600 m on average (in view of the configuration of the terrain)
shall be based on the old cadastral triangulation network (where it remains
identifiable).  The traverses themselves should coincide with the principal
traffic arteries: one on the north coastal road; the other on the south
coastal road; between (and roughly parallel to) them, the third should follow
the Conakry-Kankan rail line; and the fourth should be set along the airport
highway. Besides being easy to utilize, these routes offer the best prospects
for conservation Qf markers.



- 53 -
ANNEX 3-2
Page 6 of 6
These four traverses should be linked every 500-600 m by north-south
transversals.
Angles should be measured in T2-4 series. Measurements of length
should be taken with the distance marker.
All triangulation and traverse markers should be defined in terms of
the general leveling, while closing of the leveling network should be
identical to that of the traverse control network.
3.   Fixing Positions; Conservation of Points; Numerical Data
All points of the basic framework should be established on the ground
in permanent fashion, either by suitably-sized boundary zones, firmly embedded
stakes, or accessible, long-lasting natural markers.
A station description should be provided for each triangulation
control point. Each point of the traverse control network should be
identified by a position sketch giving at least four elevations tied in with
permanent points located at least 50 m from the position itself. These
sketches should be on transparent sheets (from which as many copies as
necessary can be made) bound in volumes (21 x 29.7 cm) fitted with side index
tabs; each sheet should hold four sketch maps.
4.  Redefining, Updating and Remapping of Existing Subdivisions
Once the MCHUD survey teams have finished laying out permanent ground
markers and recording basic network points, the new network should be divided
up by DRT teams, as necessary, into secondary traverse closures; subsequently,
existing subdivisions and those in the course of development should be
redefined and remapped by the RAC services.
Secondary traverses should be defined in accordance with require-
ments. They should be sighted in two series, Ti and T16, and their sides
measured using 50-meter calibrated tapes. Secondary traverse control points
should be located approximately every 200 m. As with the primary traversing
operation, all points should be marked in permanent fashion and mapped.
Utilization of the UTM system throughout will make cadastral data
amendable to accurate mapping on scales of 1:5,000 and/or 1:2,000.
