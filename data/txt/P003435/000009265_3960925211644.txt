SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on China
Second Power Proiect (Loan 2493-CHA)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on the Second Power
Project (Loan 2493-CRA)" prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Region. Part II
vas prepared by the Borrower.
The US$117 million Bank loan was the second project in the power
sector and focused on power shortage alleviation by constructing an Extra-High
Voltage transmission line from a mine mouth power plant in East China to Shangai.
US$6.2 million were canceled. Cofinancing came from Italy (US$8.6 million).
All physical components were implemented as planned. Transfer of
technology and know-how was achieved except in financial management which was
left out of the project. The PCR emphasizes that future projects should include
training in this area. The project viability suffered from substantial foreign
exchange losses and lessons learned called for measures to reduce the risks.
The PCR gives a thorough account of project preparation and
implementation which was mostly uneventful. Overall, the project is rated as
satisfactory, its sustainability as likely, and its institutional impact as
substantial.
The project may be audited together with other power projects in
China.

to complete the disbursements for eligible expenditures made until June 30, 1992.



CHINA
SECOND POWER PROJECT (LOAN 2493-CPA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Obiecfives
1.         The Government's strategy for resolving issues and achieving its t-njectives
in the power sector is to (a) introduce modern methods and enhance technology transfer
in the powe subsector; (b) set energy prices to gradually ensure the financial viability of
eergy pioducers and encourage the rational use of electric energy; (c) increase autonomy
in investment and operational matters; (d) accelerate the pace of hydroelectric
development, construction of large coal-fired thermal power plants, and extension of extra-
high voltage transmission networks to transmit power to load centers and to interconnect
major regional power systems; and (e) replace obsolete and small thermal power generatg
plants with larger and more efficient units, and convert eipensive oil-fired generating units
to coal-fiing to the extent pmcticable. The above objectives are being implemented step
by step through the lending operations for the power subsector in China. This proect is
the second power lending operation in China following the Lubuge Hydroelectrc Project
(Ln 2382-CHA). The project was designed to contribute to mitigation of power shortages
in the regional load c iter by construcing an Extra-High Voltage (EHV) transmission line.
The main objectives of the project were (a) to construct an EHV line to transfer power
generated at mine-mouth, coal-fired power stations to the regional load center; (b) to
transfer modern technology in EHV line and substation design, construction, and
maintenance; and (c) to adopt, by the Beneficiary, more appropriate techniques of system
planning, investment programming, and financial planning (Part I, para. 3.1).
,Implementation Experience
2.          All the main physical components of the project were successfully completed
according to the orignal objectives in the SAR. The section of the transmission line from
Xuzhou and Jiangdu (343 kIn) and associated substations were put into commission in
December 1987, about one year behind the SAR schedule. The section of the transmission
line from Jiangdu to Shanghai (272 km) and associated substations were put into
commission between September and November 1988, three to six months behind the SAR
schedule (Pat I, paras. 6.2 and 6.3).
3.          The actual cost of the project expressed in US dollars was about 18 pent
less than the appraisal estimate. The major reason for the cost underrun was a cost savings
in a 500 kV transmission line because a shorter route was arranged than the apprais
estinate called for (Part I, paras. 4f2 and 8.2).



- iii -
4.          The closing date of the loan was extended three times from the original date
of June 30, 1989, to June 30, 1992, because more time was needed for the procurement
of additional equipment to strengthen the reliability of the Jiangsu Provincial Power Grid
(Part 1, paras. 6.6 ano 15.4).
5.          All the covenants contained in the Loan Agreement and Project Agreemer t
were met.
Results
6.          The project fully achieved its main objectives through successful completion
of the 500 kV transmission lines and associated substations.  AU the lines were
commissioned within the SAR schedule. Completion of this project contributed to
developing and utilizing coal resources, promoting construction of mine-mouth power
stations, mitigating the shortages of power supply in East China, and promoting industrial
production and regional economic development (Part I, para. 8.1).
7.          Training for technical personnel in design, construction, and operation of
the latest technology of the EHV line and substation was carried out satisfactorily.
However, institutional development through training for utility and financial management
staff was less than expected (Part I, para. 14.6).
Sustainability
8.          This project is sustainable for the following reasons. The project was
designed to promote the development of coal mine-mouth power generation in the western
part of the region, along with the develcpment of EHV transmission lines to transmit the
generating power to the load center in Shanghai area. Major benefits of the project
included (a) promoting development of coal mine-mouth power stations in the western area
of Jiangsu Province; (b) expanding capacity of power transmission from west to east; (c)
raising the thermal power load rate in the western area and peak regulation capacity of the
hydroelectric power within the region; and (d) increasing the stability of the power system
in the region. The economic benefits in terms of the rate of return for this project are
marginal (about 7.1 percent compared to the SAR estimate of 12.5 percent) because of the
relatively low tariff level. The average sales price of electicity during project
implementation was 14.14 fen/kWh against the SAR estimate of 7.39 fen/kWh. However,
this was still a little below the long-run marginal cost The Chinese have made good
progress in evaluating the economic costs of electricity and coal and in suggesting
approaches for gradual price reform, through subsequent power projects supported by the
Bank (Part I, paras. 8.6 and 9.1).
Flndings and Lessons Learned
9.          Major findings were as follows:
(a)   The project was well designed and implemented. Completion of this project
yielded the following benefits in the East China Power Grid: {i) power



- iV-
genemated by coal mine-moutfi power stations could now be transferred to
the load center in the Shanghai area; (ii? the thermal power load in the
westem part of the grid and peak regulation capacity of hydroelectric power
within the system were increased; and (iii) the level of stability of the whole
system and the reliability of the regional power supply were increased
(Part I, para. 8.1).
(b)   The latest technology in design, construction, and operation of the EHV
transmission system was transferred to the Beneficiary, Jiangsu Provincial
Electric Power Bureau (JPEPB), with the assistance of the foreign
consultant through implementation of the project including training activities
(Part I, paras. 14.1 and 14.2).
(c)   Because of the subsequent change in the state construction plan, the
schedule for planning and constructing power sources in the East China grid
was changed and postponed. As a result, the commissioning of the second
500 kV transmission from Xuzhou to Shanghai was postponed from 1989
(SAR estimate) to the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) (Part I, para. 6.5).
(d)   No major environmental problems were encountered (Part I, para. 7.1).
(e)   During the implementation of the project, the devaluation of US currency
against the Japanese and Western European currencies affected procurement
activities. JPEPB lost $22.6 million equivalent in contracts in non-US
dollar currencies (Part I, paa. 8.3.).
10.         Lessons learned from this project are summarized as follows:
(a)   Training in financial management was left out under this project. With
increasng financial autonomy given by the recently promulgated
'regulations on transformiing the operting mechanisms of state-owned
industrial enterprises,' power utilities are expected to operate in a market-
oriented environment. Training in financial planning and management lags
behind and has to be strengthened. A specific training program for utility
and financial management should be included in future projects (Part I,
para. 14.6).
(b)   As mentioned in the discussion of major findings, the devaluation of the US
dollar against Japanese and Western European currencies resulted in the
beneficiary's loss of $22.6 million. Measures to avoid or minimize risks
for the foreign currency movements should be sought (Part I, para. 8.3.)
(c)   JPEPB experienced several difficulties in procurement. Project management
should have been strengthened to identify problems and seek solutions in a
timely and efficient manner to avoid unfavorable impacts on the construction
schedule (Part I, paras. 15.2 and 15.3).

2.    Backgound
2.1         In the early 1980s, the metropolitan and industrial areas of Shanghai,
Yangzhou, Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou were experiencing a shortage of
electric power, which was restricting industrial output and commercial advity. The
development program of ECEPA showed that power in the quantity necessary to alleviate
the shortage could best be provided by coal-fired thermal stations. The project was
conceived to provide (a) an optimal linge between the demand centers and mine-mouth,
coal-fired power stations located at Xuzhou and Penching in the north of Jiangsu Province
by means of EHV (500 kV) transmission line; and (b) the transfer to JPEPB of the latest
El V technology in construction, operation and maintenance. A preliminary design report
for the Xu7hou-Jiangdu line was prepared by the East China Electric Power Design
Institute (V 70DI) in 1982 and approved for implementation by the State Council in 1983.
Construction for this section was started in October 1984. Detailed engineering and design
for the Jiangdu-Shanghai line was completed before April 1985 by ECEPDI with the
assistance of foreign consultants.
3.    Project Objectives
3.1         The principal objectives of the project were the following:
(a)   to construct an EHV network to transfer power generated at mine-mouth,
coal-fired power stations situated on the west side of the East China power
grid to the regional load center located in the east side of the grid;



2-
(b)   to transfer modern technology in EHV line and substation design,
construction, operation, and maintenance to JPEPB;
(c)   to transfer to JPEPB more appropriate techniques of system planning,
investment programming, and fnacial planning and-control; and
(d)   to provide an opponunity for cofinancing.
4.    Project Description
4.1         The proposed project comprised the following:
(a)   construction of a 500 kV transmission line of about 617 kan from Xuzhou
to Shanghai, including the crossing over the Yangtze River;
(b) installation of five substations at Xuzhou, Jiangdu, Sunan, Huangdu, -md
Nanqiao and provision of equipment for hfree other substations in the grid
of JPEPB;
(c)   provision of tele-control and telecommunications equipment at project
substations and the dispatching centers at Shanghai and Nanjing for load
dispatching and system control;
(d)   provision of equipment for installation, commissioning, and testing of
substation facilities;
(e)   provision of consultg services to assist ECEPA and JPEPB in design,
procurement, construction, and staff trining for the 500 kV of transmission
lines and substations; and
(f)   establishment of a training center and provision of equipment to two existing
electrical training schools for the operation and maintenance of 500 kV
transmission lines and substations.
4.2         Transmission Unes and Substations. The 500 kV transmission line was
divided into the following four sections: Xuzhou-Jiangdu (342.5 Iam), Jiangdu-Sunan
(123.1 Iam), Sunan-Huangdu (91.7 kcm), and Huangdu-Nanqiao (53.9 kin). The total route
length was 617 km,2/ including the 2 x 2.8 Ian crossing over the Yangtze River. The
line was a single-circuit line with four-bundle Aluminum Conductor Steel Reinforced
(ACSR) conductors of 400 mm?. A step-up substation with 2 x 500 MVA tansformers
2I The length of $00 kV transmission lines at the time of the appraisal was 683 km, consisting of Xuzbou-
Jiangdu (340 km), Jiangdu-Sunan (15 km), Sunan-Huangdu (115 km), Huangdu-Nanquiao (110 km),
and tbh Yangtze River CrossiAng (3 km). The total length of the lines was reduced to 617 km from the
appraisal esdmate of 683 km as a result of obtinaing more direct rights-of-way in the vicinty of
Shanga.



3-
(for initial stage development) was established at Xuzhou near the Xuzhou No. 1 Thermal
Power Station. Four step-down substations with 500 kV/220 kV auto transformers were
established atJiangdu (500 MVA), Sunan (500 MVA), Huangdu (750 MVA), and Nanqiao
(750 MVA). Some equipment for three other substations in JPEPB's grid was also
included.
4.3         Tele-Control and Telecommunications Equipment. Power carier and
microwave tele-control and communications equipment was provided between these
substations and the dispatching centers at Shanghai and Nanjing for load dispatching and
system control.
4.4         Consulting Services. Project design was performed by introducing domestic
(ECEPDI) and foreign consultants (a Canadian firm and a TJS firm). For foreign
consultants, a total of about 60 staff-months was envisaged covering a period of 15
months.  Terms of reference covered review of design, bidding documents, and
procurement for 500 kV transmission lines and associated substations. Selection of
consultants u. s carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines.
4.5         Trai Ig. A program was included under the project to establish and equip
one taining center and two existing electrical training schools for operation and
maintenance of 500 kV transmission lines and substations. The center and schools
generated technical staff not only for the East China region, but also for all other regions
in China for the extension of the 500 kV network. The progranm included the provision
of laboratory and testing facilities and the upgrading of teaching staff. A training program
for the Ministry of Energy's (MOE's) power planning staff, including overseas tmining and
provision of some office equipment, was also part of the project.
5.    Project Desigp and Organization
5.1         The administration and implementation of the project was carried out by
JPEPB. The feasibility studies for the project were carried out by ECEPDI. Detailed
engineering and design of the project was carried out by ECEPDI with the assistance of
foreign consultants-the Canadian firm for transaiission design and the US firm for
substation design. Reviews of optimization of designs for transmission lines and
substations; preparation of bidding documents; and staff training in design, construction,
operation and maintenance of the 500 kV system were performed by these foreign
consultants. Design of the Yangtze River Crossing was carried out by the contractor and
reviewed by ECEPDI and tMe Canadian firm-
6.    Project Implementation
6.1         The project was implemented soundly and progressed to meet virtually all
the original objectives expected in the SAR. No substantial problems were experienced.
6.2         The section of the transmission line from Xuzhou and Jiangdu (343 k1m) and
associated substations were put into commission in December 1987, about one year behind



-4-
the SAR schedule. The reason for fte delay stemmed from delay in procurement because
JPEPB lacked experience in Intemational Competitive Bidding (ICB) in the initial stage.
However, JPEPB's subsequent management of the ICB procumment process was timely
and smooth.
6.3         The section of the transmission lines from Jiangdu to Shanghai (272 km,
including Yangtze River Crossing) and associated substations were put into commission
between September and November 1988, three to six months behind the SAR schedule.
The main reasons of the delay were (a) five months' delay in the delivery of transmission
line tower materials because of an industrial strike by the manufacturer (an Italian firm);
(b) an error in the tnisport destination (tower materias were transported to a different
port); and (c) five months' delay because of a change in design for the Yangtze River
Crossing.
6.4         The No. 2 main transformer expansion component in Nanqiao Substation
was delayea for 2.5 years beyond the date in the SAR schedule because of a delay in the
DC transmission line project (rot a part of the Second Power Project). The No. 2
tansformer was an associated component of the second pole of the 500 kV transmission
line project from Gezhouba to Shanghai, which was postpored from the original schedule.
Since the No. I transformer in Nanqiao substation was commissioned in May 1988, the
delayed commissioning of the No. 2 transformer did not affect opertion of the
transmission line from Xuzhou to Shanghai in this project.
6.5         Because of a subsequent change in the state construction plan, the planning
and construction of power sources within the East China Power Grid were changed, and
construction of Xuzhou Second Power Plant in Jiangsu Province and Huaibei Second
Power Plant in Anhui Province was postponed. As a result, commissioning of the second
eircuit of 500 kV transmission line from Xuzhou to Shanghai was postponed from 1989
(SAR estimate) to the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000). Subsequently, the annual energy
transfer along the Xuzhou-Shanghai transmission line was decreased and affected the
economic return of the project.
6.6         The original loan closing date for the project was June 30, 1989. The final
closing date was June 30, 1992, afte three extensions. With the Bank's agreement,
JPEPB purchased additional equipment to strengthen the reliability of the Jiangsu
Provincial Power Grid (see pam. 15.4). To ensure the payment for the additional
proement, the loan closing date was correspondingly extended.
7.    Land Acqutison and House Removal
7.1         The land acquisition was carried out smoothly in close cooperation with local
authorities and the active participation of the affected people. The pcice in China for
transmission lines is that only land for transmission towers is acquired, not the right-of-
way, since the land under high 500 kV transmission lines cn normally be utilized for
traditional cultivation. The principle for route selection is that no villages will te passed
over or houses not relocated. The totl length of the transmission Lines from Xuzhou to



-5 -
Shanghai was about 617 kn with 1,450 towers. Average landholding of each tower was
133 i2, totaling land acquisition of 19.3 ha. The landholders were compensated, and
119,725 m2 of residential houses were replaced. Compensation of Y 12.6 million was paid
to the relocated people. Compensations of Y 3.9 million and Y 6.3 million were paid,
respectively, for 754,000 trees cut down and for the year's crop of 1,228 ha. The land
acquired for the substations was 33.3 ha, comprising 7.3 ha for Xuzhou Substation, 9.9 ha
for Jiangdu Substation, 9.7 ha for Sunan Substation, and 6.5 ha for Huangdu Substation.
(No acquisition was required for the expansion of Nanqiao substation.) The compensation
for land acquisition for these substations was about Y 5 million. No major problems
relating to the land acquisition and house removal were experienced.
8.   Project Results
8.1        The project fully achieved its main objective through successfil completion
of the 500 kV transmission lines and associated substations. All the lines were in operation
within the SAR schedule, although 6 to 12 months of inital delays were experienced, as
mentioned in paras. 6.2 and 6.3. Completion of the project yielded the following benefits
in the East China Power Grid:
(a)   Power generated by the Xuzhou Power Plant located at the mine-mouth and
by neighboring power stations could be transferred to the Shanghai load
center.
(b)   The project contributed to solving the problem of inadequate power transfer
from west to east in the structure of the East China Power Grid.
(c)   The thermal power load rate in the western part of the grid was raised, as
was the peak regulation capacity of hydroelectric power within the system.
(d)   The level of the whole system's stability was raised, and reliability of the
regional power supply was increased.
On the whole, the accomplishments of the project have played a positive role in developing
and utdlizing coal resources, promoting construction of mine-mouth power stations,
mitigating the power supply shortage in East China, and promoting industral production
and regional economic development.
8.2        The estimated cost of the project at appraisal (excluding interest during
construction and other financial charges) was $133.0 million in foreign costs and Y 344.0
million in local costs, equivalent to a total of $265.3 million when expressed in foreign
currency and Y 689.8 milLion when expressed in local curency. The final cost was
$119.4 million in foreign costs and Y 368.8 million in local costs, equivalent to a total of
$218.2 million when expressed in foreign currency and Y 1,024.2 million when expressed
in local currency (see Part m for details). As compared with the appaisal estimate, the
project had a cost underrun of about 18 percent when expressed in US dollars and a cost
overrun of about 48 percent when expressed in local currency. The reason for the



-6 -
undenrun in terms of US dollars was based mainty on a cost saving in the 500 kV
transmission line because a shorter route was arranged than the SAR estimate called for
(see para. 4.2). The devaluation of the US currency against Japaneze and Western
European currencies resulted in a cost overrun in substation equipment (see para. 8.3).
The cost overrun in terms of local currency was caused mainly by the devaluation of local
currency from an exchange rate of Y 2 to $1 at the time of appraisal to Y 3.73 to $1 by
the end of 1988, the completion date of the main components of the project. Ihe average
exchange rate over the construction period (1985-88) was Y 3.46 to $1.
8.3         Because of the appreciation of the Japanese and Western European
currencies against the US dollar, JPEPB lost about $22.6 million equivalent, which
accounted for approximately 19 percet of the total loan amount provided by the Bank.
8.4         The estimated disbursements at apprisal and actual disbursements are given
in Part m. Total disbursement under this loan was $110,796,610.04. In accordance with
Bank practice, withdrawal applications were made against eligible expenditues incurred
until September 30, 1992, and the final disbursement was made on September 8, 1992.
The undisbursed balance of $6,203,386.96 was canceled on this date.
8.5         The allocation of the loan into various categories and actual disbursements
by category are shown in Part III. The original allocation was revised in January 1987 to
shift the unused amount for consultng services and the unallocated amount to category (1)
equipment and materials.
8.6         In the SAR, the ex ante internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the
project was estimated at 12.5 percent, based on measurable economic costs and benefits
associated with development of thermal power generating units in the western part of the
region (Xuzhou area) 3/ and two AC 500 kV transmission lines. The ex post IERR is
7.1 percent (with shadow price adjustment) and 8.5 percent (without shadow price
adjustment) as shc wn in Part IM and Annex 1. The lower IERRs came primarily from
increases in tariffs, which were not sufficient to cover the total operating expenses,
including debt service, and the delay in commissioning the second 500 kV transmission
line (see para. 6.5).
9.    Project Sustainabllity
9.1         This project is sustainable for the following reasons:
(a)   The project was designed to meet the Government's strategy to expand the
power generation and transmission system by promoting the development
3/ The SAR was based on Xuzhou No. 1 Station (two units of 200 MW, completed in 1986 and 1987) and
Xuzhou No. 2 Station (four units of 300 MW, completed in 1989, 1990, 1993, 1994, and one unit of
600 MW, to be completed in 1996). The PCR is based on te actual sa of Xuazou Station (two units
of 200 MW, compleed in 1986 and 1987); Penchang No. 1 Station (two units of 300 MW, to be
completed in 1996 and 1997); Penchng No. 2 Station (two units of 300 MW, to be completed in 1999
and 2000); and Huaibei No. 2 Station (two units of 300 MW, to be completed 1997 and 1998).



-7-
of coal mine-mouth power stations in the western part of the region and the
EHV transmission lines to transmit the generating power to the load center
in Shanghai area.
(b)   Completion of this project successfully yielded the following benefits, as
mentioned in pam. 8.1: (i) promotion of the development of coal mine-
mouth power stations in the westem area; (ii) contribution to solving the
problem of limited power transfer from west to east in the region;
(iii) raising the thermal power load rate in the westem area and the peak
regulation capacity of hydroelectric power within the system; and
(iv) increasing the stability of the power system in the region.
(c)   Economic benefits of this project in terms of the rate of returi are
considered marginal because of the relatively low tariff level. The average
sales price of electricity during project implementation was 14.14 fen/kWh
against the SAR estimate of 7.39 fen/kWh. However, this was still a little
below the long-run marginal cost (see Annex 1). Through subsequent
power projects supported by the Bank, the Chinese have made good
progress in evaluating the economic costs of electricity and coal and in
suggesting approaches for gradual price reform. For electricity, long-run
marginal cost and target tariffs were established for East China in 1988.
Since then, the Bank has continued to sponsor the formulation of tariff
action plans and adapted them to the specific conditions of regional power
grids.
(d)   As discussed in para. 14.6, institutional development through managerial
and financial staff tWaining was less than expected in this project. This
shortcoming has been rectified through subsequent power projects.
10.   Bank Performance
10.1        The performance of the Bank from the project prepration through project
completion was satisfactory. The Bank maintained good relations with the beneficiary and
the consultants throughout execution of the project.
10.2        Major achievements of the Bank were as follows:
(a)   During project implementation, the Bank regularly sent a mission to
supervise various aspects of the project, including the construction schedule,
procurement, financial aspect, loan covenants, project cost updating, and
training activity, to ensure smooth implementation of the project.
(b)   With completion of the Second Power Project, following the Lubuge
Hydroelectric Project (Ln 2852-CHA), the Bank established a basis for
cooperation and dialogue between the borrower/beneficiary and the Bank in
the development of the power subsector in China. To date, the Bank has



-8-
assisted the subsector in implementing 12 projects with a total assistance of
about $2.1 billion.
11.  Bonrower Perfornance
11.1       JPEPB successfully implemented and completed the project. The major
project component of 617 km of 500 kV transmission lines with associated substations was
successfully completed within the planned schedule.
11.2       JPEPB introduced and absorbed the latest design technology and
management of construction and operation of the EHV transmission lines with the
assistance of foreign consultants and tining activities. JPEPB's increased- experience in
the modern EHV technology will contribute to subsequent construction of the EHV lines
in the region.
11.3       Training for technical personnel was cariied out satisfactorily. However,
taining for managerial staff, particularly financial management, was below expectations
(see paa. 14.6).
11.4       Throughout implementation of the project, JPEPB became fii  with
relevant Bank guidelines, such as Procurent Guidelines and Guidelines for the Use of
ConsuUants. JPEPB increased its experience with ICB procurement.
12.  Fnanl Aspects
12.1        Salient features of JPEPB's finances during the period 1985-92 are
summarized in Part m.   JPEPB's operating results and financial positions were
satisfactory, even though they fell short of expectations during the period under review.
lPEPB met all the financial covenants set out in the Project Agreement, aside from not
fiurnishing the Bank with its long-term rolling plan in 1986 and 1987 owing to technical
problems. The average reun based on historically valued assets was 9.8 percent against
13.9 percent at appraisal for the period 1985-90. Since Jiangsu Province is the largest
province and has one of the fastest-growing economies in China, energy sales grew at over
10 percent per year compae with the 6 percent per year forecast at appraisal for the
period. The average tanff of JPEPB was adjusted at an annual rate of 10.2 percent
compared with a flat rate of 7.4 fenlkWh throughout the period projected at appraisal. The
return on assets, however, declined to 6.6 percent in 1992, about half that in 1985. The
declning trend in the profitability stemmed from rapid escalation of JPEPB's operating
costs. In particular, the cost for purchased power went up 338 percent between 1985 and
1990, an annual increase of about 34 percent, and accounted for about one third of the
operatin.g costs in 1990 compared with 20 percent in 1985. Moreover, both the fuel and
the operiting and maintenance costs rose beyond the general pnce increases. The negative
impacts on JPEPB's finances were only partially offset by the robust growth in energy
sales and impressive increases in the average tariff. The consequence is reflected in the
lower-than-expected capital expenditure by JPEPB (a total of Y 2.7 billion verus -Y 4
billion projected at appraisal) over the period and the severe shortage of electricity in the



-9
province. The conservative management approach taken by JPEPB helped it maintain a
high capitalization position, debt never exceeded 30 percent of total capital in comparison
with the appraisal estimate of 63 percent for 1989 and 1990. Nevertheless, Jiangsu
Province's economy suffered from a severe shortage of power supply and factories had to
be shut down from dme to dme.
12.2       The Bank's objective to promote prudent financial management was achieved
through JPEPB's compliance with the financial covenats since 1988, which required
JPEPB to prepare long-term financial plans, to focus on its trends in production costs, as
well as its future investment program and related financing arrangements, and to review
such plans annually with the Bank.
13.  Project Relationship
13.1       The relationship between the Bank and Beneficiary in the Second Power
Project was not only one of mutual trust and faith, but also was highly complementary in
al aspects of project implementation. Constraints and bottlenecks were removed efficiently
and expeditiously without negative impacts on the Bank-Beneficiary relaionship.
13.2       The Bank's relationship with the Government's organizations, other national
agencies and reiated institutions was also cordial. The Bank had no problem in gaining
access to the highest level of government authorities to discuss policy and render
professional advice.
14. Consulting Services and Training
14.1        A US firn was selected as a foreign consultant to optimize the substation
design, prepare bidding documents, evaluate bids, and train staff. A Canadian firm was
selected as a foreign consultant to optimize the transmission line design and the Yangtze
River Crossing design, prepare bidding documents, evaluate bids and train staff. The
performance of the consultants was satisfactory and met the requirements stipulated in the
terms of reference in the SAR.
14.2        The Canadian firm carried out the overseas training for JPEPB's staff in
managing the construction, operation and maintenance of the 500 kV line, which
contributed positively to raising the level of management of construction, operation and
maintenance after the project was put into operation.
14.3       In the SAR, the following trining program was planned:
(a)   One training center for the 500 kV power grid was to be established and
two electric power schools (one in Shanghai and the other in Nanjing) were
to have advanced facilities.
(b)   Overseas training was offered to the electric power planning pesnd
originally under the Ministry of Water Resources and Bectric Power.



- 10-
14.4        The actual training during implementation of the project was as follows:
(a)   Procurement for the training facility was canceled because the training
schools were unable to repay the credit, and the necessary items of
equipment for experiments and testing were purchased with domestic funds.
(b)   The power planning personnel were sent to the foreign consultant (US firm)
for tning in planning management of the system.
14.5       In addition, some relevant technical personnel were trained by equipment
manufacturers under the equipment contacts, and a small number of financial personnel
were sent to participate in overseas training or financial seminars for other projects.
14.6        As a whole, training for technical personnel in design, construction and
operation of the latest technology of the EHV transmission line and substation was carried
out satisfactorily. On the other hand, training for managerial staff, particularly for
financial management, was not sufficiently performed. Financial training for all Bank-
financed power projects in China is centrally managed by MOE and the State Energy
Investment Corporation. A financial management training program was proposed in 1989,
but was canceled at the final stage.
14.7       The consultant services and training for the project, not including the
training in the procurement contracts, utilized $530,000 from TCC fund and $375,000
from the loan for the project, totaling only $905,000 against the SAR estimate of $3.6
million.
15.  Procurement
15.1        The number of procurement contracts signed for the prQject was 101, of
which 41 were ICB packages. The total amount of the procurement contracts was
$110,425,000. All procurement activities for the project were performed in accordance
wi the Bank's procurement guidelines.
15.2       The following difficulties were expenenced by JPEPB in procurement:
(a)   A Chinese firm was selected to supply ACSR conductors of 3,500 km
(about 5,300 tons) in a contract amount of $6.9 million. In the contract
finalization- stage, the company declined the contract because it could not
fulfill its contractual obligations and deliver the conductors, mostly because
of increases in aluminum prices. Subsequently, JPEPB contracted the above
item (2,540 km, 3,800 tons) to another Chinese firm for $5.0 million.
(b)   For the procurement of 6 X 167 MVA transformers and 3 X 250 MVA
transformers, the lowest evaluated bidder (an Italian firm) declined contracts
during contract finalization stages because of the devaluation of the US



- 11 -
dollar against Japanese and Western European currencies. Subsequently,
JPEPB signed contracts with the second lowest bidders (Japanese firms).
(c)   A Yugoslavian firm delayed delivery of the remote control facility for 11
months.
(d)   An Italian firm delayed delivery of the transmission line tower materials for
five months because of labor strikes. One section of the transmission
towers collapsed in August 1989 from high wind velocity (26 mfsec). This
accident resulted in halted operations for 47 days. Countermeasures to
reinforce the strength of the towers were carried out.
(e)   Xuzhou Substation experienced trouble with a flushover in 500 kV current
transformers, supplied by a Japanese firm, in July 1988, which was related
to defects in design. The current transformers were replaced with ones of
improved design.
15.3        One of the lessons learned through the procurement activities of the project
was that project management should have been strengthened to find problems and seek
measures in a timely and efficient manner in order to avoid unfavorable impacts on the
construction schedule.
15.4        During implementation of the project, lPEPB needed to purchase additional
equipment, 500 kV shunt reactors and spare parts, to strengthen the reliability of the East
China grid. The Bank agreed to the additional procurement of these items, which resulted
in the extension of the closing date (see para. 6.6).
16.   Project Docunentation and Data
16.1        The legal agreements for the Second Power Project were appropriate for
achieving the project objectives and adequately reflected the Bank's interest in satisfactory
execution of the project. The SAR was comprehensive and well prepared, and provided
a useful framework for the Bank and JPEPB during project implementation. JPEPB
submitted quarterly progress reports and annual financial statements, annual audit reports
by independent auditors, and future investment programs, as stipulated in the Project
Agreement. The reports served as a valuable tool for project supervision and monitoring.

PART II: PROJECT REVW FROM
BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
17. Adequacy and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part III
17.1       The factual information of the project presented in the tables of Part III,
prepared by ECEPA and JPEPB, was reviewed and cross-checked thoroughly with the
Bank's mission in February 1993. It is adequate and accurate.
Comments on the Analysis Contaied in Part I
18.1       The analyses and remarks made by the Bank are comprehensive and
objective.
19. Evaluation of Bank's Performance
19.1       Throughout project implementation, the World Bank maintained a good
cooperauve reaionship with the Borrower/Beneficiary. The World Bank regularly sent
supervision nissions to supervise, inspect and direct all phases of the project to ensure
smooth performance of the project.
20. Evaluation of Borrower's Own Performance
20.1        The project was implemented we}l and progressed smoothly. The main
objectives of the project were met. No major problems were experienced. By its
completion, the project had become an important part of the main framework of the East
China Power Grid and caused power generated at mine-mouth, coal-fired power staions
on the west side of the grid to be transferred to the load center on the east side of the grid.
20.2       In the process of projec implementation, the Borrower/Beneficiary carefully
followed the Laan Agreement and the Project Agreement and met all the covenants, and
also strictly respected relevant Bank's guidelines for procurement, use of consultants, and
the disbursement handbook.
20.3        The Beneficiary introduced and absorbed the latest and advanced technology
on design, procurement, construction, and operation and maintenance of the EHV
transmission line.
20.4        Lessons leamned from the project are:
(a)   The truning of technical personnel in design, construction and maintenance
was carnied out to meet the objective of the project. However, the training
of managerial staff, particularly for financial managements was not
implemented sadsfactorily. This should be reinforced in future projects.



- 13 -
(b)   The project lost $22.57 million in foreign exchange because of a US dollar
devaluation, which accounted for 19.6 percent of the total loan amount.
Measures to minimize the risk in exchange rates should be sought in future
projects.
(c)  In procurement contracts for the project, performance of some contractors
was not satisfactory. Delays in delivery schedule, damage to equipment
during operation, and declination of contracts were experienced. Project
management should be strengthened to expedite procurement, improve
contract performance and avoid unfavorable impacts on the construction
schedule.
