SECOND POWER PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overview
1.01      China is the fourth largest producer and third largest consumer of
commercial energy in the world. Coal is by far the most important source (70%
of total production in 1982), but oil production has increased rapidly since
1972 to become an important source of both commercial energy (22% in 1982) and
of export revenue (accounting for about one quarter of the total). About 20%
of oil production and 1% of coal production is currently exported. Natural
gas, hydroelectric power and small quantities of s4,le oil and geothermal
power constitute the balance of commercial energy.- Noncommercial energy
resources supply energy equivalent to about 40% of commercial production.
Commercial energy production grew at 10% p.a. from 1952-75, but the growth
rate has fallen since then and between 1979 and 1981 it declined by 2.1%.
This trend was reversed in 1982, commercial energy production rose by 5.6% in
1982 and 6.7% in 1983.
1.02      China's achievements in developing energy resources over the past
three decades have been impressive. Production of coal has increased from
some 60 million tons in 1952 to 715 million tons in 1983. During the same
period power generating capacity increased from about 2,000 Mw to 76,440 MW.
Oil production increased from about 0.1 million tons in 1950 to 106 million
tons in 1983. These developments notwithstanding, the future prospects remain
uncertain.  The major oil fields, which together account for about 90% of
China's oil production, have peaked. Only a few, new discoveries have been
made. Rapid expansion of the coal industry faces very difficult problems in
terms of investment, location and transportation. The remoteness of large
hydro sites from load centers and the relatively large capital requirements
and long gestation period of major hydro projects preclude sizeable increases
in hydropower's share of energy production in the near term.
B. Resource Endowment
1.03      china is well endowed with primary energy and has abundant resources
in terms of coal, hydrocarbons, oil shale and hydropower potential. Coal and
lignite reserves are concentrated largely in the north and northeast, which
represent about 70% of the total recoverable reserves in China (640 billion
tons). While future plans call for increasing coal production significantly
by such measures as opening new mines and increasing mechanization, transport
(essentially railroad capacity) appears to be the single most important
1/   See Annex 1, Commercial energy balance for 1980, 1982, and 1985.



constraint to achieving this objective. Proven recoverable reserves of oil
are estimated at about 1.8 to 2.5 billion tons in the onshore regions and
4-8 billion tons offshore. Recoverable gas reserves are about 130 billion
cubic meters. Reserves of oil shale are estimated unofficially at 400 billion
tons. Current production of shale oil from the Liaoning and Guangdong mines
is about 300,000 tons p.a. China's exploitable hydropower potential, among
the largest in the world, is estimated at 1.9 million GWh per year; present
hydro generation is about 86,450 GWh. Verified uranium reserves in China are
sufficient to sustain 15,000 MW of nuclear power for 30 years. Much of China
remains to be surveyed for uranium, but abundant thorium resources are known.
While geothermal phenomena are abundant in the mountainous southwestern part
of the country, geothermal energy has not been developed to a significant
extent and its role is likely to remain limited. As in other developing
economies, noncommercial fuels such as crop residue and animal waste are used
extensively, especially in rural areas. China has pioneered and is now the
leading producer of biogas.
1.04      China's energy resources are not evenly distributed.  As much as 75%
of the known commercial energy in terms of coal and oil is in the north and
northeast, which have nearly 30% of China's population and more than 45% of
gross industrial output. The east, with one-fifth of the total population and
30% of industrial output, is almost devoid of any energy resource. In the
southwest, there is considerable hydropower and coal potential, but the
central south is largely bereft of energy resources except for some hydro
potential. Northwest China has considerable coal and oil resources but most
of these are in such remote and sparsely populated areas that development
would be extremely difficult and slow.
C. Sector Problems and Policies
1.05      China's level of commercial energy consumption is very high in
relation to its economic activity. Indications are that there is substantial
potential for improvement in industrial energy efficiency in China. The
Government is well aware of this problem and is according energy conservation
equal priority with increasing energy production.
1.06      Under the Sixth Five-Year Plan, (1981-1985) the Government is
putting major emphasis on the development of the energy and transport
sectors. Although several coal and hydropower projects were postponed in 1981
because of overall investment reductions, energy investment has since been
restored to the previously planned level. Progress is being made in building
a number of hydroelectric and thermal power stations, developing open pit and
underground coal mines, and increaseing the capacity of transport facilities
for coal handling. To accelerate petroleum development, the Government has
invited foreign oil companies to help develop both offshore and selected
onshore areas with difficult drilling conditions.
1.07      In the short run, the Government is trying to ease the problem of
energy shortages through energy conservation policies and programs. They
comprise a mix of administrative measures and price incentives. Cutbacks in
plan allocations of energy to major industrial users appear to have been the
principal measure thus far. Energy consumption norms have been reduced and



- 3 -
more strictly applied. Some very inefficient plants have been closed down.
Oil-fired units are being converted to coal-firing to the extent possible.
Fifty-five energy conservation centers have been established to provide
enterprises with technical assistance in improving energy efficiency. These
programs have resulted in energy savings estimated at 35 million tons of
standard coal equivalent in 1980 and 26.5 million tons in 1981. About half of
these savings, however, have been due to the shift in the industrial structure
from heavy to light industry. There is still much potential for further
energy-saving efficiency improvements in such industries as iron and steel,
non-ferrous metals, chemical products, fertilizer and thermal power genera-
tion. Some price increases have also been effected. In 1979, the prices of
coal and natural gas were raised. More recently, special subsidies on diesel
fuel for certain users were eliminated, an excise tax of Y 70 per ton of crude
and heavy oil (burned as fuel) was introduced and marginal coal prices to
industrial users have been increased. However, the present price structure is
not sufficiently conducive to energy conservation. Further increases in the
price of coal combined with increases in the price of petroleum products for
industrial users would be necessary. High industrial electricity rates would
also encourage conservation and provide resources for capacity expansion,
thereby helping to eliminate the chronic electricity shortage, which accounts
for a loss of about 20% in industrial production.
II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
A. Background
2.01      Power development in China has registered high rates of growth
during the last three decades. Of the total installed capacity of 76,440 MW
in 1983, 32% was hydro and 68% was thermal. Total electricity generation has
increased from 4,310 GWh in 1949 to 351,440 GWh in 1983. Annual per capita
generation of electrical energy has grown from 8 kWh to 348 kWh during the
same period. In 1982, power accounted for about 24% of the total commercial
energy consumption (see Annex 1). Power is distributed through 32 grids, of
which 13 (representing over 80% of the total capacity) exceed 1,000 MW each.
Six of these are regional grids; the remainder serve individual provinces at
smaller areas. Energy sales in 1983 reached 301,600 GWh, having grown at an
average 14% since 1949. 78% represented industrial consumption, 15% agricul-
tural, 1% transportation and 6% residential and urban commercial. About 60%
of the population has access to electricity. Annex 3 summarizes the growth of
capacity and sales since 1949, and Annex 4 shows the regional distribution of
generation.
B. Institutions
2.02      There are three principal ministries responsible for the energy
sector: the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power (MWREP), the
Ministry of Coal Industry (MOCI) and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry



- 4 -
(MOPI). Following the reorganization of the Government in 1982, MWREP
oversees all aspects of water resource management and electric power
development including policy making, system planning, and the design,
construction and operation of power and water resource projects of regional
importance. Under MWREP, there are six regional power administrations which
coordinate operations and load dispatching of the regional power grids and
formulate long-term development plans for approval by MWREP and the State
Planning Commission (SPC). Below the regional administrations are 16
provincial power bureaus operating as regional grids, while ten other power
bureaus still operate in isolation (see Chart 1, Organization of MWREP).
C. Tariffs
2.03      Electricity tariffs have in general remained constant since 1953.
Through minor regional adjustments over the years, they have become reasonably
uniform all over the country except in the northeast where historically they
have been lower. However, special reduced rates are from time to time
introduced to help new industrial and agricultural users in the initial years
of their establishment. Hence, the average revenue per unit has been declin-
ing due to increased consumption by these groups. The national average was
about 976 fen/kWh (US¢2.5/kWh) in 1982. The relatively low tariffs in
China - so far have not prevented the electric power sector as a whole from
achieving satisfactory financial results.
D.  Manpower and Training
2.04      MWREP has about 2 million employees of whom about 48% are directly
under the Ministry and about 52% are under provincial administrations. Of the
total, less than 30% have received formal education beyond junior secondary
school level. The percentage of technical personnel has declined from over 9%
in 1965 to about 8% at end-1982. MWREP suffers from the acute shortage of
well-trained administrative and technical staff.
2.05      In the late 1970s, MWREP initiated a long-term training program to
upgrade the quality of its existing staff at all levels. Although MWREP
organizes the program, much of the implementation is carried out by the prov-
incial power bureaus. The Ministry's ultimate goal is to establish by 1985 a
comprehensive program which will provide training to existing staff in a
systematic fashion. MWREP is also strengthening its capacity for full-time
training of potential employees through its Education Department which spon-
sors 48 universities, 49 technical colleges, television and correspondence
universities and 23 secondary vocational schools. Enrolled students totalled
53,000 in 1982. About 14,000 graduates are assigned to MWREP annually - 3,000
at 4-year college level and 11,000 at junior college level. These programs,
21   Average tariffs rates in other Asian countries in 1982:
India - US¢4.2/kWh; Indonesia - USc7.7/kWh; Thailand - US¢7.8/kWh;
Malaysia - US¢9.5/kWh; Korea - USC9.6/kWh.



- 5 -
supplemented by periodic short courses for managerial and technical staff and
by on-the-job training for workers, are expected to lead gradually to improve-
ments in the effectiveness of the workers in the sector.
E. Planning and Investment
2.06      Regional and provincial planning is carried out by the regional
electric power administrations and the provincial electric power bureaus.
Overall planning is the responsibility of the Planning Department of MWREP
which reviews the plans proposed by the regional administrations and provin-
cial bureaus on short-term (annual), medium term (5-year) and long-term (10-15
year) bases. For major hydro projects, the investigation, planning and design
are carried out by the regional hydroelectric investigation and design insti-
tutes under the supervision of the Water Resources and Hydroelectric Power
Construction Corporation. For system expansion, transmission lines and sub-
stations above 110kV and major thermal projects, the study, planning and
design are carried out by the regional electric power design institutes under
the supervision of the Power Planning Institute. MWREP, like other 3ine
ministries, operates under the overall supervision of the State Planting
Conuission (SPC) and the State Economic Commission (SEC), in which are vested
the ultimate authorities for project approval, budget allocation, financing
arrangements and supervision. The administrative arrangements for sector
planning are satisfactory, but the planning tools and methodology in some
cases need updating. The project will provide technical assistance and train-
ing in the necessary areas (paras. 4.11 and 5.27). Investment in the power
sector constituted about 7-8% of total national investment in capital con-
struction from 1977 through 1983. A significanct increase in the share of
power will be required to meet GOC's development targets up to the year 2000.
F. Subsector Policy and Strategy
2.07      The key points in the Government's strategy for electric power
development are as follows:
(a) the power industry should keep pace with industrial development to
ensure that demands can be met;
(b) power grids should be planned and managed on an increasingly
integrated basis;
(c) hydro development should be accelerated, particularly for rivers
with abundant hydro potential;
(d) mine-mouth coal-fired thermal stations should be developed,
supplemented, where necessary, by stations located near suitable
port areas and load centers;
(e) extra high voltage transmission lines should be developed to
transport power from remote hydro sites and mine-mouth thermal
stations and for interconnection between regions;



-6-
(f) medium and low pressure thermal units should be replaced
progressively by larger size and higher pressure units to improve
fuel efficiency, and oil-fired units should be converted to coal-
firing to the extent practicable;
(g) nuclear units should be developed in areas where other forms of
conventional energy are scarce; and
(h) efficiency should be improved and conservation should be encouraged.
G. Subsector Problems
2.08      Shortage of Generating Capacity.  In spite of considerable growth in
generating capacity, supply capability has lagged behind the demand and short-
ages are reported in most regions - particularly in the Northeast, North and
East China grids. The power shortage was estimated at about 10,000 MW in
generating capacity and 40,000 GWh in energy in 1982 which caused a loss of
20Z in industrial production. Demand management has been carried out in these
regions by staggering holidays, changing working hours, and load shedding
during shortages according to agreed priorities. As a result, the North China
Grid has increased its daily load factor to 86% and annual load factor to 75%
and the East China grid has achieved a daily load factor of 90% and an annual
load factor of around 83%. The overall average annual running hours for
thermal units in the country was around 5,500 hours, indicating a high degree
of utilization and a heavy burden on the existing facilities.
2.09      Tnadequate Transmission and Distribution Facilities.  The
development of transmission lines and substation facilities has lagged behind
that of generation. The most common high transmission voltage is 220 kV
(about 36,800 km) but this is too low to permit significant power transfers
over long distances. There are only two lines of 330 kV (about 1,088 km) in
Northwest and three lines of 500 kV (1,594 km) in Central and Northern China
in operation. No interconnection has yet been made between regions and there
are about 10 provincial grids still operating in isolation. MWREP has
estimated that China nas a shortage of about 10,000 km of transmission lines
at voltages above 110 kV. Similar shortages exist in substation capacity.
The present plan is to develop 500 kV lines for the regional backbone
transmission systems, to be overlaid by higher voltage a.c. and d.c.
transmission lines for regional interconnection.
2.10      Lower voltage subtransmission and distribution are currently being
financed by the provincial governments or municipalities. The local
authorities usually do not allocate sufficient funds for the improvement and
extension of these facilities.
2.11      Financial Constraints.  Financial constraints have been one of the
main reasons for the shortage of generating capacity and the inadequacy of
transmission and distribution facilities. In the past limited budgetary
allocations have caused considerable slow-down of power projects. Recently
the funding mechanism has undergone considerable revision (para 6.01-6.02);
this, and the possibility of increasing the level of sectoral self-financing
through tariff increases, should improve the availability of finance.

2.12      Technology Transfer and Training.  Despite the progress already
made, technology in least-cost investment programing, load dispatching and in
the application of computers is behind the levels prevailing in developed
countries. The age profile of the engineering staff is striking: most of
them are in their 50s and 60s. Strenuous efforts will be needed to narrow the
gap by training young graduates now emerging from universities. This may
involve the setting up of specialized training institutes, on-the-job training
within the country and training in utilities and institutions abroad. The
Bank plans to address this issue in due course in the context of a sector
related training program. A training component is included in the proposed
loan (paras. 5.07 and 5.12).
H. Role of the Bank
2.13      The Bank's role in the electricity subsector will be to promote the
transfer of modern technology, staff training, and institution building with
emphasis on system planning and modern financial management, as well as to
finance expansion of China's generation and transmission capacities. The Bank
will continue to assist in arrauging cofinancing of major power projects.  The
first power project (Lubuge) supported the Government's objective of maximiz-
ing the use of renewable energy resources by financing the construction of a
major hydropower facility, and in so doing successfully introduced inter-
national competitive bidding for civil works, modern construction techniques
and institutional development of state enterprises (by enhancing their
financial autonomy, etc.). Future lending will focus on hydropower
development, backbone transmission lines and coal-fired thermal stations.
Such projects, together with sector work, will form vehicles for a continuing
dialogue with MWREP and the regional and provincial administrations on
sectoral management and planning issues, including power pricing.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The beneficiary of the proposed loan would be Jiangsu Provincial
Electric Power Bureau (JPEPB).
A. Legal Status, Organization and Management
3.02      JPEPB is a state-owned enterprise under the direction of the East
China Electric Power Administration (ECEPA). It is a legal entity with
contractual capacity and is self accounting. It is assigned responsibility by
the State for the execution within its jurisdiction of the national plan for
power generation, capital investment, power sales and tariffs, employment and
payroll, materials consumption and tax and profit remittances to the State. A
charter has been issued for JPEPB and it is acceptable to the Bank.
3.03      JPEPB is headed by a director who is appointed by MNWREP. Four
deputy directors and a chief engineer are functionally responsible to him
respectively for construction; production and technical matters; finance,



-8-
labor and supply; personnel and training, and engineering and design. Opera-
tions are carried out throuagh a number of units engaged in power generation,
distribution, construction, and repair. Each of these units is headed by a
director with line responsibility to the director of JPEPB. A chart showing
the structure of JPEPB appears at Chart 2.
B. Staffing and Training
3.04      JPEPB had about 61,000 employees as of the end of 1983.  Except for
the core group of key technical 3nd managerial personnel, virtually all of
JPEPB's employees are assigned -  or recruited locally.  They are hired on a
permanent basis with the exception of some contract labor for construction
work.
3.05      Of the total staff employed by JPEPB, only about 4,000 or 62 have
received technical training equivalent to or above college level. The major-
ity of the workers have less than nine years of formal education. Although
day-to-day operations of the bureau are adequately manned and on-the-job
training is commonplace and generally sufficient, JPEPB recognizes the need
for training especially in its new undertakings such as the proposed project
where experience and expertise are lacking. A training component has been
included under the proposed project (paras 5.07 and 5.12).
3.06      Under the guidance of the deputy director of personnel and training,
the Education Division of JPEPB administers five training institutes. The
purpose of these schools is to train junior engineers, mid-level technicians
and skilled workers. The 3-year Staff and Workers University trains employees
who have graduated from high school and have at least two years of practical
experience. The Nanjing Electric Power Vocational School and the three tech-
nical schools educate junior high and high school graduates for 2-4 years
depending on their curricula and background. In 1983, over 1,000 graduated
from these five schools; nearly 60X in fields related to power generation,
about 30% in transmission and distribution and about 10% in capital construc-
tion. Specialized training in accounting, finance and management sciences is
limited.
C. Accounting Arrangements
3.07      JPEPB operates an accrual-based system and follows accounting proce-
dures laid down by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Its chart of accounts and
the form of its financial report are those specified by MOF for MWREP enter-
prises. Accounting is decentralized into the operating units and is consoli-
dated centrally. Monthly operating and quarterly full financial statements
are submitted to MWREP through ECEPA, which also prepares consolidated
statements for the 4 member bureaus (para. 4.01).
3/ Engineers with formal university education are centrally trained and
assigned by MWREP.



D. Audit
3.08      JPEPB has an internal audit staff who carry out scheduled examina-
tions of the accounts of each operating unit at least once a year, plus occa-
sional spot checks. ECEPA staff may also from time to time perform spot
checks of the accounting records of the member bureaus. 7%he object of these
examinations is primarily to test the records for arithmetical accuracy and
compliance with MOF procedures. As with all Chinese enterprises, this was
until recently the full extent of any procedure of an audit nature. The con-
cepts of an independent audit and an auditor's report thereon to the owners/
managers were not applied; no professional body of auditors existed and no
auditing standards had been established.
3.09      The new constitution ratffied by the National People's Congress in
December 1982 provided for the establishment of a State Audit Administration
'SAA), and this was done in September 1983. Audit bureaus at provincial and
county level are in the process of formation. The SAA has the status of a
ministry and reports direct to the State Council. Chinese leaders have on
many occasions affirmed the importance placed by the State on the establish-
ment of a strong national audit capability as an instrument of safeguarding
public investments and encouraging efficiency in public administration. The
Bank is supporting the formation of the SAA with an audit training component
in the Technical Cooperation Credit (1412-CHA).
3.10      The SAA has its headquarters in Beijing and has so far recruited
about 250 staff, mostly with extensive accounting experience at a senior
level, who have been grouped into six bureaus according to industrial
sector. Audits of enterprises which are beneficiaries of World Bank loans
will be carried out by SAA's Foreign Investment Bureau which will be staffed
with specialists capable of working and reporting according to international
auditing standards as well as to the Chinese regulations. The Bureau is in
the process of surveying the accounting and internal control arrangements of
its clients and devising audit programs.
3.11      At negotiations, JPEPB agreed to have its annual financial state-
ments audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank and submitted
to the Bank within 6 months of the end of each financial year (Section 4.02 of
the draft Project Agreement).
E. Tariffs
3.12      JPEPB's tariff is detailed at Annex 5.  It has been in effect since
1960. Apart from a demand charge applied to large industrial customers,
charges to all classes of customer are based solely on total energy consump-
tion. No differentiation is made between peak and off-peak use, and time-of-
day meters are not in use. The rate for domestic customers (19 fen or 7.3 USc
per/kWh) is three times the energy rate charged agricultural and large indus-
trial customers. The overall average revenue per kWh sold provides JPEPB with
a satisfactory level of operating income (para. 6.03). Domestic consumers do
not pay a connection charge but must buy their own meter and wiring. Indus-
trials are charged the cost of the substations (if any) and service drop,
which then become their property.



- 10 -
F. BilLing and Collection
3.13      At the end of 1983 JPEPB had 891,500 customers as follows:
z
Heavy industrial                      2,800          0
Other industrial/commercial         115,100         13
Agriculture                         164,900         19
Domestic and Lighting              608,700          68
891,500         100
Billing is carried out from 79 district offices. Industrial and commercial
customers are charged by direct debit to their bank accounts each 10 days on
the basis of estimated usage derived from their production or sales plan;
estimates are adjusted to actual at the end of each month. Most domestic
consumption is metered at the apartment building level and the charge is dis-
tributed between residents by internal arrangements. Agricultural consumption
is generally metered at the commune which arranges distribution amongst
individual farmers.
3.14      BilLs are collected by meter readers who return to metered premises
three days or so after billing. Amounts not collected by them are the cus-
tomer- s responsibility to pay at JPEPB's offices. Disconnection is enforced
after 10 days. These arrangements have established a reliable cash flow from
sales and reduced receivables to an unusually low level; at the end of 1983
they were less than Y 1 million on sales of Y 1,536 million.
C. Insurance
3.15      During the Cultural Revolution the Chinese insurance industry was at
a standstill and no cover was available. JPEPB still self-insures all its own
risks. However, with the emerging availability of various kinds of commercial
cover through agencies such as the People's Insurance Company of China, JPEPB
intends to reevaluate its policy on insurance, particularly as regard vehicles
and public liability. At negotiations, JPEPB agreed to insure or make ade-
quate provision for the insurance of imported goods procured under the project
against hazards incident to the acquisition, transportation and delivery to
the places of use or installation (para, 2.04 (a) of the draft Project
Agreement), and for the insurance of plant, equipment and other property
(including facilities constructed under the Project) against risks in
operation and maintenance (para. 3.03 of the draft Project Agreement).

IV. THE POWER MARKET AND THE PROGRAM
A. The East China Power System
4.01      The East China Power System (ECPS) covers the three provinces
Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang and Shanghai municipality, with a combined popula-
tion of 168 million. The installed capacity of ECPS was about 11,808 MW in
1983, consisting of about 9,958 MW of thermal (84Z) and 1,850 MW of hydro
(16%). The major generating stations are listed in Annex 7. The system peak
load and energy generation in 1983 were 8874 MW and 63,011 GWh respectively.
Only 6,045 GWh or 10% was generated from hydro.
4.02      At present, the highest transmission voltage level in ECPS is
220 kV. The total length of 220 kV transmission lines was 6,454 km at the end
of 1983 and the total capacity of 220 kV step-down transformers was 9,520 MVA
involving 60 substations. A network of 500 kV transmission lines is being
implemented in stages - the proposed project being a part of that network (see
MAP 1: East China Power System by 1990).
4.03      There are four Load dispatching centers in the East China grid:
Shanghai, under the supervision of ECEPA, has overall responsibility for
transfer of power between the three provinces and the municipality, which are
presently interconnected at 220 kV; Nanjing (JPEPB), Anqing and Hangzhou
centers control the statiors, transmission and distribution systems within
their respective provinces. Power is transferred between provinces on the
basis of availability and reLative costs of energy generation.
B. The Jiangsu Power Grid
4.04      The Jiangsu power grid extends about 450 km from north to south and
250 km from west to east, involving 11 municipalities and 64 counties. The
total installed capacity in 1983 was 3,265 MW of which 3,246 MW or 99% was
thermal. Energy generation was 18,235 GWh in 1983; the average annual util-
ization factor of generating facilities was 69%, equivalent to about 6,075
hours of operation at fulL capacity.
4.05      Before 1949. the electricity consumption in Jiangsu was only 118 GWh
with a total installed capacity of less than 100 MW. The energy consumption
has been growing at an average annual rate of about 10 from 1949 to 1970 and
about 12X from 1971 to 1983. Growth rates in peak demand and energy genera-
tion over the past 14-years from 1970-1983 are shown in Table 4.1.

4.06      Of the 19,889 GWh total energy consumption (including self-
generation by captive plants) in 1983, 68% was consumed by industrial users,
26Z by agricultural users, and 6% by transportation, residential and commer-
ciaL users. Annex 8 gives details of energy consumption by categories of
users from 1979 to 1983.
C. Load Forecast
4.07      The load forecasts of ECEPA and JPEPB were made by means of time
regression analysis for different categories of consumers on the basis of the
past growth trends adjusted for new Large industrial loads expected to be
connected to the system. The forecast peak demands and energy requirements
for the period 1984-1995 are shown in Table 4.2

1984-1995           8.2Z       8.6%        7.5Z            7.6%
4.08      The peak demand and energy generation for ECEPA would increase from
8,874 MW and 63,000 CWh in 1983 to 14,700 MW and 100,000 CWh in 1990, which
represent average annual growth rates of 7.9% and 7.0% respectively. Those
for JPEPB would be increased from 3,230 MW and 18,235 GWh to 5,400 MW and
36,200 GWh respectively, growing at annual rates of 8.0% and 6.7%.
4.09      This forecast is reasonable considering that:  (a) through about
1987 load growth wilL be constrained by shortage of generating capacity:
(b) East China is one of most important industrial centers and prosperous
areas in China with a booming economy accounting for almost a quarter of
China's gross national product; and (c) a number of large users such as the
Baoshan steel mill, textile and petro-chemical industries, oil refineries and
pumping stations for the South-North Water Diversion Scheme will be put into
operation in the next few years.
D. The 1984-1990 Program
4.10      East China is short of natural energy resources.  Shuikou (1400 MW)
in Fujian province is the only sizable conventional hydro project located
within the region capable of providing peaking capacity to the system. Future
development must depend largely on coal-fired thermal power stations located
at mine mouchs or near ports and load centers using the coal from Shanxi
province.
4.11      ECEPA's power development program including generation and
transmission from 1984-1990 is shown in Table 4.3. The balance of system
Loads and capabilities is given in Annex 9 and the power development program
is shown graphically in Chart 3. A review of ECEPA's development program



- 14 -
indicates that the program is in line with the national energy policy of
utilizing to the extent possible the indigenous resources of coal and hydro-
potential and the system would achieve a balance between demand and supply
capability from 1988 and thereafter; power shortage is still expected for the
next 2-3 years. The program can, however, be further optimized as regards the
sequence of development of alternative sites and unit installation. Arrange-
ments were made with MWREP that it would seek technical assistance from the
International Atomic Energj Agency (IAEA) in system development programming
using IAEA's latest WASP - computer program.

V. THE PROJECT
A. Background
5.01      The metropolitan and industrial areas of Shanghai, Yangzhou,
Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou are experiencing a shortage of electric
power which is restricting industrial output and commercial activity
(para. 7.01). ECEPA's development program shows that power in the quantity
necessary to alleviate the shortage can best be provided by coal-fired thermal
stations (para. 4.10-11). The project has been conceived to provide an
optimal linkage between the demand centers and a mine-mouth coal-fired station
located at Xuzhou in the north of Jiangsu province (4 x 125 MW in operation, 4
x 200 MW under construction, and 4 x 300 MW and 2 x 600 MW planned) and to
provide for the transfer to the beneficiary of the associated technology in
construction, operation and maintenance of the facilities. A preliminary
design report for the Xuzhou-Jiangdu line was prepared by the East China
Electric Power Design Institute (ECEPDI) in 1982 and approved for implementa-
tion by the State Council in 1983. Construction for this section was started
in October 1984. Detailed engineering and design for the Jiangdu-Shanghai
line are being carried out and are expected to be completed before April 1985
by ECEPDI with the assistance of consultants (para. 5.06).
B. Project Objectives
5.02      A number of the key points of the Government's strategy for power
development (para. 2.07) are refelcted simultaneously in the conception of the
project; in particular, the provision of adequate electric power to support
industrial growth; development of mine-mouth thermal power stations to exploit
China's abundant coal reserves; and construction of a network of extra high



- 16 -
voltage (EHV) lines to transfer power between optimal generating sites and
load centers and to facilitate eventual regional interconnections. Besides
this, the project provides an excellent vehicle for the furtherance of the
Bank's objectives in the subsector (para. 2.13) insofar as it will:
(a) provide for the transfer of the Latest technology in EHV line and
substation design, construction, operation and maintenance
(para. 5.06-07 and 5.12);
(b) foster the adoption by the beneficiary of more appropriate tech-
niques of system planniuig, investment programming, and financiaL
planning and control (paea. 5.27, 6.11-12); and
(c) provide an opportunity for cofinancing (para. 5.13-14).
C. Project Description
5.03      The proposed project comprises:
(a) construction of a 500 kV transmission line of about 683 km from
Xuzhou to Shanghai including crossing over the Yangtze River;
(b)  installation of five substations at Xuzhou, Jiangdu, Sunan, Huangdu
and Nanqiao and provision of equipment for three other substations
in JPEPB's grid;
(c) provision of tele-control and tele-communication equipment at
project substations and the dispatching centers at Shanghai and
Nanjing for load dispatching and system control;
(d) provision of equipment for installation, commissioning and testing
of substation facilities;
(e) provision of consultancy services to assist ECEPPI and JPEPB in
design, procurement, construction and staff training for the 500 kV
of transmission lines and substations; and
(f) establishment of a training center and provision of equipment to two
existing electrical training schools for the operation and
maintenance of 500 kV transmission lines and substations.
5.04      Transmission Lines and Substations.  The 500 kV transmission line
will be divided into the foLlowing four sections: Xuzhou-Jiangdu (340 km),
Jiangdu-Sunan (115 km), Sunan-Huangdu (115 km), Huangdu-Nanqiao (110 km).  The
total route length will be 683 km, including the 3 km crossing over the
Yangtze River. The line will be a single circuit line with four-bundle



- 17 -
ACSR 5/ conductors of 400 sq mm. A step-up substation with 2 x 500 MVA
transformers (for initial stage development) will be established at Xuzhou
near the Xuzhou No. 1 thermal power station. Four step-down substations with
500 kV/220 kV auto transformers will be established at Jiangdu (500 MVA),
Sunan (500 MVA), Huangdu (750 MVA) and Nanqiao (750 MVA). Some equipment for
three other substations in JPEPB's grid will also be included.
5.05      Tele-Control and Tele-Communication Equipment.  Power carrier and
microwave tele-control and communication equipment will be provided between
these substations and the dispatching centers at Shanghai and Nanjing, for
load dispatching and system control.
5.06      Consultancy Services.  The feasibility studies for the project were
carried out by ECEPDI. Detailed engineering and design of the project will be
carried out by ECEPDI with the assistance of consultants for the optimization
of lines and substations, in the preparation of bidding documents, and to
provide staff training in design, construction, operation and maintenance of
500 kV lines and substations. Terms of reference for these services are
detailed in Annex 10. A total of about 60 man-months is envisaged covering a
period of 15 months. At negotiations agreements were reached that JPEPB would
retain the services of consultants in design and procurement for 500 kV
transmission lines and substations and related staff training in accordance
with the Bank Guidelines (para 2.02 of the draft Project Agreement).
5.07      Training.  A program will be included under the proposed project for
the establishment of one training center and equipping of said center and two
existing electrical training schools for the operation and maintenance of 500
kV transmission lines and substations. The center and schools will generate
technical staff not only for the East China region but also for all other
regions in China for the extension of the 500 kV network. The program would
include the provision of laboratory and testing facilities and the upgrading
of teaching staff. A training program for MWREP's power planning staff
including overseas training and provision of some office equipment will also
be included. At negotiations, assurances have obtained that JPEPB will carry
out a training program satisfactory to the Bank (Section 2.08 of the draft
Project Agreement).
D. Cost Estimates
5.08      The estimated cost of the project is summarized in Table 5.1.  The
cost estimates are based on end-1984 price levels. Physical contingencies
include 5% for foreign costs, which comprise only imported goods and services,
15% for civil works, and 10% for other local costs. The price contingencies
for all foreign costs were calculated on the basis of assumed annual rate of
escalation of 3.5% for 1984, 8% for 1985 and 9% for 1986 and thereafter. The
price contingencies for local costs were calculated at 3%. Detailed project
cost estimates are provided in Annex 11.

5.10      The proposed Bank loan of $117.0 million would meet about 46% of
total project cost (net of duties and taxes) or about 82X of the foreign
exchange requirements. It would be used to cover the costs of the following
items:
(a) construction equipment and materials for the transmission line
including 6teel towers, conductors, ground wires, insulators and
hardware;-
(b) equipment and materials for substations including steel structures
and supporting insulators, transformers, power circuit breakers,
disconnecting switches, main control boards and equipment, power and
control cables, protection equipment, shunt reactors and other
installation, operation and testing equipment;
(c) tele-control and tele-communication equipment;
(d) a computer plotter and office equipment;
(e) consultancy services; and
(f) training.
5.11      The Bank loan would be made to the People's Republic of China at the
standard variable interest rate for a 20-year term including five years of
grace. GOC would relend the proceeds of the loan to JPEI'B under a subsidiary
loan agreement, with a 20-year term, including five years of grace, at 8.5%
p.a. interest. JPEPB would bear the foreign exchange risk (between the dollar

and the Borrower's currency). Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement
satisfactory to the Bank and approval of the Loan Agreement by the State
Council would be conditions of effectiveness of the loan.
5.12      About US$0.6 million has been provided under the Technical
Cooperation Credit (Credit 1412-CHA) for project preparation. Besides the
consultancy services related to project preparation (para. 5.06), it will
provide funding for a study tour and for training of staff in design and
construction. The balance of the foreign exchange required for the
consultancy services and training for the operation and maintenance of 500 kV
transmission lines and substations would be financed under the Bank loan.
5.13      The Government of Italy has agreed to provide a soft loan of US$10
million (15 years repayment with 2 years of grace at 2.5% p.a. interest) for
the supply of steel towers, conductors, insulators, hardware and erection
supervision services for the crossing work over the Yangtze river and the
supply of selected substation equipment. The Bank has assisted in making the
necessary contacts.
5.14      It was also agreed that the Bank will assist GOC in seeking bila-
teral aid for the establishment of one training center and equipping of said
center and two electrical schools. In case such aid should not be forth-
coming, an amount of US$2.6 million has been provisionally included in the
Bank loan amount.
5.15      All local costs of the project and interest during construction on
local and foreign loans will be financed by local bank loans and GOC funds.
F. Construction and Supervision
5.16      The construction and installation of transmission lines and substa-
tions will be the responsibility of JPEPB. JPEPB may subcontract all or part
of the work within Shanghai municipality to the construction unit of the
Shanghai Electric Power Supply Bureau (SEPSB). Both of these enterprises have
extensive experience in 220 kV transmission lines and substations. With
proper training and consultant assistance in tower erection and line string-
ing, these enterprises are capable of carrying out the project in an effi-
cient and economic manner.  The average cost of 500 kV transmission_,)ines is
estimated at about US$166,000 per km. This reflects the low level ' of labor
costs in China. Construction supervision will be carried out by the 500 kV
Transmission Project Office under JPEPB in association with ECEPDI.
7/   A contracted price of US$200,000 per km was recently recorded for a
similar project in Indonesia.

G. Procurement
5.17      Equipment and materials financed under the proposed Bank loan will
be procured by International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the
Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Under ICB, qualifying domestic manufacturers
will be permitted to participate and be eligible for a 15% margin of prefer-
ence or the prevailing custom duties, whichever is lower, in the evaluation of
bids.  Minor equipment estimated to cost less than US$100,000 per contract up
to an aggregate amount of US$2 million could be procured on the basis of three
quotations from qualified supplier eligible under the guidelines.
5.18      Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 5.2 below:

JPEPB and SEPSB, and US$10.0 million of goods financed under bilateral
credits.
5.19      For the procurement of equipment and materials financed under bila-
teral credits, procurement procedures of the donor country would be followed.
5.20      All bidding packages for equipment and materials financed by the
Bank and estimated to cost over US$500,000 equivalent would be subject to the
Bank's prior review of procurement documents, which is expected to cover
nearly all the contracts.

H_ Implementation Schedule
5.21      Chart 4 gives the implementation schedule for the various elements
of the project. The Xuzhou-Jiangdu section of the line and the substations at
Xuzhou and Jiangdu are scheduled for completion by December 1986. The
Jiangdu-Shanghai section and the substations at Sunan, Huangdu and Nanqiao are
expected to be completed by early 1988.
5.22      The project completion date is June 30, 1988.  The closing date of
the Bank loan would be June 30, 1989, which would allow adequate time for
payment of retention monies.
r. Disbursement
5.23      The Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) 100X of the foreign
expenditures of directly imported equipment and materials; (b) 100% of local
expenditures ex-factory of locally manufactured items; (c) 75% of the cost of
other items procured locally off-the-shelf; and (d) 100% of the cost of con-
sultancy services. In the event that assistance is required with training as
described in paras. 5.10 and 5.14, the Loan wouLd also be disbursed against
100Z of overseas training expenditures. Documents in support of the statement
of expenditures for overseas training and contracts each valued at less than
$20,000 equivalent need not be submitted to the Bank but should be retained in
the project office for review by the Bank's supervision missions.
5.24      Annex 12 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan
as weLl as the Bank-wide profile of disbursements for distribution and trans-
mission projects, which are very close for the first two years. The estimated
project disbursement schedule is faster in the latter years than the average
Bank profile because: (i) consultants have already been appointed and are
reviewing and optimizing designs for the southern section of the transmission
line; (ii) procurement is underway and bids for the first package of major
substation equipment are being evaluated by ECEPDI assisted by the
consultants; and (iii) construction of the northern section of the line was
started in October 1984.
J. Monitoring and Reporting
5.25      Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project
in terms of physical execution and financial renorts were agreed during
negotiations. Quarterly progress reports on the projecc and a completion
report as agreed in a side letter on reporting requirements will be submitted
by JPEPB (Sections 2.05 (b) and (d) of the draft Project Agreement).
K. Ecology
5.26      Ecological factors have been taken into account in the design of the
line in accordance with internationally accepted safety practices, particulary
with respect to radio interference, audible noise, visual nuisance and-ground
gradients. The line route has been selected to cause minimum disturbance to
the environment. Substation sites have been selected out of populated
areas.   No safety hazards are foreseen.

5.27      To improve MWREP's capability in system planning, it was agreed that
the Bank will assist MWREP in seeking technical assistance of the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in demand forecastin,Band in least cost
investment programing using IAEA's latest MAED and WASP -  computer
programs. IAEA has already agreed in principle to provide such assistance on
a grant basis. In addition, the project includes a training component for
developing MWREP's capability in system planning (para. 5.07).
M. Operation and Maintenance
5.28      All the facilities to be constructed under the project will remain
in the ownership of JPEPB, which will have ultimate responsibility for their
operation and maintenance. At its discretion JPEPB may entrust operation and
maintenance of the facilities in the Shanghai metropolitan area to SEPSB.
N. Risks
5.29      As most of the transmission line traverses flat agricultural areas
in Jiangsu province, little problem in obtaining and clearing the right-of-way
for line construction is expected. The right-of-way for the section from
Huangdu to Nanqiao close to the outskirts of Metropolitan Shanghai has already
been secured. No other risks are envisaged.
5.30      Since the main objective of this project is to transmit bulk power
from the mine-mouth Xuzhou thermal power stations to the Jiangsu-Shanghai
areas, anv slippage in the commissioning of the thermal power stations will
also affect the success of this project. The extension of Xuzhou No. 1
thermal power station (4 x 200 MIW) is under construction and is expected to be
completed as scheduled: No. 1 unit in December 1985, No. 2 unit in December
1986 and No. 3 and No. 4 units in June and December 1987 respectively.
5.31      Around the Xuzhou coal fields, there is a total coal reserve of
about 3.5 billion tons. The annual production now is about 12,000,000 tons a
year. There w-ill be no problem in coal supply for these four units of 200 MW,
which together with the existing units will require about 4 million tons a
year.  Fcr the No. 2 power station (2,400 MW in total ultimately), part of the
coal could be supplied locally through the accelerated development of coal
mines in that area but part of the coal would have to be supplemented by coal
from Shanxi province using railroad transportation. Fortunately, Xuzhou is
located close to the main trunk line for coal export connecting Taiyuan -
Shijiazhuang - Jinan - Yanzhou - Shijiusuo (a new sea port in Shandong
province in association with an electrified railroad partly financed by the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan).

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Background
6.01      For many years the financial operations of JPEPB - in common with
all Chinese state enterprises - have been conducted according to a system in
which the capitaL of the enterprise is divided into a number of funds, each
earmarked for a particular purpose. Each enterprise was permitted to retain
small amounts of earnings to estabLish funds for specific internal purposes,
such as R&D, empLoyees' welfare and bonuses; other special funds (in JPEPB's
case, for major overhauls) might be created by specific charges against
operating revenue. Funding for capital expenditure and working capital was
derived excLusively from budgetary allocations by the State; in return, the
enterprise was required to return to the State virtuaLly the whole of its net
earnings except for the permitted retentions described above. However, the
quantum of earnings returned to the State was not related to the quantum of
budgetary funds received, and the concept of loan debt and associated debt
service was not reLevant. Neither was the concept of self-financing by the
enterprise. The system was an essential piece of the central planning mecha-
nism, under which State funds are mobilized inter alia through the operations
of enterprises and are applied according to priorities determined nationally
by the State Planning Commission.
6.02      In 1980, the system began to undergo certain changes.  Loan financ-
ing was introduced as an additional instrument of funding for enterprises'
capital experditures. In JPEPB's case, loans would be available both from
People's Construction Bank of China (PCBC) and from provincial sources.
Interest would be at 3Z but maturities would vary according to the class of
asset - for example, shorter for thermal stations, longer for hydropower
plants. Debt service would be deductible in calculating earnings to be
remitted to the State. In 1983 an income tax was introduced under which
enterprises were to be assessed to tax at 55X of taxable income, which was
defined as net income less debt service. For the time being, the balance of
earnings is still to be remitted to the State as well as the tax, but experi-
ence is being gained which may Lead to a system more firmly oriented to the
concepts of earnings, tax and retentions.
B. Pas: Results and Present Position
6.03      Summarized income statements for JPEPB for the five years 1979
through 1983 are at Anrex 13. Energy sales grew at an average annual rate of
9%; revenue growth was rather less (7.5Z) because of a decline in the average
revenue resulting from a higher proportion of agricultural consumption and
bulk power sales to the ECEPA pooL in 1983. Net income averaged 30% of sales
revenue during this period, although as a result of the arrangements described
above very little was retained by JPEPB. The operating results represent a
rate of return of around 27% of the net value of assets employed. Highlights
of the five year's operations are as follows:

6.04      By virtue of the financing arrangements described in paras. 6.01-
6.02, the proportion of debt in JPEPB's balancg sheet is still low; the
debt:equity ratio at the end of 1983 was 8:92. 'The current ratio was 2.2,
with current assets consisting more than half of cash (receivables are
unusually small: para. 3.14). ThW0yinancial condition of the enterprise is
sound.  Summarized balance sheets -   for JPEPB for the years ending
December 31, 1979 through 1983 are at Annex 14.
C. Future Financial Performance
6.05      It has been noted (para. 6.02) that important changes have already
begun to be introduced into the Chinese financial systen.  It is to be expec-
ted that, as experience is gained in the operation of these systems, further
modifications may take place. In addition, the Bank understands that the MOF
accounting rules that enterprises follow are being reviewed, so that changes
may also emerge in the statements of financial results that they prepare.
Financial forecasts made at this time are therefore particularly vulnerable to
the effects of institutional change, and in preparing those for JPEPB
(Annexes 15-17) it has been necessary to carefully define a number of assump-
tions. The most important are those concerning JPEPB's financing plan, and
the arrangements for disposal of net earnings.
6.06      Financing Plan.  JPEPB's construction program for the rest of the
forecast period (through 1990) has been assumed to follow the arrangements
instituted for projects now in construction or about to enter construction:
9/   In arriving at this measure, government funds, retained earnings and
special funds have been treated as equity.
10/ They have been reassembled from the Chinese versions, which are grouped
so as to distinguish the various funds and their attributable invest-
ments.



- 26 -
(a) thermal power stations: financed by local or PCBC loans, or a blend
of the two; and
(b) transmission and distribution (apart from the proposed project):
financed by Government budgetary allocations up till 1984 and
financed by PCBC loans from 1985 onwards.
On this basis, JPEPB's investments would be financed as follows:
Y million           X
IBRD/Italy                                 330            8
PCBC loans                               3,138           77
Other local loans                          532           13
Government allocations                      73            2
Total Capital Expenditure              4,073          100
6.07      Disposal of Net Earnings.  With the introduction of income tax on
enterprises in 1983 (para. 6.02), the amount of after-tax profit to be
remitted to the State (through the enterprise's parent ministry) was to be
fixed every third year for the following three-year period, on the basis of
the remittance of the preceding year. Under this system, after-tax earnings
above the base year level would accrue to the enterprise.  However, because
the system is new it will be reviewed year by year, and the formula may be
modified. For the purposes of the forecasts a conservative assumption has
been made that the balance of after-tax profit would be remitted in full to
1'1WREP after providing for a retention by JPEPB of 3.5% of net earnings, as in
prior years.
6.08      On the basis of these and other assuaptions set out in Annex 18, the
forecasts show that JPEPB would continue to produce satisfactoff financial
results through 1990. The rate of return on assets employed - would decline
from its current high level but would still be over 8% at the end of the
decade. Cash flow fzom operations develops strongly and debt service is
covered a minimum of 1.8 times throughout the period. Because of the buildup
of debt service, however, profit remittances to MWREP dwindle to negligible
levels by 1990. At the end of that year, JPEPB is still satisfactorily
capitalized with a 63:37 ratio of debt to equity, and holds cash balances
amounting to about 40% of annual operational requirements. The current ratio
is 2.8.
6.09      The forecasts indicate that no change in tariffs would be required
to maintain JPEPB's satisfactory performance through the end of the decade.
This conclusion is, however, sensitive to changes in JPEPB's operating
11/ At historic cost. The concept of accounting for price-level changes is
not employed in the Chinese system, and, given the low level of cost
inflation, has not been introduced into the present forecasts.



- 27 -
costs. The forecasts are based on escalation in JPEPB's cash costs of 3Z per
annum (in the five years through 1983 unit costs of energy sales increased by
an average 2.5% per annum), and if domestic inflation were to increase, tariff
adjustments might need to be advanced. Of particular importance to the fore-
cast financial results is the price of coal, which currently represents 55% of
JPEPB's variable costs, rising to over 60% as the enhancement of JPEPB's
generating capacity increases the proportion of self-generated power in its
sales. The table below shows the order of magnitude of changes in the average
tariff that would be required to absorb the effect of changes that might be
made in the coal price:
Required increase
Coal price increase            in average tariff
(X)                           (.)
50                              20
100                              40
150                              60
6.10      Although no change is called for in the overall average power rate,
the rate for bulk power transfers withir. ECEPA is a special case that should
be closely monitored, since it is the price at which a substantial proportion
of the power transmitted through the project will be sold by JPEPB to SEPSB.
The rate currently in effect (4.0 fen per kWh exclusive of sales tax) was
designed on the basis of transmission at 220kV and may not be appropriate for
500 kV. At negotiacions, Government agreed that if the ECEPA bulk power price
prevailing at the time of project commissioning is insufficient to cover the
full cost (including generation) of power to be transmitted through the new
EHV line and substations, an appropriate adjustment will be made in the bulk
price (Section 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
D. Financial Covenants
6.11      In the past, when Government provided all the finance for approved
projects and JPEPB returned virtually all operating surplus to the State, its
financial condition was to a large extent the result of decisions taken exter-
nally and the enterprise had little need of a financial plan. However, now it
is assuming responsibility for servicing its own debt, JPEPB must begin to
adopt a systematic approach to planning its financial affairs. At present it
has no financial planning mechanism beyond its budget for the next following
financial year. JPEPB is conscious of the need to extend the planning
horizon, and Bank staff have worked with JPEPB personnel to explain the
approach and methodology empLoyed in financial planning, and have demonstrated
the use of appropriate computer software. At negotiations, JPEPB agreed that
by December 31 of each year, commencing December 31, 1985, it will prepare a
five-year financial plan rolLed forward each year (Section 4.05 of the draft
Project Agreement).



- 28 -
6.12      With the aid of such a plan JPEPB will be better equipped to
accommodate the present Pnd possible future changes in its financial systems
and accounting, and to initiate and monitor the measures necessary to maintain
a sound financial condition. At negotiations, JPEPB agreed to take all such
measures, including adjustments to electricity tariffs, as may be necessary to
maintain its gross revenue at a level sufficient to cover its full costs of
operation including depreciation, and to meet all its financial obligations
including debt service, taxes, allocations to special funds, distributions of
earnings and other cash outflows (Section 4.03 of the draft Project Agree-
ment). To further encourage prudent financial management, JPEPB also agreed
that it may incur additional debt if a reasonable forecast of its revenues and
expenditures indicates that internal cash generation would at least exceed the
projected debt service (Section 4.04 of the draft Project Agreement).
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Project Justification
7.01      East China is one of the most important industrial areas in China,
accounting for about 25X of total national production. Shortage of elec-
tricity generating capacity has been one of the major constraints to economic
development. Power curtailment by rotation has been in force to almost all
industries, which thus can be operated only 4 or 5 days a week, causing
considerable underutilization of plant facilities and manpower. The loss of
gross agricultural and industrial prodysuion is estimated by ECEPA at Y 5 for
every kWh of electricity not supplied.-
7.02      The dimensions of the power shortage in 1983 are indicated by the
following statistics:
Jiangsu      Shanghai
power         power
system        system
No. of blackouts (feeder-times)                            3,062           n.a.

12/ Net production value (after deducting inputs) is estimated at about
Y 1/kWh.



- 29 -
7.03      ECEPA's power development plan (1984-90) indicates that its genera-
tion program in the 1980s depends largely on the development of coal-fired
plants located at mine-mouth or near ports or load centers (para. 4.10). The
No. 1 and No. 2 thermal power stations at Xuzhou are the two important ones
with an installed capacity of 1,300 MW and 2,400 MW (ultimate development)
respectively. The existing 220 kV system is inadequate to transmit the large
bulk of power from Xuzhou to the load centers in Jiangsu province and the
metropolitan areas of Shanghai, and enhanced transmission facilities are
therefore necessary. The existing Tianjin-Nanjing railroad will be fully
loaded after the completion of the Jianbi thermal power station extension and
the new plants at Yangzhou and Taizhou, all of which are located at the
southern end of the Xuzhou-Jiangdu line.
7.04      The power flow to be transmitted by Xuzhou-Shanghai lines from
Xuzhou mine-mouth thermal power stations to the ECEPA pool is estimated as
follows:
Capacity               Energy
(MW)                 (GWh)
1986                      300                   800 with single circuit
1987                      500                 2,600         "
1988                      500                 2,660         "
1989                    1,000                 4,655 with 2 circuits in operation
1990                    1,000                 4,655         "
1991-92                 1,500                 6,650         "
1993                    1,500                 8,645         "
1994-95                 2,000                10,640
1996-2011               2,000                14,630
B. Least Cost Studies
7.05      A study was made by ECEPDI in 1982 regarding the selection of volt-
age level for the new transmission lines. The study demonstrates that the
optimum solution would be 2 circuits of 500 kV line, each capable of trans-
mitting 1,000 to 1,250 MW of capacity in the ultimate development. 220 kV
would be too low a voltage for a grid the size of East China, since it would
require about 5 lines to transmit the same block of power. 765 kV transm, 7-
sion is also unsuitable, since although only one line would be required,-
the four step-down substations which are required to provide en-route supplies
would be unjustifiably expensive at this voltage. Similar considerations
13/ Reliability of power supply with only one line is another problem.



- 30 -
apply to direct current transmission which, like 765 kV, is best suited to
point-to-point transmission only.
7.06      The study also indicated that 4 x 400 mm2 aluminum conductors steel
reinforced (ACSR) bundle conductors would be the most economical size and con-
figuration for the Xuzhou-Jiangdu line (capitalized power losses being taken
into consideration). The thermal ratings of the four conductor bundles of
these lines would meet the capacity requirement expected in 1995 under single
contingency conditions. It would also provide satisfactory performance in
terms of corona losses, radio inference voltage (RIV) and audible noise. The
conductor sizes for the Jiangdu-Nangiao line will be further optimized at the
detailed design stage.
C. Economic Rate of Return
7.07      Since it is difficult to separate the benefits of transmission lines
and substations from those of generation facilities, the analysis has been
made on the basis of a complete system comprising the Xuzhou thermal power
stations (2 units of 200 MW at Xuzhou No. 1 station and 4 units of 300 MW and
1 unit of 600 MW at Xuzhou No. 2 station) and No. 1 and No. 2 circuits of 500
kV transmission lines and substations. This system would be fully balanced
between generation and transmission capacity. Shadow pricing was applied.
Benefits were calculated using the revenue at the prevailing average tariff.
On this basis, the IERR is 14.0% (see Annex 19 for details).
7.08      The IERR was tested for sensitivity to changes in the capital and
fueL costs. If the project cost rises by 10%, the IERR would be 13.5Z; if the
fuel costs are 10Z above the assumed Level of Y 65 per ton of coal (using
long-run incremental cost of coal), the IERR would be 13.0%. These are
minimum measures of benefits because in using tariff revenue only for the
benefits, the consumer surplus is ignored; considering the valuation placed on
industrial production lost through power rationing (para. 7.01), this could be
considerable. As the IERR is above the opportunity cost of capital in China
(10%), the project is economically justified.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Agreements reached at negotiations were:
(a)  the Government agreed that, if the ECEPA bulk power price prevailing
at the time of project commissioning is insufficient to cover the
full cost (including generation) of power to be transmitted through
the project works, an appropriate adjustment will be made in the
bulk price (para. 6.10);
(b) JPEPB agreed that it:
(i) will submit to the Bank its audited financial statements
within 6 months of the end of each financial year
(para. 3.11);



- 31 -
(ii) will insure or make adequate provision for the insurance of
imported goods procured under the project (para. 3.15);
(Mi) will use of consultants to assist in design, procurement and
staff training (para. 5.06);
(iv) will carry out a training program satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 5.07);
(v) will comply with reporting requirements (para. 5.25);
(vi) will institute the preparation of a five-year financial
plan, rolled forward each year (para. 6.11);
(vii) will take all such measures, including adjustments of
tariffs, as may be necessary to maintain its gross revenue
at a level sufficient to cover it full costs of operation
including depreciation, and to meet all its financial
obligations including debt service, taxes, allocations to
special funds, distributions of earnings and other cash
outflows (para. 6.12);
(viii) may incur additional debt if a reasonable forecast of its
revenues and expenditures indicates that internal cash
generation would at least exceed the projected debt service
(para. 6.12).
8.02      Execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government
and JPEPB and approval of the Loan Agreement by the State Council would be
conditions of loan effectiveness (para 5.11).
8.03      Subject to agreement being reached on the above matters, the project
is suitable for a Bank loan of $117 million to the People's Republic of China,
for a term of 20 years including a 5-year grace period, at the standard
variable interest rate.

SECOND POWER PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Consultancy Services
The Project
1.        The project is located partly in Jiangsu province (about 570 km) and
partly in Metropolitan Shanghai (about 105 km). Its main objective is to
transmit bulk power from the mine-mouth thermal station at Xuzhou (4x125 MW in
operation and 4 x 200 MW under construction) to the power hungry areas of
Yangzhou, Nanjing, Wusi, Suzhou and Shanghai. It would be a singLe circuit
line in the initial stage. A second line will be added later on with the
completion of the Xuzhou No. 2 thermal power station (4 x 300 MW plus
2 x 600 MW).
2.        The proposed project will consist of:
(a)  provision and installation of a 500 kV transmission line from
Xuhzhou to Shanghai as follows:
Zuzhou-Jiangdu                        340 km
Jiangdu-Sunan                         115 km
Sunan-Huangdu                         115 km
iuangdu-Nanqiao (Shanghai)           110 km
River crossing                          3 km
Total                              683 km
(b) provision and installation of the following substations:
Transformer capacity       Voltages
(initial stage)
Xuzhou substation                2 X 500 MVA             220/500 kV
Jiangdu substation               i X 500 MVA             500/220 kV
Sunan subscation                1 X 500 MVA              500/220 kV
Huangdu substation (Shanghai)  1 X 750 MVA               500/220 kV
Nanqiao substation (Shanghai)  1 X 750 MVA               500/220 kV
(c)  consultancy services to assist in design, procurement, construction
and staff training.
(d)  establishment of one training center and equipping for two
electrical schools for 500 kV transmission lines and substations.
3.        The construction of the first section of the line from Xuzhou-
Jiangdu will start in late-1984 utilizing locally produced steel towers,
insulators and conductors. It is scheduled for completion by December 1986.

The Bank has been requested to assist in the financing of all the line
materials for the second section from Jiangdu-Sunan-Huangdu-Nanqiao (343 km)
and terminal equipment for the five substations.
4.        The project was appraised in March 1984 and is expected to be
approved by the Bank in early 1985. The proposed consultancy services will be
financed under the Technical Cooperation Credit for Project Preparation (Cr.
1412-CHA). The East China Electric Power Design Institute (ECEPDI) will be
the counterpart.
Scope of Services
5.        China already has three 500 KV transmission Lines totalling 1,594 km
in length under operation. Two others are under construction. As 500 kV will
be the back-bone transmission voLtage in China, many of such lines will be
built in the future. The Bank and MWREP agreed that the most modern tech-
nology be introduced to further optimize the design of 500 kV transmission
lines and substations, initially for the section from Jiangdu to Shanghai.
6.        The services to be provided by the consultant will include, but may
not be limited to, the foLlowing:
(a) review of design parameters;
(b) assist in making additional studies as may be required for Jiangdu-
Shanghai line and substation equipment and coordination thereof;
(c) assist in the preparation of tender documents and bid evaluation in
accordance with Bank's procurement guidelines for Jiangdu-Shanghai
Line and substation equipment and coordination thereof;
Cd) assist in optimization of tower design including selection of type,
initial design, tower spotting and line profile and final design
with the aid of computer;
(e) assist in optimization of substation design and coordination
thereof;
(f) on-the-job training of ECEPDI's staff in line and substation design;
(g) field training for tower spotting;
(h) field training in line construction; and
Ci) training of operation and maintenance staff for lines and
substationb, including live line technique.

Technology Transfer and Training
7.        Technology transfer and training are two of the main objectives of
the project. MWREP will send a group of experienced engineers (three for
transmissions lines and four for substations) to work together with consul-
tant's staff in consultant's home office. They will be provided with
on-the-job training to familiarize themselves with the computer programs used
in system studies and in tower and span design.

Income Statement
2.        Energy sales comprise sales to JPEPB's own customers plus bulk power
transfers to the ECEPA pool, and reflect JPEPB's generation/transmission con-
struction program. ECEPA forecasts load growth averaging 7.5% per annum for
the whole service area.
3.        Average revenue is assumed constant at the actual level for 1983.
4.        Fuel is assumed at the 1983 provincial average of Y 56/ton plus
inflation as in para. 1.
5.        Purchased power is at the present ECEPA pool rate of 4.6 fen/kwh.
6.        Sales tax is at 15Z of sales revenue, which approximates the current
tax basis of 6% of sales revenue plus Y 6 per 1,000 kwh generated.
7.        Depreciation is on the straight Line basis and projected at JPEPB's
-overall average rate of 4%.
8.        Income tax is at 55% of taxable profit (net income before tax less
[DC and retirement of loan debt).
9.        Retained earnings are projected on JPEPB's historical basis of 3.5%
of earnings (but see para. 6.07).

Economic Rate of Return
General
1.        The system considered incLudes two units of 200 MW at the Xuzhou
No. 1 thermal power station, four units of 300 MW and one unit of 600 4W at
the Xuzhou No. 2 thermal power station, two circuits of 500 KV transmission
lines and associated substations. This provides a package balanced becween
generation and transmission capabilities (about 1,100 MW per circuit) at full
capacity.
Costs
2.        All costs were based on end-1984 price levels.  Shadow pricing was
applied as follows: Ci) Taxes and duties were excluded; (ii) official
exchange rates were used to convert foreign currencies to Renminbi;
(iii) border prices were used for traded goods such as cement, steel, and
timber; and (iv) all labor costs were first adjusted to reflect the economic
cost to the country; a conversion factor of 0.5 was applied to unskilled
labor. No conversion is necessary for skilled labor. The long-run incremen-
taL cost of coal (including inland transportation) is estimated at Y 65/ton
which is used in economic analysis.
Benefits
3.        Quantifying the benefits of power projects is difficult in all
countries and particuLarly so in China, where tariffs and most other prices
are not subject to economic pressures and where mosc power is administratively
allocated. It is accepted by all, however, that shortages of electricity are
currently constraining China's industrial production (causing under-capacity
operation) and will continue to do so in the near future. This suggests that
the economic benefits of increased power supply will be substantial - average
net agricultural and industrial output per kWh of electricity consumed is
about Y 1.0 in Jiangsu/Shanghai area. The benefits to the package were calcu-
lated on the basis of the prevailing average power tariffs (7.39 fen per kWh)
as the minimum value of economic benefits.
Economic Rate of Return
4.        The economic rate of return (IERR) of the project is the discount
rate which equalizes the present value of the economic costs and benefits.
The IERR taking into consideration variations in capital costs and coal prices
is as follows:

Cost of Electricity
5.        The average long-run cost of electricity at the retail level as well
as at the bulk suppLy level was calculated. It was made on economic basis
with shadow pricing.  The results of the study are summarized as follows:

/a   Discounted at a rate of 10%.
lb   Since ECPS is a system predominantly depended on thermal power
generation, the above average long-run cost of electricity should be very
close to the long run marginal cost of supply. Due adjustment, however,
has to be made for reserve margin and other contingencies in system
operation.
Ic   Y 361 million will be deducted from the capital cost for distribution
works.
