REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
KLAIPEDA PORT PROJECT
1. COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND MACROECONOMIC BACKGROUND
1.1      Country Profile. Lithuania, with a population of 3.7 million people and a territory of 65,200
square miles, is the largest and southernmost of the Baltic countries. It lies on the eastern shore of the
Baltic Sea and borders on Latvia in the north, Belarus in the East, and Poland and Russia's Kaliningrad
region in the south. As such it is located at a cross-road between Russia and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), Central Europe, and Western Europe. Its terrain is relatively flat, with forests
covering 30 percent of the territory.
1.2      Fifty years of central planning and integration with the countries of the Former Soviet Union
(FSU) resulted in a rapid industrialization. While Lithuania does not have abundant natural resources, it
has inherited a highly skilled workforce and relatively well-developed infrastructure.
1.3      Recent Economic and Social Developments. Since its independence in March 1990, when
an unfavorable economic environment with declining output and deteriorating terms of trade imposed
significant hardships on the population, market-oriented reform efforts have remained consistently in
place, despite differences in emphasis on specific issues. This has resulted in macroeconomic
stabilization and transition towards a market economy. The consolidated fiscal deficit fell from 4.4% of
GDP in 1996 to 1.7% in 1997 while the currency board-backed exchange rate has remained fixed to the
US dollar since 1994. In 1997, accelerated privatization supported record high levels of foreign direct
investments, while most other structural reforms proceeded apace. The GDP growth rate rose from 3.3%
in 1995 to a high 7.3% in the first half of 1998, while the rate of CPI inflation fell to 2.4% in 1998, one
of the lowest rates among economies in transition.
1.4      Lithuania has adopted policies such as monetary and budgetary discipline, currency reform,
decreasing energy subsidies, privatization, social assistance reform and restructuring of the financial
sector. The benefits have become visible. Beyond the progress made against inflation, Gross Domestic
Product per capita has grown from US$1,138 in 1994 to an estimated US$2,832 per capital in 1998.
While longer-term fundamentals remain sound, Lithuania's short-term prospects were fundamentally
altered by the crisis in Russia in 1998. GDP growth fell to 4.7% for 1998 as a whole, and growth is
estimated at 0% for 1999. Fiscal outcomes deteriorated, with the consolidated fiscal deficit rebounding to
5.9% of GDP for 1998, and around 8% for 1999.
1.5      The current fiscal deficit reflects a combination of slower revenue growth, and policy
responses aimed at easing the shock to enterprises. Another significant element of the current situation is
the emergence of quasi-fiscal deficits accumulated in earlier years, such as the Savings Restitution Plan
aimed at compensating depositors for inflation losses during the difficult years immediately after the re-
establishment of independence. Finally, the recent privatization of an oil refinery has proven costly to the
budget. Political difficulties have intensified side by side with the economic problems. The Prime
Minister for Lithuania's third governing coalition (since independence) resigned in May 1998. The
successor coalition proved short-lived and a new Prime Minister was appointed in November, 1999.

1.6     Indicators of social conditions have evolved favorably in recent years. Life expectancy at birth
began rising in 1995, and reached pre-reform levels for men and exceeded those for women, by 1997.
Data from 1997, suggest that official employment increased for the first time since 1990, and the
numbers of economically inactive and unemployed fell. About one sixth of the population fell under the
poverty line (defined as 50% of average expenditures). The incidence of poverty is highest in households
where the breadwinner is under 30 or over 60, families with small children and/or headed by a woman,
and families with unemployed members. The crisis in Russia will have an adverse impact on progress on
social and economic conditions, and inevitably slow down poverty reduction. This impact will have to be
monitored and policies and programs adjusted accordingly.
1.7      External Trade. In 1997, the country's exports and imports were equally shared by the
European Union, and FSU and CEEC. Main trading partners were in order of importance Russia,
Germany, United Kingdom and Ukraine. Main exports consisted of foodstuffs and agricultural products,
textiles, chemical and fuels. Main imports consisted of machinery, oil and manufactured goods. The
crisis in Russia exposed Lithuania's dependence on its external environment, given its small size, limited
natural resource base and high trade intensity. External trade had increased from USD1.3 billion in 1992
and peaked at USD10 billion in 1998, with Russia being the main trading partner, although trade with the
EU has become greater. Looking ahead, diversification of trade and production, continued integration
with the EU, with minimization of both likelihood and impact of external trade shocks, will remain
important.
1.8      Economic Prospects. Continued stabilization efforts to reduce the main sources of fiscal
deficits, and further structural reforms to sustain and accelerate economic growth, form the core of a
reform program supported by a Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL Report No. P-6986-LT) under
implementation. Successful implementation of the key measures under this program would set the stage
for expected GDP growth of 4 percent p.a. over the next five years. The main remaining challenge for
Lithuania is its growing current account deficit.
1.9      The relative importance of trade with the Western Europe has increased. Simultaneously,
exports of services to Russia are still important as transit traffic has held steady or grown in the aftermath
of the crisis, with the exception of transit of oil products. The biggest impact on transit trade has been
that of the anti-dumping tariffs imposed on steel products which have reduced by almost 30% this transit
services item (Section l.E).
1.10      In summary, the effect of the crisis in Russia has been to slow down growth and accelerate
the integration with Europe. Lithuania's small size, limited resource endowment, high trade intensity,
and significant short/medium term financing requirements for energy imports and investments, lead to
economic prospects which are dependent on its external environment, ie., its trade relation with EU and
Russia; the pace of its integration within the European Union (EU); and avoidance of possible trade
shocks.
B. BANK'S EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGY
1.11      Bank's Experience in Lithuania. The first Bank lending operation with Lithuania since it
joined the World Bank in 1991 was a 1992 Rehabilitation Loan for US$60 million equivalent to finance
imports of materials, spare parts and equipment to assist Lithuania in implementing the first economic
reform steps. Loan processing and implementation proceeded expeditiously, and the loan proceeds were
fully utilized. This was followed by a US$80 million SAL in 1996 to help government solve problems
related to deficits in the key sectors of the economy. In addition, nine investment projects in various
sectors have been approved. Most of them are still relatively new and will be implemented over the next

few years. They are a US$ 26.4 million Power Rehabilitation Loan, a US$7.0 million Klaipeda
Environment Loan, a US$ 25 million Enterprise and Financial Sector Loan, a US$6.2 million Siauliai
Environmental Loan, a US$30.0 million Private Agriculture Development Loan, a US$5.9 million
Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Loan, a US$19.0 million Highway Project Loan, a US$10.0 million
Energy Efficiency/Housing Loan, a US$3.7 million Social Protection Loan, and a US$30   million
Municipal Development Loan.
1.12     Bank's Strategy for Lithuania. The latest Country Assistance Strategy for Lithuania (Report
No 19135-LT, April 19, 1999) identifies three key areas of support. First, programs to improve
macroeconomic and financial stability, including the analysis and monitoring of macro-financial
vulnerabilities, strengthening the financial sector and development of a structural reform program for
sustainable growth and EU accession. Secondly, support to reforms and investments needed for EU
accession; and thirdly, support to reforms and institution building in health, education and social
assistance, including pension reform.
1.13      The support to EU accession includes four sub-areas; (i) enhancing competitiveness with
support of private investments and private sector led growth; (ii) developing the rural economy; (iii)
strengthening local and public administration, and (iv) improving infrastructure and environmental
management. The proposed project has links to the first and fourth sub-areas, as investments for
upgrading infrastructure and the environment are identified as key components
1.14    Bank's Experience in Port Projects. The Klaipeda Port Project would be the first Bank port
project for Lithuania, although the Bank has developed a substantial experience in the Port sector.
Lessons and Practices # 9 from OED (June 1996) identified the following issues in the Port Sector: (i)
choice of institutional structure (with a preference for landlord2 port as the most efficient structure) and
institutional strengthening; (ii) economic pricing of infrastructure (ship dues versus cargo dues); (iii)
licensing conditions of private operators; (iv) consultation with port users for monopolistic port services;
(v) adoption of new technologies; (vi) private sector involvement; (vii) improvement and preservation of
the environment.
1.15    Among 35 port projects reviewed by OED, only five have had a substantial impact on
institutional development. Several criteria for success in the preparation of port projects have been
highlighted by OED: (i) precipitate preparations often lead to project failure; (ii) monitoring indicators
are required to assess the benefits accrued and the beneficiaries; (iii) good engineering (geo-technical
analysis); (iv) good analysis at appraisal of port data leading to traffic projections; and (v) thorough
knowledge of port operations. Experience has shown that most port projects took longer to implement but
cost less than scheduled. Strong borrower commitment, an appropriate project implementation unit, some
technical assistance on procurement issues and a good follow up of civil works problems are essential to
ensure the success of project implementation.
2 In landlord ports, port authorities limit their role to building and owning infrastructure, leaving superstructure,
pilotage, cargo operations and towage to be conducted by private operators, usually in competition.

C. OVERVIEW OF THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
1.16     Due to its geographic location, the transport sector, particularly freight transit, plays a key
role in the economy of the country. Freight shipments between Russia and the CIS, and the West, are the
core of the transit industry in Lithuania. Lithuania has only one major seaport, the Port of Klaipeda,
which is the hub of the transport transit industry.
1.17      Lithuania provides transit services in movement of freight along three main corridors:
*    East-West (major): to/from Russia and other CIS countries, via Belarus through Vilnius and
Kaunas to the Port of Klaipeda, and from there to Scandinavia and Western Europe;
*    North-South: to/from Finland, via Estonia and Latvia, through Kaunas and Sastokai, to
Poland, Germnany and Central Europe. The road element of this component is known as Via
Baltica; and
*    East-West (minor): to/from Russia and other CIS countries, through Kaunas, to Kaliningrad.
1.18      Transport System. Lithuania inherited from the FSU an adequate transport system in all
five modes - road, railways, maritime, aviation, and urban transport. However, location and size of the
investments made often have ignored financial and economic aspects. Since independence, transport
infrastructure has not been appropriately maintained or rehabilitated due to lack of resources, which has
resulted in transport cost increases. Reorganization of industry, the collapse of FSU structures and
liberalization of energy prices have eliminated uneconomic movements, leading to a complete
transformation of trade and transport needs in the region. This caused initially a drop in traffic of at least
fifty percent compared to pre-independence levels.
1.19      Road. Lithuania has a good road infrastructure. The total road network is about 45,000 km.
The roads owned and maintained by the Government includes 21,109 km of main roads, 10,493 km of
which are paved. These national roads are divided in three categories: (i) highways (1,444 km); (ii)
regional roads (3,408 km); and district roads (16,257 km). 376 km of European standard motorways serve
the highest density routes (Vilnius-Kaunas-Klaipeda, and Vilnius-Panevezys).
1.20      Under the Government's stringent stabilization program aimed at reducing inflation, the
Lithuanian Road Administration (LRA) 1994 budget was reduced in real terms to less than one-fourth of
the 1988 level. Under these conditions, LRA had to cut back on its pavement maintenance operations
leading to deterioration of physical infrastructure. Since then, the road sector financing situation has
significantly improved with the creation of a road fund and the provision of loans by international Banks,
including IBRD. These resources have enabled LRA to address maintenance needs and partially address
the maintenance backlog.
1.21      Railways. The Lithuanian rail network consists of 2,042 route-km, of which 557 route-km
are double tracked. An estimated 850 km of track is in need of repairs and maintenance but equipment
available for track repair is insufficient. The combination of dirty ballast and cessation of track renewal
and maintenance, due to shortage of steel track components from Russia, are expected to lead to serious
track deterioration. The rolling stock is from the FSU, fairly old, and lacking spare parts. These
difficulties are not likely to become a bottleneck in the near future, given the existing spare capacity of
the railway.
1.22      The Lithuanian Railways (LR) is a state company, built from the Lithuanian section of the
Baltic Railways, one of the 32 railways administered by the former Soviet Ministry of Railways.
Although independent since 1991, the railways continue to operate according to the FSU guidelines.

1.23      Aviation. For a small country, Lithuania has an oversupply of airports. It inherited from the
FSU four large airports: (i) Vilnius; (ii) Kaunas; (iii) Siaulai; and (iv) Arigola, plus many smaller ones,
which were designed largely for military purposes.
1.24      Urban Transport. In Vilnius and Kaunas, buses and trolley-buses are the main modes of
urban transport. There are no trans and no immediate plans for a light-rail. The responsibility for
provision and operation of urban transport was transferred from the central government to the local
governments. These lack the means and resources to finance these systems, and have been slow in
instituting cost-recovery systems.
1.25      Institutions. The general transport policy is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport
(MOT). Transit industry in Lithuania is dominated by shipment of freight cargo between the East and the
West. The transport and transit industry is an attractive activity for the private sector (private supply and
demand, identifiable producers and beneficiaries and allocation of costs and benefits). However, because
of the perceived strategic importance of transport enterprises, the Government of Lithuania decided to
keep key companies as semi-public enterprises, most notably Lithuanian Railways and the Klaipeda State
Seaport Authority. Within this context privatization in the sector has been significant, in logistic services
road transport and port operations.
D. THE PORT OF KLAIPEDA
1.26      Physical Characteristics. The Port of Klaipeda is located along the east bank of the river
connecting the Kursiu Lagoon with the Baltic Sea. The port offers a maximum draft of 10.5 m. It has a
land area of 393 ha, of which about 157 are used for cargo handling; and 12 km of quays, of which 4 are
used for port operations. Breakwaters are in critical condition despite maintenance and require immediate
rehabilitation to avoid being breached in a storm. A major breach would force cessation of port
operations for a significant time and the adverse conditions may result in risk of spillage in the
environmentally sensitive Kursiu Lagoon area. The existing breakwaters are not adequate to protect the
port from waves, and under adverse weather conditions port access is denied for more than 40 days per
year, as port safety regulations are enforced.
1.27      Klaipeda Port Competitiveness. All three Baltic Republics in addition to Russia itself are
natural competitors for East-West cargo shipment; however the Port of Klaipeda has several advantages.
The Port of Klaipeda is year round ice free while Riga, Tallinn and St Petersburg ports need icebreakers
to guarantee access during winter. Compared to other Baltic ports, the Port of Klaipeda has the best
hinterland road with a four lane European standard motorway to Vilnius and rail connection to the East
and Moscow. Even though most Baltic ports operate below capacity, including those having specialized
modern facilities, the Port of Klaipeda has demonstrated its competitiveness by having a 16 percent
increase in traffic in 1996 followed by an 8 percent increase in 1997. A survey of logistic costs3 in the
region indicated that logistic costs in Lithuania were the lowest in the region. Transport through Klaipeda
also offers a faster route to Russia from the West than land transport through Poland, since it avoids the
rail transshipment before entering into Poland and bottlenecks at border crossings. Despite this favorable
competitive position, the port needs to improve its current infrastructure to remain competitive in the
future. Competition among Baltic ports is discussed in Annex 13.

different sectors.

1.28      Klaipeda State Seaport Authority (KSSA). KSSA, created in 1992, has a staff of 338. It
owns land and water areas of the port of Klaipeda, and is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Transport. KSSA is responsible for the maintenance and repairs of the port infrastructure, for navigation
within the port and its approaches, and for the development of the port but has no responsibility in port
commercial operations (cargo handling or storing). The transfer of the port infrastructure assets to KSSA
was completed in January 1996. KSSA collects harbor dues for cargo and ships and leases the land area
of the port to independent operators, public or private (stevedoring companies, ship building and ship
repairs companies). Land leasing rates currently applied are below cost recovery levels and do not reflect
the opportunity cost of scarce available space. KSSA is also responsible for marine environmental
protection.
1.29      Facilities and Operators. The main port operators and the privatization progress are
described in Annex 10. On June 6, 1997, the Lithuanian Government announced the privatization of the
three largest enterprises of the port of Klaipeda, namely the freight cargo company Klasco, the cargo
terminal Smelte and Lithuanian Merchant Marine's LISCO. Until recently, most of them were partly
state-owned joint-stock companies, although the oil Terminal is still operated by the Ministry of Energy.
The privatization has strengthened port competitiveness as a result of the choices open to port users
(Annex 10). In addition to intra-port competition among terminal operators providing comparable
services, there is also significant inter-port competition, which encourages operational efficiency and cost
reductions.
1.30      Free Economic Zone. A free economic zone has been created in Klaipeda by a joint- stock
company, the Klaipeda Development Group. The group consists of Klaipeda city, fourteen major
companies based in the city and the American Baltic Fund. The entity is independent from the port. It
covers 205 ha of land. A management company will be selected competitively for the use of the land, and
will be offered a 49-year lease and 51 percent of the capital shares. The Lithuanian MOT has also drafted
a new free port concept for KSSA that would give the status of free-trade zone or duty-free warehouses
to sections of the port.
1.31      Freight-Forwarding Agents. There are over twenty freight-forwarding shipping agents
operating in Klaipeda in a competitive environment, some of them are local offices of foreign freight
forwarders, and shipping lines serving the port. Some freight-forwarding agents provide warehousing
distribution and custom clearance services.
E. TRAFFIC
1.32      Historical Traffic. Traffic at the Port of Klaipeda, shown in Annex 6, started to decline even
prior to independence. In 1999, 15 MT of cargo were handled compared to 14.7 MT in 1994 and 20 MT
in 1988 and 1989. Most of the decline is due to the breakdown of the trade channels of the FSU. Figures
for 1999 are based on the trends observed up to and including December 1999.
1.33      Main Cargo Flows. The main goods transiting through the Port of Klaipeda are metal, oil
products, chemical and fertilizers. Klaipeda has developed a number of specialized terminals in recent
years. These include the rehabilitated petroleum terminal, the deepwater steel berths, the expansion of the
international ferry terminal and the dedicated container terminal. Plans are now underway for the
construction of several fertilizer terminals and a grain terminal. These facilities combined with the deeper
draft provided under this project will substantially improve the competitive position of the port for both
domestic and transit cargoes.

1.34       The vessels serving the bulk trades are primarily chartered tankers, bulk carriers and special-
purpose vessels. Their size is determined by the size of typical consignments. Most of the petroleum
products are transported as tanker loads of Heavy fuel oil (HFO) and diesel. The typical tankers are
25,000 Dwt and load an average of 24,000 tons. Fertilizer is transported in bulk in both single product
and mixed product loads. These vessels average 10,000 Dwt and load an average of 7,500 tons. Metals
are transported as multiple consignments in general cargo ships many of which are dedicated to this
trade. The vessels average about 5000 Dwt and frequently take on a full load. RoRo traffic is transported
in ferries, which carry an average of 100 units. Some are designed to carry rail wagons. Containers are
transported in small feeder vessels with capacities of 250-350 TEU. These make multiple calls and
transfer around 100 boxes at Klaipeda.
1.35       Traffic Forecasts. Traffic forecasts in this report are based on estimates prepared in January
2000, on the basis of traffic figures up to December 1999. Assembling a reliable regional equilibrium
model to determine traffic for the port of Klaipeda does not seem feasible given the high degree of
uncertainty in the FSU and the Baltic region. Traffic is expected to grow as Lithuania's economy
continue to recover and as economic conditions stabilize in Russia and the CIS (Annex 6), due to the
logistical advantages of shipping through Klaipeda (Annex 13).
1.36       A forecast of individual cargoes has been prepared for the next 10 years. Longer termn
projections other than a continuation of trends from the previous years was not feasible given the level of
uncertainty, especially for the transit trades. A basic forecast was prepared as shown in Table 5 of Annex
6. This was bounded by high and low forecasts, which are presented in Tables 6 and 7 of Annex 6. The

1.37      Total traffic is expected to reach 22 million tons, the level of 1989, by 2002, and reach 38
million tons, close to the historical high traffic mark for Klaipeda by 2010.
1.38      Future Developments. In 1994, a Litas 250 million Development program was defined. This
plan was revised, and in 1999, it was increased to Litas 900 million (Annex 1 1). It includes: (i)
rehabilitating the port entrance which cannot be used in adverse weather conditions; (ii) addressing the
lack of proper container handling facility in Klaipeda; (iii) providing access for bigger bulk carriers and
improved loading equipment; (iv) constructing a passenger terminal since the number of passengers is
increasing in Klaipeda, and at present the ferries are moored at the International Sea Ferry Terminal; (v)
deepening channel and berths beyond the three deepwater berths, which are congested; (vi) reconfiguring
port/rail interface; (vii) providing vessels for sea rescue and environmental protection; and (viii) dredging
the channel to accommodate larger ships. The plan as scheduled by KSSA would not be financially
viable should traffic projections be below expectations (par. 3.10). Revisions to the schedule and
borrowing program proposed by KSSA, reflecting financial constraints would have to be introduced.
This need to ensure financial sustainability is reflected in project conditionality (par. 5.1 (e)).

2. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND FORMULATION
2.1       The World Bank's involvement in the transport sector in Lithuania started with the
preparation of a highway rehabilitation project. It was received Board approval in September 1996. The
Government had expressed interest in a project to improve the channel entrance in the Port of Klaipeda
as early as 1994. The project was prepared by the Lithuanian Ministry of Transport (MOT), the Klaipeda
State Seaport Authority (KSSA), and supported by a Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD)
grant from the Government of Japan and Grants from the Government of The Netherlands. Project
components were identified on the basis of investment priorities, and feasibility studies prepared by
KSSA with the assistance of consultants and the World Bank.
2.2       Link to Country Assistance Strategy. The project defined in Part C of this chapter is fully
consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy described in Chapter 1 Part B. The project would include
maintenance and development of physical infrastructure and a significant improvement in environmental
protection. The project would also increase efficiency in key economic sectors by offering cheaper and
more efficient access to markets.
2.3       Lessons from Experience. The Bank's experience in the Port sector (see Chapter 1-Part B)
has been taken into account in the design of the project from institutional strengthening to preparation
and supervision. Institutional strengthening has been a major focus, although KSSA is not directly
involved in port operations. The technical assistance on leasing and privatization/contracting-out of port
services, is expected to support KSSA in its evolution into an efficient and commercially managed
landlord port. Klaipeda project preparation started three years ago by testing various construction
altematives and was completed with a thorough engineering study of the selected solution, including ship
simulations by port pilots under the modified port entrance conditions.
2.4       Significant expert assistance was provided by port and shipping specialists in the course of
preparation. A set of indicators will be used to measure the actual port performance improvement. Project
implementation and supervision functions have been established, consultants have assisted and trained
the project implementation unit already in place to handle procurement issues, ensuring a proper
execution of civil works, and setting up necessary financial management and accounting systems. A
special focus on environmental protection aspects of the project has been central to the project
preparation effort.
B. PROJECT RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES
2.5       The Port of Klaipeda has demonstrated its competitiveness in the Baltic Sea and its
capability to attract significant transit traffic towards the West, and Russia and Belarus. This position
would be threatened under current port conditions as competitors develop their port infrastructure. The
traffic transiting through the Port of Klaipeda increased by 20 percent in 1996, despite the significant
level of competition in the Baltic Sea, and remained relatively stable during the Russian crisis of 1998.
The Port of K]aipeda has several competitive advantages that explain this success (par. 1.24, Annex 13).
2.6       Existing breakwaters are in poor condition and likely to be breached in a storm if no
rehabilitation is carried out. Such an event would force cessation of port operations for a significant time
and make the port lose its competitive edge. Port competitiveness is also affected by the current design of
the port entrance, which does not allow safe in/out maneuvers and cargo handling under adverse weather
conditions (usually more than 40 days per year). Reconstruction of the port entrance and breakwaters



10
would mitigate this problem and alleviate the significant risk of spills in the environmentally sensitive
Kursiu Lagoon area.
2.7       The project main objective is to strengthen the long term competitiveness of the Port of
Klaipeda in the Baltic Region. The project second objective is to improve environmental conditions by
preventing spills, improving waste reception facilities, and providing necessary disposal facilities and
continuous monitoring of environmental conditions at the port.
C. PROJECT COMPONENTS AND DESCRIPTION
2.8       The project has two main components: (i) investments in civil works, and (ii) technical
assistance. Their description is as follows; all prices are expressed in 2000 US$, and include physical and
price contingencies and VAT (18 percent).
Investment Component
2.9       The investment component of the project (US$51.6 million) would include:
*    Rehabilitation of the Existing Breakwaters (US$5.4 million). The existing channel entrance
to the port is protected by two breakwaters. The northern breakwater is about 190 m long, and
the southern breakwater is about 880 m long. These breakwaters were built in the 19th century,
and in spite of regular maintenance, require major rehabilitation. Detailed field investigations
have been carried out to determine the exact nature of the rehabilitation needed.
*     North and South Breakwater Extension (US$16.4 million). With the present configuration
of the breakwaters, the Oil Terminal (Naftos Terminalas) and the forrner State Commercial Port
operator (KLASCO) are exposed to the north-western and western waves, with insignificant
reduction in wave action inside the port. This results in considerable loss in berth utilization
from down time in cargo-handling operations. In bad weather conditions, excessive penetration
of waves into the port, from the north-west and the west, complicates ship maneuvers in and out
of the port. Due to these disturbances, the port is currently losing on average over 40 days per
year of operations (see Table IV-1). An extension by 240 m of the northern breakwater and by
275 m of the southern breakwater would address this problem. The extension would also reduce
the distance between the two breakwater heads, thus limiting the wave energy entering the port,
and effectively reducing wave disturbance in the port. Breakwaters would be of rubble mound
construction, protected by artificial armor blocks.
*     Dredging of the Channel Entrance (US$19.0 million). The reconfigured channel entrance
would allow bigger ships to use the port, and improve safety during in/out maneuvers. The
existing channel entrance has a limited capacity - it is only 100 m wide and 11.4 m deep. Even
under normal weather conditions, the maximum size of ships that may be admitted to the Oil
Terminal cannot exceed 28,000 DWT. The channel passes very close to the Oil Terminal,
which requires specific ship maneuvers to avoid hitting the oil berths. To improve this situation,
the channel would be widened to 120 m and deepened to 14 m allowing ships of up to 60,000
DWT, to enter the port, and realigned away from the Oil Terminal. The extensions of both
northern and southern breakwaters would provide additional protection of the channel.
Dredging and disposal of dredged materials methods would follow the provisions of the
London Dumping Convention and international agreements for protection of the Baltic Sea
(Helsinki, 1992, and Gdansk, 1993).
*     Improvements in Mooring/Fenders Systems (US$2.0 million). In the port of Klaipeda, ships
at berth are exposed to longitudinal motions induced by specific wave spectra. This phenomena



11
causes occasionally mooring lines to break, endangering both ships and berths, and forcing
ships to leave the berths without delay, resulting in loss of time in cargo-handling operations.
To resolve this situation, specifically designed mooring/fenders would be installed. It would
mainly consist of pneumatic fenders, combined with steel mooring lines with nylon tails. This
system of mooring/fenders would be installed at Naftos Terminalas' and KLASCO's berths.
*    Wave/Current Monitoring System (US$1.0 million). Wave/current recorders would be
installed at the entrance of the port to assist pilots. On-line data would provide necessary
information to pilots to make rational decisions during maneuvers and to extend the navigation
period under adverse weather conditions without exposing the ships to unwarranted risks.
Safety of in-and-out maneuvers would be increased significantly as those tools become
available to the pilots.
*     Port/Ship Discharge Service Equipment (US$1.8 million). The dumping of ship wastes in
the Klaipeda port or in its environmentally sensitive approaches is not systematically
monitored. Any such pollution would be critical for the fish that hatches in the Kursiu Lagoon
and migrations from and to the Baltic. Preventive and mitigation measures are needed to control
the situation. These measures would consist of establishing a permanent pollution monitoring
unit at KSSA which would be equipped with booms, boats, skimmers, and waste reception
facility. A study would be carried out to determine the steps required to achieve protection of
the marine environment against illegal or accidental spills, and to finance necessary equipment
and training. This study would take into account the survey carried out by the International
Maritime Organization (IMO) in 1995 that identified the basic rehabilitation needs of port
reception and treatment facilities in the Baltic Sea, and the IMO Comprehensive Manual on
Port Reception Facilities. The Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) may
consider to finance this part of the project.
*     Environmental Mitigation Measures (US$6.1 million). Mitigation measures would limit
environmental impacts of the proposed project as well as those derived from the
development program of the Port. Under this component a site for depositing contaminated
dredged materials would be selected and a Confined Disposal Facility (CDF) built for
contaminated dredged material from the future deepening of the Port. A program of remedial
and monitoring measures has been identified and described in Annex 9.
Technical Assistance Component
2.10      The technical assistance component of the project (US$4.9 million) would include:
*     Contract/Lease Management (US$0.2 million). The existing land lease rates do not reflect
the opportunity cost of land and do not cover their share of investments in port infrastructure.
A study would estimate the appropriate level of land lease rates to avoid cross subsidies
between harbor dues and land lease. These new land lease rates would enable an efficient use
of land available around Klaipeda Port. The study would also review leasing contracts
management including bidding procedures and seek improvements towards a more
transparent, fair and economically efficient management.
*    Training of the Port Pilots (US$0.5 million). Changes in channel entrance would affect in-
and-out maneuvers. This requires training of port pilots to perform under the new navigation
conditions on a simulation model. Pilots would acquire the know-how necessary for a safer and
more skillful navigation of ships, especially under adverse weather conditions, thus reducing
ship waiting time.



12
*     PrivatizationlContracting out of Port Services and Port Management Strengthening
(US$1.0 million). Various port services provided by KSSA such as piloting, infrastructure
maintenance, or environment protection would benefit from being privatized or contracted out.
This technical services contract would include: (i) the preparation of a port privatization
seminar and determination of port services that could be privatized or contracted out, (ii) the
preparation of tender documents inviting bids for privatization; (ii) assistance to evaluate the
bids and negotiate the contracts; (iii) services as needed to improve the international
competitiveness of the port of Klaipeda. It would help KSSA to further dissociate itself from
port services and assume a landlord status while retaining regulatory and control functions over
the private sector operators. The study would also cover steps necessary to the potential
privatization of KSSA at a later stage.
*     Project Supervision, Environmental Mitigation and Procurement Assistance (US$1.9
million). Implementation of the environmental mitigation program, supervision of construction
and civil works under the project, and review of regulations and penalties related to fisheries
protection at marine construction sites, will be carried out by qualified consultants. They would
be expected to: be on site by August 2000, and remain on site until the closure of the works
contracts, expected to be in June 2003.
*     Project Implementation Unit. This item would include the financing of advisors and some of
the operating costs of the Project Implementation Unit (US$200,000).
*     Design of a Confined Disposal Facility (CDF) and Monitoring Program (US$0.9 million).
It would cover the site selection and the detailed engineering design for a CDF.
*     Financial Audits (US$0.1 million). Financial audit of KSSA and project accounts to be
conducted annually for FY 2000 through 2003.
D. COST ESTIMATES
2.11      The total estimated cost of the project is US$56.9 million, including taxes and duties (US$8.7
million) and physical and price contingencies (US$6.6 million). The foreign exchange component is
US$38.6 million, or about 68 percent of the total costs. Costs estimates date from January 2000 and include
physical contingencies of US$4.5 million, i.e., 10 percent of base costs for civil works and equipment. Price
contingencies amounting to US$2.1 million were estimated based on forecast of inflation in dollar for
foreign goods and services of 1.9 percent annually for foreign costs and 2.5 percent in dollars for local costs.
The recent appreciation of the Lita following the initial overshot after the devaluation of 1992, would be
expected to continue during project implementation. The estimated cost of the project is summarized in the
table next page (Table 11-1).
2.12      Several configurations for the channel entrance were studied during the feasibility studies and it
was concluded that the most appropriate alternative was a bent channel and rubble mound breakwaters. The
alternatives considered included: (i) a straight channel with extended breakwaters and higher dredging costs;
(ii) a bent channel with a longer extension of the breakwaters and a bigger opening to the sea; and (iii) a
bent channel with a reduced opening, which resulted in shorter breakwaters, lower construction costs and
dredging totals. The third altemative was selected, fed into a ship simulator, and actually tested and found
satisfactory by KSSA pilots before being retained. After this test the detailed engineering work took place,
including physical modeling of breakwater designs to refine specifications.



13
2.13       Project cost estimates are based on detailed engineering estimates, under water investigations
and a thorough review of the current condition of the breakwaters. Invitation to tenders on the investment
components is expected on or about the time of Board Presentation.

E. Financing
2.14.      The Bank would finance US$35.4 million, or 62 percent of total project costs, which would
cover all of the foreign exchange costs of the investment component. KSSA would finance US$12.9 million
of project costs and US$8.7 million of reimbursable VAT. The KSSA will undertake to obtain grant
financing for about US$ 10 million.
2.15.      The Government of the Netherlands has indicated an interest in financing works, goods and
technical services for environmental protection, including the control of dumping of ship wastes in the port



14
and its approaches. For the technical assistance components of the project, a Dutch Government Grant
would also be sought. Other bilateral donors may also be invited to participate by the Lithuanian
Government. Unless grant finance is secured, availability of counterpart funds conditions disbursements for
works contracts under the project (par. 5.1 (c); par. 5.4 (a))

F. IMPLEMENTATION
2.16      Project implementation would be the responsibility of KSSA, through  its Project
Implementation Unit (PIU). The PIU is staffed by full time local experts assisted by consultants. Staffing of
the PIU was confirmed at negotiations (par. 5.1. (h)). Implementation of procurement and financial
arrangements acceptable to the Bank at the PIU, a condition for Board Presentation (par. 5.2. (a)), are in
place. The PIU will be responsible for on-time implementation of project components, and will send
quarterly progress reports and semi annual financial reports to the Bank (Annex 3). The formats of the
reports have been agreed upon by the Bank and KSSA. Procurement documents for Civil Works and
Works Supervision have been completed and are under review at the Bank. Consultants have assisted
KSSA in the preparation of bid documents, pre-qualification of contractors and bid evaluation
2.17      The project would finance technical assistance for procurement and management support to
the PIU as necessary. Operating costs of the PIU, including PIU and KSSA annual financial audits,
would be financed partially from the loan proceeds, on a declining scale, i.e., 100% the first year, 75%
the second year, and 50% the third year. It is expected and understood that the capacity developed at the
PIU would then be continued for the implementation of the investment program of KSSA.
2.18      A financial management assessment of the KSSA and of the PIU in relation to the anticipated
LACI disbursement system has been carried out. A procurement assessment has also been conducted. The
project is expected to start in May/June, 2000, and to be completed by March 2003. Minimal delays in
implementation are expected as major contracts would be signed shortly after the approval of the Loan. An
estimated project implementation schedule is presented in Annex 2.
2.19      During implementation of the project, it would be necessary to cooperate closely with the
Lithuanian Ministry of Environment and other environmental institutions, concerning fish migration from
the Kursiu Lagoon, in accordance with the mitigation and monitoring program proposed by the Government
of Lithuania (Table 1, Annex 9), and reflected in the Loan Agreements (section 2 L).
G. PROCUREMENT
2.20      Procurement Arrangements. Contracts for works and goods to be financed under the Loan
will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines - Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits, dated January 1995, revised January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999);

consultants will be hired in accordance to the Guidelines - Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers, dated January 1997, revised September 1997 and January 1999. Major project
elements, their estimated costs and proposed procurement methods are given in Table 11-3 and the list of
procurement packages and detailed procedures are shown in Annex 3. Bank Standard Bidding
Documents would be used. Procurement financed by the Bank would involve civil works (approximately
82 percent of total project costs), goods (approximately 2 per cent of total project costs) and consulting
services (approximately 7 percent of total project costs). All procurement under the proposed project
would be carried out by the Project implementation Unit in KSSA (PIU).

2.22      The completion date of the project according to Bank profiles is March 30, 2004. The
project is expected to be implemented faster than the norm by June 30, 2003. Table 11-5 shows the
estimated disbursement profile for the project as derived from the implementation plan.
2.23      Special Account. To facilitate project implementation and to ensure prompt availability of
funds, KSSA would establish a Special Account (SA) in a commercial bank, on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, to cover the Bank's share of eligible expenditures. The Borrower shall maintain
a financial management system, including records and accounts, and prepare financial
statements, all in accordance with accounting standards acceptable to the Bank, consistently
applied, adequate to reflect its operations and financial condition and to register separately the
operations, resources and expenditures related to the Project. The initial allocation to the special
account may start at the authorized allocation of US$3.5 million representing approximately three months
of expenditures. Replenishment of the SA would take place at least every three months, or when one third of
the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier.
2.24      Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedures as
described in the LACI Implementation Handbook. In addition, quarterly bank statements of the SA,
which have been reconciled by the Borrower, would accompany Project Management Reports (PMR). The
minimum size of an application for direct disbursement from the Loan Account would be 20% of the current
Authorized Allocation to the Special Account.
2.25      The supporting documentation for uses of Loan funds would be retained by the Borrower for
inspection by supervision missions and by extemal auditors. Expenditures for contracts for individual



19
consultants over US$50,000 equivalent, for contract for consulting firms valued over US$100,000
equivalent and for operating costs valued at over US$50,000 equivalent would not be subject to prior
review. All other disbursements would be against standard documentation.
2.26      Project Account. In addition, the KSSA would establish a Project Account for counterpart
funds in a commercial bank with an initial allocation of US$1.2 million equivalent of the estimated local
contribution to the project. The opening of the Project Account would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
During negotiations, a schedule of disbursements into the Project Account has been agreed (par. 5.4 (a)).
I. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, MONITORING AND REPORTING
2.27      Financial Management. KSSA will be responsible for maintaining an adequate financial
management system, including accounting, financial reporting and auditing. KSSA will be staffed with a
qualified accounting specialist. An assessment of KSSA accounting system will be during project
appraisal. A project financial management system, LACI compliant, acceptable to the Bank, including
accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements, is in operation and in concordance with
the outcome of negotiations is in place (par. 5.2 (b)).
2.28      Accounting. Accounting Information submitted to the IBRD by the PIU would comply with
international accounting standards. Project accounts would be maintained by the PIU separately from any
other existing accounts. The PIU having the responsibility for orderly and efficient recording and
safeguarding of the project assets and resources would: (i) ensure accountability for project funds; (ii)
maintain records of the sources of funds, and the relevant accounts, broken down into the various types
of expenditure for the project; (iii) maintain internal controls to ensure that financial records are reliable,
complete and provided on a timely basis; (iv) report on the use of funds; (v) facilitate verification of
these reports by independent auditors; and (vi) provide information, as required, to the IBRD.
2.29      Project Financial Audit. The PIU would be responsible, on behalf of the Borrower, for
providing to the IBRD, within six months of the end of each fiscal year (including the fiscal year of the
final IBRD disbursement), financial audits of the Project acceptable to the IBRD. The PIU would have
the required Financial Statements for each year audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the
IBRD in accordance to international standards acceptable to the IBRD4. The auditor would be appointed
with sufficient time to carry out its responsibilities, including: (i) a review of the financial management
systems at the beginning of project implementation; and (ii) periodical reviews of the project financial
management systems thereafter. An audit of financial statements would include: (i) an assessment of the
adequacy of accounting and internal control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial
transactions and ensure safeguarding of project-financed assets; (ii) a determination of whether the PIU
has maintained adequate documentation of all relevant transactions; and verification that expenditures
submitted to the IBRD are eligible for financing under the project, and identification of any ineligible
expenditures. The use of a special account (SA) would be addressed separately in the auditor's opinion.
2.30      Financial Audit of KSSA. In order to monitor the financial performance of KSSA under the
project, an audit of its financial statements by auditors acceptable to the Bank would be required. The
audit reports, which would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year,
would also contain a separate opinion on compliance with all covenants under the IBRD Loan.
4 The International Standards on Auditing, published annually by the International Federation of Accountants and
widely adopted by the accounting profession, is an example of standards on auditing that are acceptable to the
IBRD.



20
2.31      During negotiations, it was agreed that, each year, KSSA would submit to the Bank the
auditors' report for KSSA and its audited financial statements, together with the audit report for the SA,
and the Project Account for each fiscal year, no later than six months after the close of such year (see
par. 5.1.(g)).
2.32      Project Monitoring Indicators. Project monitoring indicators would include those related
to: (i) the financial position of KSSA; (ii) the physical implementation of the project's components; and
(iii) the operational gains in the port. The list of indicators to be monitored is presented in Annex 5, and
included in the quarterly reports. Time-based actions presented in the project implementation schedule
(see Annex 2) would also be monitored. Agreement on the project monitoring indicators was reached at
negotiations (par. 5.1. (i)).
2.33      Reporting. The PIU would be responsible for preparing quarterly progress reports showing
the physical progress of the project, procurement status, costs incurred and anticipated, disbursements
made, administrative aspects and institutional performance. A mid-term review would be hold no later
than September 2001, for which the beneficiary would prepare a report describing the physical progress
of the project and an assessment of how the project meets the overall project objectives. Loan funds
would be reallocated between components on the basis of the mid-term review as necessary.
2.34      Financial Reporting. During project implementation, the PIU would submit on a quarterly
basis Project Financial Management Reports in the format agreed with IBRD. The Reports would
include: (i) Summary of Sources and Uses of Funds Report by project categories of expenditures,
showing the IBRD loan, Government contribution, and funds from other donors separately in currency as
deternined by project design; (ii) Summary of Expenditures by project components, for the current fiscal
year and accumulated to date; (iii) Summary of Statement of Expenditures (SOE) by individual
application reference number and amount5; (iv) Special Account Statement providing reconciliation of
amounts in the Special Account; (v) Expenditures Report by disbursement category providing details of
eligible project expenditures during the current quarter and next quarter; (vi) Balance Sheet showing
Accumulated Fund of the Project, bank balances, other assets of the project, and project liabilities.
2.35      An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be submitted by the beneficiary to the
Bank within six months of the Loan closing date. The ICR will discuss execution of the project, its costs
and benefits, the performance of the borrower, the performance of IBRD and other co-financiers, and the
lessons learned. It will also include a plan for the future operation of the project.
2.36      Agreement that the Borrower and KSSA will: (i) prepare an ICR integrating the
results of monitoring and evaluation activities performed under the project, no later than
September 2003; and (ii) hold a mid-term review, no later than September 2001, were reached at
negotiations (par. 5. 1. (k)).
J. LENDING TERMS
2.37      Maturity 17 years, including a five year grace period, on FSL terms chosen by the borrower
and communicated at negotiations. The Government of Lithuania will act as Guarantor of the KSSA, the
Borrower.
The total withdrawals under the SOE procedure should be added to expenditures financed by the IBRD under
regular procedures, which together would be equal to total expenditures financed by the IBRD shown in
Summary of Expenditures.



21
K. PROJECT SUPERVISION
2.38      During the implementation of the project, the Bank would lead supervision missions, staffed
by an engineer and such specialists as may be appropriate (such as procurement expert, financial analyst,
etc.) (Annex 5). Each of these missions would last about two weeks, for a total over the project life of 50
staff weeks, including time at headquarters. Missions would assist in project start-up and review physical
progress of the project. Co-financiers would be invited to each supervision mission. In addition, the
Resident Mission in Vilnius is expected to provide continuous assistance on project implementatien and
environmental monitoring.
L. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
2.39      The project has been designated as a "category A" project, taking into account the significant
quantity of material (675,000 cu. M.) that will be dredged in the realignment of the channel. Consultants,
in collaboration with local environmental organizations carried out an environmental analysis of the
project in accordance to Bank guidelines prior to appraisal. This analysis includes a set of mitigation
measures reviewed by the Bank prior to appraisal to be adopted during project implementation. A
summary of the environmental analysis and identification of remedial measures is provided in Annex 9,
Table I. Assurances have been received during negotiations from KSSA and the Government as to the
implementation of the remedial and monitoring measures described in this plan (para. 5.1 0)).
2.40      The project positive impacts on the environment are expected to greatly outweigh the impact of
civil works. Positive impact would notably include the following:
* The safe disposal of contaminated dredging materials in accordance with intemational agreements on
the Baltic Sea, for all material dredged under the project (realignment of channel entrance) as well as
the future port development program (Annex 1 1).
- The project would significantly improve the safety for in/out maneuvers (preventing potential oil
spillage6), would shorten waiting time outside the port under adverse weather conditions, and would
bring a much better protection for ships moored at berths, thus preventing damage to ships and
spillage damaging to the environment7.
* The port ship waste discharge services will put an end to the common practice of dumping waste in
the port or in its environmentally sensitive approaches and will establish port reception and treatment
facilities that follow the IMO Comprehensive Manual on Port Reception Facilities.
*  Monitoring and mitigation measures would extend through the execution of the Investment Program
of the Port of Klaipeda.
* The risks of building breakwaters have been publicly discussed and led to a program of beach
nourishment and use of clean sands dredged under the project.
The project includes financing for the design and construction of a CDF (par. 2.8, 2.9). The selection of this
technical solution reflects the geological composition of the Klaipeda port area, with a substrata of glacial
rubble mound material which prevents the leaching out of contaminants. This technical solution has been
6 The port connects the Kursiu Lagoon, an important hatching location for Baltic Sea fish, to the Baltic Sea. Any oil
spillage in the port would have a very serious effect on the fish population of the Baltic Sea.
7An oil spillage at the Port entrance happened in 1986.



22
successfully used in the Netherlands and Poland, and is in full compliance with international agreement on
protection of the Baltic Sea.
M. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES
2.41      The project would contribute directly to the sustainable development of Lithuania by improving
and extending navigability of ships in and out of the port of Klaipeda under adverse weather conditions,
improving environmental conditions and by privatizing remaining port operations. This would maintain port
competitiveness in the region and help develop the role of Lithuanian as an exporter of transit services.
2.42      The project, by further improving the competitiveness of Klaipeda, will preserve. and enhance
the role of Lithuania as a provider of services to trade. This in turn will lead to increased economic activity
and employment in Lithuanian and the Klaipeda region, in particular the development of the Klaipeda free
economic zone near the port. The expected social impact of increased employment and economic activity
triggered by the project have been reflected in public hearings and in the interest of local government in the
timely implementation of the project.

3. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. PAST AND CURRENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
3.1       Klaipeda State Seaport Authority. KSSA, created in 1992, is the state-owned landlord of
the port of Klaipeda under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport. KSSA is responsible for: (i) the
maintenance and repairs of the port infrastructure; (ii) navigation; (iii) marine environmental protection;
and (iv) the development of the port. It leases land to independent operators, public or private
(stevedoring companies, ship building and ship repairs companies). The responsibilities and functions of
KSSA have gradually expanded, and in January 1996, the transfer of the port infrastructure assets to its
balance sheet was completed.
3.2       As a landlord authority, KSSA has two main sources of revenues: port dues for vessels and
cargo, and land lease revenues from the operators leasing the port facilities. In Klaipeda, port dues are
paid by the vessel's Master prior to the vessel leaving the Port. The Port dues are computed according to
the declared Gross Registered Tons of the vessel, and a list of unit tariff set up by the Ministry of
Transport8. Land is leased by the operators at a tariff set in the land leasing contract between KSSA and
each operator.
3.3       Overall Situation. The port financial situation is healthy. Based on 1999 audited9
statements, the port shows substantial net operating income, little indebtedness and a substantial
allocation of resources towards repairing and upgrading port facilities. Financial results are discussed in
details in Annex 7 and shown in Table 111-1 and 111-2. Only 14 percent of the revenues came from land
lease as opposed to 85 percent from harbor dues. Given the scarcity of land in the port area these revenues
do not represent the fair value of the land use. This imbalance translates in a transfer to KSSA of the
commercial risks related to traffic levels as opposed to the port operators. The cost recovery of
infrastructure investments needs to reviewed taking into account this aspect (Annex 10, par. 15)
3.4       The need to review port tariffs and land leasing rates and the preparation of draft revised land
leasing contracts during the project life was agreed upon during negotiations (par. 5.1. (a) and (b)).
3.5       Tax privileges have been granted from the Govemment. KSSA has not paid, and currently
does not pay: (i) any VAT on port revenues; and (ii) any profit tax on income from port-related activities.
The Government has been up to now, willing to exempt KSSA from any tax and dividends, and to leave
the port net income within KSSA for port development.
8 Currently these dues are separated as follows: vessel, tonnage, sanitary, pilotage, passenger, berth, and mooring and
defined by the Order 185 (4/30/1998) of the Ministry of Transport.

24
B. FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
3.6         Given its good financial standing, KSSA is expected to finance the proposed project without
difficulties. KSSA may, under a slower development of traffic, not have sufficient financial resources to
simultaneously implement its comprehensive rehabilitation and investment program (Annex 11). The
analysis in this section is based on the investment program agreed at negotiations, IBRD and EIB financing,
book value for existing assets and traffic projections presented in Annex 6. Under such assumptions, KSSA
will be able to carry out most of its investment program without additional external financing. During
implementation the Development Program of KSSA will be amended and rescheduled as needed to adjust
to the financing capacity of KSSA (par. 5. 1 (d)).
3.7         Financial Statements. An analysis of income statements, cash-flow statements and balance
sheet projections for KSSA is presented in Annex 7. The table below (Table 111-1) highlights the historic
and projected Income Statement of KSSA.

remain above 43 percent. This reflects the simultaneous increase in revenues, linked to expanded traffic,
and in expenses (interest, depreciation and maintenance expenses).
3.9         Cash-Flow. The projected sources and applications of funds statement is highlighted in
Table 111-2, and Figure 3.1. Any renewal expenditure in KSSA development program  will be subject to
securing financing prior to the start of works. For capacity expansion investments, preparation of an
economic evaluation with an economic rate of return in excess of 12 percent and of a financial
evaluation with a rate of return in excess of Libor plus four percent would be required (par. 5.1. (e)).
3.10        Debt. KSSA would be the Borrower of the World Bank loan. Once the grace period for an
existing EIB loan has expired, the debt service coverage ratiol0 is still expected to exceed 3.9 (Annex 7
and Fig. 111.2). A financial covenant in the Loan Agreement establishes a minimum debt service coverage
ratio of 2. 0, and a 4 percent minimum return on equity (par. 5.1. (O. The debt to equity ratio would not
exceed 35 percent over the period.

3.11              Financial projections show a return on net fixed assets ranging from 5.0 percent in 2001 to
6.7 percent in 2003 before increasing again afterwards. The fast increase in the value of port assets
(US$115 million over 1999-2005) explains the initial decrease, which will be offset by traffic increases.
The detailed analysis of future investment projects will mitigate the risk of adding investments impacting
negatively the return on fixed assets. The adjustment of existing assets to their current value may lead to
a significant reduction in the calculated accounting returns.
3.12              An evaluation of the port assets will be performed by an independent auditor acceptable to
the Bank and any required accounting adjustment in the value of these assets be reflected in KSSA
accounts prior to any change in the tax status and dividendpolicy applicable to KSSA (par. 5.1. (1)).

4. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. PROJECT COSTS AND BENEFITS
4.1      The project evaluation appears robust, with a probability of 95 percent to have an NPV of
more than US$70 million. The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of the project is in excess of 40
percent, with a net present value (NPV at 12 percent) of US$89 million. The basic assumptions used and
the detailed results of the analysis are presented in Annex 8.
4.2      Project Impacts. The improvements to the entrance channel of the Port of Klaipeda are
expected to have the following impacts: (i) reducing the risk of accidents while entering or exiting the port
during periods of stormy weather; (ii) reducing the cost of transport through Klaipeda by allowing access to
deeper-draft vessels; (iii) reducing the periods during which the port is closed due to weather conditions;
and (iv) preventing the breach of existing breakwaters that would cause a closure of the port. The economic
benefits and costs associated with the rehabilitation of existing breakwaters have not been taken into
account in the evaluation, since it would take place in both scenarios, due to its absolute and immediate
necessity.
4.3      Costs. The with project scenario includes the civil works to improve the port accessibility,
consisting of: (i) a reconfigured, deepened and re-aligned bent channel; (ii) extensions of the northern and
southern breakwaters; (iii) improved mooring and fender systems; and (iv) control and disposal of illegal
dumping of ship wastes. In addition to capital investments, the with project scenario also includes technical
services for: (i) training of port pilots; (ii) wave and current monitoring; and (iii) project supervision. The
rehabilitation of existing breakwaters and the maintenance dredging of the without project scenario are also
performed. Investment costs are US$39.7 million in 2000 U.S. dollars, net of taxes and subsidies. They
include physical contingencies and exclude price contingencies. Incremental maintenance costs are dredging
works, which start five years after the start of the project.
4.4      Benefits. The impacts were quantified in terms of benefits in three broad categories: (i) safety
improvements (present value: US$11 million); (ii) transport cost savings (present value: US$46 million);
and (iii) economic surplus linked to transit traffic (present value: US$62 million). Consultation with port
users have revealed that the impact of extending the number of days, when vessels can enter or exit the port,
will be less significant. While the improved port entrance would increase capacity, actual port operational
capacity would remain constrained by the existing limitations of handling equipment during periods of high
wind.
4.5      Safety Improvements. The safety improvement benefits account for 9% of the total benefits.
Four accidents involving sinking of vessels have been reported over the last 20 years. The causes appear to
be a combination of sea conditions at the entrance channel, human error and equipment failure. The
combination of pilots training, wave and current monitoring systems, deeper and realigned channel, and
extended breakwaters is expected to reduce vessel accidents by 80 percent. On the basis of expected
accident cost estimated at US$11 million and occurrence every five years, the expected annual savings
amount to US$1.8 million.
4.6      Transport Cost Savings. The benefits associated with the use of larger vessels account for 39%
of total benefits. The increase in channel depth combined with the investments made by the port and the
private sector in deepwater berths and modem handling equipment will enable larger vessels ("Panamax"
class) to use the port. The benefits will primarily derive from the reduction in the shipping cost for existing



28
traffic, i.e. oil products, the generation of additional oil product traffic as well as the generation, attraction or
avoidance of diversion for dry fertilizer products.
4.7        Transit Benefit. Transit benefits account for 52% of the project benefits. Since Klaipeda is
primarily a transit port, the benefits derived from an increase in transit traffic is related to the
complementary activities and logistic services associated with transit traffic. In this sense, the transit port
is like a Free Trade Zone where the benefits from improvements in the efficiency of the primary activity
are captured by foreign companies, but the domestic economy benefits from providing further services to
these activities. The project is expected to increase the transit traffic by 1.6 million tons by 2005, through
generation and diversion linked to reduced shipping costs. The unit economic surplus linked to this
traffic was estimated to be 10.6 US$/ton, including the economic surplus at the port area (5.3 US$/ton)
and the economic surplus resulting from land transport (5.3 US$/ton).
B. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
4.8        The sensitivity analysis indicates that in all cases the project would remain economically
justified. Detailed results are shown in Table IV. 1 for the changes in the most critical parameters of the
analysis: (i) changes of 20 percent in project costs; (ii) changes of 20 percent in diversion coefficient costs;
(iii) changes of 20 percent in the value of time; (iv) changes of 30 percent in expected Panamax-size traffic.
The results indicate that the project would still be economically justified in all cases. The switching value
analysis (value of the modified parameter for which NPV is 0) confirm project robustness. The project
would provide a return of 12 percent in any of the following unlikely events: project costs were four times
higher; the cost of accidents cost fell to zero; the ship operating costs savings fell to zero; the economic
surplus per ton of diverted or generated cargo fell to zero; and the volume of Panamax-class traffic fell to
only 20 percent of the estimate.

C. PROJECT RISKS
4.9        A risk analysis, a Montecarlo simulation with 10,000 random samples, has been performed to
assess the effect of variability in key estimates. The frequency chart for the NPV is shown in Figure 4.1.
Median values are: US$86 million for the NPV and 40 percent for the EIRR. The risk analysis shows that
four parameters have a significant impact on the results of the economic analysis: (i) the economic
surplus per ton with a correlation coefficient of 0.59 with the NPV; (ii) the traffic volume (correlation of
0.68); (iii) the investment costs (correlation of -0.25); and (iv) the voyage cost savings (correlation of
0.20). Given the origin/destination of most of the transit traffic - Russia and Belarus, the risks associated
to traffic variability are significant and led to a detailed traffic analysis. The detailed engineering study
provides a fairly accurate level of construction costs and consequently reduce the risk linked to project
costs.
4.10        The competitiveness of Klaipeda would be further strengthened with a separate set of
measures under consideration by Lithuania, which are not part of the proposed project and its evaluation.
These are transport and trade facilitation measures, inclusive of Customs reformn to align to EU
requirements. The combined impact of these measures would be a further increase in logistical
advantages for Klaipeda with a commensurate reduction in project risks.

Disbursement Schedule (Table F)
Procurement - General
All Bank-financed procurement will be in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Thus, procurement for
goods and works would follow the Bank Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits
(January 1995 as revised in January and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999). Procurement
of consulting services would follow the Bank's Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants
by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997 as revised in September 1997 and January 1999).
Procurement Responsibility
All procurement under the proposed project will be carried out by the Project Implementation Unit in
KSSA (PIU). Established in June 1999, the PIU staff was trained in Bank procurement and financial
management by international consultants and an accounting and reporting system was set into place to
meet LACI requirements. Consultants hired under a grant fund have assisted the PIU in the preparation of
the first year bidding documents. The PIU includes a full time procurement specialist. The responsibilities
of the procurement specialist would include inter alia: (i) to prepare and submit to the Bank all
procurement documents which require Bank's prior review; (ii) carry out any procurement action; (iii)
prepare and submit to the Bank at the beginning of each calendar year a detailed procurement schedule;
(iv) update the General Procurement Notice and prepare Special Procurement Notices; (v) ensure that the
procurement process is conducted based on principles of efficiency, economy and transparency.
Procurement Capacity Assessment of the PIU
A public procurement system was created in Lithuania in 1996 by the enacting of a Public Procurement
Law inspired from UNCITRAL. The system has been continuously enhanced over the last years. At this
stage, there is no Country Procurement Assessment Review conducted by the Bank. An assessment of
the capacity of the PIU to conduct procurement under this project was completed by December 15, 1999.
By that date important actions had been already taken to ensure a good start in project implementation
such as: (i) a project PIU was established and all office procedures and procurement and financial
management manuals have been prepared with the assistance of an international consultant; (ii) staff was
recruited competitively from the market and paid at a level comparable to the private sector; (iii) the
contracts of the PIU staff are renewable semi-annually based on adequate performance; (iv) the PIU head
and the procurement officer have been trained in Bank procurement by an international procurement
specialist; and (v) an international consulting company was hired to assist the PIU in project preparation
and in conducting advance procurement and most of the bidding documents are expected to be finalized
by the time of negotiations. The challenge remains the fact that this is the first Bank project to be
implemented by this PIU and the experience does not cover the complete procurement cycle and all the
range of procurement methods and documents. Based on this considerations, the recommendation is to
have this PIU rated average risk. An action plan to further enhance the PIU capacity to conduct
procurement was prepared. This action plan, to be finalized during negotiations, includes: (i) further
training tailored to the project design during a project launching workshop (by June, 2000); (ii) attending
a course in Bank procurement on civil works contracts in ILO/Turin (by May, 2000); (iii) the use of Bank

standard bidding documents; and (iv) ensuring international technical assistance in procurement during
project implementation.
Notification of Business Opportunities
A General Procurement Notice was published on June 16, 1998 and updated on September 30 1999.
Specific Procurement Notices have been published in Financial Times and Development Business
respectively, to invite firms to pre-qualify for two major civil works contracts and provide expressions of
interest for project supervision. These notices have been also published in newspapers of national
circulation. The General Procurement Notice will continue to be updated annually.
Procurement Methods
(i) Goods and Works
International Competitive Bidding (ICB): would be used to procure goods for contracts estimated to
cost US$100,000 or more each and for all civil works contracts.
International Shopping (IS): would be used to procure goods for contracts estimated to cost less than
US$100,000 each up to an aggregate amount of US$ 300,000.
(ii) Consulting Services
Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS): would be used to hire consulting firms to provide technical
assistance and training under contracts estimated to cost more than US$100,000 each.
Least Cost Selection (LCS): would be used for hiring consulting firms to provide audit services for the
project.
Individuals: would be hired to provide technical assistance for management strengthening (procurement,
port tariff, marketing and financial strategy) up to an aggregate amount of US$300,000.
(iii) PIU Incremental Operating Costs (US$200,000)
Items for operation of the PIU will be procured in accordance with an agreed budget and schedule.
Disbursement
Allocation of Loan Proceeds. The proceeds of the Fixed Spread Loan (FSL) (US$35.36 million
equivalent) would be lent to the KSSA, under a Guarantee extended by the Government of Lithuania. The
Borrower would bear the foreign exchange risk. The proposed Loan would be disbursed over a period of
four years. (Annex 3, Tables E and F). The Loan closing date (i.e., the final date for presentation of
requests for approval or authorization to disburse on project components) would be September 30, 2004;
six months after the completion date. The project completion date would be March 31, 2004.
Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Borrower would establish, maintain
and operate, under condition acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in US dollars in a commercial
bank, acceptable to the Bank. The selection process and criteria for selection of the commercial bank
would follow the World Bank standard selection procedures. The initial allocation of the Special Account
would be limited to US$ 3.5 million.
The PIU will keep documentation supporting the payments under the loan and will make it available for
the required audit as well as to Bank supervision missions.

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
KLAIPEDA PORT PROJECT
TRAFFIC FORECAST
Background
Trade has become increasingly important for Lithuania. The value of imports now reaches almost 60% of
GDP. Over the last decade Lithuania's trade had gradually reoriented from markets in the FSU to markets
in Europe. This change has been accelerated by the recent Russian economic crisis. At the same time,
domestic industry has undergone a conversion from energy-intensive, relatively inefficient heavy industry
to more efficient light industry.
The remaining heavy industries, e.g. fertilizers and cement, have invested in new equipment, improved
their marketing and shifted their exports to Europe. The manufacturers of machinery and electronic
equipment have attempted to do the same but with less success because of the difficulties in competing
with the quality of EU manufactures. The agricultural sector has declined in importance. Both domestic
production and exports decreased as a result of the breakup of the large farms into smaller privately
owned units. Low cost imports of food from the EU have also put pressure on this sector. A significant
portion of the exports reported in Lithuanian trade statistics are re-exports or exports with a substantial
import content.
Lithuania has been a major transport corridor between Russian and Belarus and Northern Europe. This
has now been extended to North and South America. It competes for this transit trade with the other
Baltic states.
Port Competition
The competitive advantage of Klaipeda derives from an excellent road network, lower rail freight rates,
efficient port operations, an ice-free port and a tradition of being a major gateway for neo-bulk cargoes
(Annex 13). Nevertheless, its market share for dry cargo has been stagnant and its share of liquid cargoes
has declined while those in Tallinn and Riga have increased.
Tallinn offers deepwater berths and has invested in new cargo-handling facilities. Riga has also invested
in new facilities and take advantage of its proximity to Moscow to strengthen its position as a major outlet
for containers and wood-products. Ventspils, the major bulk port in the region, has lost market share
despite its deepwater facilities and its crude and product pipelines with connections to the Russian
network. St. Petersburg has lost market share due to the condition of its facilities, its northern locations
and the cost of doing business. It regained some of this market share due to recent Russian regulations
and taxes that encourage the use of Russian ports. The Black Sea ports offer a shorter transit time and
distance to the Eastern Mediterranean and Asia but have not gained significant market share from the
Baltics due to lack of capacity, inefficient operations and other costs to freight.
Klaipeda has developed a number of specialized terminals in recent years. These include the rehabilitated
petroleum terminal, the deepwater steel berths, the expansion of the international ferry terminal and the
dedicated container terminal. These are operated by the private sector as are all the cargo-handling
facilities in the port. Plans are now underway for the construction of several fertilizer terminals and a
grain terminal. These facilities combined with the deeper draft provided under this project will
substantially improve the competitive position of the port for both domestic and transit cargoes.
The vessels serving the bulk trades are primarily chartered tankers, bulkers and special-purpose vessels.
Their size is determined by the size of typical consignments. Most of the petroleum products are
transported as tanker loads of Heavy fuel oil (HFO) and diesel. The typical tankers are 25,000 Dwt and
load an average of 24,000 tons. Fertilizer is transported in bulkers in port single product and mixed



Annex 6
Page 2 of 12
product loads. These vessels average 10,000 Dwt and load an average of 7,500 tons. Metals are
transported as multiple consignments in general cargo ships many of which are dedicated to this trade.
The vessels average about 5000 Dwt and frequently take on a full load. RoRo traffic is transported in
ferries which carry an average of 100 units. Some are designed to carry rail wagons. Containers are
transported in small feeder vessels with capacities of 250-350 TEU. These make multiple calls and
transfer around 100 boxes at Klaipeda.
Petroleum Products
The petroleum products loaded at Klaipedos Nafta terminal (KN) are transit cargo from refineries in
Russia and Belarus. The output of crude and refined products in the FSU had been declining steadily for
more than a decade up through 1995. Although Russia accounts for the majority of the production both
Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have been increasing their share. The former is expected to be a major
producer in the coming years with the development of the vast Tengzig field. Oil exports from Russia
have been growing at 10%-1 5% in recent years despite a decline in extraction and production.
The shipments of petroleum products through Klaipeda have been primarily heavy fuel oil (HFO) shipped
by rail. The KN terminal was constructed in 1959 specifically to handle this cargo. Over the last five
years, there has been extensive renovation to improve efficiency and to add capacity for exports of diesel
and other white products. This included a substantial expansion of the storage capacity, rehabilitation of
the heating system for removing fuel oil in rail wagons, new marine loading arms and safety systems to
meet international standards.
The Mazheikiai refinery, located about 92.5 kilometers from the Butinge terminal, is supplied with crude
from a pipeline with a capacity of 20 million tons per year. The refinery's design capacity is 17 million
tons per year but it has never reached that level. The level of production declined significantly in the
1990's, but then recovered to about 6 million tons. Table 1, shows the structure of this traffic until 1997.

A termninal for handling crude has recently been constructed at Butinge near the Latvian border. It will be
used to offload crude from the North Sea as well as load Russian crude transported by pipeline. The
facility will ensure a regular supply of crude for the refinery. This should eliminate the recent problem of
shutdowns due to Russian suppliers withholding shipments.'
This occurred not as a result of supplier logistics problems but as part of an attempt to gain financial
control of the refinery as well as to negotiate better prices.

KN receives products, HFO and diesel, directly from Belarus, Russia, and Mazeikiai refinery using rail
transport. In the future, product will also be
transported directly from the Mazeikiai refinery           Past and Projected Traffic
to the port via pipeline.                                Petroleum  Products (000 tons)
The volume of HFO shipped through the KN       12,000
terminals declined from a high of 8 million tons                                    .. .. . ::
in 1992 to 2 million tons in 1998 before    10,00
recovering to 4 million tons in 1999. The       8,000 -
decline was due to the losses of certain markets    6,000
and  a  diversion  to  Tallinn  during  the     4,000
rehabilitation. Part of this volume will be
recovered over the next decade. However, there  2,000

because of the product's high viscosity and
sulfur content. Most of the current demand is
from power plants in Europe.
Future growth in traffic will come from diesel and jet fuel exported from Mazheikiai as well as the diesel
and other higher products shipped from Russian and CIS refineries. KN is expected to handle all of
Mazheikiai's exports and has a contract to handle up to 7 million tons once the pipeline from the refinery
is completed. The volumes actually shipped are expected to reach this level relatively quickly and
increase gradually thereafter. Were there to be a much larger increase in the refinery's exports, then a new
products berth would be constructed at Butinge to handle the overflow.
The volume of diesel shipped by rail from Russian and CIS refineries amounts to about 1 million tons per
year. As Russian refineries shift their product mix to lighter products, the surplus available for export to
Europe will increase. The volume is expected to increase to 2 million tons per year. This assumes that
domestic consumption is restrained by pricing that reflects the opportunity cost.
The increase in depth at Klaipeda will improve the competitive position of the refinery's exports and
attract additional transit cargo. Panamax tankers will be used to carry the white products to more distant
markets. The port will be able to take advantage of both its depth and ice-free status to increase its market
share relative to Ventspils. It will also be able to compete more effectively with Tallinn, which has 17 m
draft and the capacity to handle high-viscosity HFO, for shipments of HFO to Europe. In the past, some
Panamax vessels have loaded consignments in Klaipeda and continued to Ventspils to top off. These
would now be able to fully load in Klaipeda.
The exports of HFO are expected to increase to 4.5 million tons within the next five years but then decline
gradually. The exports of diesel is expected to rise to 2 million tons over the next five years. The export of
Mazeikiai production is expected to increase to 5 million tons within five years and thereafter to grow at a
more gradual rate of 3%. This will be shipped to the US and the Mediterranean. A higher than expected
volume could result if the Russian petroleum industry improves its efficiency and captures a larger share
of the world market. A lower volume could result if some of the transit cargo is diverted through the
Black Sea ports and EU regulations discourage the use of high sulfur HFO.
Panamax vessels will be used for the shipment of the products other than HFO to more distance locations.
Within 5 years, about 10% of the refinery output should be transported in these larger vessels rising to
20% in ten years.
Fertilizers
Both dry and liquid bulk fertilizers are exported through Klaipeda. The dry bulk fertilizers include Potash
and Urea from the Urals and DAP, Ammonium Sulfates and Urea produced in Lithuania. Domestic
production accounts for about 70% of total shipments. Liquid fertilizers include solutions of Ammonium



Annex 6
Page 4 of 12
Phosphate and Urea. The fertilizers are transported to the port by rail 2 Dry fertilizers are shipped to North
and South America, Scandinavia and Asia. Liquid fertilizers are loaded for North and Central Europe.
The shipments through Klaipeda have demonstrated strong growth over the last seven years reaching
about 3 million tons in 1999 of which 2 l/2 million tons were dry fertilizer shipped primarily in bulk form
(Table 2). Future growth is expected to come from new markets in China (up to 1'/2 million tons) and
diversion of shipments to the US that are currently handled through Ventspils. There will also be an
increase in the imports of Apetite rock for production of DAP.

Shipments of dry fertilizer are expected to increase to 4 million tons within the next three years and 5
million tons within the next five as shown in the figure. Thereafter they are expected to increase at 5%.
Exports of liquid fertilizers are expected to continue their strong growth with volumes reaching 1.2
million tons within the next five years. The growth could be more rapid but this would require an
investment in additional production or capturing market share from neighboring ports.
The increase in depth will also improve Klaipeda's competitive position relative to Ventspils by allowing
the use of Panamax vessels for exports to markets in China and Southeast Asia. These vessel have a 30%
lower cost for long distance shipments. It is expected that within 6 years, about 20% of the dry fertilizer
will be carried in Panamax vessels and that over the long term this will rise to 40%. Of equal importance
for the port's competitive advantage will be the proposed development of modem bulk-handling facilities
with high speed loaders which reduce the turnaround time of larger vessels.
2 The one exception is Lifosa which began temporarily using truck convoys when Lithuanian railroad failed to offer
acceptable rates.

Metals
The port handles a variety of metal exports including steel products, iron ore, pig iron, and scrap iron. The
steel products include hot and cold rolled steel coils. These are shipped by rail from the large steel mills in
Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. The scrap iron is shipped to European mills while the pig iron is exported to
Europe, the US and the Far East.
Following the economic crisis in Southeast Asia, the FSU countries refocused their exports to western
nations, especially the US. The dramatic rise in exports to the US from Russia and also from the CIS,
Brazil and Japan, led to US trade quotas and increases in import duties in mid 1999. Shipments declined
substantially.3
The steep decline in exports to the US market was partially offset by the unexpectedly rapid recovery in
the Southeast Asian economies, and did not have major effects on Baltic ports. For Klaipeda, the result
was a rapid run-up in exports prior to the embargo followed by sharp decline. The decline was partially
offset by an increase in exports of pig iron and iron ore.
Despite strong growth in economic activity in the US and Europe, world consumption of steel is forecast
to increase by only 10% over the next decade.4 Despite an average productivity which is less than 50% of
US steel-makers, the mills in the FSU will remain cost competitive due to low labor and material costs,
and produce basic products that the US and Japan are no longer able to produce at a competitive price.
With privatization, the Russian mills have begun adjusting output to meet market conditions.
The metals shipped through Klaipeda continue to be directed primarily at the US. A number of factors are
expected to mitigate the impact of the quotas. First, the Russian metal industry will continue to increase
its production capacity and improve its marketing capabilities so as to serve new markets. Second, it will
focus more on the higher end of the market including CR coil and ferro-alloys. Third, alternative ways of
serving the US market will be developed including intermediate processing through third countries and
offshore fabrication by US auto and other manufacturers.
Klaipeda is expected to remain the port              Past and Projected Traffic
of choice in the Baltic because of its
experience, its improved facilities and its  7000    Metal Products (000 tons)

continues to enjoy lower rail freight rates,  6,000
then the port will gain some additional    5,000                                       750

The volume of steel products will recover                 Metals    3 Scrap and Ore
over the next five years to between 4 and
5 million tons. Scrap and ore exports will increase gradually to between 1.5 and 2 million tons.
Thereafter, the traffic is expected to increase at 5% as Russian mills increase their market share in basic
steel as well as higher value steel products. This growth assumes that there will no additional restrictions
3 US quotas have been a periodic impediment to the US steel trade during the decade, however, these measures
included a 6 month moratorium on imports. The quotas did not affect the Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

on metals trade and that the Russian efforts to divert cargoes to St. Petersburg and the Black Sea ports
will have limited success.
While there have been situations in which Panamax vessels have been used for steel shipments to the US
with topping up in Ventspils or Europe, these were the exception. Because of the nature of the trade, it is
unlikely that there will be any demand for vessels larger than 40,000 DWT. Therefore, deepening of the
channel is expected to have little impact on this trade.
Wood and Wood Products
Klaipeda handles logs, pulpwood, processed timber and wood products. The logs are exported primarily
to Norway and Sweden. Processed timber is sent primarily to the UK. In 1998 about 45% of the wood
exports were logs but this will decrease due to changes in Russian policy regarding the export of logs and
the increasing cost of domestic logs relative to those produced in Latvia.
Exports of sawn timber production have also declined due to the restriction on import of cheap logs from
Russia and Belarus as well as the diversion of Russian timber exports to St. Petersburg. Much of the
wood from Lithuania, Russia and Belarus is spruce which tends to have too many knots for export to
European markets. Lithuanian mills operate at a competitive disadvantage because of lack of investment.
The mills are old and in poor condition and lack drying kilns. Their competitive advantage had derived
from low energy and labor costs but this has been lost with the rise in wages and domestic energy prices.
The trade in pulpwood is highly volatile. There was a strong market in 1995, but it subsequently crashed
and has not recovered. The impact on the port traffic between 1995 and 1996 can be seen in Figure 15.
Exports of wood products are primarily

fluctuate around their current level. The
result will be a combined volume of
exports that will grow at 1%-2% for the
next five years and then increases at about 3% per year. Exports of furniture and other wood products are
expected to grow at 7%-12% for the next five years and then continue but at a slower pace. Since these
are shipped as RoRo cargoes, they are included in the RoRo traffic forecast.
The logs and wood products are shipped in small consignments and carried in relatively small vessels
used for short sea routes. Shipping of wood products is done using RoRo for Europe and containers for
the US. The deepening of the channel will have no impact on the type of vessels used for this trade.
Sugar and Grain
About 2/3 of the grain and fodder imports are transit cargo. Imports of fodder from North Europe have
increased gradually over the last four years. These are consumed domestically by the livestock industry.
Imports of food grain from the US, Canada and France have declined precipitously throughout the 90's. In
addition, domestic grain production declined as a result of privatization which produced a large number of
inefficient farms. It improved slightly in 1996 and 1997 but then declined again in 1998 as a result of bad

weather. Grain imports are expected to increase dramatically with the expected shipment of 700 thousand
tons of PL480 grain from the US to Kazakhstan through Klaipeda. Although grain remains a volatile
cargo, one of the terminal operators is planning to construct silo capacity to accommodate future exports.
The growth of food grain imports combined with a steady growth in fodder imports for the FSU should
result in an increase in traffic to about 1.2 million tons in three years and 1.75 million tons within the
decade. However, this trade remains highly speculative and could easily revert to primarily a fodder trade.
On the other hand, it could become part of a long-term grain purchasing activity by the FSU.
It is possible that some grain imports would be
shipped in Panamax vessels, but the PL480                    Past and Projected Traffic

Food Products
The total volume of refrigerated cargo is currently almost 600 thousand tons and has been rising relatively
steadily since 1992. Most of this cargo is food products with about equal proportions of imports and
transit cargoes. The volumes of the primary food products are shown in Table 3.
About 40% of this cargo is, frozen fish.
Past and Projected Traffic                   Klaipeda was formerly a home port for large

Inbound reefer cargo is expected to continue growing at 13-15% per year once the Russian and
Lithuanian economies recover and to level off at a 10% rate of growth over the next decade. Since these
products are relatively high value, they are very sensitive to the economic conditions in Lithuania and
FSU. The growth will be much slower if the rate of economic growth in these countries remains low.
There is also potential competition from St. Petersburg, should that port become efficient.
RoRo Traffic
The RoRo cargo consists of tractor-trailers and rail wagons carrying higher value cargoes between
Northern Europe and Russia or Belarus. It also includes new and used automobile imported from Europe
to Russia. The growth in RoRo traffic, as measured in terms of vehicles, was relatively steady for the
period 1993-1997, about 50 thousand units, but declined by more than half to 21 thousand in 1999, due to
the Russian economic crisis. During the period 1995-1998, about 1/3 of the RoRo traffic were autos as
shown in Table 4.
Trailers transported either alone or with their tractor and driver account for over half of the RoRo traffic.
Tractor-trailer combinations have a higher ocean freight but are less costly to operate because of the lower
salaries of Lithuanian drivers. The RoRo traffic competes directly with the all-road movements through
Poland to Western Europe. Traffic on both modes should increase in the future as trade in semi-finished
goods and consumer products increases.

The modal split between the RoRo and all road routes will depend on a number of factors including:
1. the condition and development of Polish roads and border crossing delays;
2. the improvement of procedures at the borders between the connecting states;
3. the costs of diesel fuel;
4. road congestion in Western Europe;
5. EU regulations on trucking;
6. the frequency of ferry services; and
7. the introduction of larger RoRo ferries.

thereafter reflecting limitations on the growth in general cargo. The auto traffic is expected to recover and
then grow at 15% for another three years before settling into a more sustainable rate of 6%.
Container Traffic
The decline in container traffic over the last four years is atypical. A rapid growth from 1993-1995, would
have been expected for a port entering the take-off stage. The container terminal at Klaipeda was
designed on this assumption. The decline began before the Russian economic crisis and occurred even as
RoRo traffic continued to grow. Part of the downturn in 1997 is explained by shippers switching back to
RoRo from containers for cost reasons. This suggests that growth in unit cargoes is continuing, but
containerization is suitable only for longer distances. The container trade will continue to be a feeder
operation providing unitized shipments for cargo traveling beyond Europe. The growth of container cargo
will depend on the trade with America and Asia in consumer goods and manufactures. Containers are
expected to continue to be carried in small feeder vessels and transshipped at the major North European
hubs.
The ratio of 20:40 foot containers in 1998 was about 55:45 with the result that the larger boxes account
for about 2/3 of the capacity. The average load per TEU declined from 1993 to 1997 due to an increase in
the percentage of empty boxes. The inbound transit boxes were predominantly loaded whereas the
outbound transit boxes were predominantly empty. With the economic crisis in Russia, there was a
decline in containerized imports with the result that there was a better balance and higher average load.
The volume of container traffic is expected to remain at a diminished level until the economic conditions
in the FSU and Lithuania improve. Thereafter, the growth in containerized traffic will be limited to 5%,
moderated by an increase in the average tonnage per container through more dense packing. Over the
long term, the growth should be about 7% reaching nearly 50 thousand TEU at the end of the decade.
Forecast
The forecast of individual cargoes was prepared for the period of the next 10 years. Longer terrn
projections other than a continuation of trends from the previous years was not feasible given the level of
uncertainty, especially for the transit trades. A basic forecast was prepared as shown in the following
Table 5. This was bounded by high and low forecasts which are presented in Tables 6 and 7. The trends in
total shipments of dry and liquid bulk, and neo-bulk cargoes are shown below:

Annex 7

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
KLAIPEDA PORT PROJECT
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND PROJECTIONS
The basic documents used to prepare the financial analysis and projections for the KSSA were the
financial statements for 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 of the KSSA prepared in accordance with
International Accounting Standards together with the report of independent auditors (Arthur Andersen)'.
Port statistics, the traffic analysis (Annex 6), financial statements for 1995, and the KSSA ten-year
investment plan supplemented those audit reports. In the tables, statements are in current US dollars. A
Litas is valued at US$0.25.
Past Situation (1996-1998)
Income Statement. The port had sound revenues and good margins, but in 1998 expenses surged, calling
for close scrutiny in coming years. Despite a reduction of 6.9 percent in traffic in 1998 (+8.7 percent in
1997), operating revenues grew by 2 percent (compared to +12 percent in 1997) due to a 10 percent increase
in average harbor dues. Net income dropped by 27 percent in 1998 due to operating expenses sharply
increasing by 52 percent. All broad categories of expenses increased significantly despite declining traffic.
In 1998, the operating margin dropped to 47 percent compared to 66 percent in 1997. The return on equity
reached 10.4 percent compared to 17.4 percent in 1997. Only 11 percent of the revenues came from land
lease as opposed to 87 percent from harbor dues. Given the scarcity of land in the port area these revenues
did not represent the fair value of the land use. In 1997, expenses were reduced by 15 percent due mostly to
the variability in the port repair expenses (the port does not use a fixed annual provision for repair).
Sources and Uses of Funds. Cash flow available from operation raised steadily over 1995-1997 to reach 74
MIs, but declined in 1998 to 59 MIs, representing 11.7 percent of total assets. The KSSA allocated 94 Mls
in 1998 (97 percent of total revenues) and 88 Mls in 1997 to invest in the repair/rehabilitation /improvement
of the port. A large part of the debt of EUR014 million contracted in 1995 with the EIB for the
development of the Smeltes Peninsula was used during year 1998.
Balance Sheet. The situation of the port of Klaipeda in 1998 was strong: (i) level of debt on equity was
only 12.9 percent; (ii) the current ratio and quick ratio (7.1 and 5.2 respectively) displayed a strong liquidity
situation; and (iii) the return on net fixed assets and equity (9.9 and 10.4 percent respectively) provided a
decent retum, although lower than in 1997. The fixed assets could be undervalued 2, resulting in a lower
depreciation charge than needed to maintain the port in its present condition and in an artificially high net
income.
Approach for Projections 1999-2005
Projections used the 1999 audited financial statements as reference. The revised program of investments of
KSSA as agreed during negotiations was the basis for forthcoming investments (Page 4). Tariffs were left
The auditor conducted an audit in accordance with International Standards on Audit and expressed the opinion that
the financial statements represented fairly in all material aspects the financial situation of KSSA in conformity
with the IAS, apart from the two following exceptions: (i) for 1996 the auditor did not expressed an opinion on
the statements of operations and cash flow (first year of their engagement and insufficient data on 1995); (ii)
the auditor did not determine if the net value of tangible assets as revised by the application of revaluation
coefficient was appropriate to determine the fair value of the assets (as required by IAS).
2 No independent evaluation of the port gross fixed assets value has taken place. KSSA asset value was reindexed
twice in 1994 and 1995, but was not reindexed in 1991 and 1992 (indexation factors or 2.2 and 2.0-5.0) since
KSSA started its existence only in 1992.

unchanged in the projections. Graphs and pro-forma statements showing the projections are provided page
4-11 of this annex. Traffic projections are the one described in Annex 6 with a slightly reduced estimate for
the period 2000-2002. The statements include the lending to be provided by the present project as well as
the foreseen lending from the European Investment Bank. The investments from year 2001 onwards would
be implemented only to the condition that their financing is secured (self-financing, lending or new equity)
and each project is financiallyjustified given the evolution in actual and forecasted traffic.
Analysis 1999-2005
Ratio Analysis and Graph Analysis (p 5-7)
Liquidity. The level of current assets would reach a lowest of 1.2 times the current liabilities in 2002. Cash
would decrease temporarily as a result of the large program of investments, assumed to be mostly self-
financed under the projections. In case of cash shortage, it is foreseen that the KSSA will be able to borrow
against future investment activities.
Operating Performance. Over the period, the operating performance would remain stable as the port long-
termn rehabilitation investments are offset by traffic increases. The operating margin would remain above 39
percent (from 49 percent in 1998) and the operating ratio would remain below 61 percent. The rapid
expansion of the fixed assets would significantly increase the depreciation and maintenance costs. Close
monitoring of other operational expenditures will be required.
Profitability. The return on equity would exceed 6 percent over the period (high of 8 percent in 2002- low
of 6 percent in 2001). An independent financial review of each investment under the KSSA's program will
be required to ensure that these investments will exceed the borrowing rate for KSSA and the opportunity
cost of capital in Lithuania.
Debt Financial Coverage. The proposed debt coverage would be suitable as illustrated in the graphs "Debt
Impact of Tested Scenario" and "Interest Payment Impact". The debt service would not exceed 26 percent of
the funds available to repay the debt at its peak (in 2005). The operating income before interest would
represent a minimum of 4 times the interest expenses. The debt on equity ratio would not exceed 40 percent.
Income Statement (pp. 8 & 9)
Net Income. The annual net income would increase from US$8.5 million to US$16 million over the period
as a result of the faster growth of revenues than that of expenses (depreciation, maintenance and interest).
The growth of expenses will need to be closely monitored in connection with the actual growth in traffic
and revenues.
Revenue. The revenue would increase over the period 1999-2005 from US$23 million to US$40 million as
a result of traffic increases, notably in oil products and fertilizer. Traffic is expected to grow on average 10
percent annually during the 2000-2005 period and stabilize afterwards.
Expenses. Depreciation, maintenance and repair expenses would grow considerably (from US$6 million in
1999 to US$12 million in 2005) as a result of the sharp increase in the value of net fixed assets over the
period (progressively increasing to 350 percent of the 1996 value). These expenses would represent more
than 50 percent of expenses in 2005 (interest excluded). Interest payment would increase steadily to peak in
2003 at US$3.6 million (11 percent of operating revenues).
Cash Flow Statement (p. 13). The cash flow from operation would increase by 70 percent over the period
as the net income increase. The cash outflow from investing activities would reach US$31 million in 2003
underlying massive efforts to upgrade the port infrastructure. The cash inflow for financing activities would
include the World Bank lending of US$35.4 million.

Balance Sheet (p. 14). Despite its delayed investment program, this scenario offers a sustained growth of
the port assets from US$141 million in 1999 to US$256 million in 2005. This large growth would lead to
significant increase in capacity through increased efficiency. The level of long term liabilities would remain
acceptable throughout the period.
Main Conclusions. This scenario would provide an effective solution for modernizing the port facilities
and keeping it solvent. Some conditions are required for it to be sustainable:
- review on an annual basis the financial situation of the port and agree to proceed only with the elements
of the investment program for which the full financing is secured.
- any additional capacity should be considered only after an in-depth marketing study, including an
analysis of the development of competing ports and financial analysis have been done (failure to reach a
rate of return at least equal to the market borrowing interest rate plus one percent should lead to
rejection of the proposed investment).
- an independent evaluation of the fixed asset value should be performed in 2000.

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
KLAIPEDA PORT PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
An economic analysis, based on incremental costs and benefits derived from comparing the with/without
scenarios has been conducted for the project. All costs are expressed in 2000 constant prices, net of taxes
and subsidies. The 12 percent discount rate used in the analysis corresponds to the opportunity cost of
capital in Lithuania. Below are presented the basic assumptions and the results of the sensitivity and risk
analysis.
Evaluation Results
The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) on the investment component of the project is in excess of 41
percent, with a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$89 million. A summary of main assumptions and inputs can
be found in table 7 of this annex and a breakdown of costs and benefits in table 8.
With/Without Project Scenarios - Components and Costs
The scenarios, which have been studied for the economic analysis, are the following:
Without Project. The without project scenario represents the continued operation of the port in its current
condition, involving only the capital, operation and maintenance costs necessary to maintain the existing
nautical conditions (rehabilitation of existing breakwaters and maintenance dredging).
With Project. The with project scenario includes the civil works to improve the port accessibility,
consisting of: (i) a reconfigured, deepened and re-aligned bent channel; (ii) extensions of the northern and
southern breakwaters; (iii) improved mooring and fendering systems; and (iv) control and disposal of illegal
dumping of ship wastes. In addition to capital investments, the with project scenario also includes technical
services for: (i) training of port pilots; (ii) wave and current monitoring; and (iii) project supervision. The
rehabilitation of existing breakwaters and the maintenance dredging of the without project scenario are also
performed. Investment costs are US$39.7 million in 2000 U.S. dollars, net of taxes and subsidies. They
include physical contingencies, and exclude price contingencies. Incremental maintenance costs consist of
dredging works' to be carried-out after year 5.
The traffic forecasts, which have been used for the purpose of the economic analysis are presented in detail
in Annex 6, and are discussed in Chapter 1, Section E.
Benefits Streams
The improvements to the entrance channel of the Port of Klaipeda are expected to have the following
impacts: (i) reducing the risk of accidents while entering or exiting the port during periods of stormy
weather; (ii) reducing the cost of transport through Klaipeda by allowing access to deeper-draft vessels; (iii)
reducing the periods during which the port is closed due to weather conditions; and (iv) preventing the
breach of existing breakwaters that would cause a closure of the port. The economic benefits and costs
associated with the rehabilitation of existing breakwaters have not been taken into account in the evaluation,
since it would take place in both scenarios, due to its absolute and immediate necessity.
These impacts were quantified in terms of benefits in three broad categories: (i) safety improvements
(present value: US$11 million); (ii) transport cost savings (present value: US$46 million); and (iii)
economic surplus linked to transit traffic (present value: US$62 million). Consultation with users
revealed that the impact of extending the number of days, when vessels can enter or exit the port, will be
' An estimated 200,000 c.m. of material will be dredged after year 5 of implementation to maintain channel depth to 14
meters.

less significant. While the improved port entrance would increase capacity, actual port operational
capacity would remain constrained by the existing limitations of handling equipment during periods of
high wind. A capacity increase benefit was therefore not quantified in the evaluation.
Safety Improvements
This benefit accounts for 9% of the total benefits. The combination of pilot training, wave and current
monitoring systems, deeper and realigned channel, and extended breakwaters is expected to reduce vessel
accidents by 80 percent. On the basis of expected accident cost estimated at US$1I1 million and occurrence
every five years, the expected annual savings amount to US$1.8 million.
The reduction in vessel accidents as the result of the extension and realigmnent of the entrance channel and
breakwater were estimated based on the prior experience. Accidents involving sinking have taken place at a
rate of two per decade. The accidents occurred both when entering and departing the port. Most of the
accidents occurred during bad weather conditions. The causes appear to be a combination of sea conditions
at the entrance channel, human error and equipment failure. Avoidable accidents relate only to larger vessels
because of the inability of using tug boats without the project.
It was not possible to establish the relationship between the level of traffic and the likelihood of accidents2
but it is assumed that they are positively correlated and the relationship is non-linear.3 Both the volume and
size of vessels are thought to have changed relatively little over the last decade but are expected to change in
the future. The likelihood of accidents is also a function of the frequency and duration of severe storms, but
the data was not available to develop any correlation.
In order to simplify the analysis, the probability of an accident was assumed to be solely a function of time
and the process was assumed to be memory-less.4 That is, for each year, there is a fixed probability, P0, that
an accident will occur. The sample size did not permit developing separate probabilities for tankers and
bulkers or to differentiate by size of vessel. It was therefore assumed that the probability for each vessel type
and size group was proportional to percentage of calls by the subgroup. The analysis considered three types
of vessels, tankers, bulkers and other, and three size categories, 10-20 thousand Dwt., 20-40 thousand Dwt.
and 40-65 thousand Dwt.
In order to relate the probability of an accident to the cost of the accident, it was also necessary to
determine the condition of the vessel - whether it is loaded or in ballast. The risk of accident is greater when
a vessel is fully loaded. If a vessel is A times as likely to have an accident when it is loaded than when it is
empty and if the percentage of the movements (entries and exits) that involve loaded vessels is B, then the
probability that an unloaded vessel has an accident is P, defined by PO = NT[ A B + (I-B)] P,, where NT is
the total number of vessel movements.
The costs of an accident include the damage or loss of the vessel and its cargo, the cost to salvage the vessel
and any cost associated with cleaning up spilled bunkers, product or crude. There is also the cost of damage
to the environment. Because of the complexity of these outcomes, some typical events, their costs and
relative frequency were developed as shown in Table 1. The cost of loss of cargo was computed by
assuming an average value of US$250 per ton for bulk cargo and US$800 per ton for general cargo. The
cost for oil spills was assumed to be US$1,500 per ton.
The evaluation is based on one accident every five years. The probability distribution selected assumes that
more severe accidents are less likely to occur (see table 1). About 60% of the accidents of loaded vessels
Records of vessel traffic before 1994 were not available and those after 1994 could not be broken down by type.
The likelihood is relatively low for small volumes of traffic and will increase rapidly as the channel approaches
capacity. This suggests an exponential relationship.
4The likelihood of an event is not affected by the period since the last event.

were assumed to involve only damage to the vessel, 15% had sufficient damage to also affect the cargo, and
another 15% involve a limited fuel spill. Sinking would represent the remaining 10% of accidents. The
probability distribution is conservative in comparison with recent historical data (one sinking every five
years).

The expected cost of one accident was calculated as a function of vessel type, size and status (loaded or
not), using the matrix in Table 2. The costs were then multiplied by the corresponding frequency of each
category and added to obtain the expected cost of one accident (US$11 million).

Savings in Transport Costs
The benefits associated with the use of larger vessel account for 39% of the total benefits. The increase
in channel depth combined with the investments made by the port and the private sector in deepwater
berths and modern handling equipment will enable larger vessels ("Panamax" class) to use the port (see
page 13-14 of this Annex). The benefits will primarily derive from the reduction in the shipping cost for
existing traffic, i.e. oil products, the generation of additional oil product traffic as well as the generation,
attraction or avoidance of diversion for dry fertilizer products. The detailed estimation of savings is
presented below.
Shipping Cost Reduction
The reduction in transport costs arising from the deepening of the channel applies only to those trades which
will shift from the 40 thousand DWT vessels to the Panamax size. This is expected to be primarily the bulk
fertilizer shipments to the Americas and Asia and some petroleum product shipments to the Mediterranean
as discussed in details on page 13. These savings can be estimated by comparing the per ton voyage costs
for these two cargoes. A summary of the estimates used in computing these numbers is shown in Table 3.

Consultant's Estimates
The resulting voyage costs per ton for a Mediterranean and Asia voyage, the former with an empty
backhaul and the latter as a triangular voyage is shown in Table 4. The values were calculated using both
the current time charter rates for vessels and the long tern capital costs. These indicate a savings of
US$8-S l0 per ton for bulk cargo going to Asia and a savings of US$5 .50-7 per ton for bulk cargo going

to Mediterranean. For petroleum products bound for the Mediterranean, the savings would be between
US$4.75-$6.25 per ton.

Consultant's estimates
The savings in voyage costs are converted into project benefits in two ways:
?  Generated/Diverted Traffic - When the savings of using large vessels enables traffic generation or
diversion5 by serving more distant markets at a lower delivered cost, the benefits are taken as half of the
reduced voyage costs. This applies to the exports of fertilizer to Asia and the Americas (transit or
domestic production). To the extent that the fertilizer is produced domestically, these benefits will go to
the country but to the extent that they are transit cargo, i.e. Russian potash, the benefits will go to the
shippers. This also applies to the products to be exported by Maziekiai refinery at destination to the
Mediterranean Sea. The level of traffic in this category using Panamax-size vessels was estimated at 1.7
million tons by year 2005.
*  Normal Traffic - When the savings affect normal traffic that Klaipeda has by virtue of an existing
competitive advantage and that is expected to shift to Panamax vessel, the reduced voyage costs is
translated into benefits for the shippers. This traffic would keep on growing over the next 15 years as
the countries in the region recover. This group mostly includes diesel oil transit (0.1 million ton by
2005, 0.3 million ton by 2013) destined to the Mediterranean Sea, which is likely to be transported in
the large vessels.
Diversion is a combination of cargo diverted from other ports because Klaipeda will now have a competitive advantage
as well as cargo remaining at Klaipeda but that would have been lost to competing ports because of their competitive
advantage.



Annex 8
Page 6 of 14
The savings in voyage costs for oil product tankers and dry bulk fertilizers are shown in Table 4. The tanker
cargo carried in Panamax-class vessels is expected to be destined for the Mediterranean or the Americas. It
is assumed to be either generated or diverted cargo so that average savings per ton of cargo would be
US$2.75. The average savings for diesel oil traffic targeted to the Mediterranean Sea would be US$5.5 per
ton. The domestic fertilizer exported in Panamax-class vessels is expected to be destined to Asia and the
Americas. The former would be generated cargo and the latter diverted cargo. Assuming that the two
destinations receive approximately equal amounts, then the average savings would be US$7.50 per ton.
Transit Benefits
Transit benefits account for 52% of the project benefits. Since Klaipeda is primarily a transit port, the
benefits derived from an increase in its traffic is the complementary activities and logistic services
associated with the traffic. In this sense, the transit port is like a Free Trade Zone where the benefits from
improvements in the efficiency of the primary activity are captured by foreign companies, but the domestic
economy benefits from providing resources to these activities.
The project is expected to impact significantly the traffic through generation and diversion linked to reduced
shipping costs. Using the estimates above, about 1.6 million tons of additional traffic would come or remain
as a result of the project by 2005 and 3.2 million tons by 2013. The unit economic surplus linked to this
traffic was estimated to be 10.6 US$/ton, including the economic surplus in the port (5.3 US$/ton) and the
economic surplus resulting from land transport (5.3 US$/ton). The estimates used to assess this parameter
are shown in table 6. These estimates were based on discussions with the freight forwarder association, road
and rail transport companies and the port authorities. The project benefits are taken as half the economic
surplus.
Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values
Detailed results are shown in detail below for: (i) changes of 20 percent in project costs; (ii) changes of 20
percent in diversion coefficient costs; (iii) changes of 20 percent in the value of time; (iv) changes of 30
percent in expected Panamax-size traffic. The results indicate that the project would still be economically
justified in all cases. The switching value analysis (value of the modified parameter for which NPV is 0)
confirmn that robustness. The project would provide a return of 12 percent even if the investment was
multiplied by 4, the accident cost fell to zero, the voyage savings fell to zero, the economic surplus per ton
of diverted or generated cargo fell to zero, or the volume of Panamax traffic fell to 17 percent of the
estimate.

Risk Analysis
Risk Analysis. A risk analysis, a Montecarlo simulation with 10,000 random samples, has been performed
to assess the potential outcomes of the project and to determine the sensitive parameters. The assumptions
selected for this risk analysis were : the expected volume of Panamax-class traffic, the estimated accident
cost, the estimated voyage cost savings, the economic surplus per ton of diverted/generated cargo and the
project costs. A triangular-shaped distribution of probability was used for traffic, a lognormal distribution
for project costs and normal distributions for other assumptions around the estimates (see page 12). The
results are presented below.

This analysis gives a clear justification to the project. The project is likely with a probability of 95 percent
to have a net present value of more than US$70 million. The median values are US$86 million for the net
present value and 34 percent for the intemal rate of return. The sensitivity analysis conducted during the risk
analysis shows that four parameters have a significant impact on the results of the economic analysis: (i) the
economic surplus per ton with a correlation coefficient of 0.59 with the NPV; (ii) the traffic volume



Annex 8
Page 8 of 14
(correlation of 0.68); (iii) the investment costs (correlation of -0.25); and (iv) the voyage cost savings
(correlation of 0.2). Given the origin of the transit traffic - Russia and Belarus, the risks associated with this
parameter are significant and explain the comprehensive traffic analysis carried out during appraisal. The
detailed engineering study provides a fairly accurate level of construction costs and consequently reduce the
risk linked to this parameter. The two other parameters do not relate to actual risks.

Volume of Cargo Affected-Traffic Assumptions
Since the majority of the cargoes that would be carried in larger vessels are bulk cargoes, the vessels are
primarily voyage charters which can easily be replaced with larger vessels. This replacement will depend
on the size of the consignments and the distances traveled. An indication of the potential for replacement
with larger vessels can be determined by comparing the size of vessels which call at Ventspils and
Tallinn both of which can handle vessels with draft of up to 16 meters. This comparison is based on data
collected in 1997 6 The results are shown in Figures I to 3.
For the oil products carriers (POL), there is a relatively
small demand for vessels over 40 thousand Dwt at   % of            Fig 8.1. POL Carriers

is anticipated that the proportion of vessels over 40         Klpeda    Ventspils  Riga    ETaIIinn

For the bulk carriers, the use of vessels over 40

may be as large as 15%. This is due to the fact that the   50%

percentage of Panamax size vessels will rise to 15%,
matching that of Ventspils.
The other liquid bulks are primarily liquid fertilizers, much of which is shipped in chemical tankers. For
these, there is a clear size restriction as shown in Figure 3. The size of consignments is not large enough to
permit the deployment of larger vessels. Only Ventspils appears to have a market niche for Panamax size
chemical carriers. The current volumes of shipment from Klaipeda are not sufficient to justify a substantial
increase in the size of chemical carriers, so the deepening of the channel is expected to have little impact.

The distribution of vessel sizes is expected to change as the volume of cargo handled increases, but this will
not be the same for all groups of vessels. The past three years have seen a dramatic fluctuation in the
average size of tankers as shown in Table 9, however, this does not appear to be correlated with the volume
of cargo. It is only with substantial increases in volume that a permanent shift is expected. The size for dry
cargo vessels which include bulkers, containers and general cargo vessels has been relatively steady. The
bulkers accounted for about 280 vessel calls and had an average size estimated to be 24 thousand DWT. The
vessel size distribution is expected to shift to larger vessels as volume increases and more distant markets
are served.

The container vessels accounted for only about 100 vessels calls. The average size of the container vessels
may increase from the current 250-325 TEU range. However, even with a strong increase in traffic vessel
size is unlikely to go above 500 TEU since trade is expected to continue to be a combination of shortsea and
feeder services. The average size of the general cargo vessels is about 4000 DWT, but this includes vessels
ranging in size from 500 DWT to more than 20 thousand DWT. The average size of RoRo vessels has
declined in the past three years due to a rationalization of the fleet and decline of rail wagon traffic. A strong
growth in demand is likely to produce more frequent sailings rather than an increase in vessel size due to the
shortsea nature of some services and the growing importance of more frequent services to compete with the
all-road route to Europe.

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
KLAIPEDA PORT PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA)l
The Klaipeda Harbour entrance will be improved by the construction of two new breakwaters to
extent the existing breakwaters, by the rehabilitation of the two existing breakwaters and by
deepening and widening the entrance channel and a part of the harbour basin to - 14 meters.
The sediments to be dredged under this project comprise various types of soils of which a part is
contaminated. Of these sediments, all clean sands will be beneficially used. The contaminated
sediments would need to be dredged separately and stored in a confined disposal facility.
However, no such facility yet exists. The remaining clean glacial till and silt sediments will be
dumped at a designated disposal site about 20 kilometres offshore from Klaipeda. The project
and its impacts on the environment are extensively described in the Environment Impact
Assessment Report of the project, the executive summary of which is presented below.
The main purpose of the port entrance rehabilitation is to reduce wave penetration into the port
and give larger vessels improved and safe access to the port. The design works are financed by a
grant from Netherlands and Japanese Governments.
Need for Rehabilitation
The Port of Klaipeda is the main port of Lithuania. It is located on the south-east coast of the
Baltic Sea at the entrance of the Curonian lagoon. Particularly during the winter months, under
rough weather conditions, navigation through the entrance channel is dangerous and the deep
water berths at the oil port and the Klasco Port are unusable.
In the recent past a number of accidents occurred with ships running out of control at the
entrance of Klaipeda Port. Over the last 15 years four major accidents occurred. In two of these
cases the ship was wrecked and in one case there was major damage to a quay and cranes. One of
the accidents involved a tanker and resulted in a large oil spill. Taking the traffic volume into
consideration four major accidents in such a short period is clearly excessive.
From the above it can be concluded that in its present state the nautical safety of the port is
below international standards under severe weather. In addition it is to be noted that the
harbour's breakwaters (especially the Southern one) have sustained damage during recent storms
and possible further damage would enhance the problems just mentioned.
Alternatives Evaluated
Three alternatives were considered under the EIA to address the need for rehabilitation.
Alternative 1: No-Action
In this alternative the present situation will remain unchanged. The proposed project will not be
executed, which means neither dredging nor construction activities will be carried out. This
alternative is taken as the "neutral" reference for comparison of the other two alternatives.
Alternative 2: The Proposed Project
This alternative includes the construction of two new breakwaters and dredging of approximately
2 million m3 of sand, silt and glacial till sediments. In this project alternative, all dredged sands
(from the outer entrance channel) wou Id be beneficially used for near shore or beach

replenishment. All silt sediments as well as all the glacial till sediments will be disposed off at
the designated offshore disposal site. In this alternative all non sand sediments will be dredged as
one volume, which means that no differentiation would be made between clean and contaminated
sediments and between silt sand and glacial till.
Alternative 3: The Proposed Project plus Confined Disposal Facility (CDF)
This alternative is the same as the proposed project, but with some changes in the execution of
the dredging works. In this alternative the contaminated sediments will be dredged separately
from the clean sediments and subsequently stored in a Confined Disposal Facility (CDF). With
respect to the CDF it is to be noted that the feasibility, the design characteristics and the location
for implementation are still to be worked out. Some initial studies have been carried in this
respect. Dredging of the contaminated sediments will be done in line with modern practice of
removing contaminated sediments, i.e. with high dredging accuracy, minimal turbidity and re-
suspension of contaminated sediments and minimal spill. This alternative would be in full
compliance with Lithuanian law and international agreements on environmental protection of the
Baltic Sea, of which Lithuania is signatory (Helsinky, 1992, and Gdansk, 1993).
Proposed Action
Each alternative was evaluated on a number of criteria both for (i) the construction period and
the subsequent operational phase and (ii) compliance with international environmental
regulations. Although the proposed project (alternative ii) already has a significant positive
environmental impact by reducing navigation hazards and consequently oil pollution risks at the
Klaipeda port, the planned offshore disposal of contaminated sediments is considered to be a
violation of international environmental agreements.
Consequently, alternative 3 has been selected as the Preferred alternative and Proposed Action.
This alternative will require the implementation of a CDF. The CDF, which can be constructed
from uncontaminated dredged materials (Glacial till), should be designed to solve not only the
contaminated sediment problem from this project, but also to provide a solution for other
contaminated sediment problems elsewhere in the port areas. Details on contaminated sediments
elsewhere in the port are discussed below.

An opportunity to review the draft version of the EIA (in the Lithuanian language) was
announced twice in the local Klaipeda newspaper. Public response was limited and the Port
Authorities received no formal comments on the EIA by December 31, 1998. In December 1998,
copies of the draft EIA have been presented to the Lithuanian Ministry of the Environment, the
Klaipeda Municipality, the Klaipeda County Governor's Administration, the Klaipeda public
health centre of the Ministry of Health, the fire-fighting department of the Ministry of Home
Affairs, the Project Expertise Bureau, the KSSA and to representatives of the World Bank, for
review.
A technical public hearing was organised by the Port Authorities on May 11, 1999. The
discussions focussed on the costs of the breakwaters, the direct benefits of the works for
Lithuanian contractors and the width of the harbour opening. A public hearing on the
environmental aspects of the project and the resulting EIA was organised by the Port Authorities
on September 15, 1999. During the meeting serious concerns were expressed by the participants
in relation to the delay in implementing a Confined Disposal Facility for safe storage of
contaminated sediments and regarding the damage of offshore dumping of dredged sediments on
fisheries. The findings of the public hearings have been included in the EIA.

Alternative Analysis
The impact assessments and use-conflict criteria were divided into two groups, those related to
the construction activities during the project and those related to the subsequent operations at the
rehabilitated port entrance. The evaluation of each alternative included the consideration of all
impacts possibly detrimental and their possible mitigation, or beneficial impacts that could result
from implementation of the alternatives.
Major positive effects are expected in relation to navigational conditions and safety, and the
related reduction of oil spill risks. The new breakwaters will also have a small positive effect on
fisheries and aquatic life in the project area.
The project is expected to result in higher future maintenance costs and would have a negative
effect on water quality in the Baltic Sea if contaminated sediments are dumped at the offshore
disposal site.
During construction, several detrimental effects are to be expected. However, as all of these
effects are related to the construction and dredging activities they are all of a temporary nature.
This means they will stop once the project is finished. Included in these temporary effects are
detrimental effects on water quality, aquatic life, especially if contaminated sediments are
dredged without precautions. Small detrimental effects are expected in relation to fisheries,
navigation (hindrance) and urban land traffic. Mitigating measures to minimise the indicated
negative effects are presented in this report.

Preferred Alternative
Alternative 3 has been selected as the so-called Preferred Alternative and was presented
accordingly to the Port Authorities in the draft EIA (September 1998). This alternative was found
to have the same benefits as alternative 2, but the least and less severe negative impacts, while
still meeting the goal of KSSA, e.g. a safer and more economic port.
Encroachment on Preferred Alternative and Proposed Action
During the execution of the EIA study for the project, upon initiative of KSSA, the area to be
dredged under this project was split into two tenders. One tender organised by Frederic R. Harris
(FRH) and with possible finance by from a World Bank loan, covering the (re)construction of the
breakwaters and the dredging (practically) from the existing coastline seawards. The other tender
organised by the Lithuanian Energy Institute (LEI) and financed by KSSA itself, covering the
dredging from the existing coastline land inwards. The dredging area under the FRH tender
comprises only clean sediments, whereas practically all surface sediments under the LEI tender
can be classified as contaminated under the Lithuanian classification system.
In view of the fact that a CDF had not yet been implemented, the KSSA requested permission
from the Lithuanian Ministry of the Environment to be allowed to dump the contaminated
sediments present in the dredging area covered under the LEI tender at sea. Although not in line
with the concept of environmental protection, or the international attempts to improve the water
quality of the Baltic Sea - measures to improve the water quality in and around Klaipeda are
listed as priority actions under the Baltic Sea Programme approved by the regional Ministers of
Environment at Helsinki (April 1992) and Gdansk (March 1993) - this permission was granted
and early 1999 dredging in the LEI area started. During the summer of 1999 practically all
contaminated and clean sediments had been dredged in the LEI dredging area and had been
dumped offshore.
Consequently, with no contaminated sediments present in the dredging area covered under the
FRH tender and all the contaminated sediments already removed from the LEI dredging area, the
so-called preferred alternative as developed in this EIA would appear no longer relevant for this
project.
However, there is still a considerable volume of contaminated sediments left in various parts of
the Klaipeda port to be rehabilitated at a later stage. Lithuanian experts estimate the present
volume of class 3 and 4 sediments at approximately 200,000 - 400,000 m3. Undoubtedly, more
contaminated sediments will be formed (deposited) in enclosed port areas in the years ahead.
This demonstrates that the implementation of a CDF remains very relevant.
According the Minister of Transport and Communications, the project for storage of
contaminated sediments will form part of the Public Investment programme and the Tina
programme as a separate project. The implementation of this project is anticipated in 2001.
Environmental Management Program
Based on the findings of the EIA it is clear that the execution of the Klaipeda Port Entrance
Rehabilitation Project will influence a variety of environmental aspects. Therefore an
Environmental Management Program (EMP) has been developed, which contains the evaluation
of the most significant environmental effects, defines adequate measures to mitigate them, and
establishes a monitoring program to measure and control both the impacts and the effectiveness
of the mitigating measures. The objectives of the EMP are to:
* Ensure compliance with all pertinent environmental legislation and international
agreements



Annex 9
Page 5 of 22
*  Ensure environmental-friendly practices in relation to dredging and disposal works
*  Give priority to preventive measures in preference to corrective measures
*  Promote two-way communication with the local communities
Additional works directly related to this project have been identified as well. These works
include:
*  The set-up of a nautical and environmental database system for storage and retrieval
of relevant data and information for better planning of future port development
projects.
*  A study of remedial measures related to the contaminated sediment problems of the
Port.
*  The development of a CDF for storage of contaminated sediments.
With respect to the EMP it is to be noted that several aspects of the works are still unclear, e.g.
the equipment and working methods of the selected contractor, the source and transport of the
breakwater construction materials, etc. Consequently, the EMP presented is to be considered a
Final Draft version, which is to be elaborated and finalised when the selected contractor has
made relevant details available.
On the basis of the information provided in the EIA (section 1 to 7), a matrix of environmental
aspects has been prepared, giving a summary possible relevant effects on the natural and social
environment. This matrix has been used to facilitate the definition of the mitigating measures and
the development of the monitoring program.
Mitigation Measures
Environmental Impact Assessment studies are designed to identify environmental problems,
which may be caused by a development project, and to determine the magnitude of the effects on
the environment. Through this process, design and operational changes can be introduced in the
detailed design phase of the project, minimising any adverse effects of the development.
This is also true for the Klaipeda Port Entrance Rehabilitation project. The design of both the
entrance channel and the new breakwaters was oriented towards providing better protection
against waves and improvement of the navigational and safety conditions. This by itself strongly
reduces the risks of oil spills and is to be noted as a major benefit for the environment. With the
new layout (and other safety measures taken) the port entrance design will comply with
international safety standards.
The beneficial usage of dredged sand for beach or near shore replenishment was also based on
environmental considerations, i.e. preventing further coastal erosion. This will be the first time
clean dredged sediments will be beneficially used in Lithuania.
Nevertheless, for some aspects of the project mitigating measures have been identified to prevent
or reduce possible detrimental effects. Two measures are related to the operational phase
(consequences) of the project, whereas the remaining measures are related to the construction
phase of the works.
A. Mitigating Measures Related to the Operational Phase of the Project
Set-Up of an Automated Database System
Future maintenance dredging costs are expected to increase as more sedimentation in the
navigational channel is anticipated. In this respect it is important to note, that the removal of
sediments by dredging from the coastal zone with disposal offshore has been identified as one of
the possible causes of coastal erosion along the Klaipeda coastal area. To facilitate the planning



Annex 9
Page 6 of 22
of beneficial usage of the sediments originating from maintenance dredging works (e.g.
relocating the sediments at appropriate locations within the coastal zone, beach replenishment,
etc.), a database system is to be set up. Information regarding the locations, types, quality and
quantities of the sediments to be dredged are stored in the database for future analyses. With
sediment characteristics and quantities known in advance (proven records), beneficial usage can
be better planned. This database system should be easy accessible and PC based. In addition to
storage of the sediment characteristics of maintenance projects, the database can also be used to
store other soil/sediment-related information and other environmental relevant information. This
would facilitate future planning of development projects by the Port Authorities.
Introduction of Alien Species
The increase in size and number of ships entering the port will result in increased risk of alien
species invasion. To mitigate this effect, which is associated with ballast water, appropriate
measures as indicated in the IMO guidelines should be taken by the Port Authorities.
B. Mitigating Measures Related to Project Construction
During the construction phase some temporary negative effects are foreseen. For these effects the
following mitigating measures are developed.
Protection of Fish Migration Routes and Spawning Areas
The Lithuanian Ministry of the Environment has already to some degree regulated dredging
operations, which might interfere with fish migration. These regulations are known as "Order No
67", titled "On the assessment of the effects of Klaipeda port dredging works on fisheries".
These regulations comprise both strong and weak points. Strong points are that dredging is only
allowed during fish spawning migration in case of "urgent necessity". Secondly, the dredging
contractor is to provide information regarding the planned dredging works and the measures
taken to reduce the negative effects on fish migration. In case of dredging during the fish
spawning migration periods the dredging contractor is to pay a fee for possible damage caused.
The first weak point is that the fees are so low that they will not put any restriction on dredging
from a financial point of view. Secondly, in the course of the dredging works the port must carry
out a monitoring investigation of migration intensity and the effects of dredging on migrating
fish. (Assessment of the latter is believed to be practically impossible, as there are too many
other parameters besides dredging that might affect fish migration such as natural variability of
currents, flow directions, discharge of waste water, spills, shipping, other port related activities,
etc.)
Thirdly, the regulations do not in any way protect the spawning areas on the existing
breakwaters.
In view of the above, the dredging contractor should plan the dredging works outside the fish
spawning migration periods to the maximum extent possible. Besides, the Contractor is to take
protective measures for the breakwater spawning areas (to prevent smothering by resettling
sediments), if and when required.
As less intense fish migrations across the Klaipeda Strait take place throughout the year,
dredging and the resulting increased levels of re-suspended sediments are likely to affect fish
migration in any period of the year. To mitigate these effects special attention should be paid to
predicting, monitoring and minimising turbidity generation during the dredging operations.
Note: With practically all the contaminated sediments removed from the study area and no
contaminated sediments found present in the remaining dredging area of the proposed Bank



Annex 9
Page 7 of 22
project, the mitigating measures for dredging and disposal of contaminated sediments (as given
below) are no longer relevant for the dredging works forming part of the proposed Bank project.
However, as there is still a considerable volume of contaminated sediments left in various parts
of the Klaipeda port, the implementation of a CDF is as relevant as an adapted dredging
methodology for these areas. More detailed information regarding the present situation on
contaminated sediments, the need to carry out a remedial study and the development of a CDF is
presented in the section on additional works below.
Dredging Clean and Contaminated Sediments
The lack of differentiation between dredging clean and contaminated sediments will result in
negative effects on water quality (re-suspension and dispersion of contaminated sediments and
release of contaminants to the water column), aquatic life and fisheries. Besides, offshore open
water disposal of contaminated sediments will not only have a temporary and local negative
effect on water quality (during disposal), but also a more permanent and more widespread
negative effect. The contaminated sediments will be dispersed over a wide area (litho-
dynamically active zone) and will act as a source of pollution.
The effects in the dredging areas can be mitigated by removing the contaminated sediments
separately from the clean sediments in a manner appropriate for the removal of contaminated
sediments (high accuracy dredging, no or minimal turbidity generation and minimal spillage).
The dredging contractor should prepare a method statement on the removal of the contaminated
sediments, in line with modem dredging practice.
Disposal of Contaminated Sediments
The effects in the disposal area can be mitigated by not allowing contaminated sediments (above
a certain level of contamination) to be dumped at sea. A confined disposal area should be
prepared for safe storage of these sediments.
In addition, periodic testing should be carried out to verify that the sediments, which are to be
dumped at the offshore disposal site, do not contain hazardous materials.
Offshore Disposal of Uncontaminated Dredged Sediments
At present four open water disposal areas for dredged sediments exist in the Klaipeda coastal
zone. Two of these sites have been closed, whereas the other two are still in operation. A fifth
disposal area is being studied. All these disposal sites may affect fisheries positively or
negatively. Disposal of glacial till sediments (including rocklike hard clay and boulders) is
planned to take place at disposal area III, located more than 20 kilometres from the Port entrance.
The presence of mounds of rocklike clay and boulders make these areas less suitable/ attractive
for certain types of fishing (bottom trawling). To minimise the damage to fisheries caused by
disposal of dredged sediments, disposal should be restricted to the designated disposal site.
However, in view of the long transport distance to this disposal site and the related costs, it is not
unthinkable that disposal of dredged sediments from barges also takes place at shorter distances
from the port entrance. These "unplanned" and uncharted dumping at various locations between
the port entrance and the official disposal site have already caused serious damage to the fishing
industry in general and fishing gear in particular.
To ensure proper disposal of the dredged sediments, the barges should be equipped with a GPS
(or better) positioning system and a PC-based electronic monitoring system for continuous
recording of the parameters time, position and load data.



Annex 9
Page 8 of 22
Beach or Foreshore Replenishment
The sandy sediments dredged at the entrance channel will be beneficially used for prevention and
remedial of coastal erosion. However, special care should be taken in case the sandy sediments
contain inclusions of clay-balls or silt sediments. In view of the recreational value of the beach
areas, these "mixed cargoes" should not be used for beach or dune replenishment. When the
cargoes contain limited amounts of clay-balls or silt sediments, they can be used for foreshore
replenishment. In case too much silt is present in the cargo, the load should not be used for
replenishment purposes, but should be redirected to the offshore disposal site.
Planning of Navigation During the Construction Works
To minimise the interference of stationary dredging equipment and the construction of the
breakwaters with other maritime traffic two mitigating measures should be taken. Firstly,
planning of the works should be done in such a way that the interference with maritime traffic is
minimised. The contractor should provide a method statement in this respect. Secondly, a
program should be developed by the Port Authorities in advance of the works, to co-ordinate and
further reduce this interference. This program is to include aspects like advance warning to other
maritime traffic of closure of areas and presence of equipment, but also advance warning to the
contractor(s) of relevant maritime traffic, e.g. arrival or departure of oil tankers or other large
ships.
Hindrance and Information to the Public
No matter how well planned, the construction of the new breakwaters, the repair works for the
existing breakwaters and the dredging and replenishment works will cause hindrance to the
people who are living, working or recreating at or near these sites. To mitigate this effect, ample
attention should be paid to informing the public about the project, its timing and its progress.
Planning of Road Transport During the Construction Works
In case considerable road transport is foreseen as a consequence of the works (e.g. supply of
breakwater construction materials to the site and transport of sand to beach and/or dune areas),
similar mitigating measures to those for navigation should be taken with respect to road
transport.
Pollution Cused by the Cnstruction Ativities
Pollution related to the construction activities can be caused by the equipment used, e.g.
dredgers, cranes, etc., and at the construction site(s), e.g. construction of concrete armour units,
storage areas for solid and liquid wastes, storage areas for stockpiling construction materials, etc.
To mitigate these forms of pollution, the contractor should be requested to supply an anti-
pollution method statement. In this statement measures taken to prevent or minimise pollution,
including spillage during bunkering and waste handling, should be indicated. The statement
should also include a clean-up plan to be carried out after completion of the works.
NOTE: In the contractual arrangements relating to the environmental and social management of
the project, the above mitigating measures will be included (Conditions of Particular
Application of the contract between the KSSA and the Contractor).
Environmental Monitoring
The main objectives of the monitoring program can be described as follows:
The works should comply with laws, rules, regulations and permit requirements. This is the legal
basis for the monitoring program.



Annex 9
Page 9 of 22
The learning objective for future planning. This is the common sense basis for the monitoring
program.
With respect to the proposed project and in line with the mitigating measures, the monitoring
activities can be split into two sections, i.e. monitoring related to the operational phase of the
new Port entrance (design consequences) and monitoring related to the construction activities of
the project (operational control).
The monitoring activities related to the operational phase are long term monitoring activities and
fall under the responsibility of the Port Authorities. The monitoring activities related to the
construction activities are mainly control monitoring activities and are the responsibility of the
Contractor and/or the Port Authorities. Management and execution of the monitoring activities
are discussed in section "C" below.
A. Monitoring Related to the Operational Phase of the Project
Permanent Reduction in Hydraulic Resistance in the Klaipeda Strait
Due to the dredging works in the sea access channel and the northem harbour area, the flow
conditions in the Klaipeda Strait will change. The expected permanent reduction of the hydraulic
resistance of the Strait will have a variety of secondary effects, like:
e  changes in flow characteristics and discharge rates
*  changes in sediment transport and sedimentation/erosion processes,
*  changes in salt intrusion into the lagoon,
*  water level changes in the lagoon
It is expected that the present project may result in a 3-4% initial increase in discharge and may
lead to approximately 2 cm lower water levels in the lagoon during outflow periods. Based on the
LEI dredging study (LEI 1997), it is clear that considerable additional deepening dredging works
are foreseen for the area from the present project up to Alksnyne (more than 5 kilometres in the
direction of the lagoon). If executed these dredging works will lead to a much larger reduction in
hydraulic resistance (up to 10%) and subsequently in stronger secondary effects.
In order to indicate the environmental effects of the planned works with more accuracy, the
effects of the present project should be assessed by monitoring several key characteristics before
and after the present project. The key characteristics should include: water flows in time,
suspended sediment levels, salt intrusion measurements and water level registrations. Several of
these measurements are already included in ongoing monitoring programs, but coordination may
be required.
Coastline Development
A clear difference of opinion exists between scientists about the littoral drift in the study area.
Depending on the expert the execution of the project (and mainly the construction of the
breakwaters) may have a considerable or an insignificant effect on coastline development. To
make sure severe coastal erosion effects are noted in time to take preventive or mitigating
actions, the coastline both north and south of the access channel should be monitored.
The information should not only include details of the actual location of the coastline (sea-land
interface), but should also include changes in the dune/beach, as well as the near shore
topography. For this purpose both land and near shore topographic measurements are required on
a regular basis (extended hydro-graphic survey area). A part of these monitoring activities are
already included in ongoing monitoring programs.



Annex 9
Page 10 of 22
Maintenance Dredging and Beneficial Usage of Dredged Sediments
Regular monitoring is required with respect to changes in sedimentation in the navigational
channel and the northern harbour part, to study the effects of the project on maintenance
dredging. The resulting information is to include information on the characteristics of the
sediments (type of sediment, grain size distribution and level of pollution) in view of possible
beneficial usage. The proposed monitoring activities are part of the normal maintenance dredging
related activities, which may need to be adjusted to fulfil the present and future needs.
The data resulting from all the above monitoring programs should be stored in a so-called
"Nautical and Environmental Database System" (N&EDS) for analyses and future use.
Background information on the N&EDS is presented in the section on additional works below.
B. Monitoring Related to the Construction Activities of the Project
Increased Levels of Suspended Sediments - Turbidity
Re-suspension and dispersion of fine sediments will take place during dredging operations and
during placement of the construction materials. In view of fish migration and nearby spawning
areas monitoring of this aspect is required.
The resulting information should indicate the scale of re-suspension for the various types of
dredger and auxiliary equipment, the various types of sediment or construction materials, as well
as the dispersion in time and place. Based on the monitoring information additional mitigating
measures may be developed if and when required.
Fish migration and spawning during the construction and dredging works are to be monitored as
well. The key parameters for fish migration should include: type of species, migration routes and
migration intensity. For fish spawning the key parameters should include: spawning locations,
timing and duration of spawning, period till hatching, spreading of fry, temperature and
suspended sediment levels.
Dredging Contaminated Sediments
In case contaminated sediments are to be dredged, the relevant characteristics of this type of
dredging should be monitored, e.g. accuracy of dredging, turbidity and spillage. The resulting
information should indicate differences between the design level and the dredged level in
centimetres.
Offshore Disposal
To ensure that dredged sediments are only dumped at the designated offshore disposal site,
control monitoring is required. For this purpose the equipment to be used for transporting the
sediments to the offshore disposal site should be equipped with:
a GPS-positioning system (or better)
a PC and related software to record: date, time, position, and load information (based on depth
gauges of the barge/transport-ship).
Beach or Foreshore Replenishment
To ensure that only sand and no silt and clay balls are placed on the beach, the dredging
contractor should carefully monitor the loading process during dredging. Each load should be
judged individually in order to assess if the load is suitable for beach replenishment, for near
shore replenishment or should go to the offshore disposal site.



Annex 9
Page 11 of 22
Anti-Pollution Program
To ensure compliance with the anti-pollution program as is to be presented by the contractor,
control monitoring in the form of independent incidental audits during and after completion of
the works are required. Items to be included in the control monitoring are: fuel bunkering, waste
handling, storage facilities and construction facilities.
C. Institutional Aspects of the Monitoring Program
As the owner of the project, the Port Authority is responsible for monitoring the design
consequences of the project (operational phase). The monitoring activities, part of the works
supervision contract (see below), should be extended to cover up to 10 years after the works have
been completed and would include:
*  Reduction of hydraulic resistance and related effects
* Changes in coastline development
* Changes in maintenance dredging volumes
As parts of these monitoring activities are already part of ongoing monitoring programs, it is
recommended that the KSSA and its consultants will work out detailed monitoring programs in
close co-operation with the third parties involved.
In view of the direct involvement of KSSA in the project, it is recommended that an independent
monitoring agent is appointed to oversee and conduct monitoring related to the construction
activities. The "Construction Supervision Team (CST)" to be appointed for the execution of the
works, is proposed to be this independent monitoring agency for the following reasons:
*  It has a clear commitment to ensure the works are undertaken according the contract
and the EMP.
*  The CST follows project planning and daily activities, which facilitates monitoring
activities.
*  The CST has direct and communication lines with both the Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) and the Contractor. This greatly facilitates quick responses as required in
cases of non-compliance.
*  The CST is directly involved in technical monitoring, like production processes and
work progress. Items that are directly related to the environmental monitoring
program, e.g., turbidity control.
It is foreseen that for specific monitoring activities, like fish migration, fish spawning and other
field measurements, the CST is expected to be assisted by experts from Lithuanian institutes, e.g.
the Klaipeda University, the Marine Research Centre, The Fishery Research Laboratory, the
Institute of Geography and the Vilnius University.
Based on the planning and the work methods of the contractor, and in line with the items
presented in this EMP, the CST is to work out a detailed works program for the environmental
monitoring activities for the proposed Bank project as well as the Klaipeda Port Rehabilitation
Program. The CST work program is to include the monitoring topics, the monitoring strategy,
timing, frequency of measurements, people and equipment involved, and related costs. The
monitoring works program is to be completed before the start of the execution of project works,
and would continue beyond project completion.
A series of report requirements and communication channels have been identified under this
EMP:
*  Weekly progress reports from the CST to the Project Implementation Unit



Annex 9
Page 12 of 22
*  Daily and weekly reporting on specific topics by involved third parties to the CST
*  Reporting between the Project Implementation Unit and the Funding Institution(s)
*  Regular communication and coordination on a regular basis between the Project
implementation Unit and the Ministry of the Environment
*  Daily coordination between the CST and the Contractor(s)
The main players and reporting modes are outlined in the framework given below.
NOTE. The contractor will be directly involved in the monitoring activities by allowing access to
his working sites and equipmen, and dredging and construction planning. This will be reflected
in the contractual arrangements relating to the environmental and social management of the
project this will be reflected

Additional Works
The following additional works directly related to the project have been recommended:
1. Set-up of a database system for dredging and environmental data



Annex 9
Page 13 of 22
2. A contaminated sediment remediation program
3. The design and implementation of a CDF for contaminated sediments
Additional Works 1: Database System for Nautical and Environmental Data
The data and infornation which had to be collected for the proposed Bank project, included a
variety of environmental and dredging related data, e.g. bottom topography, sediment
composition, layer thickness, levels of contamination, water quality characteristics, dredged
areas, dredged volumes and characteristics, hydro-graphic survey data, salinity data, levels of
suspended sediments, fishery data, etc.
Although substantial information was known to exist, it was sometimes very hard or even
impossible to have the data made available to the study team. Although several earlier studies
were carried out on behalf of the Port Authorities, most of the information and data was only
available from the original source (private company, public organisation or University experts).
Besides the information was fragmented, incomplete and sometimes incompatible. Data on levels
of sediment contamination were considered "Classified" and only a part of the information could
be bought from the original sources.
This situation is a clear disadvantage to the Port Authorities, being the manager of the entire
Klaipeda port area. Not only it caused considerable delays to the Bank project, but the lack of a
central knowledge base, or "Nautical and Environmental Database System" (N&EDS) also
hampers proper planning of future development projects. With respect to the wish of Lithuania to
become part of the European Community, it must be noted that the present situation is not in line
with the 1990 EC Directive on freedom of access to information on the environment.
It is clear that information availability can be improved by creating a N&EDS for the Port
Authorities. By storing and analysing nautical and environmental information, future works and
activities of the Port Authorities can be better planned, e.g. maintenance dredging, beneficial
usage of dredged sediments, contaminated sediment problems, coastal erosion problems, etc.
Besides, by making data and information free and easy accessible to third parties, the data and
information can also be used for other than their original purpose, e.g. coastal zone management,
fishery research, education, in-house training, marketing of port services, etc.
The N&EDS should be PC based and should include so-called GIS (Geographical Information
System) software. In this way data can be presented on standard maps and charts. The retrieval of
information and knowledge should be facilitated by use of simple records accessible through
Internet-based gateways.
Although developed with and for the Port Authorities, the N&EDS should also be promoted and
developed in close co-operation with other possible end-users, especially University experts.
This to ensure that the results from research projects, surveys and monitoring activities will find
their way into the database system as well.
The development of the N&EDS, including the purchase of hardware and software, the design of
the database structure, implementation, testing and training, reporting and external consultant, is
estimated at approximately US$150,000.
Additional Works 2: A Contaminated Sediment Remedial Program
A serious problem with respect to the contaminated sediment issue and consequently with
planning of the capacity of a CDF (Confined Disposal Facility) is the fact that there are no
accurate data available regarding the volumes of contaminated sediment present, the variations in
layer thickness, the toxicity of the contaminated sediments, easiness to dredge and effects of



Annex 9
Page 14 of 22
dredging tolerances on dredged volumes, treatment options to minimise the volumes to be stored,
etc.
To fill this information gap, a remedial program is highly recommended. This program should
preferably be carried out as a joint effort by the CST and Lithuanian experts. The total costs of
the program, including limited field sampling and laboratory analyses are estimated at
approximately US$200.000.
Background Information on Presence of Contaminated Sediments
In the summer of 1998 the Geographical Institute in Vilnius (Lithuania) executed an extensive
investigation on the presence of contaminants throughout the port of Klaipeda. Sediment samples
were taken in 192 positions from the port entrance up to and including Malku Bay. The results of
the investigations have been reported separately (Geographical Institute, 1998) and have also
been used in a preliminary report to the implementation of a confined disposal facility
(Association of Lithuanian Hydro-biologists, 1999). The results of the investigations show that
most of the contaminated areas are related to the presence of silt sediments. The assessed
quantities of contaminated sediments are summarised in the table below.

Source: Treatnent site for contaminated sediments from the water territory
of Klaipeda Port. (Association of Lithuanian Hydro-biologists, 1999)
Looking at the distribution of these sediments (see figure below) it is observed that most of the
port's fairway is contaminated with Class II sediment, whereas Class III and Class IV
contaminated sediments are found along most of the quays and in inner harbours (Winter port,
Malku bay). Implicitly this means that any expansion or rehabilitation of the existing quay
structures requiring deepening in front of the quays, requires Class III and/or Class IV sediments
to be dredged. According Lithuanian guidelines these materials cannot be dumped in open sea.
The aforementioned studies concur with the findings of the EIA that for the future planning and
progress of the port a Confined Disposal Facility for environmentally safe storage of
contaminated sediments is urgently required.
The Lithuanian experts of the Association of Hydro-biologists indicate in their report that in
some cases Class III sediments are overlying layers of Class II contaminated sediments.
Theoretically, it is assessed that the actual quantity of Class III contaminated sediments includes
some 201,000 m3. However, taking into account the available dredging techniques it is concluded
not possible to dredge with the required accuracy. Hence the total quantity of contaminated
sediment required to be stored or treated is estimated at 450,000 m3.
Present day's dredging techniques manage to maintain a vertical accuracy of 0.10 Im, when using
advanced dredging equipment (with respect to horizontal and vertical dredging control) and a
trained crew. However, for the quantities indicated, KSSA Consultants consider to be more
realistic to apply a dredging tolerance of 0.20 m. Based on a practical dredging tolerance of 20



Annex 9
Page 15 of 22
cm, the amount of sediment dredged including the layer of contaminated sediments would be
around 550,000 m3. Including the Class IV sediments, this will lead to a minimal 600,000 m3
storage volume in a Confined Disposal Facility.
In addition to this amount of contaminated sediment to be stored to re-mediate the present day
contaminated sediment problems of the port, a reservation has to be made for the future
maintenance dredging in the port as well. Lithuanian experts assess the amount of silt sediments
to be deposited annually at 100,000 m3. Based on the area distribution of contarninated silt
sediments, it is assessed that initially 34,000 m3 of Class III/V material will be deposited each
year. However, when sources of pollution will be re-mediated in due course this amount of
contaminated maintenance dredging will be reduced as well, for which argument Consultants
assume the annual contaminated maintenance dredging to be some 20,000 m3 for the coming 10
years. Hence the required size of a Confined Disposal Facility to solve the contaminated
sediment problems for the port of Klaipeda in the coming 10 years is about 800,000 m3.
A storage amount of 800,000 m3is a considerable amount and reduction of this quantity may be
looked for in the following areas:
(i) Precisely identifying the layers of
I z   N           contaminated sediment. Presently some 200
samples have been taken throughout the
-    >     .   .g port to identify the contaminated sediment
r ';>  (PiJlS84Cxproblem. Most of these samples have been
limited to the top 10 cm of the bottom. By
precisely  indicating   (vertically  and
horizontally) where Class I to Class IV
contaminated sediment can be found, not
only a detailed estimate of the quantity of
contaminated sediments can be obtained,
but also a detailed dredging plan can made
where to dredge which layers to what depth.
(ii) Minimising the inclusion of clean or
lightly contaminated sediments (due to
over-dredging and dredging tolerances), the
indicated amount will be reduced. However,
increasing the accuracy of dredging and
reducing the dredging tolerances will put a

*______             Lcontractor, resulting in increased dredging
cost.
(iii)  The effect of bulking of sediments
(increasing volume as a consequence of
handling)  is  not  yet  taken  into
consideration, as filling of the CDF is
.2 5                              AIn3bilv<>rz lusewt  S f  N 1  liexpected to take place gradually during the
years. Settlement and compaction of the sediments inside the CDF will significantly reduce the
bulking effect caused by handling.
(iv) Separation of clean sand and contaminated silts can reduce the quantity of contaminated
sediments to be used. Generally, with more than 50% sands in the dredged spoil, separation of



Annex 9
Page 16 of 22
sand and silt will lead to a reduction of the quantity to be stored. However, with less than 50%
sand in the dredged spoil, the quantity to be stored does not reduce due to the adverse de-
watering characteristics of the remaining silt-water mixture.
(v) Treatment of the sediments in the form of cleaning (removal or destruction of contaminants)
may result in a very large reduction of the quantity of sediments to be stored.
The reduction of the total quantity of contaminated sediments to be stored does have a cost.
Which options can be used will have to be studied in more detail as part of the remedial program,
which in itself would be included in the CDF study finaced under the project (Additional Works
3, below).
Overview of Completed, Ongoing and Planned Capital and Maintenance Dredging Works
On additional problem in relation to proper planning of the required CDF capacity is the removal
heretofore of contaminated sediments from various parts of the port and its subsequent dumping
at the offshore disposal site. This practice has been stopped.
A considerable number of capital dredging works is planned for the period from the present to
2003. Practically all of these projects will involve dredging of contaminated sediments. The
present plans lead to the implement of a CDF after all of these works have been completed, and
need to be revised. It is therefore necessary to expedite the implementation of a CDF under the
project, and to postpone all dredging works in contaminated areas till a CDF has become
available.
Additional Works 3: Confined Disposal Facility for Contaminated Sediments
Introduction
In this section some concepts of a Confined Disposal Facility to store contaminated sediments
from the Klaipeda port are being discussed. Two of these concepts have been developed by
Haskoning (1995) and the Consultants within the EIA study have identified two additional
concepts. For all concepts a first order cost estimate for the
implementation costs have been provided.
Locations                                              Sea Museum CDF          KLAIPEDA CITY
When deciding on the implementation of a CDF, an    Curonan Spit CDF (Th
important issue to take into account is the location of the          J\
CDF to be constructed. The first study resulted in a   Ship Cemetery CDE
preliminary design and a preliminary environmental impact
study for two possible disposal sites: the Ship Cemetery and
the Dreverna site:
The Ship Cemetery
The Ship Cemetery is located along the Klaipeda Port                        IV
fairway at approx. location 5540.8' N, 2108.1' E (see
figure). With the depth of the fairway locally being nearly 9  Baltic Sea
m, due to its location the site is easily accessible for dredges                    Drevema CDF
and  barges. Further, the  disposal  site  is  located
approximately in the middle of the port and thus in the heart
of the contaminated sediment problem. The resulting short
transport distances will be beneficial for the execution of              Curonian
contaminated sediment dredging and disposal.                             Lagoon
Locations of CDF's (indicative)



Annex 9
Page 17 of 22
The Dreverna Site
The Dreverna site is not as well defined in location as the Ship Cemetery, but has roughly been
indicated between 5534' N and 5536.5' N on the eastern shore of the Kursiu Lagoon (see
figure). This results in considerable sailing distances (of the order of 10 to 15 km) from the areas
where the contaminated sediments are to be dredged. Second disadvantage about the location is
the rather shallow depth in the Kursiu Lagoon.
In the execution of this EIA, Consultants identified two alternatives for a CDF. One of these is
located behind the Sea Museum, taking advantage of an already present basin. The other exact
location for a CDF still has to be specified. Requirement for this last location would be that the
glacial till bottom layer should be quite near to the ground surface. According the soils
investigations carried out for the project, this layer can be found at a depth of approximately -12
m CD under the Curonian Spit. In short these two sites can be described as:
The Sea Museum Site
The Sea Museum site is located at approx. 5543.2' N, 2106.2' E (see figure). The site is
located close to the fairway through Klaipeda port and with the depth locally being nearly 12 m,
easy accessible for dredges and barges. The sailing distances to the locations with contaminated
sediment are in the order of 2.5 to 8.5 km.
The Curonian Spit Site
The Curonian Spit site is not as well defined as the Sea Museum site, but is roughly proposed to
be located between the Ship Cemetery site and the Sea Museum site. This puts the site close to
the fairway with sufficient depth for dredges and barges. Further, also the sailing distances to the
dredge areas with contaminated sediments are short (order of 5 kin).
In proposing three potential locations of a CDF on the Curonian Spit, the consultants to KSSA
have not overlooked that the Curonian Spit is a National Park. Considering that a CDF is
essentially a closed system from which contaminants are not supposed to leak, the proposals do
have some specific advantages:
-  With large scale infrastructure and urban developments not allowed in the National
Park, it will be very unlikely that the CDF will ever be in the way of any future
developments, as it might be when located near urban Klaipeda.
*  The long term after care of a CDF constructed in the National Park could fall under
the obligations of the organisation maintaining the National Park. This organisation,
in itself concerned with the care for nature, should understand the importance of the
CDF and take proper care of it.
* The site being a National park, a clear directive from the Government (i.e. the
Ministry of Environment) would trigger the implementation to the CDF. Clearly, the
Ministry of Environment would need to be convinced of the advantages of having
the CDF on the Curonian Spit.
*  Once filled, capped and completed, the CDF can be properly embedded in the natural
environment of the National Park.
Finally, many activities take place at the Northern part of the Curonian Spit, such as: presence of
quays of ferry links, museums, houses and Coast Guard station. In view of this, it is not
considered a loss to the park if a well functioning disposal site is created within it.



Annex 9
Page 18 of 22
Still, the above sites are identified as only as potential sites. The feasibility of these sites has not
been demonstrated yet, nor have approvals been received to construct a CDF at one (or more) of
these sites. Prior to the design and construction of a CDF at any of these sites a detailed
feasibility study to the (final) location of the CDF will be required.
Storage Capacity
The storage capacity of the Ship Cemetery and the Sea Museum site have been assessed at:
Ship Cemetery: 85,000 m3 volume corresponding to 65,000 m3 in situ dredge sludge
Sea Museum: 60,000 m3 volume corresponding to 45,000 m3 in situ dredge sludge
In view of these relatively small capacities, these sites may be considered as temporary disposal
facilities. As final CDF's these sites might be attractive in the future when the amounts of
contaminated sediment to be stored in the depots can be reduced.
The storage capacity for the Drevema site and Curonian Spit site are much larger, as both sites
are supposedly to provide a long-term solution to the contaminated sediments problem of the port
of Klaipeda. The storage capacity for these sites have been assessed at:
*  Dreverna site: 500,000 m3 volume corresponding to 350,000 m3 in situ dredge sludge
*  Curonian spit site: in view of the uncertainties about the quantities of contaminated
sediment still present in Klaipeda Port, a CDF's with capacities ranging from
200,000 m3 to 800,000 m3 have been identified.
Environmental Impact Assessment
Adopting isolating measures, with proper care and monitoring program for the CDF, the
environmental impacts of the CDF will be minimal, provided it is integrated within the
surrounding natural environment.
Implementation Costs
It is clear that the storage capacity of the CDF will strongly affect the costs of implementation.
The implementation costs calculated for the presented alternatives vary from 1 million dollar for
the 60,000 M3 depot to 9 million dollar for the 800,000 m3 depot.
Conclusions and Recommendations
One of the main conclusions of the EIA is that the design and construction of a CDF is urgently
required if the port of Klaipeda is to carry out maintenance dredging and capital dredging inside
the port in accordance with national and international guidelines for the preservation of nature.
Based on the 1998 field investigations on contaminated sediments still present in the port,
Lithuanian experts estimate the amount of level III and IV contaminated sediments inside the
port to be 215,000 m3 minimum up to 440,000 m3 maximum. The actual amount actually depends
on possibility to differentiate (vertically) during dredging operations between level II and level
III contaminated sediments.
Yearly 100,000 m3 of fresh silt will be deposited in the harbour. How much of this 100,000 m3 of
silt is contaminated is not quite clear, but may be in the order of 20,000 m3 per year.
When considering the storage of existing and anticipated contaminated sediment for another 10
years to come, the storage capacity required may be as much as 800,000 m3. Methods to reduce
the volume of contaminated sediments to be stored will have to be studied as part the Remedial
Program study. Based on the present estimates, it seems clear that a small CDF will not be



Annex 9
Page 19 of 22
sufficient. The capacity of both the Ship Cemetery Site and Sea Museum site are insufficient to
store all the contaminated materials present.
With the requirements for the implementation of a CDF clearly demonstrated, and the impact of
a delay in its implementation may have on the development plans of the Port of Klaipeda, it is
also clear that a fast start up of the design and construction of a CDF is to be promoted by all
parties involved: KSSA, Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Environment.

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
KLAIPEDA PORT PROJECT
PRIVATIZATION OF PORT OPERATIONS IN KLAIPEDA
Introduction
I .   The progressive privatizing of public enterprises in Lithuania has taken place over the last
seven years in accordance with the principles and procedures set out in the Law on the Initial
Privatization of State Property - 1993 and subsequent amendments and regulations for
implementation.
2.   In Klaipeda Port, after a burst of initial activity during the years 1991-1994, which
brought about the creation of the Klaipeda State Seaport Authority (KSSA) in 1992 as a state-
owned landlord authority and 5-6 stevedoring companies and other ship and port- related
enterprises, progress towards further Privatization (par. 3) slowed somewhat.  This may be
attributed partly to the lack of funds for the further purchase of shares in the newly created joint
stock companies, after the initial use of vouchers and relatively little cash. At present however,
new momentum seems to be developing towards further privatization, as foreign investors are
showing interest and local funds for investment become available.
3.    Privatization needs to be understood in the East European context: Where no private sector
and no market has previously existed, where there was no legal provision for private property
ownership and no proper banking system, it is evident that privatization is a complex and difficult
task. The Vice-Minister of Communications and the officials in charge of the privatization in the
transport sector explained that the process was further delayed by the need for multiple tenders, as
asset evaluators tended initially to overprice shares, fearing they might otherwise be accused of
"giving away" national assets. Consequently, there were no offers, and another round of bidding
had to be organized.
4.    The relatively rapid growth of traffic through the port (as the principal transit port on the
Baltic for much of the Russian Commonwealth states' exports and imports) and the consequent
growth in revenues, has generated both surpluses for local enterprises and an interest by foreign
investors and international development banking. Thus, Klaipedos Nafta has found strategic
investors in the USA and elsewhere (par. 8f), Klaipedos Terminalas has found consortium
partners (par. 8d), and Klasco's new container terminal at the port's Southern end is being
financed with a loan from EIB.
Steps to Privatization
5.    Even in market economies, where the legal, financial and economic conditions for private
enterprise do exist, the road to privatization of parastatal enterprises consists of a series of
sequential and progressive steps leading to fully private operations. These steps are as follows:
*  Decentralization
*  Commercialization
*  Corporatization
*  Diversification of Share Holdings
*  Strategic Partnership
*  Private Operations
Port Enterprises' Present Status
6.    The following table presents (in summary form) the present status of the main
enterprises operating in Klaipeda port, using the above steps as an indication of progress
towards full privatization:

Enterprises Rendering General Cargo - Handling Services
7.    The principal stevedoring companies, Klasco (par. 8a) anid Klaipedos Smelte (par. 8b),
have been privatized.
8.   The following are the stevedoring companies handling general cargo, which are currently
operating in the port:
a) Klasco. This company is the largest of the stevedores, handling 44% of the total port
cargo in 1999. This cargo consists largely of Russian steel exports, but also of many other types
of general cargo, including a growing number of containers and Roll-on Roll-off (RORO) units.
In addition to its six-seven berths (2.5 Km of berths) at the port-s Northern (and deepest) end, the
company also operates the important RORO and container terminals at the Southern end of the
port. It employs a labor force of some 1,650 people.
b) Klaipedos Smelte. This stevedoring company specializes in solid and liquid bulk and
neo-bulk (uniform) cargo, e.g. timber, handling about 6% of the total port cargo in 1999. The
company employs some 1,000 people. It operates about three - four berths (1.5 Km).
c) Bega Ltd. This totally private stevedore is smaller than the two above but a highly
efficient and dynamic enterprise, specializing in bulk (liquid and dry) and bagged fertilizers,
cement in bulk, as well as timber, handling more thlan  14% of the total port cargo in 1999.
e) Other General Cargo Handling Enterprises. In addition to the general cargo
stevedores mentioned above, some of the ship construction and repair yards also render a certain
amount of cargo loading and discharging.
Specialized Terminals
f) Klaipedos Nafta. This specialized terminal is owned by the state with participation of
foreign interests. This is a (Lithuania-USA owned) bulk-liquid handling and storage facility,
owned mainly by foreign interests, which operates two - three relatively) deep-water berth (max.

draft, 10.6 m.) near the port entrance and can therefore accommodate tankers of up to 30,000 tons
deadweight, though developments planned should enable vessel dwt. to increase to 70,000 tons
(14 meter draft). Its recent rehabilitation accounts for the recent drop to less than 4 million tons.
The annual transshipment capacity is estimated at 7.1 million tons. The terminal specializes in
storage, loading and discharging of petroleum, liquid fertilizers and other liquid in bulk from
railway-tankers or from ships.
g) Other Terminals. There are a number of small specialized terminals - one for peat
and one private fishing company, which are of no relevance to this report.
Ship Building and Repair Enterprises
9.    Other important enterprises operating in the port are the following ship building and repair
yards:
a) Baltijos Laivu Shipyard. This is a joint stock company, which was acquired in 1994
by Danish Odense, (member of the AP Muller group) which hold 92% of the shares, with the
workers of the enterprise holding the balance. The firm builds ships and sections, and employs
some 1,600 workers. A representative of the Ministry of Communications sits on the company
Board of Directors.
b) Western Ship Repair Yard (Vakaru Laivu Remontas). This joint stock company
not only deals in ship repairs, reconstruction and conversions, which bring in 90% of it's
revenues, but also renders stevedoring services, mainly scrap metal and timber. It is currently
92.8% state-owned and 7.2% owned by employees. The government has already put out a tender
for bids and three potential investors have applied. It is expected shortly to be fully privatized.
c) Klaipeda Ship Repair (Klaipedos Laivu Remontas). This is a relatively small
enterprise, also a joint stock company, which deals not only in ship repairs, but in related
technical repairs, e.g. valves, railway equipment maintenance, etc. In addition, it also gives some
stevedoring services for timber, fish and containers. It has a staff of about 400 workers. It is
owned by the Regional Council, which owns 70% of the shares, with the remainder in the hands
of various local investors.
Other Enterprises
10.   There are a number of other enterprises in the port area, with whom KSSA has contracts.
These are a private fishing company, a specialized peat-loading facility, a paper and box works, a
marine engineering firm (it has performed maintenance dredging in the port) Klaipedos
Hidrotechnikas, and a company which operates the ferry over the lagoon.
Leases and Contracts
11.   All the above-mentioned companies have lease agreements with KSSA, lasting in most
cases for 25 years. The government has recently produced a new standard contract. Land is
classified into six different categories, depending on proximity to the quays, railway lines and
other infrastructure available. Lease prices are index-linked, and the government has recently
decided that leases will not be raised in real terms before the year 2000. This is in keeping with
the efforts to maintain the port's competitive position vis-a-vis those of neighboring countries.
Some of the port tenants already find the lease charges excessively burdensome, but find some
consolation in the fact that KSSA will be making heavy investments in port infrastructure from
which they will derive the benefits.
12.   Here lies a potential problem: the present contracts seemingly make no provision for how
to recover infrastructure costs from port tenants who will be the direct beneficiaries of such
investments. It is important, therefore, to establish a method whereby the specific benefits gained
by various port tenants as a result of KSSA's investments can be convincingly measured and the
burden of cost recovery be equitably shared.



Annex 10
Page 4 of 4
KSSA's Vessel Dues and Wharfage Charges
13.  As of May of 1998, new vessel dues were established by Government regulation. These
rationalize and consolidate former detailed dues for obligatory ship services, e.g. channel, lights,
anchorage, mooring and waste disposal, into one payment, and also add a wharfage element not
previously in existence for the cargo volumes loaded and unloaded.
Conclusions
14.  As may be seen from the foregoing, the number and variety of cargo handling enterprises,
whether privately owned or not, is sufficient to assure a healthy degree of competition in cargo
handling. None of the companies have exclusivity of any sort and all are free to negotiate
handling charges and draw up contracts with their potential clients. The same applies to ship
repairs, where several companies in the port are competing for the market. The only enterprise
which has a certain degree of monopoly is the bulk liquid terminal Klaipedos Nafta. This might
require some regulatory measures incorporated in future contracts with KSSA.
15.   The recovery of infrastructure investments costs by KSSA needs careful consideration. It
is not yet clear whether the new vessel dues and the accompanying wharfage cargo will be
sufficient to recover the costs of the projected new investments. A new financial analysis of
tariffs is therefore required, based on different scenarios of future traffic and the new scale of
charges. Should projected recovery of costs prove insufficient, negotiations will be required with
terminals which benefit from the investments, regarding how they will pay for such incremental
benefits. The best way to implement these adjustments on present lease contracts need to be
determined.

KLAIPEDA PORT PROJECT
COMPETITION AMONG BALTIC PORTS
The volume of traffic moving through the port of Klaipeda depends not only on the amount
shipped from the FSU but also the competition from other Baltic ports. The competitors include
Riga, Ventspils, Tallinn and St. Petersburg to the north and Kaliningrad to the south. The share of
total cargo handled in these ports is shown in Figure 1. This graph indicates the dominance of
Ventspils but also shows that the market shares of both Ventspils and Klaipeda has been
decreasing.

The results are somewhat deceptive because they include both liquid and dry cargoes. When the
shipments of crude and petroleum products are removed, Klaipeda has the largest share, but the
other ports, except Kaliningrad, are within a few percent of each other.

The relative market share of these ports can be further assessed by looking at their share of
different types dry cargo as shown in Figure 2 and Table 1. The impact of the Russian crisis was
most severe for Kaliningrad. Klaipeda and the other competing ports managed to increase their
dry cargo volume from 1997 to 1998. Klaipeda's market share was relatively unchanged while
those of Tallinn and Riga increased. Tallinn benefitted from a growth in dry bulk cargoes while
Riga experienced an increase in general cargo, especially metal and wood exports.
The change in market share of container traffic from 1996-1998 is shown in Table 3. Klaipeda
experienced a 15% decline in traffic and a 1.2% decline in market share whereas Tallinn had an
increase of about 10% in volume and a 3 1/2% increase in market share. The most dramatic decline
was for St. Petersburg as a result of the Russian economic crisis and difficulties in port
operations. It is anticipated that in 1999, St. Petersburg will recover most of its market share.

Annex 13
Page 3 of 4
The competitiveness of the Baltic ports depends primarily on three factors:
1. Inland transport connections
2. Available draft
3. Efficiency of operations
A summary of the characteristics of these ports is shown in Table 4.
Ventspils benefited from its deep draft and its crude and petroleum products pipelines which
provide low-cost transport from Russian fields. As a result, it is the dominant port for handling
liquid bulk cargoes. It also has a large volume of dry bulk cargo, especially potash fertilizer, due
to its rail access and the ability to load Panamax vessels. The port is now in the process of
constructing a multipurpose terminal to increase its share of the container trade. Although it does
not appear to have any competitive advantage for this traffic, the facility has been financed in part
by Noor Natie, a major terminal Belgian terminal operator.
Riga, the other major Latvian port, benefits from its historic role as a major economic center and
from its convenient rail connections to Moscow. However, the rails have deteriorated and the
rates have increased resulting in a sharp drop off in rail traffic. Riga is the regional port of call for
Maersk container services. Its location provides good RoRo connection to the Scandinavian
countries
Liepaja is an ex-navy port which has relatively little traffic. It is not well developed and is located
far from the major economic centers. Although it has a rail connection, the track is bad condition.
Its major competitive advantage is the Special Economic Zone.
Tallinn provides the major RoRo connection for Helsinki. The port facilities in Muuga Harbor
provide deep draft berths. The port is close to Moscow by rail and road (940km and 1100 km,
respectively). Its bulk traffic, especially liquid bulk, has increased rapidly because of its location
and deep draft berths. The port is now constructing a new two-berth container terminal together
with European interests
Kaliningrad is an ex-navy port which serves Russian cargo. It provides ferry service to Germany
and was a gateway for automobiles and other imports bound for Moscow. It has suffered a steep
decline in its traffic due to the economic crisis in Russia. The port is served by rail and road
transport but requires a transit of Lithuania by rail. It is currently expanding its container terminal
St. Petersburg is the major Northwest outlet for Russia. Navigation is limited by its 12 m draft, it
location 27 kilometers up the Morsky channel and the need for ice-breaking operations during the
winter months. In order to promote the use of this port, the government has eliminated the rail
tariff discounts which use to apply to Latvia and Estonia and has introduced duties on transit
cargoes using the other Baltic ports. Sealand, P&O Nedlloyd and CMA/CGM all call at its main
container terminal. There is a container train service from the port to Moscow.
The competition of these ports with Klaipeda will be for transit cargo. Because of the proximity
of these ports, they will offer comparable total transport costs. The competition for petroleum
products is expected to be limited as long as the rail service between the major refineries and the
port is maintained. The heavy fuel oil cannot be transported economically by pipelines. The
products will be delivered by pipeline from the Maziekiai refinery. The increased depth will
allow the port to remain competitive. The major competitive threat will be improvements in
Black Sea ports.
The competition for potash and other bulk fertilizer exports will come primarily from Ventspils
but Klaipeda will be able to compete effectively once its berths can handle Panamax vessels.
Lower land transport costs will give it an advantage for all but the largest consignments. The
same applies for imports of grain.



Annex 13

There will be considerable competition for metal exports. Riga and Ventspils will compete for
cargoes headed to the US and East Coast of Latin America. The increase in Klaipeda's draft may
improve its competitive advantage but there is little evidence that the metal will be moved in
Panamax size vessels. St. Petersburg will compete by taking advantage of constraints on cross
border movements.
The routing of RoRo traffic will depend on the land transport costs as well as the offshore
destination. Klaipeda will continue to have the advantage of its road network and its ice-free
status. Tallinn and Riga will compete for shipments to Finland and Sweden. For container traffic,
Riga is expected to be the major competitor. Klaipeda's market share is not expected to change
significantly over the next decade. The increase in draft will have no impact on either RoRo or
container shipments since both will continue to utilize smaller vessels.
