Program            The proposed stand-alone Development Policy Operation supports the authorities’
Development        efforts to (i) deepen executive accountability, (ii) protect poverty reduction
Objective(s) and   progress made in recent years, and (iii) prepare for a rapid economic recovery as
Contribution to    the political transition ends and the security situation improves. While the credit
CAS                would primarily translate into financing programs from the Emergency Priority
                   Action Plan 2013-14, particular attention is given to policy actions aimed at (i)
                   strengthening controls on budget and transparency, (ii) protecting pro-poor
                   expenditures, (iii) restoring financial sustainability and investment capacity in
                   power and irrigation sectors, and (iv) improving public financial and investment
                   management. The proposed operation fully shares the objectives of the proposed
                   World Bank Group’s Interim Strategy Note for FY14-15, and is aligned with the
                   World Bank’s Strategy for Africa.

Risks and Risk     The proposed operation comprises the following potential risks:
Mitigation
                   Security. The ongoing military conflict in the North could heighten security risks
                   in the South, with potential negative implication on the focus and time required
                   from Government to implement the reform program supported by the proposed
                   operation. Potential political destabilization from groups opposed to the roadmap
                   could also weaken the phased return to full constitutional order, with potential
                   negative implication on donors’ ability to support the budget and fully resume
                   official aid. The proposed operation does not entail measures to mitigate such risks
                   or their impact. Development objectives of strengthening executive accountability


                                               vi
               and preparing for the economic recovery would thus be affected.

               Political feasibility of reforms. Ahead of elections, groups might strongly oppose
               electricity tariff increases, in Bamako notably, with implications on the financial
               capacity of the electricity company to ensure regular supply and/or the stability of
               the government’s fiscal framework. Development objectives of preparing for the
               economic recovery and protecting the poverty reduction gains would be affected.
               Nonetheless, tariffs were increased in February 2013 without strong opposition.
               The Government proactively took the lead to communicate that tariff increases
               were pro-poor as intended to give more capacity to invest in connections. The
               proposed operation will support these efforts through the dissemination of the
               Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of electricity tariff increases.

               Commodity prices shocks. An unexpected increase in petroleum prices would
               affect electricity generation capacity (with a generation mix highly dependent on
               imported oil products). The adoption of the tariff adjustment mechanism supported
               by the proposed operation would reduce the development impact of such risk, and
               is complemented with a World Bank initiative to develop solar energy. An
               unexpected fall in gold prices would weaken the overall fiscal framework, with
               possible implications for government ability to finance basic service delivery. The
               proposed operation mitigates the development impact of such risk through the
               protection of pro-poor expenditures. An unexpected fall in cotton prices would
               potentially affect farmers’ income, and growth through forward linkages. Such a
               risk is partially covered by the stabilization mechanism of the cotton industry. The
               proposed operation would also mitigate its impact through diversification towards
               rice production with greater access to irrigation. More generally, continued
               macroeconomic monitoring and dialogue with authorities (at the national and
               regional levels, through WAEMU in particular), in coordination with the IMF, will
               help manage the impact of exogenous shocks on budget execution and service
               delivery.

               Climatic shocks. A negative climatic shock would aggravate food insecurity and
               raise food inflation. The protection of pro-poor expenditures supported by the
               proposed operation reduces the potential impact of such risk, and is complemented
               by several other government, World Bank and DPs activities to expand social
               safety nets and strengthen food security.

               Fiduciary risks. Risks that public financial resources are not allocated to their
               intended purposes or deliver poor value for money remain substantial, with a
               potentially significant negative development impact through poor public spending
               effectiveness and efficiency. The proposed operation mitigates these risks by
               supporting a series of measures to strengthen controls on budget execution and
               budget transparency. The fiduciary review of the security sector conducted in
               2013, at the request of authorities is also expected to improve public financial
               management of security spending as it expands and reforms itself.

               Implementation risks. Risks that policy actions supported by the proposed
               operation are not implemented due to the poor capacity are moderate. The strong
               country office presence and close dialogue with authorities mitigate such risk, as
               well as the technical assistance in the sectors of public financial management,
               energy, and agriculture provided by the World Bank and other donors.

                      RECOVERY AND REFORM SUPPORT CREDIT


                                    I.    INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document proposes a one-tranche Recovery and Reform Support
Credit (RRSC) for SDR33.4 million (US$50 million equivalent) to the Republic of Mali. This
stand-alone Development Policy Operation supports the authorities’ efforts to (i) deepen
executive accountability, (ii) protect poverty reduction progress made in recent years, and (iii)
prepare for a rapid economic recovery as the political transition ends and the security situation
improves. While the credit would primarily translate into financing programs from the Emergency
Priority Action Plan 2013-14, particular attention is given to the policy actions aimed at (i)
strengthening controls on budget and transparency, (ii) protecting pro-poor expenditures, (iii)
restoring financial sustainability and investment capacity in power and irrigation sectors, and (iv)
improving public financial and investment management. The proposed operation fully shares the
objectives of the proposed World Bank Group’s Interim Strategy Note for FY14-15, and is
aligned with the World Bank’s Strategy for Africa.
2.     The proposed operation is part of a larger program of support to Mali that strongly
focuses on safety nets, education, health, energy, governance, agriculture and emergency
recovery. The current portfolio notably comprises investment lending projects for electricity
transmission and distribution (US$120 million), agricultural productivity (US$70 million) and
reproductive health (US$30 million). In FY13, the Board of Executive Directors approved the
emergency project on safety nets (US$70 million), as well as additional financing (US$20
million) for agricultural productivity. In full alignment with the objectives and rationale of the
Interim Strategy Note (ISN, FY14-15), the proposed operation seeks to support the transition
towards the emergence of more accountable and service delivery oriented public institutions, by
focusing on State legitimacy, the protection of human capital and the development of investment
opportunities. While policy actions supported in the proposed operation pursue reform efforts
undertaken in recent years, the uncertainty on government’s priorities after elections and progress
in terms of security provides the rationale for stand-alone nature of the proposed operation.
3.      Since 2012, the political and security situation strongly deteriorated. The calendar
year 2012 witnessed the occupation of the Northern regions of Mali by armed separatist and
fundamentalist groups allied to organized crime, and a military coup in March overthrowing the
elected Government and preventing the organization of elections scheduled a month later.
Constitutional order was thereafter progressively restored in 2012 with the formation and
international recognition of a Transitional Government of National Unity in charge of restoring
sovereignty over the entire territory of Mali and organizing fair and transparent national elections.
Under the mandate of the UN Security Council, a coalition of foreign troops launched military
operations in Northern Mali in support of the Malian army in January 2013. A political roadmap
identifying milestones to restore democratic order was also adopted by the National Assembly in
January 2013. The roadmap underscores that these unprecedented events constitute the worst
political and security crisis ever faced by Mali since independence.
4.     The political crisis highlights Mali’s drivers of external and internal fragility. As a
land-locked Sahelian, undiversified, and rain-dependent economy, Mali has been highly
vulnerable to climatic and commodity price shocks, with significant implications for food
insecurity and income poverty. In 2011, a severe drought significantly aggravated food insecurity.

                                              -1-
The recent political crisis also underscores the criticality of the security dimension for sustainable
economic and social development: the deterioration of the security situation in the North has had
significant social impact, as basic service delivery and humanitarian assistance dwindled and
populations were massively displaced; the poor management of the security sector is also likely to
have contributed to the breach of the constitutional order and the disruption of most aid flows.
The third Growth and Reduction Strategy Paper 2012-2017 (CSCRP-3) adopted in late 2011
acknowledges – unlike previous PRSPs - the utmost necessity to guarantee populations security
through security service reform and citizen participation to its governance, with special emphasis
on Northern regions. Sadly though, potential programs and actions contemplated under this
strategic axis had hardly started when the political crisis erupted in early 2012.
5.      The re-foundation of the State of Mali will necessitate strengthening executive
accountability through better internal and external controls and greater transparency. The
political crisis of 2012 has generated a wide spectrum of opinions and assessments on the quality
of institutions in Mali and their ability to equitably serve and protect citizens (in low population
density areas in particular, such as Northern Mali), and on the role of external factors in Mali’s
recent destabilization. One point of consensus though (political and technical, as reflected for
instance in the Roadmap, the Public Expenditure Fiduciary Assessment of 2010 and governance
indicators) is probably the need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of fiduciary controls
(internal and external) and to strengthen transparency for greater executive accountability.
Important institutional reforms engaged in 2011 in these domains were stopped by the political
crisis.
6.      In the transition period, efforts should also be made to promote and improve the
quality of investment, so as to facilitate economic recovery. The economic recovery will
necessary be synonym of larger and better investments, in support of infrastructure development
and labor-intensive sectors. Improving public investment project selection and adopting the
financial scheme for investment in irrigation infrastructure will significantly contribute to these
medium-term objectives. The revision of electricity tariffs is also a first important step in
restoring the investment capacity of the national electricity company, which has severely
deteriorated in recent years.
7.     Reduced budgetary resources and growing social needs call for improved public
financial management and greater domestic resource mobilization. Anemic economic growth
and the suspension of aid after the events of March 2012 have significantly limited government
capacity to finance pro-poor expenditures in 2012, as total budgetary resources were cut in an
amount equivalent to 6 percent of GDP compared with 2011. In 2013, additional security
spending needs will further reduce the resources available for basic service delivery and
development programs. In this context, improving public financial management and mobilizing
greater domestic resources for pro-poor expenditures becomes increasingly critical. Thus, the
proposed operation supports authorities’ efforts to protect education and health expenditures in
the Budget Law 2013, acknowledging at the same time the need for greater and better security
spending.
8.      While the proposed operation is of substantial risk overall, not engaging with
authorities could bear even higher risks. Through the preparation of the proposed operation, the
World Bank stayed continuously engaged with the authorities at the technical level. As underlined
in the assessment conducted for Mali in June 2012, in accordance with the OP7.30, risks of not
engaging with the current government could have further jeopardized stability and security. The
proposed operation comprises important risks (both for the Bank’s reputation and for the


                                              -2-
development objectives supported by the operation), some of which are directly related to the
recent political and security events; but not engaging could have entailed even larger risks of
seeing Mali falling into a fragility trap, taking decades and being very costly to redress. Thus,
technical dialogue with authorities was maintained throughout the preparation of the proposed
operation, to stay informed of the social and economic situation and be able to identify actions
which could be trustfully supported.
9.      Such a continued engagement also proved catalytic to the broader resumption of
financial assistance from Development Partners. Following the adoption of the road map and
the restoration of territorial integrity in early 2013 a number of multilateral and bilateral donors
announced their intention to resume their disbursements. Dialogue conducted by the Bank and
the Fund in 2012 on budget developments most likely contributed to the planned resumption of
budget support from the European Commission, African Development Bank and France in 2013,
as well as other forms of financial assistance to the Budget from Canada and the Netherlands.
While formal aid harmonization structures became less active after the events of 2012, efforts
were nonetheless made to frequently share information between Development Partners, through a
number of joint missions notably, with a view to ensure complementarity in scope and time of the
various interventions. Coordinated efforts to resume assistance to Mali culminated with the May
15, 2013 “Together for a New Mali? conference, during which US$4.2 billion were pledged to
finance the implementation of the Emergency Priority Action Plan 2013-14. Participants
highlighted in particular the need for State institutions and governance practices to be thoroughly
overhauled in order to ensure sustainable development.
10.    The proposed operation is also part of a larger regional response to the crisis in the
Sahel. While Mali is at the epicenter of the crisis, it is broadly understood that some of its causes,
and the responses, have to be found at the regional Sahelian level. Thus, development policy
operations are also being processed in Niger and Burkina Faso. A World Bank regional response,
taking the form of projects to strengthen resilience and promote regional integration, while
building knowledge on demographic and spatial Sahelian challenges was also in the making by
May 2013.

                II.    MALI RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS

                      A.     RECENT POLITICAL AND SECURITY DEVELOPMENTS

11.     In early 2012, the conflict between regular armed forces and a coalition of separatist
and fundamentalist armed groups intensified in the North of Mali. Some analysts point to the
important role played by massive transfers of weapons and militants from Libya to explain this
conflict escalation, as well as the role organized crime is playing to reinforce armed groups and
motivate their spreading out. The regular armed forces were defeated in March 2012 and
fundamentalist and separatist took control of the North of Mali, claiming its independence. The
deteriorated security situation and the imposition of harsh fundamentalist social rules entailed
massive population displacements (cumulatively, some 260,000 people fled to the South of Mali
and 170,000 fled to neighboring countries between January 2012 and February 2013, or
approximately 31 percent of the total population of the North of Mali) 1. Some infrastructure and
capital was destroyed, vandalized or looted (e.g. public buildings, utilities, commercial banks, and
livestock). Traditional trade links with the South of Mali, Algeria, Senegal and Niger were
severed. Tourism to cultural heritage sites located in or close to Northern Mali (e.g. Timbuktu,
Dogon) was immediately halted. Most civil servants were redeployed to the South, severely
undermining basic service delivery.
12.     In March 2012, a military coup overthrew the elected Government, a month before
the scheduled national elections. Grievances from putschists included widespread executive
corruption, impunity, and the poor management of the security sector. Under pressure from the
international community 2 led by the ECOWAS and African Union, constitutional order was
progressively restored, with the international recognition of the Transitional Government of
National Unity. The Government committed to restore sovereignty over the entire territory of
Mali and organize fair and transparent national elections. In January 2013, the GoM and the
National Assembly adopted a political roadmap, which foresees the organization of presidential
and legislative elections between April and July 2013.
13.     In January 2013, a coalition of foreign troops launched military operations in
Northern Mali in support of the Malian army, under the Mandate of the Security Council (UN
resolution 2085, December 2012). By February 2013, the major cities of the North had been
reconquered by the coalition. Nonetheless, sustainably securitizing the region and addressing the
political tension between different groups remain daunting medium term political and security
challenges. According to the Roadmap this endeavor will entail, among others, the restructuration
and the modernization of the security sector for it to meet its main objective of securing peace
over the entire Malian territory.

14.     Recent events have taken place within the context of deteriorating governance
trends. In the last 3-4 years, indicators of political stability, rule of law and control of corruption
significantly deteriorated. Trends in political stability and rule of law have likely been influenced
by developments in the North, where the authority and legitimacy of the state have traditionally
been weak, and further eroded in recent years as the region increasingly became home to
trafficking and criminal networks. But they cannot be explained only by developments in the

  Following the events of March 22, 2012, Official Development Assistance (ODA) was immediately suspended,
with the exception of humanitarian assistance. The WAEMU also promptly blocked access to GoM’s accounts at the
regional Central Bank (BCEAO).

legitimacy through greater transparency and strengthened internal and external controls in budget
execution and in the use of public financial resources.

                          B.       RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

15.      The political crisis of 2012 has had a severe economic impact. There were two
important sources of economic contraction in 2012. The first one is the strong reduction of ODA
in 2012. Indeed, disbursement against projects and programs were cut by FCFA 299 billion in
2012 compared with 2011. In the absence of alternative financing opportunities, authorities cut
public investment expenditures by FCFA 279 billion compared with 2011, with a view to protect
current expenditure in real terms (see Table 2). In turn, demand for domestic construction services
and public works was strongly affected, and was estimated to contract by approximately 35
percent in real terms compared with 2011. Overall, World Bank staff estimates the cost of the
decline in aid flows at 1.5 to 2.0 percentage points of foregone growth in 2012 through demand
effects. The second source of economic contraction is the deterioration of the security situation,
which mainly impacted tourism (both in Southern and Northern parts of the country) and the
livelihood of Northern populations. Tourism, which brought in foreign currency receipts FCFA
150 billion in 2011 (3 percent of GDP), was put to a standstill after the events of March 2012, and
may have cost 2 percentage points of foregone GDP growth in 2012. Other impacts of security
deterioration are more difficult to estimate, as likely primarily affecting the North, from where
statistical information is extremely scarce. Before the political crisis, the GDP of northern Mali
could roughly be estimated at FCFA 470 billion (9.4 percent of GDP), based on 2010 household




                                             -5-
survey data 3, and was mainly driven by trade, livestock, rice cultivation, tourism and
administrative activities. With about 31 percent of the northern population being displaced
(including civil servants and their families redeployed to the South), one can roughly venture to
estimate that, besides tourism and administration, other economic activities in the North were cut
by a third, costing Mali’s GDP another 2.5 to 3 percentage points of foregone growth in 2012. As
for Northern Mali itself, the economic situation is likely to be significantly more severe, with real
per capita incomes about 10-15 percent lower for populations who stayed in the North (against a
2-3 percent decline in the South, including displaced populations).
16.     Fortunately, the economy also benefited from positive exogenous factors, not related
to the political crisis. These include in particular favorable terms of trade (+18 percent, as gold
prices increased sharply, while oil prices slightly dropped), which corresponded to a net transfer
equivalent to 4 percent of GDP in 2011. Gold production continued to grow steadily, as it is
located in the South and was not affected by domestic developments. Climatic conditions were
also very favorable to agricultural production (mostly located in the South), which was estimated
to grow by 13 percent in 2012, following a poor 2011 harvest. All in all, Mali’s GDP is
preliminarily estimated to have contracted by 1 percent in real terms (see Table 1), through the
combination of positive and negative developments discussed above. The structural weaknesses
of Mali’s national accounts, 4 and the difficulty to assess the economic situation in the North
nonetheless put this estimate within a large interval of confidence.
17.     Consumer price inflation decelerated throughout the year. From 8 percent year-on-
year in April 2012, the consumer price inflation dropped to 2 percent in December. This evolution
was mainly driven by (i) the low domestic food supply in the first month of the year (the
consequence of the poor harvest in 2011 and resulting stock levels); and (ii) by the rebound in
agricultural supply from the second part of the year combined with the overall compression in
aggregate demand.

18.     Balance of Payments recorded reductions in the current account deficit and the
capital and financial account surplus. Growing export receipts (gold) entailed a contraction in
the current account deficit (from FCFA 312 billion in 2011 to 175 billion in 2012). Transfers to
private entities (households remittances and foreign financial support of Non-Government
Organizations, +FCFA 69 billion between 2011 and 2012) also helped offset increased profit
repatriation (+FCFA 47 billion between 2011 and 2012) and lower program grants to the
government (-FCFA 52 billion). In contrast, the capital and financial account surplus contracted
by FCFA 203 billion between 2011 and 2012, as ODA loans and project grants dropped by FCFA
247 billion. The balance of payments (-FCFA 50 billion, after error and omissions) was mostly
financed by drawing down foreign currency reserves at the BCEAO, the Central Bank of the West
African Economic and Monetary Union to which Mali belongs.
19.   With lower aid resources and limited borrowing capacity on domestic and external
markets, the Government chose to cut public investment expenditures, so as to protect
current expenditures and debt service. It also cut implicit subsidies on petroleum products and

  There are no national accounts at the regional level in Mali. This estimate assumes that the share of Northern
households’ private consumption in Mali’s total private consumption is equal to the share of Northern GDP in Mali’s
total GDP. Budget expenditure allocations to Northern regions in 2012 represented 9.5 percent of total budget
allocations, excluding centrally managed expenditures.

  Mali’s national accounts are computed using the SNA 68 and are based on a set of representative prices from 1988.
From 2014, Mali’s accounts will be re-based to the year 1997 and adopt the SNA 93 methodology.

cooking gas, and accumulated arrears on domestic expenditures (for an amount preliminary
estimated by March 2013 at FCFA 30 billion). 5 Civil servants’ salaries were paid in full
(including for those displaced from the North), and external debt service was mostly honored (but
for a few creditors, in an amount of US$54 million), with a view to facilitate the swift resumption
of ODA from 2013. Transfers and subsidies to electricity and agriculture were maintained,
protecting in particular the preparation of the agricultural campaign 2012-13. From an economic
classification perspective, the security sector (armed forces and domestic security) saw its budget
growing by FCFA 39 billion in 2012, from FCFA 107 to 146 billion between 2011 and 2012, in
response to the deteriorated security situation. Funds were made available from the “charges
communes?, which is a budgetary line directly managed by the MEFB to accommodate
unforeseen contingencies.

  The Authorities committed to undergo a comprehensive audit of all domestic public expenditure arrears
accumulated in 2012, the precise amount of which still remaining uncertain.

                      C.       MACRO-ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

 20.    In 2013, the Malian economy is expected to rebound from its low level, but shall
 remain below its full potential. A 5 percent GDP growth is projected, based on conservative
 assumptions regarding exogenous factors (terms of trade, gold production, climate, foreign aid),


                                                       -9-
which should allow closing part of the output gap through a better mobilization of existing
productive capacities. Thus, given the cumulative recession of the last two years (a 5 percent
decline in per capita terms), the Malian economy will continue to remain below its long term
potential as the economy will not fully recover from the food and political crises of 2011 and
2012. Even with positive political developments, the decline in investments in 2012, and the need
to address additional social and security needs will hamper any economic rebound.
21.     Though positive, the macro-economic outlook remains highly uncertain. Besides
traditional sources of vulnerability (climate, commodity prices – gold, cotton and oil in
particular), which the government is less equipped today to address, political and security
developments will significantly influence the resumption of aid and economic activity. In
particular, the pace at which African armed forces will be able to deploy in Mali 6 to maintain
peace and the capacity of the Transition Government to organize fair and transparent elections
will be important variables affecting the outlook. Besides, information is still lacking or
preliminary on the true state of the economy. The impact of public expenditure arrears on firms’
financial and operational capacity to resume activity (in particular for hardest hit sectors such as
construction, public works, and tourism), banks’ balance sheets and capacity to extend credit to
the private sector, 7 and the extent of human and physical damage in the North still remain to be
assessed.
22.     Over the longer term horizon, economic growth needs to be accelerated. Barring
2012, annual GDP growth averaged 5 percent in the last decade, or 1.5 percent in per capita
terms. Even if inclusive, such a growth performance is much too modest to make a serious dent in
terms of poverty reduction, as discussed in the Section III.D. As highly exposed to significant
exogenous shocks, economic growth has been volatile, making investment risky, and as in 2012,
the main adjustment variable to address macroeconomic downturns. Low aggregate private and
public investments (at less than 15 percent of GDP in 2011, excluding ODA financed and gold-
related investment projects) prevent economic diversification from a very narrow export base, 8
and the necessary productivity gains to reduce underemployment. Regional integration, skills
development and economic diversification are identified by authorities as major policy areas to
promote GDP growth and exports. 9 As for economic diversification, infrastructure development –
regional connectivity for trade creation, irrigation to improve agricultural productivity and
resilience, and grid connection to encourage the development of small non-agricultural enterprises
- are considered critical, pointing to the need for greater and better public and private investments
in these areas (see Section IV.B).

  ECOWAS estimates that 8,000 foreign African military troops would be needed in support of the Mali armed forces
to maintain peace under a new UN mandate after MISMA’s mandate ends. This broadly corresponds to current
commitments from ECOWAS (5420 troops) and Chad (2250 troops) to the MISMA. On April 25, 2013, the UN
Security Council approved the creation of a 12,600-strong peacekeeping force in Mali starting July 1, 2013.
7
  By March 2013, it was estimated that the deterioration of the security situation in the North had cost FCFA 18
billion to banks (0.3 percent of GDP), in the form of stolen cash (FCFA 4 billion), non-recoverable loans (FCFA 12
billion) and physical damages to bank agencies (FCFA 2 billion). At the national level, the quality of assets had also
deteriorated, with 21.7 percent of loans being considered non-performing, against 18.5 percent by end 2011.

  In 2011, exports of gold were representing 65 percent of total exports receipts, goods and services.

23.     Through its Budget Law 2013, the Government adopted a prudent strategy. The
budget for 2013 was built on the assumption of no resumption in ODA 10 and very limited access
to private financing. The Budget Law 2013 realistically prolongs expenditure patterns recorded in
the execution of the budget 2012, priority being given to protecting education and health current
expenditure (see Section IV.B) and security, against investment projects and general public
administration (regrouped under “Others? in Table 3). The prudent and responsible
macroeconomic management by authorities since March 2012 was acknowledged in January 2013
with the approval of a Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) by the IMF Board of Executive Directors, See
Annex 3. A second disbursement under the RCF is scheduled to be discussed at the IMF Board of
Executive Directors on June 10, 2013.

24.     Accounting for the proposed operation and other probable sources of foreign
assistance, see Table 4, the IMF retained a more positive outlook for 2013 allowing a larger
deficit (2.4 percent of GDP, see Table 2, against 0.3 percent in the Budget Law 2013). The
European Commission, the African Development Bank and France officially announced their
decision to resume budget support in 2013. Overall, US$4.2 billion were pledged by donors at the
May 15, 2013 conference ‘Together for a New Mali’ to support the implementation of the PAPU
2013-14. In turn, the materialization of higher official assistance than expected in the Budget Law
2013 prepared in late 2012 will prompt the authorities to submit a revised budget law to the
National Assembly later on in 2013. Against higher ODA, such a revised budget law would
primarily accommodate (i) higher public investment expenditures (for rehabilitation of damaged
infrastructure and the completion of projects interrupted in 2012, FCFA 238 billion), (ii) higher

10
  From August 2012, the World Bank resumed its disbursements on ongoing projects, roughly at the rate of US$10
million per month (or 1.1 percent of GDP on an annual basis), excluding budget support.

elections costs (given displaced and refugees populations, FCFA 25 billions), (iii) reconciliation
costs (commission for reconciliation, compensations for victims, humanitarian assistance, FCFA
7.5 billion), (iv) clearance of arrears and the backlog of the national electricity company (EDM)
short term debts (FCFA 49 billion), and (v) higher current expenditure for health and education
(FCFA 8 billion) and agriculture (FCFA 5 billion). As part of the revised budget law, military
expenditure in 2013 would also be increased by FCFA 7.5 billion, to be exclusively financed by
domestic contributions.
25.     The implementation of the Government’s macro-economic program should
minimize risks of external debt distress. A Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA) was conducted in early 2013. 11 By end 2011, Mali’s external and domestic public debt
stood respectively at 28.1 and 4.7 percent of GDP. Mali’s external debt is entirely public, and the
bulk of it is with multilateral creditors, the International Development Association, and the
African Development Bank in particular. Most of Mali’s domestic public debt is with the Malian
Banking sector. Accounting for recent developments in 2012 (low external borrowing, good
export receipts) and medium term prospects (a return to a steady state 5 percent GDP growth, and
a progressive decline in gold net export receipts with declining reserves 12, the DSA continues to
assess Mali’s external risks of debt distress as “moderate?. Looking forward, the DSA identifies
gold price volatility and less concessional financial resources as the two main sources of potential
vulnerability.
26.     Mali’s exchange rate and monetary policies are set within the WAEMU framework.
In the West African Economic and Monetary Union the monetary and exchange rates policies are
independently run by the Central Bank, the BCEAO, which is mandated to ensure price stability.
Over its fifty years of existence, the BCEAO has established a strong track record in terms of
macro-economic management, keeping inflation under control in the monetary union and
protecting countries’ balance of payments from major disruptions. In its most recent annual
review, 13 the IMF staff acknowledges the adequacy of the current monetary stance, in light of
inflation risks. Yet, the IMF staff also recognizes the limited role monetary policies can play to
address asymmetric shocks, as observed for Mali in 2012 with the suspension of aid and the
deterioration of the security situation. Given the low degree of economic integration in WAEMU,
asymmetric shocks can only be addressed through fiscal policies, and the high frequency of such
shocks 14 will continue to pose significant risks to budget execution in the near future - to public
investments in particular. 15 For that matter, the WAEMU is keen to explore fiscal convergence
rules allowing for greater counter-cyclicality.

27.     Mali’s macro-economic framework is assessed as adequate for the purpose of the
proposed operation. The fiscal prudence set forth in the Budget Laws 2012 and 2013 (and
consistent budget execution so far), the adoption of a Rapid Credit Facility program with the IMF
in January 2013, the nature and pace of actions taken by the Government since 2012 to keep the

   Be it the outcome of commodity prices variation, abrupt climatic changes, or political crises, it appears that shocks
are highly asymmetric in WAEMU -- that is, not occurring at the same time in the different member countries.

   Dessus and Varoudakis (2013) indeed suggest that public investment plays, in WAEMU more than anywhere else,
the role of shock absorber, in the absence of alternative policy instruments.

conditions for the proposed operation to meet its objectives, and justify the use of IDA resources.

         D.       POVERTY TRENDS AND PROGRESS IN SOCIAL AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

28.     A recent report from the World Bank 16 underlines poverty reduction progress made
by Mali in the last decade. Between 2001 and 2010, the poverty rate of Mali (percentage of
population living below the national poverty line 17) declined from 55.6 to 43.6 percent. 18 This
positive trend is broadly in line with that observed for the whole Sub-Saharan Africa. 19 The
poverty reduction between 2001 and 2010 can be attributed for two-third to economic growth, and
for one-third to a reduction in inequality. Compared with poverty reduction episodes in other
African countries, Mali had a very pro-poor (“inclusive?), albeit very slow, per capita economic
growth. 20 High inclusivity in Mali results mainly from the fact that most of poor derive most of
their income from agriculture and consume most of it, as subsistence farmers. Between 2001 and
2010, subsistence farming (including rice) as computed in national accounts grew annually by 9
percent on average (and from 9.4 to 13.0 percent of GDP at factor cost). Related to that trend, the
severity of poverty almost halved during the same period.

29.     The decline in the poverty rate was not sufficient to significantly reduce the number
of poor. Between 2001 and 2010 the number of poor increased from about 5.7 to 6.4 million.
High fertility rates (6.7 children per women) strongly hamper poverty reduction, as entailing high
dependency ratios, worsening maternal mortality, and maintaining gender imbalances in various
areas. It also exerts enormous pressure on the capacity of the State to deliver basic services
(education, health, social protection, security) to all citizens, and on the capacity of labor markets
to absorb new entrants, 300,000 every year. Rural and urban under-employment is pervasive,
affects youth disproportionally, and significantly contributes to maintaining households in
situation of poverty and vulnerability.

   World Bank (2012), Republic of Mali: Poverty and Gender Notes, December, Washington D.C.
17
   A household is considered poor if its annual per capita consumption was below the national poverty line of FCFA
165,431 (approx. US$ 346) in 2010. A household is said to be ‘food poor’ if its level of total expenditure per capita is
below the food poverty line of FCFA 118,173, which is defined as the minimum consumption expenditure needed to
meet the cost of consuming 2450 kilocalories per day, reflecting Malian consumption habits. In 2010, 22 percent of
households were considered food poor.
18
   Using alternative poverty lines with a view to correct some methodological shortcomings, the report also suggest
that some of the geographical disparities in poverty might be exaggerated. This correction does not however affect
the magnitude of poverty reduction observed between 2001 and 2010.
19
   Between 1999 and 2008, the poverty rate in Sub-Saharan Africa declined from 57.9 to 47.5 percent of the

30.     There are wide geographical disparities in the prevalence of poverty. While all
regions recorded declines in poverty rates, some regions still stand out as much poorer than
others. Interestingly, the Northern regions of Mali (Timbuktu-Gao-Kidal) were in 2010 among the
richest regions in the country, after the capital city Bamako, even if, over time, the contribution of
Northern regions to national poverty increased, as it did also in Sikasso and Mopti-Ségou.

                                                 - 14 -
Alternative poverty measures (based on assets ownership – fridges, cars, etc. – for instance, or
based on nutrition outcomes), however, portray a different geography of poverty. Based on assets
ownership, the Northern regions appear to be the poorest in Mali. 21 Based on chronic malnutrition
indicators, Northern regions do not significantly differ from the Mali average, along with Kayes-
Koulikouro and Mopti-Segou. Only Bamako and Sikasso look significantly richer and poorer
respectively. 22

31.      Since 2010, poverty has likely increased as a result of the drought of 2011 and the
political crisis of 2012. The poverty rate is roughly estimated to have increased from 43.6 percent
in 2010 to 46.1 percent of the population by end 2012, or 7.2 million poor. In the South, the
poverty rate would stand at 46.2 percent, including displaced populations. In the North, the
poverty rate would stand at 44.3 percent, including refugees. These estimates account for the fact
that the refugees’ poverty situation in neighboring countries is likely to be much more severe than
that of populations displaced in the South. Field post-crisis assessments and the resumption of
quarterly household surveys, which started in 2011 but was stopped in March 2012, will be
critical to confirming these estimates.

32.     Mali’s high vulnerability points to the need to expand social safety net (SSN)
programs. The scope and coverage of the existing safety net system programs is too limited and
most interventions (mainly food transfers) are small in scale, designed as temporary programs,
and financed by external and ad hoc resources. Spending on SSN programs only corresponds to
0.5 percent of GDP, while over 25 percent of the population is food insecure. Given the needs of
the chronic poor and the limited fiscal space available for SSN programs, an expansion of the
safety nets programs and an allocation of scarce resources to well-targeted and cost-efficient
programs are necessary. Furthermore, the protection of public health, education and social
expenditures (regrouped under the definition of priority pro-poor expenditures), if not necessarily
benefiting the poor more than the others, is also a pre-requisite to poverty reduction (see section
IV.B). While difficult to assess, it is likely that (i) the strong decline in per capita health and
education expenditures, and (ii) the increased difficulty to deliver services to displaced population
in 2012, have contributed to poverty aggravation. The World Bank is currently assessing the
impact of the recent disruptions in health and education service delivery on human development
outcomes.

33.    Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been mixed.
Except for income poverty and access to water, most of other MDGs remain off-track to be met in
2015. As this assessment relies on pre-food (2011) and political (2012) crises period data, it is
unlikely that prospects have improved since.

34.     Health. Maternal and child health outcomes including those related to reproductive health
(RH) are among the most pressing problems. Maternal mortality is higher in rural areas where
access to emergency obstetric care is limited by large geographic distances to health facilities and
scarce resources. RH indicators are poor with only 49 percent of deliveries attended by skilled
personnel (including matrons), and 35.4 percent of pregnant women having received four or more
antenatal services (Demographic and Health Survey, DHS, 2006). Only 8.2 percent of married
women 15 to 49 years old use contraceptives while 31 percent have unmet family planning needs
(DHS 2006). Health problems are compounded by a population growth rate among the highest in
the world. This growth is expected to continue given the country’s young age structure, high


                                                      - 16 -
fertility rates and low levels of contraceptive use. The total fertility rate remains high at 6.7
children per woman, with much higher figures for women in rural areas (7.2 births per woman).
The adolescent fertility rate is high, affecting not only young women and their children’s health,
but also their long-term education and employment prospects.

35.    Malnutrition. There is a strong - but not perfect - correlation between income
poverty and malnutrition. Income poverty is positively associated with malnutrition, but the
correspondence is not perfect, as in 2010, two-thirds of food poor were malnourished 23, but only
one-fourth of malnourished were food poor. This is consistent with the fact that poverty and
malnutrition MDG did not evolve at the same pace, the former being on-track while the latter
being still off-track. In the face of it, targeted interventions to increase households’ purchasing
power (e.g. cash transfers) might not be sufficient to tackle malnutrition.

36.      Education. Under the government’s comprehensive ten-year Education Program
(PRODEC), strongly supported by donors, Mali made substantive progress but still failed to reach
all the set targets between 2002 and 2011 and thus related MDGs. The country continues to have
some of the lowest education indicators in the region. In basic education gross primary enrollment
rates increased from 74 percent in 2004/2005 to 80 percent in 2010, but inequities in coverage
persist. Public school construction could not keep up with demand, and while community schools
filled the gap, accounting for 5,500 of the 11,207 schools in Mali in 2010, that was not enough to
meet the demand. As a result, enrollment and completion rates remained low in many parts of the
country (Gross Enrollment rate in 2010 is 109 percent in Bamako and 56 percent in Kidal). In
addition, serious gender disparities persist, particularly in North Mali where the intake and
completion rates in Mopti in 2010 were 63 percent for boys and 38 percent for girls, respectively.
The gross enrollment rate in secondary education increased from 13 percent to 26 percent
between 2005 and 2010 in large part due to the government’s subsidies to private sector schools
(private enrollment increased while public enrollment declined), with pronounced inequities.

37.     Despite improvement in quality of education under PRODEC, learning outcomes
remain poor and inequitably distributed. Results obtained from the 2010 national student
assessment show that only 41 and 38 percent of second grade students in Mali perform
satisfactorily in reading, comprehension and in math, respectively, while the results of sixth grade
students are 48 percent in French and 31 percent in math, respectively. Low quality in primary
education is explained by a number of factors including low learning time, limited school inputs,
and limited teacher effectiveness in teaching children how to read in early grades, teacher
motivation and qualifications, especially in rural areas, and for language and math teachers.
Efforts to improve the quality of education had been implemented under the Bank supported
project PISE I and II, including significant improvements in the availability of books, transfers of
financial resources to schools, and massive teacher training programs.

38.      Water and Sanitation. While international and national definitions and measurement of
access to improved water sources and sanitation facilities differ, the picture of progress against
the MDG remains the same: There was good progress on access to water, even if disparities
between rural and urban areas remain significant. In contrast, progress on access to sanitation
facilities has been insufficient so far. Achieving MDGs, means providing annually access to safe
drinking water and improved sanitation services to, respectively, 420,000 and 710,000 additional

23
  Malnutrition is defined here by the presence of at least one stunted under-5 child in the household. In 2010, 44
percent of households in Mali were considered malnourished.



                                                   - 17 -
people and would cost about US$110M a year for water and US$30M a year for sanitation. To
date, investments in sanitation have been insignificant and there is an urgent need to fill the gap.
Most of the water projects include sanitation and hygiene promotion campaigns, but the share of
resources allocated to the development of sanitation facilities remains negligible.

                     E.       MALI GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

39.    In late 2011, Mali adopted its third Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(CSCRP-3), for the period 2012-17. The CSCRP-3 was prepared through extensive
consultations with different actors throughout the country, reflecting a strong commitment at the
highest level of government. 24 Building on lessons from previous PRSPs (design, implementation,
M&E) and emerging new realities (security, climatic and commodity price volatility), the
CSCRP-3 aims at promoting shared growth 25 and equitable access to quality social services, 26 and
at supporting institutional development, 27 under the prerequisites of peace, security and macro-
economic stability. The Priority Action Plan (PAP) lists the programs to be implemented in
support of the CSCRP-3 objectives, for a total cost of FCFA 9,744 billion over the 6 year period
of implementation.

40.     In 2013, the Government recently re-affirmed its commitment to implementing the
CSCRP-3, acknowledging delays in implementation and the emergence of new realities.
With reduced financial resources, unforeseen new social needs (e.g. displaced populations), and
great difficulties to deliver basic services in North Mali, the implementation of the CSCRP-3
hardly started in 2012. 28 Nonetheless, the Government considers that medium terms objectives
and related programs set forth in the CSCRP-3 remain fully relevant, as backed by a strong
consultative process. Thus, accounting for projected limited available financial resources in 2013-
14, the Government selected from the PAP a subset of programs initially envisaged to be
implemented in 2012-13. This set of programs regrouped under the Emergency Priority Action
Plan 2013-14 (PAPU) aims in priority at preventing the deterioration of human development
indicators during the transition. As such, sectors covered under the PAPU include security,
education, health, social protection, employment, rural development and public financial
management. In contrast, most programs retained under the CSCRP-3 for infrastructure and

24
   Consultations involved parliamentarians, local elected officials in Bamako and regions, civil society and the private
sector, academia, media, trade unions, technical and financial partners (PTF), and the like. A set of institutional
mechanisms and a clear roadmap guided the development of this new framework: a Steering Committee (including
its Thematic Groups), a Joint Commission-PTF Mali, Technical Secretariat, regional committees, local committees
and municipal committees.
25
   Specific objectives and related programs include: (i) increase the rural sector production and support emergence of
agro-business; (ii) promote industries, micro, small and medium enterprises, trade and services; (iii) facilitate access
to credit and increase investment ; (iv) develop infrastructure across the country to promote a modern economy and;
(v) promote employment and income generating activities.
26
   Specific objectives and related programs include: (i) control the population growth and better manage migration;
(ii) correct gender disparities; (iii) reduce social inequalities, notably by implementing the national social protection
strategy; (iv) improve access and quality of education, vocational and technical training and national capacity for
research ( v) reduce food insecurity, hunger and malnutrition; (vi) ensure access to quality health services to all; and
(vii) ensure environmental sustainability.
27
   Specific objectives and related programs include: (i) improving judicial governance; (ii) modernize civil service;
(iii) encourage regional poles for participative management; (iv) strengthen regional integration initiatives and sub-
regional and international relations; and (v) improve public finance management and efficiently fight corruption and
financial crimes.

industrial development have not been retained in the PAPU. Besides, crisis-related actions
contemplated under the political roadmap (e.g. elections, rehabilitation, reconciliation, security)
which were not contemplated in the PAP, were included in the PAPU in support of the
implementation of the political roadmap, see Figure 3.

41.     Implementing the PAPU would cost FCFA 2850 billion over the period 2013-14. This
cost represents about 86 percent of the initial cost of the PAP for the period 2012-2013, FCFA
3325 billion. Almost half of its actions and 57 percent of its cost are related to activities that were
not initially programmed in the PAP, see Figure 4. These include notably actions to restructure
security services, promote reconciliation through dialogue between communities, facilitate and
support the return of the administration, refugees and displaced populations in Northern regions,
organize elections, rehabilitate damaged infrastructure, encourage the development of labor
intensive economic activities, and strengthen State legitimacy and the rule of law.

  III.    WORLD BANK GROUP’S SUPPORT TO THE GROWTH AND POVERTY
                          REDUCTION STRATEGY

                     A.      LINKS TO THE INTERIM STRATEGY NOTE (ISN)

42.     Accounting for political, security and economic uncertainties, the Interim Strategy
Note FY14-15 aims primarily at accompanying the ongoing transition. The ISN
acknowledges the volatile institutional, political and security outlook for Mali in the next years to
come, weak implementation capacity, uncertain rehabilitation costs and institutional reforms in
conflict-affected areas, and, in this context, wishes to (i) lay the foundations for longer term
accountability and stability, (ii) protect human capital and build resilience, and (iii) prepare the
conditions for economic recovery. Flexibility and the rapid resumption of disbursement call for a
selected number of scalable investment projects primarily focused on rehabilitation and human
development. Development Policy Operations will support reforms aimed at strengthening
executive accountability and at improving the investment climate. Economic and Sector Work
will primarily aim at building a consensus on the lessons which can be drawn from the crisis and
the identification of critical reforms for shared growth. External communication and partnership
with civil society will be critical in this respect.

43.     The proposed operation is a central instrument of the ISN, given its size and focus.
The proposed operation and the ISN were developed in parallel, and as such their designs and
objectives were fully aligned.

44.    The proposed operation is also well aligned with the World Bank Strategy for Africa.
Conceived as a fast track operation to support basic service delivery programs and ensure their
smooth implementation in a volatile environment, the proposed operation aims at strengthening
Mali’s resilience against the many shocks it is being confronted with. In addition, its strong focus
on internal and external fiduciary controls and transparency aims at improving economic
governance and beyond, executive accountability for greater institutional stability. The proposed
operation is based on knowledge creation and knowledge sharing, benefitting from recent analysis
and policy notes prepared by the Bank and other donors. With the suspension of aid in 2012,
donor harmonization structures were also affected (see Section III.C). In particular, the budget
support group under which were discussed joint approaches (policy matrices, disbursement
calendars, annual reviews) became less active as budget support was suspended by all PTF since
March 2012. The design of the proposed operation nonetheless benefited from many interactions
with the PTF interested in resuming budget support, and the ISN envisages that the next DPO will
be processed within the harmonized budget support group as soon as it can be fully revitalized.

         B.    LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATIONS

45.    The proposed operation is drawing lessons from the Implementation Completion and
Results Report (ICR) for the first (1-2) and second (3-5) PRSC series. In particular, greater
realism and selectivity guided the policy reforms targeted for support, in a context of limited
capacity, focus and time, and a culture of slow moving reforms.

46.     Country ownership and the associated political economy of reforms are critical to the
success of the program. Consensus is sought for major policy decisions in Mali. The process can
be lengthy, delaying implementation of critical reforms. The proposed operation has taken into
account the experience from the delays of PRSC II series in three major reform agendas, namely
in the cotton sector, in the adoption of a new Investment Code and of a new tariff mechanism for

                                             - 20 -
electricity, which were not finalized by program closing. It is now evident that the sustained
political commitment needed for these major structural reforms may not have been deep-rooted
enough, allowing personal or political interest to affect the reform process and leading to multiple
delays and policy backtrackings. These occurred despite lengthy lead-in time and extensive
analysis and national consultation. Furthermore, the upcoming elections and the follow-on time
for the new government and national assembly to settle into governing and reach a consensus on
major reforms will absorb the policy makers at least throughout 2013. Therefore, the operation is
designed to concentrate on finalizing reforms already well engaged (in PFM and financial
irrigation notably) and supporting reforms for which consensus is strong (protecting pro-poor
expenditures) or builds on the current momentum of national mobilization for the re-unification of
the country (electricity tariffs).

47.    Close supervision and technical assistance are critical to address capacity constraints
and bottlenecks impeding or delaying the implementation of reforms in all sectors. The
experiences of the first and second PRSC series suggest that intense supervision, follow-up and
assessment are needed. Technical assistance needs to be programmed upstream and delivered on
time. A clear work program for achieving the reform measures needs to be agreed to and updated
on a quarterly basis, accompanied by a government prepared implementation report.

48.      Experience from the implementation of previous operations favors a streamlined but
strong multi-sectoral monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework. The quality and
reliability of data to measure outcomes are limited in Mali. The proposed operation uses the
experience of the previous PRSC series, focusing on parsimony and criticality of indicators (see
Annex 2). The operation is using indicators and targets that were chosen and agreed to jointly
with the authorities, to ensure ownership and monitoring without imposing additional costs to the
Government.

49.     More generally, lessons learned globally from dealing with de facto Governments
point to the need to maintain dialogue with authorities to the greatest extent possible with a
view to facilitate re-engagement when conditions allow for it. As such, efforts were maintained
throughout the preparation of the operation to keep close contact at the technical level with
authorities to stay informed of the social and economic situation and be able to rapidly identify
actions which could be supported under the proposed operation. As underlined in the assessment
conducted for Mali in June 2012, in accordance with OP 7.30 risks of not engaging with the
current Government could have further jeopardized stability and security. While working with the
Government presented some risks, not engaging could have entailed significant risks of seeing
Mali falling into a fragility trap, taking decades and being very costly to redress. 29

          C.      COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS’ PROGRAMS

50.     The proposed operation was designed in consultation with other development
partners, through various meetings held at the local and international levels. In 2013, along
with Germany and Denmark, the World Bank also resumed its participation to the “troika?, the
group of three DPs appointed on a rolling basis to conduct policy dialogue with authorities on
behalf of the larger development community.

51.    Development partners are organized in thematic groups, each of which maintains
close dialogue with the Government in specific areas, such as education, health, PFM and
macroeconomics. To provide Mali with a unified framework for a multi-donor approach to
budget support, the Government and a group of donors signed a Memorandum of Understanding
in March 2006 and renewed it on July 1, 2010. This group of donors included the African
Development Bank, Canada, Denmark, the European Commission, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Sweden, and the World Bank. This Budget Support Group initiated annual joint-
donor missions in 2007. The last review of the annual joint policy matrix took place in October
2011. With the political crisis and suspension of budget support, the group became less active.
Nonetheless, expressed intentions from the European Union, the African Development Bank and
the French Development Agency to resume budget support (see Section II.C) could provide the
necessary impetus to revive this structure and develop a programmatic approach starting in FY14.

52.     The RRSC has been prepared in close coordination with the IMF. Since the outset of
the political crisis, the IMF and World Bank teams collaborated closely, with a view to respond
swiftly and flexibly to the new environment. In particular, teams continued to maintain joint
dialogue with authorities on budget execution and reform implementation through a series of
video-conferences from Washington, DC in 2012. Following the agreed institutional division of
labor between the Bank and the IMF (as reflected for instance in the Mali-Joint World Bank-IMF
Work Program agreed for FY13), there is a common understanding of the macro and debt
sustainability situation, as well as that of macro-critical sectors (e.g. energy). The IMF and World
Bank teams are also closely collaborating on issues of public financial management with a clear
division of labor on the policy actions identified. The division of labor is also reflected in the
complementarity between prior actions in the proposed programmatic operation with indicative
targets criteria and structural benchmarks in the RCF, see Section IV.B.
                  D.     COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANK ACTIVITIES

53.     The proposed operation is part of a program of support to Mali that focuses on
public financial management, agriculture, energy and human development. It complements a
number of Bank technical assistance and project activities. In PFM, the PEFA 2010 has provided
insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the Malian system. It has been used as a base for
focusing the operation on the Government’s PAGAM/GPF II reform program, from which prior
actions were selected. In agriculture, the Competitiveness and Diversification Project (P130873)
and the Fostering Agricultural Productivity Project (P095091) support the reforms in the sector,
including those undertaken at the Office du Niger. In energy, the proposed operation benefited
from the ongoing dialogue and sector knowledge developed under the Energy Sector Support
Project (P108440) to support the implementation of the tariff adjustment mechanism. In human
development, the World Bank supports reforms through its reproductive health project (P124054)
and through the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) Trust Fund managed by the Bank. In
addition, the recent Emergency Safety Nets project (P127328), has the objective of improving the
welfare of food insecure households (chronic poor) and protecting them against shocks while
putting in place building blocks for a safety nets system.

                                E.      ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

54.       The design of the proposed operation draws on several economic and social analyses:

         The World Bank Country Economic Memorandum (#36751-ML) completed in 2007
          which underlined the criticality of reforming the regulatory environments in the cotton and
          energy sectors for job creation, productivity gains and private participation (prior action
          #8).

         The Education (#59108-ML) and Health (#70614-ML) country status reports of 2010 and
          2011 which identify policy reforms (expansion of basic service delivery, geographic
          deployment of human resource, information systems) and financing to accelerate progress
          against MDG (prior action #5).

         The review (#53222-ML) of social safety nets of 2011 which underlines the need to
          greatly expand their coverage given the size of vulnerable populations, increase domestic
          financing for sustainability, ensure trans-sectoral consistency, and develop an information
          system of beneficiaries (prior action #5).

         The numerous PFM assessments performed by or at the request of the authorities - the
          2007 Public Expenditures and Financial Accountability (PEFA), the 2008 the Mali Public
          Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review, the 2009 Country
          Systems Review for project Financial Management and, the 2011 Public Expenditures and
          Financial Accountability (PEFA) – which underline recent progress (budget credibility,
          comprehensiveness and transparency, policy-based budgeting and predictability in budget
          execution) and remaining challenges to be tackled (accounting, recording and reporting,
          and external scrutiny audit and legislative oversight) (prior actions #1, #2, #3, #4 and #6).

         The Investment Climate Assessment of 2011 which confirms the comparative advantages
          Mali has in many agricultural sectors (fresh and dry fruits, animals and animal products,
          rice and cereals, legumes, leather and meats), and emphasizes the growing constraint that
          corruption exerts on business development and formalization (prior action #7).

         The re-engagement notes of 2012 which assess the impact of the events of 2012 on
          various sectors, and the most urgent policy actions to be taken in health, education, social
          protection, agriculture, PFM and electricity. The notes also try to estimate the impact of
          the political crisis on poverty and malnutrition (prior actions #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7 and
          #8).

         And IMF and World Bank continued economic monitoring and analysis (Article IV
          reports, ECF and RCF reviews, Debt Sustainability Analyses) which assess the
          sustainability of the fiscal stance and the broader macro-economic framework.

       IV.   THE PROPOSED RECOVERY AND REFORM SUPPORT CREDIT

                              A.      RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES

55.     The proposed Recovery and Reform Support Credit (RRSC) aims to support the
authorities’ three-pronged efforts to (i) deepen executive accountability, (ii) protect poverty
reduction progress made in recent years, and (iii) prepare for a rapid economic recovery as the
political and security transition ends. Government’s efforts supported by the RRSC concentrate
on measures to:

      Install the AICE software and its interface with management applications for tax revenues
       (SIGTAS) and customs data (ASYCUDA), covering all transactions at the central
       government level, for purposes of integrating the management of tax and customs
       revenues in the accounting information system;

      Adopt a risk-based approach for internal controls in the Ministries of Health and
       Education;

      Adopt and transmit to the National Assembly the budget execution reports for fiscal years
       2010 and 2011, and the legal opinion on the budget execution report for fiscal year 2010;

      Adopt the Budget Transparency Code and submit it to the National Assembly;

      Increase the share of priority pro-poor expenditures to total expenditure through the
       Budget Law 2013 in comparison with the Budget Law 2012;

      Establish a selection committee for public investment projects;

      Adopt a new financial mechanism for irrigation for the office du Niger area;

      Adopt and implement an automatic electricity tariff adjustment mechanism.

                   B.      DESIGN AND FOCUS OF THE PROPOSED OPERATION

56.     Policy actions supported by the proposed operation are consistent with the narrow
mandate of the Transitional Government of National Unity. The Government program is
described in the following paragraphs and reflected in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex
1). Table 8 details the RRSC prior actions and status. The rationale for their selection is discussed
below, namely their importance to the program and expressed Government commitment and
feasibility. All the prior actions supported by the proposed operation originate from the CSCRP-3.
As such, they are part of the broader policy reform agenda pursued by the authorities in the recent
years, and supported by the donor community, the World Bank and the IMF.

Deepening Executive Accountability
57.     In line with PEFA (2011) findings, the RRSC supports Government’s measures to
strengthen financial reporting, internal audit controls, National Assembly oversight, and
budget transparency. Measures supported by the proposed operation are part of the ongoing
Action Plan for the Improvement and Modernization of Public Finance Management II
(PAGAM/GFP II). This second PFM action plan was adopted by the Government in July 2010 for
the period 2011-2015 and adjusted through an operational plan in November 2011 to incorporate


                                             - 24 -
issues resulting from the findings of the 2011 PEFA Update report and the adoption of the
internal controls strategy. It succeeds the PAGAM GPF I for the period 2007-10. Between 2007
and 2011, important progress was recorded in areas of budget credibility, comprehensiveness and
transparency, policy-based budgeting and predictability in budget execution (see also Box 2).
Revenue and expenditure out-turns compared to the original budgets testify to the credibility of
the budget. The budget which is more realistic, is prepared with due regard to government policy
and implemented as intended. Obvious progress has been made, such as in the budget information
submitted to National Assembly, accessible to the public through the MEFB website and the
budget classification. Significant improvements have also been noticed in the availability of
information on resources received by service delivery units and the quality of in-year budget
reports. Such progress strongly contributed to the efficient management of the budget crisis in
2012. However, several challenges remain.

58.     Accounting and Financial Reporting. Up to now, the public financial management
system is not fully integrated from revenues collection to the different phases of the expenditure
cycle. Implementation of a computerized system to centralize fiscal data, from commitments to
accounting entries, and linked to an operational accounting system is crucial. This would improve
the quality of internal controls and budget execution reporting, reduce the time required to
produce annual financial statements and balance sheets and strengthen the role of the Budget
Execution Law. It also allows exchanging real-time information on the different stages of credit
management, money orders and payments. The absence of this system affects the transparency of
budget execution as well as the quality and timeliness of accounting and reporting. In this regard,
the Government, through the Ministry of Economy, Finances and Budget, installed the AICE
software and its interface with management applications for tax revenues (SIGTAS) and customs
data (ASYCUDA), covering all transactions at the central government level, for purposes of
integrating the management of tax and customs revenues in the accounting information system
(RRSC prior action), following the implementation of AICE at the Paymaster General of the
Treasury in 2011.

59.     Internal audit controls. Internal audit functions are carried out by the Contrôleur General
des Services Publics (CGSP, General Control Agency for Public Services), operating under the
authority of the Prime Minister with extended competencies on any public administration or
agency; the General Inspectorate of Finance under the authority of the Ministry of Finance, with
extended competencies to intervene at the level of any public or private bodies benefiting from
public resources, and various Internal Audit departments in Line Ministries. However their
efficiency in monitoring the budget execution is limited due to lack of professional audit methods
and risk assessment techniques and duplication of ex-post reviews. In the face of it, the
Government decided to strengthen the effectiveness of the internal audit spelled out in the
National strategy for internal controls and implement actions to reinforce the capacity of internal
audit institutions and the management teams. Thus, the Government, through the Contrôleur
General des Services Publics, started implementing this strategy with the adoption of a risk- based
approach for internal controls in the Ministries of Health and Education (RRSC prior action). The
Government intends thereafter to extend this initiative to all Ministries.

60.    External Audits and Parliamentary Oversight. External audit remains weak and
arrangements for scrutiny of public finances and follow-up by the executive are not operational.
Continued efforts are required to improve the availability of central government accounts, to clear




                                            - 25 -
up the institutional issues surrounding the creation of an Independent Supreme Audit Institution
(“Cour des Comptes?) in line with WAEMU Directives, 30 and to build up its capacities. Efforts
are also needed to establish and consolidate the structure to provide support for the National
Assembly for an effective parliamentary oversight. In the shorter run, the Government is
committed to improve the timeliness of budget execution reports and Budget Review Acts (“Lois
de Réglement?) to the Assembly and the legal opinions on it from the Audit Section of the
Supreme Court (“Section des Comptes?). As such, the Government adopted and transmitted to the
National Assembly the budget execution reports for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and the legal
opinion on the budget execution report for fiscal year 2010 (RRSC prior action). Also, with a
view to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of external audit reviews , the Government proposed
a framework for the treatment of audit backlogs of the period 1960-1991 which is adopted by the
National Assembly . The accelerated audit of the management accounts (“comptes de gestion?)
for the period 1992-2008 is also being finalized.

61.     Transparency. The 2012 Open Budget Index rated Mali 57st out of 98 countries on
public availability of budget information. With a view to improve budget transparency and
strengthen executive accountability, and in conformity with WAEMU PFM regulations
(“Directives?) to be transposed in national legislations – see below, the Government, through its
Council of Ministers, adopted the Budget Transparency Code and submitted it to the National
Assembly (RRSC prior action). The transparency code notably clarifies the institutional
responsibilities, format and frequency for the publication of information related to budget
preparation and execution (central and local levels), audits, public contracts and procurement,
public private partnerships. The Transparency code also stipulates legal obligations for officials to
frequently declare their assets, and to denounce any fraud in the management of public resources
they could be made aware of by their official functions. Following adoption by Cabinet and
National Assembly, the code will need to be transposed into national legislation, and its
implementation will require building adequate administrative capacity.

62.     Since 2011, Authorities are also publishing the “Citizen’s Budget?, with a view to
familiarize citizens with national Budgets and strengthen their capacity to monitor and
exert control on them. The Citizen’s Budget discusses in a user friendly manner the
macroeconomic assumptions retained, the main sources of revenues, spending choices, and major
policies supported by the budget. The budget laws are also translated in local idioms and posted
on the MEFB website. Moving forward, the development of the AICE could pave the way for a
frequent and user friendly dissemination of budget execution reports

63.     In parallel, the World Bank envisages to support more frontally Demand for Good
Governance Interventions through its ongoing Governance and Decentralization project,
acknowledging the growing need to better complement supply interventions with demand
interventions at the national, transversal and local levels. This technical assistance project
addresses the need for improved budgetary decision-making and enhanced transparency and
oversight at decentralized level. One of its four components, destined to be strengthened, is
concerned with external oversight and community participation. This component supports
establishing a framework for effective participation of key stakeholders (including women and
youth) in the monitoring and evaluation of the allocation and use of public resources,

30
   The Government submitted the creation of the Independent Supreme Audit Institution as part of a package of
constitutional amendments to the National Assembly, which approved them in July 2011. As implying an amendment
to the Constitution, a referendum would then be required to create the Court legally.



                                                 - 26 -
establishment and implementation of a mechanism for the collection and treatment of financial
data to inform community surveillance committees, and provision of training on the use of the
said mechanism.

64.    Other WAEMU regulations to be transposed into national legislation cover budget
preparation and execution laws, government accounting, budget classifications, central
government chart of accounts (CoA), and central government operations. The Government
intends to transpose these regulations as well in 2013. In this regard, a bill was submitted by the
Government to the National Assembly in February 2013.

65.    Efforts are also ongoing to improve cash management. Under the Rapid Credit Facility
arrangement approved in 2013, the IMF is supporting the non-accumulation of domestic and
external arrears, as well as actions from authorities to reduce delays in public expenditure
payments, reduce tax fraud, improve cash management and establish the single treasury account.

Protecting Poverty Reduction Gains
66.    Pro-poor expenditures. Priority pro-poor public expenditures in Mali comprise all
domestically-financed public expenditures for education (basic, secondary and tertiary), health,
and social sectors. In 2011 the Government budgeted FCFA 371 billion for pro-poor expenditure,
and eventually spent FCFA 360 billion (7.2 percent of GDP, 28.9 percent of actual total
expenditure). In 2012, however, while the Government initially budgeted FCFA 427 billion, it
was only able to spend FCFA 313 billion (6.0 percent of GDP and 29.8 percent of actual total
expenditure), as its fiscal resources severely dwindled after aid was suspended (see Section II.B).
This suspension translated into a sharp decline of about 25 percent between 2011 and 2012 in pro-
poor per capita expenditure in real terms (see columns 2 and 4, Table 7, for budget execution),
with serious implication for health and learning outcomes. In the event, domestically-financed
investment programs were the hardest hit with respect to the budget execution in 2011.

67.     Through its Budget Law 2013 submitted to the National Assembly, the Government
increased the share of priority pro-poor expenditures to total expenditure through the
Budget Law 2013 in comparison with the Budget Law 2012 (RRSC prior action).
Acknowledging the very limited financial resources available for domestically-financed
investment, the Budget Law 2013 nonetheless foresees to significantly increase the share of
priority pro-poor expenditure in the budget (compared with both the initial Budget Law 2012 and
with the budget execution in 2012 - see the penultimate row “Percentage of Total Expenditure? in
Table 7), with a view to protect per capita basic service delivery, 31 and increase the actual amount
of priority pro-poor expenditure to be spent in 2013 compared with what was spent in 2012.
Thus, personnel and other current expenditures, such as textbook, drugs and vaccination were
budgeted to accommodate for inflation and growing relevant populations. The resumption of
foreign assistance (such as the GPE-sponsored emergency education project) could complement
this effort with a view to limit the over-crowding of facilities (schools, hospitals) resulting from
insufficient investments and the displacement of populations.



31
   While the focus here is put on budgeting, as a way to reflect Government’s commitment to protect pro-poor
expenditure over the transition period, the results framework emphasizes too (and monitors accordingly) the
importance of budget execution in 2013, see Annex 2. The results framework will thus consider the execution of the
likely revised budget law for 2013 (see Section II.C).

68.     Protecting pro-poor expenditures is a prerequisite for poverty reduction. Admittedly,
“priority pro-poor expenditures? are not all meant to exclusively benefit the poor, such as primary
education or health care for which the Government aims to grant universal access. As elsewhere,
such a classification of expenditures generates skepticism on their pro-poor nature, in comparison
to targeted cash transfers for instance. 32 In this respect, revisiting the definition of pro-poor
expenditure could be useful for properly monitoring and evaluating poverty reduction policies.
Yet, in Mali’s context, it is likely that protecting “priority pro-poor expenditures? as currently
defined contributes to poverty reduction. In its last country education status report of 2010 the
World Bank suggests for instance through a benefit incidence analysis that Mali ranks well
internationally in terms of equitable access to public schools. While rich children have greater
access to public schools, the difference with poor children is less pronounced than in most Sub-
Saharan African countries. The difference becomes more pronounced at the end of the school
cycle (tertiary), as poor children’s survival rates decline more rapidly. Addressing such an issue
(seemingly the consequence of an insufficient demand for post-primary education among poor,
especially in Northern regions) calls for stimulating demand through targeted policies, which
requires additional financing. Conversely, substituting supply side interventions with demand side
interventions would bear the significant risk of reducing the poor’s relatively high access to
school. Besides, the ongoing World Bank assessment of the human development impact of
reduced priority pro-poor expenditure with the crisis (coupled with population displacements) will
contribute to the identification of the beneficiaries of priority pro-poor expenditures.

69.     The Government is also developing the institutional framework for managing and
coordinating social safety nets. Improving social protection has become a priority of the
Government of Mali, and, in 2011, an action plan for the extension of the social protection
strategy was prepared and adopted. In 2013, the Government established a steering committee and
a technical unit at the MEFB in charge of coordination and management for the safety net system.
This institutional framework will host the World Bank sponsored emergency safety net project
approved in 2013.

Preparing for the Economic Recovery
70.     The RRSC supports Government’s measures to prepare for economic recovery,
focusing on improving the investment climate. As discussed in Section II.C, the resumption of
public and private investments in Mali will be hampered by the need to address the various
consequences of the crisis in terms of physical rehabilitation, additional social and security needs,
and possibly financial support to sectors particularly affected by the crisis. These will take
precedence over the development of new infrastructure and new productive capacities. Besides,
on a more structural basis, low overall levels of public and private investments in Mali point to a
poor investment climate, characterized notably by low infrastructure levels. In fact, Mali stands
among the Sub-Saharan African and low-income countries with the lowest levels of
infrastructure, roads and electricity generation in particular. 33 The proposed operation supports
authorities’ efforts to address the infrastructure gap through (i) better public investment selection,
implementation and evaluation, (ii) the development of a financial scheme for private investment
in irrigation, and (iii) greater maintenance and investment capacity in electricity generation
through the adoption of cost-recovery tariffs.

71.     Public Investment Management. A review of Mali’s public investment management
conducted in 2012 for the MEFB identified several areas to improve public investment
effectiveness and efficiency: strategic project selection, project appraisal, budgeting, procurement,
execution, accounting and ex-post evaluation. 34 An action plan was derived from the review by
the MEFB, pointing to the need first to formally establish a selection committee for public
investment projects (RRSC prior action), which the Government, through the Ministry of
Economy, Finances and Budget, did. Such a committee was already operating on an informal
basis, and its formal establishment will consolidate its institutional authority, mandate and
capacity. Seen as a first essential step in the improvement of the public investment management
framework, the establishment of the committee shall be followed by the (i) creation of a fund to
finance feasibility studies and ex-post evaluations, and (ii) the constitution of a bank of projects to
be budgeted when financing become available. The committee will be headed by the Direction for
Development Planning (DNPD) at MEFB and will comprise representatives of the directions of
Budget, Public Debt, Treasury, Public Procurement, Poverty Reduction Strategy, Local
Governments and Foreign Cooperation, as well as from the National Statistical Institute and the
Environment and Sustainable Development Agency. The committee will be mandated to select
projects based on a number of pre-identified criteria (availability of feasibility studies, rates of
return, social and environmental safeguards, implications for current expenditure, financing
availability, etc.). While primarily aimed at improving the quality of domestically financed

investment projects (3.7 percent of GDP in 2011), the plan to improve public investment
management should also eventually comprise foreign-financed investment projects (5.1 percent of
GDP), notably when it comes to budgeting and drawing lessons from ex-post evaluations. Moving
forward, it is hoped that the ongoing dialogue between WAEMU and the bank on “boosting
capital budget execution? will inform the implementation of the action plan.

72.      Irrigation financial Scheme. Rice, which is cultivated in rotation with vegetables, could
see its production dramatically increase with the expansion of irrigated areas in the area under the
control of the office du Niger. While about 80,000 hectares are currently irrigated, the office du
Niger has the capacity to provide irrigation for more than one million hectares, 300,000 of which
in the next years. 35 This effort would complement parallel efforts to raise yields from 5 to 8-10
tons per hectare through the adoption of new varieties, and would strongly contribute to food
security, poverty reduction and economic diversification. Institutional reforms and investments in
irrigation have proven crucial in reducing vulnerability to weather-related shocks by contributing
to increased rice production, notably in the irrigable lands on the left bank of the Niger River.

73.      In order to attract private investments, enhance focus on producer's participation
and co-financing including the involvement of the banking sector an irrigation funding
mechanism for Office du Niger area was designed in consultation with key stakeholders. 36
The Government, through its council of Ministers, adopted a new financial mechanism for
irrigation for the Office du Niger area (RRSC prior action). The adoption of the mechanism
comprises the establishment of the land management agency and the irrigation fund. The agency
will be made responsible to lease irrigable land to private entrepreneurs on a long term basis, with
a view to provide them with the security needed to invest in irrigation infrastructure on a cost-
sharing basis. It is expected that lease titles could serve as collateral in the medium term to
finance private investment in irrigation infrastructure, as the secondary market for leases develop.
The fund will complement the agency by pre-financing the irrigation networks and levy fees for
access to these networks in the first years of inception of the financial mechanism. In the medium
term, the fund would finance the subsidized shared of the investment using the proceeds from the
access fees. The implementation of this transparent institutional framework is expected to help the
authorities better manage the process of funding irrigation they are engaged in. Water resource
management related to the expansion of the irrigation network will be dealt with through the
institutional framework set forth by the Niger Basin Authority, see Section V.B. The PAPAM
will complement this endeavor, in providing technical assistance for water resource management
within the agency, with a view to ensure the sustainability of the financing scheme.

74.     Electricity Tariffs. The domestic energy resources potential of Mali consists mainly of
biomass, hydropower and solar energy. Petroleum products are entirely imported with a
significant cost premium over international prices, given the geographical position of the country
(landlocked and far from the regional ports). In addition, the low overall population density of the
country, and the poverty of rural populations makes it very challenging to extend access to
electricity in a financially sustainable manner. In spite of these structural handicaps, and starting
with the beginning of operation of the Manantali regional hydropower plant, the GoM has

35
   At independence in 1960 total irrigated area covered around 40,000 ha. Since then only 40,000 ha have been
developed while the existing infrastructure (dam and main canal) allows irrigating around 300,000 ha.
36
   Through the Fostering Agricultural Productivity Project (PAPAM) approved in 2010, The World Bank is providing
complementary financial and technical assistance to the productivity of smallholder agricultural and agribusiness rice
producers in the Niger Basin.

managed to aggressively increase access to electricity. At the end of 2011, the number of
connections to the electricity grid stood at 261,000, representing a 120 percent increase over a
nine-year period (from 119,000 in 2002). The extension of the distribution grid and the
densification of connections, combined with electrification of rural localities through mini-grid
managed by independent private operators under the support of the rural electrification agency
(Malian Agency for the Development of Household Energy and Rural Electrification), have made
possible a significant increase in the access rate to electricity. 37 The Malian authorities estimate
that the share of the population with access to electricity is currently around one-third (admittedly
under a very broad definition of access including rural households living in villages with
electricity services but which are not directly connected). 38 As a result of the increase in access
and of economic growth, electricity consumption has been growing at a sustained pace over the
last decade (at around 9-10 percent per year). Meeting this demand has become increasingly
challenging.

75.      Over the recent years, the national electricity company, EDM, saw its financial
capacity to invest strongly eroded. Since 2006, all the generation from Manantali is absorbed by
domestic demand and the GoM has no choice but to resort to alternative supply sources to meet
the rapidly growing demand. It did so through combining domestic thermal generation (with in
particular two HFO-fired plants constructed around Bamako and now operational) with regional
solutions (Félou regional hydropower project developed jointly with Senegal and Mauritania,
construction of an interconnection with Cote d’Ivoire). Overall, this approach was reasonable and
balanced, combining investments with short lead times providing some level of energy
independence (domestic thermal generation) with regional alternatives (hydro and
interconnections) longer to implement but resulting in lower generation costs. However, this
development strategy has not been accompanied by adjustments to electricity tariffs that would
have reflected the increasing share of thermal generation in the mix, and higher oil prices. As a
result, nominal electricity tariffs were lower in January 2013 than in 2003, in spite of the
considerable inflation in costs over the period. This failure to pursue cost recovering tariffs has
put the finances of the sector in an increasingly untenable position. In the design of its concession
contract, EDM 39 is supposed to finance its investment program on the basis of its own cash flow
complemented by borrowing based on the strength of its own balance sheet. This has proved
impossible due to the increasingly inadequate levels of electricity tariffs for consumers connected
to the grid. 40 As a result, since 2006, new investments have increasingly been financed with GoM
support (for the most part without on-lending of the debt to EDM which is not in a position to
bear the corresponding debt service obligations). This support has however become insufficient to
prevent further deterioration of EDM’s cash position and short term debt situation. As a result,
since 2010, the GoM has been forced to subsidize EDM operational expenses in order to allow the
utility to purchase enough fuel to run its plant and meet electricity demand.

76.    Moving forward, the Government is committed to have electricity operation costs
and investment plans increasingly financed by consumers. Government’s intention is based on

the understanding that (i) the situation prevailing so far puts electricity supply at risk; (ii) that
EDM needs to strengthen its balance sheets to finance its investment plans through its own
resources; (iii) that current subsidies benefit mainly non poor households, in spite of a progressive
tariff structure (see Annex 4), and that (iv) subsidies could be re-directed to investments in
connection to provide greater access to electricity to the poor. In order to do so, the Government,
through the Commission de Regulation de l’Electricité et de L’Eau (CREE, Electricity and Water
Regulatory Commission), adopted and implemented the automatic electricity tariff adjustment
mechanism (RRSC prior action). Thus, in February 2013, electricity tariffs were increased on
average by 6.5 percent. Whereas some sector analysts expressed the view that the mechanism
relies on questionable parametric assumptions, the Government considers that implementing the
mechanism in 2013 will provide the opportunity to review the adequacy of its key parameters,
and amend it if need be to facilitate the timely and sustainable adjustment of tariffs to change in
the generation costs. In support of these objectives and to ensure their political feasibility over the
medium term, the Government proactively took the lead to communicate that tariff increases were
pro-poor. The dissemination of the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (Annex 4) will contribute
to this endeavor.

                          Box 1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership. The operation supports implementation of Mali’s PAPU 2013-14, which
comprise programs from the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (CSCRP-3) adopted by the
Government in December 2011, and from the Roadmap adopted by the National Assembly in January 2013. The
CSCRP-3, which benefits from broad-based consensus, is Mali’s third poverty reduction strategy, the first dating to
2002 and the second to December 2007. Mali has an established track record of participatory and meaningful
consultations in the design and monitoring of its PRS.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework. The Bank is an active participant in the budget support donor group and has been basing its budget
support on the agreed coordinated framework since 2006. However, with the suspension of aid (including budget
support) in 2012, the group was not in position to develop a coordinated framework (policy matrix, monitoring and
evaluation) for future budget support operations. In this context, the World Bank agreed directly on a coordinated
accountability framework with the Government, while consulting with interested partners at the different stages of
designing the operation. It is hoped that the resumption of budget support by other Development Partners will allow
the full reactivation in 2014 of the harmonized budget support structure.

Principle 3: Balancing Predictability and Flexibility. The proposed operation was designed on a fast track basis to
accompany the political transition at a critical juncture. As such, the policy matrix was developed to ensure that it
could meet country’s peculiar circumstances (a narrow mandate and time for the Transitional Government of
National Unity), building on ongoing initiatives and strategies.

Principle 4: Streamlining critical actions for achieving results. The proposed operation is parsimonious in
selecting only eight prior actions. The chosen prior actions were identified jointly with the Government, focusing on
policy areas consistent with the limited mandate of the Government. Most actions are self-standing and will not
necessitate follow up actions (as in programmatic series) to achieve their intended development results.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support. Although developed in fiscal year due to circumstances, efforts were made to announce as quickly as
possible within the fiscal year the intended amount and disbursement calendar to facilitate cash management. Prior
actions were designed with authorities with a view to be easily measured.

                                    A.      PARTICIPATION PROCESS

77.      The proposed operation supports implementation of Mali’s PAPU 2013-14, which
comprise programs from the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (CSCRP-
3) adopted by the Government in December 2011, following an extensive consultation
process, and from the Roadmap adopted by the National Assembly in January 2013. The
CSCRP-3, which benefits from broad-based consensus, is Mali’s third poverty reduction strategy,
the first dating to 2002 and the second to December 2007. Mali has an established track record of
participatory and meaningful consultations in the design and monitoring of its PRS.

                                   B.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

78.      Measures supported by the proposed operation are not expected to have any
significant negative impact on the environment. The budgeting of pro-poor expenditures, the
establishment of a public investment projects selection committee, the installation of the AICE
software, the adoption of a risk-based approach for internal audit controls in Ministries of Health
and Education, the adoption of the transparency code and the submission of budget execution
reports to National Assembly are all environmentally neutral. The increase in electricity tariffs
could improve energy conservation, and is not expected to induce any significant switching to
dirty energy in net terms. In Mali, electricity is used for lighting and running appliances, but not
for cooking, as reported in the various household surveys. As such, electricity tariff increases
could only induce switching to kerosene for lighting, but such a substitution effect is expected to
be negligible given that poor households (typically the most sensitive to changes in relative prices
of energy given its importance in overall budget) 41 will not be affected, see below. Also, even
with tariff increases, electricity will still remain much cheaper than kerosene. Finally, the setting
up of the financial mechanism for irrigation will contribute to increased water abstraction from
the Niger Basin which is shared with eight riparian countries. The recipient is a member of the
Niger Basin Authority and signatory of the Niger Water Charter which regulates the sharing of
the water resources. As part of their obligations stipulated in the Water Charter, the Recipient has
to notify on a no-objection basis the riparian countries through the Niger River Basin Authority in
Niamey of the type and size of the irrigation investments planned at Office du Niger. The
Recipient will confirm the applicability of this notification system to the new developments
financed under the Irrigation Fund. In order to enforce this regulation, the Land Management
Agency in charge of the Irrigation Financing Mechanism will ensure that no land lease is made
that is not related to a secured and agreed water right 42.

79.      More generally, the Government’s reform agenda builds on Mali’s robust
environmental institutional framework. The country has sound environmental legislation and
institutions though some harmonization and capacity building are needed to ensure an optimum
efficiency of the whole system for the mainstreaming of sustainability in socio-economic
development. The backbone of the environmental policy and institutional framework is the
Constitutional Law of 1992 which states that: "Everyone has the right to benefit a healthy

opened for development, and connected to the main water supply lines. No communication would be necessary for
individual investors’ projects.

environment. Environmental protection and promotion of quality of life is an obligation of all and
the state". To this end, the country has adopted the National Policy for Environmental Protection
(NEPP) in 1998, the main components of which are related to (i) fight against desertification, (ii)
pollution prevention and control, and (iii) poverty reduction. In line with the objectives of the
NEPP, specific policies/strategies have been adopted such as: the National Plan of Environmental
Action Plan, the National Strategy for Managing the Protected Areas, the National Policy for
Adaptation to Climate Change, and the National Strategy of Management of Biodiversity.
Furthermore, the CSCRP-3 as well as many regional and local development action plans have
been ‘’greened’’ through a participative approach, and therefore incorporate environmental and
social sustainability measures. In addition to traditional regulations governing the management of
natural resources such as forests, water courses and basins, hygiene and sanitation, specific
regulations are in place to enforce environmental assessment procedures (Decree No. 08-346/P-
RM of June 26, 2008). The mining code also entails environmental and social sustainability
provisions. The coordination of the policies and strategies, and the enforcement of the specific
regulations are under the responsibility of the following institutions: (i) the inter-ministerial
committee for the coordination of cross-sectoral environmental issues; (ii) the Ministry in charge
of Environment; (iii) the National Directorate of Control of Pollution and Nuisances (DNACPN);
(iv) the Environment and Sustainable Development Agency (AEDD); (v) the Sewage Treatment
Plants Management Agency. Regarding the integration of environmental aspects in sector
policies, programs and projects, the DNACPN is responsible for the enforcement of the EIA and
Environmental Audit procedures while the AEDD is responsible of the strategic environmental
assessment; this is a source of inefficiency which need to be solved.

80.     However, environmental institutions are lacking capacities on both the required
expertise and the structural budget availability aspects. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of
Environment and Sanitation and its line institutions have little leverage for the enforcement of
environmental management/assessment regulations and procedures. Regarding environmental
governance, lot of effort must be done. On the one hand, for public participation to the decision
making on environment issues, there are few formal forum for inviting public input though the
EIA regulation provides an adequate space to this end. On the other hand, without sound
environmental standards and norms, it's obvious that the judicial system would not have the
capacity to fairly handle complaints related to environmental matters. Finally, the country had
recently engaged in the setting up of a financial mechanism which will be used as a strategic tool
to channelize international instruments (carbon funds) support to the implementation of
sustainable land and water management and renewable energy projects.

                             C.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL ASPECTS

81.     Measures supported by the proposed operation are expected to have a significant
positive and direct effect on poverty reduction, though through various degrees. The
protection of priority pro-poor expenditures is expected to ensure the financing of basic service
delivery during the transition. The selection of public investment projects with high social returns,
and higher investment capacity in agriculture and power are expected to foster inclusive growth
over the medium term. More indirectly, greater executive accountability and budget transparency
are expected to reduce fiduciary risks and ensure the allocation of public financial resources
where voted by the National Assembly. This is likely to reduce corruption and political capture,
which are both generally detrimental to the poorest and most vulnerable segments of the society.

82.    The Poverty and Social Impact Assessment of electricity tariff increases in 2013
suggests an insignificant impact on poverty, See Annex 4. Less than 5 percent of poor

                                             - 35 -
households had access to electricity in Mali in 2010. And poor having access to electricity (2
percent of the population) were devoting only 2-3 percent of their consumption to electricity,
against 4-6 percent for non-poor households (17 percent of the population) connected to the grid.
Micro simulations run using household data from 2010 suggest that a 6.5 percent average tariff
increase could induce a marginal increase of 0.05 percentage point of the poverty rate.
Nonetheless, such an effect could be concentrated in Bamako, where most of the poor and near
poor connected to the grid reside.

                                 D.      FIDUCIARY ASSESSMENT

83.      Public financial management is solid enough to warrant the continuation of
Development Policy Operations (see Box 2). The Government had adopted an update of the
integrated public finance management action plan (PAGAM / GFP II). The action plan addresses
the main risks highlighted in the 2010 PEFA, which indicated that: (1) budget credibility is
satisfactory, except for arrears management; (2) budget comprehensiveness and transparency are
rated as adequate but further progress requires inclusion in the budget of information such as data
of autonomous government agencies, on the programs financed by donors and on fiscal
information between central and local entities; (3) budgeting is based on sectoral policies and
multi-year policies; (4) the quality of the instruments, rules, and procedures is generally adequate.
The procurement system has been modernized in three dimensions namely the legal and
institutional framework and, the control system of bidding documents. However, capacity
building is required for the implementation and monitoring of budget execution, especially of
planned actions in the area of data processing, analysis, and control systems. The compliance with
internal control rules and the effectiveness of internal audit need to be improved; and (5)
accounting and reporting, as well as external scrutiny and audits, are reported to be weak. The
proposed operation supports the implementation of PAGAM / GFP II, focusing on financial
reporting, internal and external controls and parliamentary oversight. The OP7.30 Assessment of
2012 confirmed that, even if PFM reform plans had been postponed with the political crisis, the
fiduciary environment had remained adequate for the Bank to process its operations.

84.     A Fiduciary review of the security sector was also conducted in FY13, at the request
of authorities. The review covered the armed forces and the domestic security, which both saw
their budget allocations significantly increasing in 2012 and 2013. Overall, the review found that
the security sector was facing PFM issues similar to that of the larger central government (e.g.,
financial reporting and controls), with some specificities related to the particular nature of the
sector (payroll management, special cash advance, procurement, physical assets recording). It is
hoped that the review will provide the framework for reform identification and implementation,
and thus facilitate the restructuration and modernization of the sector.

85.     The BCEAO is the common central bank of the West African States, which includes
Mali. In 2005, the IMF staff carried out an on-site safeguards assessment of the BCEAO and
found that progress has been made in strengthening the BCEAO’s safeguard framework since
2002, when the last safeguard assessment was conducted. The BCEAO now publishes a full set of
audited financial statements, and improvements have been made to move financial reporting
closer to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IMF staff noted that the BCEAO
had improved the explanatory notes to the financial statements and further changes are scheduled,
with a view toward gradual alignment with International Accounting Standards, as adopted
internationally by other central banks. Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place,
mechanisms have been established to improve risk management and risk prevention, and follow-
up on internal and external audit recommendations has been strengthened. The assessment

                                             - 36 -
identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the progress made in recent
years. The main recommendations relate to: (i) improving the external audit process by adopting a
formal rotation policy and further enhancing the transparency of the financial statements by
adopting IFRS in full; and (ii) enhancing the effectiveness of the internal audit function by further
strengthening reporting to management of the BCEAO. The status report of the implementation of
recommendations, received from the Central Bank in March 2007, indicates that some progress
was achieved in corporate governance and strength and transparency of internal financial reports.

86.     Overall, the fiduciary risk of the operation is rated “substantial?. This is based on the
results of the latest IMF Safeguards Assessment of the BCEAO, the country issues and the
demonstrated commitment of the Government to implementing other wide ranging reforms in the
area of PFM.

                         Box 2: Mali’s Public Financial Management Systems
Budget Credibility. Revenue and expenditure out-turns compared to the original budgets of the last three years
(2010-12) testify to the credibility of the budget. However, the 2012 budget has been affected by the political crisis
which led to a significant decrease of revenues as a result of the suspension of donors’ budgetary support and a
reduction of project support. The Government responded with fiscal austerity and managed its budget prudently by
offsetting the loss of revenue by expenditures cuts, especially public investment, implicit subsidies on petroleum
products and cooking gas. As a result, in October, the Government adopted a revised 2012 budget recognizing the
need for fiscal austerity. In doing so, the Government sought to give priority to payment of salaries, pensions,
scholarships, the army and security forces, and, to the extent possible, priority spending on education, health, and
social protection.
Policy-Based Budgeting. Policies and priorities defined through the Poverty Reduction Strategic Framework are
linked to the budget. Preparation of the MTEFs has progressed considerably, including on the linkage of sector
expenditure programs with sector strategies. The three-year programming of public expenditures has been in practice
for several years. The forecasts are prepared for 3 years on a rolling annual basis. After the program reviews, the
MTEF is updated and circulated to the ministries to enable updating of the sector MTEFs. As of end 2012, more than
80% of sectors have MTEFs. The link between multiyear estimates and subsequent setting of annual budget ceiling
are clear and differences explained and evidenced in the Cabinet’s report submitted with the draft budget law.
Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget. The budget is prepared with due regard to government
policy. The budget is presented on the basis defined by WAEMU Guidelines 04-98 and 04-99 that correspond to the
GFS86 standards, hence in accordance with an international standard, but not fully in compliance with GFS/COFOG
2001. However, the monthly budget execution report is fully in line with WAEMU standards. The current budget
classification provides a clear understanding of public action. Budget allocations are detailed into administrative,
economic and functional classification. Moreover, in the explanatory annex containing program budgets, allocations
are presented by program for each ministry. A summary is presented by function and by ministry in the draft budget.
Exhaustive information is provided on externally-financed operations and projected operations are outlined in very
detailed manner by ministry and by program. The budget executions are also reported in the same details
(administrative, economic, and functional).
Predictability and Control in Budget Execution. The financial management systems are effective to ensure that the
budget is implemented in a controlled and predictable way. The assessment of the internal control framework is
overall satisfactory. The quality of the instruments, rules, and procedures is generally adequate. The internal control
rules and procedures incorporate a comprehensive set of controls, but may create some duplication and inefficiency
that needs a better coordination among internal audit institutions and the introduction of professional audit methods
and risk assessment techniques. The procurement system has been modernized in three dimensions namely the legal
and institutional framework and, the control system of bidding documents. The budget execution internal control is
monitored by internal audit units coordinated the CGSP (Contrôle General des Services Publics). In 2012, the
authorities started implementing an internal controls strategy to enhance the performance of internal control systems,
through comprehensive and cost effective set of controls and a better focus on systemic issues and follow up of
internal audit findings.
Accounting, Recording and Reporting. The in-year execution budget reports are issued quarterly within six weeks
from the end of each quarter and reliable data is generated from the integrated system information and the quality of
the reports appears to be satisfactory. These reports are posted on the Ministry of Finance website. A consolidated
government statement is prepared annually and includes, with few exceptions, full information on revenue,
expenditure and financial assets/liabilities. But the draft budget execution review law for 2011 which was supposed to
be submitted to the National Assembly before the adoption of the Budget Law 2013 has not yet been adopted by the
Government.
The public has access to annual budget documentation and in year budget execution reports within one month after
their preparation. In addition, citizen budgets are prepared and made available to the public for 2011 and 2012. The
awards of contracts higher than US$100,000 are also made available to the public.
External Scrutiny and Audit. The Government’s bank accounts are regularly monitored. Verification and
reconciliation of account statements with the Treasury accounts opened at the Central Bank are conducted on a daily
basis. For accounts opened by the Treasury accountant at commercial banks, verifications are conducted monthly in
the month following the period under review. Details of the reconciliation statements are provided for all the
accounts.

                               E.      DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

87.     Disbursement and Accounting. The borrower is the Republic of Mali, represented by the
Ministry of Economy, Finances and Budget. The credit will be released in one tranche of SDR
33.4 million (US$50 million equivalent) upon effectiveness. The proposed operation will follow
IDA’s disbursement procedures for development policy operations. Upon approval of the Credit
and effectiveness of the Financing Agreement, the proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed by
IDA into a dedicated account of the Government for budget support. The proceeds of the Credit
will not be used to finance expenditures excluded under the Financing Agreement. The Borrower
shall ensure that upon the deposit of the Credit into said account, an equivalent amount is credited
in the Borrower’s budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. Based on
previous experience, the execution of such transaction from the Central Bank to the Treasury
(Ministry of Economy, Finances and Budget) Finance) does not require more than four days. The
Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and
credited in local currency to the budget management system. Assuming that the withdrawal
request is in Foreign Exchange, the equivalent amount in FCFA reported in the budgetary system
will be based on the market rate at the date of the transfer. The Borrower will promptly notify the
Bank by fax or email that such transfer has taken place, and that proceeds have been credited in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank.

88.     Auditing. Dedicated deposit accounts could be audited on terms of reference acceptable to
IDA. If, after being deposited in this account, the proceeds of the Credit are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the recipient to either: (a)
apply the corresponding amount to eligible purposes, or (b) refund the amount directly to IDA.

89.       The closing date for the operation is December 31, 2013.

                     F.     IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

90.     The Ministry of Economy, Finances and Budget will be responsible for overall
coordination of supervision and monitoring of the reform program supported by the
proposed operation. The MEFB will liaise with focal points in the Ministries, departments and
agencies involved in the proposed operation. The participating ministries, departments and
agencies will furnish relevant information and documentation on implementation and monitoring
of their respective programs to MEFB, which will oversee progress in achieving program
objectives.

                                G.      RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

91.       The proposed operation comprises significant potential risks, namely:

         Security. The ongoing military conflict in the North could heighten security risks in the
          South, with potential negative implication on the focus and time required from
          Government to implement the reform program supported by the proposed operation.
          Potential political destabilization from groups opposed to the roadmap could also weaken
          the phased return to full constitutional order, with potential negative implication on
          donors’ ability to support the budget and fully resume official aid. The proposed operation
          does not entail measures to mitigate such risks or their impact. Development objectives of
          strengthening executive accountability and preparing for the economic recovery would
          thus be affected.


                                               - 39 -
   Political feasibility of reforms. Ahead of elections, groups might powerfully oppose
    electricity tariff increases, in Bamako notably, with implication on the financial capacity
    of the electricity company to ensure regular supply and/or the stability of the
    Government’s fiscal framework. Development objectives of preparing for the economic
    recovery and protecting the poverty reduction gains would be affected. Nonetheless, tariffs
    were increased in February 2013 without strong opposition. The Government proactively
    took the lead to communicate that tariff increases were pro-poor as intended to give more
    capacity to invest in connections. The proposed operation will support these efforts
    through the dissemination of the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of electricity tariff
    increases

   Commodity prices shocks. An unexpected increase in petroleum prices would affect
    electricity generation capacity (with a generation mix highly dependent on imported oil
    products). The adoption of the tariff adjustment mechanism supported by the proposed
    operation would reduce the development impact of such risk, and is complemented with a
    World Bank initiative to develop solar energy. An unexpected fall in gold prices would
    weaken the overall fiscal framework, with possible implication for Government ability to
    finance basic service delivery. The proposed operation mitigates the development impact
    of such risk through the protection of pro-poor expenditures. An unexpected fall in cotton
    prices would potentially affect farmers’ income, and growth through forward linkages.
    Such a risk is partially covered by the stabilization mechanism of the cotton industry. The
    proposed operation would also mitigate its impact through diversification towards rice
    production with greater access to irrigation. More generally, continued macroeconomic
    monitoring and dialogue with authorities (at the national and regional levels, through
    WAEMU in particular), in coordination with the IMF, will help manage the impact of
    exogenous shocks on budget execution and service delivery.

   Climatic shocks. A negative climatic shock would aggravate food insecurity and raise
    food inflation. The protection of pro-poor expenditures supported by the proposed
    operation reduces the potential impact of such risk, and is complemented by several other
    Government, World Bank and DPs activities to expand social safety nets and strengthen
    food security.

   Fiduciary risks. Risks that public financial resources are not allocated to their intended
    purposes or deliver poor value for money remain substantial, with a potentially significant
    negative development impact through poor public spending effectiveness and efficiency.
    The proposed operation mitigates these risks by supporting a series of measures to
    strengthen controls on budget execution and budget transparency. The fiduciary review of
    the security sector conducted in 2013, at the request of authorities is also expected to
    improve public financial management of security spending as it expands and reforms
    itself.

   Implementation risks. Risks that policy actions supported by the proposed operation are
    not implemented due to poor capacity are moderate. The strong country office presence
    and close dialogue with authorities mitigate such risk, as well as the technical assistance
    provided in the sectors of public financial management, energy, and agriculture by the
    World Bank and other donors.




                                         - 40 -
92.    In IDA’s assessment, the potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the
residual risks and warrant IDA’s assistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions
while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize the sustainability of the reform agenda.

Monsieur le Président,

1.          La mise en œuvre du programme de réformes du Mali en 2012 s’est déroulée dans
un environnement interne difficile. Néanmoins, le Gouvernement a maintenu ses efforts en
matière de sauvegarde de la stabilité macroéconomique et de poursuite des réformes
structurelles.

2.          La présente Lettre de Politique de Développement fait l’état des lieux de la situation
économique récente et les perspectives des deux prochaines années. Elle met en évidence les
objectifs stratégiques du Programme d’Action Prioritaire d’Urgence 2013-2014, couvrant la
Feuille de Route du Gouvernement pour la période de transition. Elle évoque les politiques que
les autorités ont l’intention de mettre en œuvre dans le contexte du Cadre Stratégique pour la
Croissance et la Réduction de la Pauvreté (CSCRP) 2012-2017, tout en intégrant l'émergence de
nouvelles réalités. Pour faciliter le financement et la mise en œuvre de cette stratégie, le
Gouvernement de la République du Mali sollicite le soutien des partenaires au développement.
La Banque Mondiale est ainsi sollicitée pour la mise à disposition d’un crédit d’appui à la
reprise et la reforme.

Contexte Politique, Social et Economique
Faits marquants pour 2012

3.        Les problèmes sécuritaires survenus au Nord et les troubles politiques au sud ont
plongé le Mali en 2012 dans une crise politique et institutionnelle sans précédent. La rupture



                                           - 42 -
avec l’ordre constitutionnel démocratique qui s’en est suivie a engendré la suspension de la
coopération avec les Partenaires Techniques et Financiers.

4.          Au début de l’année 2012, le pays a été confronté à une crise sécuritaire provoquée
par les attaques perpétrées dans le nord du pays par une rébellion revendiquant l’indépendance
de la zone constituée par les trois régions du nord et par les activités d’organisations terroristes
affiliées à Al-Qaeda. Ces attaques ont provoqué une crise humanitaire à travers la fuite
d’environ 420.000 personnes dont environ 210.000 dans les pays voisins (109.000 en
Mauritanie, 65.000 au Niger, et 36.000 au Burkina Faso). L’impact social de cette crise fut
aggravé par la crise alimentaire survenue en 2011/2012.

5.         En Mars 2012, le pays connu une crise politique aboutissant à la démission du
Président de la République, auquel succéda le Président de l’Assemblée nationale, dont le
mandat court jusqu’aux prochaines élections présidentielles. Un premier ministre fut nommé,
qui constitua son gouvernement. L’Assemblée nationale a repris ses travaux. En Aout 2012, le
Président élargit la composition du gouvernement pour former un gouvernement d’union
nationale ayant comme priorités la reconquête du nord du pays et l’organisation d’élections
présidentielle et législative.
6.        Un changement de Premier ministre est intervenu en décembre 2012 et un
gouvernement plus inclusif fut mis en place. Le gouvernement d’union nationale demanda l’aide
des Nations Unies, de l’Union africaine et de la Communauté des états de l’Afrique de l’ouest
pour reconquérir le nord du pays. Puis, une feuille de route fut approuvée par l’Assemblée
Nationale avec comme agenda la reconquête du Nord et l’organisation d’élections
transparentes et crédibles.

7.          En Janvier 2013, le déploiement d’une force d’intervention de plusieurs milliers de
soldats français vint épauler l’armée malienne pour arrêter la progression des groupes rebelles
vers le Sud et ensuite, en compagnie des soldats de la Mission internationale de soutien au Mali
(MISMA) et des soldats de l’armée tchadienne, reprendre une à une toutes les villes du nord du
pays et attaquer leur sanctuaire dans une région montagneuse au nord de la ville de Kidal à
proximité des frontières avec l’Algérie et le Niger. A ce jour, toutes les grandes villes ont été
libérées.
8.       Les nouveaux défis nés de la crise politico-sécuritaire ont rendu nécessaire un
réajustement du cadre stratégique pour la croissance et la réduction de la pauvreté à court
terme. Ce réajustement a permis d’aligner le Programme d’Action Prioritaire d’Urgence sur les
objectifs de la transition politique et la poursuite de la mise en œuvre du CSCRP 2012-2017,
mais aussi d’en faire un référentiel dans le cadre de l’intervention du Gouvernement de
transition et de ses partenaires au cours de la période 2013-2014.
9.       Ainsi, le PAPU permettra de préserver les acquis sociaux tout en facilitant une reprise
cohérente des activités de développement identifiées dans le CSCRP 2012-2017 après la crise.
Plus spécifiquement, il s’agira de (i) appuyer l’organisation de l’aide humanitaire et les secours
aux populations déplacées et celles restées dans les zones sous occupation ; (ii) consolider la
Paix et la Sécurité ; (iii) organiser des élections libres, transparentes et crédibles (iv) favoriser le
retour des PTF et le renforcement du cadre de partenariat avec ceux-ci.

Développements macroéconomiques récents

10.        Les chocs alimentaires, sécuritaires et politiques ont ébranlé l’économie malienne en
2012 l’entrainant ainsi dans une récession. Les plus récentes estimations tablent sur une
contraction du Produit intérieur brut (PIB) réel de 1,2 % en 2012. Mais l’impact négatif de la
situation d’instabilité politique sur l’activité économique a été atténué par la bonne
performance des secteurs agricole et aurifère. La mauvaise campagne agricole en 2011 a
engendré une hausse des prix des produits alimentaires qui a poussé l’inflation à 5,3 % en
moyenne annuelle en 2012, contre une norme communautaire de 3%.

11.        Le déficit des opérations courantes (dons compris) s’est légèrement contracté de
3,3% du PIB à cause de la forte augmentation des exportations d’or et de coton et des transferts
des revenus des travailleurs migrants. Le compte de capital et des opérations financières s’est
détérioré en raison de la forte baisse de l’aide extérieure et des investissements directs
étrangers. Ainsi, le déficit global de la balance des paiements est estimé à 49 milliards de FCFA.

12.          S’agissant de la masse monétaire, elle a crû de 15%, sous la progression de
l’utilisation par l’Etat de ses dépôts pour financer le déficit budgétaire. Les crédits à l’économie
n’ont progressé que de 5% compte tenu de la récession dans les secteurs secondaire et tertiaire.

13.         Au plan budgétaire, en 2012 le gouvernement a opéré très rapidement une
régulation des dépenses pour les maintenir à un niveau compatible avec ses recettes et ses
avoirs de trésorerie. Ce faisant, le gouvernement s’est efforcé de donner la priorité au paiement
des salaires, des pensions, des bourses des étudiants, et des dépenses de l’armée et des forces
de sécurité, et, dans la mesure du possible, des dépenses prioritaires pro-pauvres dans les
secteurs de l’éducation, la santé, et la protection sociale. En contrepartie, le secteur de
l’investissement public fut durement affecté, avec une baisse de 60 % en termes réels. Ainsi, le
déficit budgétaire (base caisse, dons inclus) ressort à un peu moins de 70 milliards de FCFA (1,3%
du PIB). Ce résultat a été obtenu grâce aux efforts de recouvrement exceptionnel des services
de recettes, à une augmentation de la fiscalité sur les produits pétroliers et à la réduction des
subventions à la consommation de gaz butane, et au prix de coupes dans les dépenses
d’investissement.

14.         L’un des axes majeurs de la stratégie gouvernementale en matière de réformes
économiques et financières, reste la viabilité des opérations financières de l’Etat. La politique de
l’État en la matière, vise l’assainissement des finances publiques par la maîtrise de l’ensemble
des dépenses courantes et l’élargissement de la base de l’assiette fiscale.

15.       Le Gouvernement a en outre poursuivi la mise en œuvre d’un plan d’action à moyen
terme pour renforcer et moderniser la gestion des finances publiques dans le cadre de la mise
en œuvre du Plan d’Action Gouvernemental pour l’Amélioration et la Modernisation de la
Gestion des Finances Publiques (PAGAM-GFP).

16.        En ce qui concerne la passation des marchés publics, le Gouvernement s’est doté au
cours des dernières années d’un cadre législatif solide, afin d’asseoir plus de transparence, de
concurrence, d’équité, d’économie et d’efficacité. Ce cadre inclut (i) le décret portant
procédures de passation, d’exécution et de règlement des marchés publics et des délégations de
service public, ii) les textes de loi relatifs à l’Autorité de régulation des marchés publics et des
délégations de service public, et iii) les textes de loi relatifs à la création, à l’organisation, aux


                                             - 44 -
modalités de fonctionnement et au cadre organique de la Direction Générale des Marchés
Publics (prévoyant la création des directions régionales). L’adoption de ces textes consacre la
création d’un organe de régulation incluant un mécanisme de recours indépendant, mettant
ainsi le cadre réglementaire en conformité avec les directives de l’UEMOA, d’une part et d’autre
part, renforcent les autorités contractantes.

17.        La rationalisation des dépenses publiques sera au centre du renforcement de la
gestion des finances publiques et se portera sur l’élargissement des Cadres de dépenses à
moyen terme (CDMT) aux secteurs prioritaires. L’objectif visé restera l’atteinte d’une plus
grande efficacité dans la fourniture de services publics de base pour le bien-être de la
population. Enfin, l’amélioration de la bonne gouvernance nous permettra de sécuriser le
système de gestion des finances publiques tout en modernisant l’administration publique et en
améliorant l’environnement des affaires.


Perspectives en 2013-2014
Au plan macroéconomique

18.         Après une contraction de l’activité économique de 1,2% en 2012, la croissance
devrait être de retour en 2013 et 2014. Globalement, le PIB réel devrait s’accroître de 4,8% en
2013 en raison d’un retour à la normale dans le sud du pays et de la reprise progressive des
projets financés par les PTF. L’inflation pourrait baisser en dessous de 3% en 2013, suite à la
bonne campagne agricole 2012-2013.

19.        Le déficit du compte courant de la balance des paiements (dons compris) devrait
augmenter pour atteindre 7,1% du PIB en 2013 à la suite de l’effet de la stagnation des
d’exportations en raison du léger recul de la production et des prix de l’or, de la baisse des cours
du coton et de la reprise des importations compte tenu du regain de l’activité économique. Le
solde global de la balance de paiement resterait déficitaire à hauteur de 36 milliards de FCFA.

20.       Au niveau de la situation monétaire, la masse monétaire devrait croître en 2013 de
7,4%, sous l’impulsion du regain de l’activité économique. Les crédits à l’économie
progresseraient de 6,2% en raison de la reprise dans les secteurs secondaire et tertiaire.

21.           Dans le domaine budgétaire, le gouvernement continuera à mener une politique
prudente. Pour ce faire, une loi de finances rectificatives 2013 est en préparation pour refléter
du côté des ressources notamment la reprise des aides projets/programmes et budgétaires par
les Partenaires Techniques et Financier. Du côté des dépenses budgétaires, il s’agit de la prise en
charge des nouveaux besoins qui porteront notamment sur (i) la mise en œuvre de la feuille de
route , (ii) le paiement des arriérés intérieurs pour soutenir le secteur privé , (iii) la reprise des
dépenses d'équipement et d’investissement pour la reconstruction et la réhabilitation, le
financement de la contrepartie nationale des projets d’investissements, et le paiements des
arriérés du service de la dette et des projets à la suite du gel et à la réduction des crédits
budgétaires,(ii) les subventions supplémentaires pour l’Energie du Mali (EDM) afin d’améliorer
sa position financière, les dépenses courantes supplémentaires en faveur des secteurs de
l’éducation, de la santé et de l’hydraulique afin d’améliorer l’accessibilité, et rétablir les services
sociaux de base.




                                              - 45 -
22.           Le projet de loi finances rectificatives table sur des recettes et dons de 21,3% du PIB
(18,2% du PIB dans la loi initiale), des recettes fiscales nettes de 15,1% du PIB (15,5% du PIB
dans la loi initiale), des dépenses totales et prêts nets de 23,8% du PIB (18,4% du PIB dans la loi
initiale), un déficit global (base caisse, dons inclus) de 2,9% du PIB (0,3% du PIB dans la loi
initiale), et un déficit du solde de base de 0,4% du PIB (surplus de 0% du PIB dans la loi initiale).
Le besoin de financement est de l’ordre de 30 milliards de FCFA. En l’absence de perspectives
claires d’aide extérieure au-delà de 2013 à ce stade, les besoins de financement pour 2014 et
2015 sont respectivement de 120 milliards de FCFA et 172 milliards de FCFA. Le Gouvernement
espère pouvoir couvrir ces besoins de financement au travers d’engagements des Bailleurs lors
de la Conférence internationale de haut niveau de soutien au développement du Mali prévue au
mois de mai 2013 à Bruxelles.


Programme de Réformes
Sauvegarder les acquis au niveau des secteurs sociaux

23.         La nécessité de rétablir les services sociaux de base, notamment dans les secteurs de
la santé, de l’éducation, de la protection sociale, de l’eau, de l’assainissement et de
l’administration économique et financière est pressante pour la reprise des activités
indispensables à l’amélioration des conditions de vie de la population malienne. Dans ce
contexte, le Gouvernement s’est engagé à augmenter dans la Loi de Finances 2013 la part des
dépenses prioritaires pro-pauvres dans les dépenses totales, en comparaison avec la Loi de
Finances 2012. La protection des dépenses sociales et de développement humain en 2013
favorisera le retour à la normale du fonctionnement des services sociaux de base, ainsi que le
maintien des acquis obtenus au cours des récentes années en matière de développement
humain et de réduction de la pauvreté. En outre, des provisions budgétaires seront constituées
pour assurer la réhabilitation et l’équipement des centres de santé de base et les écoles ainsi
que la réhabilitation des locaux abritant les services de l’administration financière publique
(impôt, marchés publics, budget et contrôle financier). Aussi, le redéploiement des agents des
directions financières ainsi que les agents des services sociaux de bases dans les régions libérées
sera effectué pour faciliter le retour de l’administration dans le nord.

24.         Afin d’améliorer l’efficacité de la protection sociale, le Gouvernement développe
actuellement, avec l’appui de la Banque Mondiale, le projet d’urgence de filets sociaux au Mali,
dénommé Jigisemejiri. qui est à une phase avancée dans sa préparation. Ce projet, en phase
avancée de préparation, devrait contribuer à réduire la pauvreté, soutenir les ménages les plus
pauvres et créer une incitation pour les familles extrêmement pauvres à investir dans
l'éducation et la santé des enfants, la santé des femmes enceintes, et prévenir la malnutrition
chronique.
Renforcer la gestion des finances publiques

25.         Le Gouvernement continuera à améliorer la gestion des finances publiques, en
particulier en remédiant aux faiblesses mises en lumière par l’évaluation PEFA en 2011 à travers
la poursuite de la mise en œuvre du Plan d’Action Gouvernemental pour l’Amélioration et la
Modernisation de la Gestion des Finances Publiques (PAGAM-GFP).Les réformes de la gestion
des dépenses publiques ont logiquement été marquées en raison de la crise de 2012. Environ la
moitié des actions prévues pour 2012 a pu être mise en œuvre, à l’exception notable de quatre



                                             - 46 -
domaines qui ont connus des avancées : le cadrage et le suivi de l’exécution du budget, le suivi-
encore perfectible - des arriérés de paiement, la gestion de la trésorerie, et la stratégie du
contrôle interne. A ce titre, le Gouvernement s’est engagé à adopter une approche du contrôle
interne basée sur le risque, pour les Ministères de l’Education et de la Santé. Cette approche
devrait être étendue aux autres Ministères par la suite. En outre, le Gouvernement s’est engagé
à soumettre à l’Assemblée Nationale la loi de règlement 2010 avec le certificat de conformité
délivré par la section des comptes, et la loi de règlement 2011, ceci afin de renforcer la
transparence dans l’exécution budgétaire et son contrôle externe.

26.         Les actions prévues dans le cadre du Plan d’Action Gouvernemental pour
l’Amélioration et la Modernisation de la Gestion des Finances Publiques (PAGAM-GFP) pour
2013 visent à aller au-delà et porter sur les questions auxquelles le système GFP fait face. Les
mesures à prendre ou à renforcer à cette phase du processus de réforme incluent celles visant à
adopter le projet de loi portant lois de finances qui définit les règles et procédures relatives à la
préparation, l'élaboration, l'adoption, l'exécution et le contrôle du budget conformément à la
Directive de l'UEMOA en vue de transposer la directive dans la législation nationale ; Ainsi, le
Gouvernement s’est engagé à adopter le code de transparence dans la gestion des finances
publiques et à le soumettre à l’Assemblée Nationale. Afin de renforcer la gestion de la
comptabilité de l’Etat, le Gouvernement s’est également engagé à déployer l’application
intégrée de la comptabilité de l’Etat (AICE) au niveau des administrations financières (douanes
et impôts), incluant l’opérationnalisation des interfaces avec les applications de recettes
(SIGTAS et AYSCUDA) afin de couvrir l’ensemble des transactions effectuées au niveau central
(paierie générale et Recettes Générales du District). Enfin, le Gouvernement s’est engagé à
établir le cadre de concertation unique pour la sélection des projets publics pour rendre
efficace le choix des projets et programmes et améliorer la gouvernance de ceux-ci. Un nouveau
PEFA est prévu pour 2013 ainsi que l’évaluation à mi-parcours du PAGAM/GFP.

27.          La rationalisation des dépenses publiques sera au centre du renforcement de la
gestion des finances publiques. L’objectif visé restera l’atteinte d’une plus grande efficacité dans
la fourniture de services publics de base pour le bien-être de la population. Enfin, l’amélioration
de la bonne gouvernance nous permettra de sécuriser le système de gestion des finances
publiques tout en modernisant l’administration publique et en améliorant l’environnement des
affaires. Prises ensemble, ces réformes vont nous permettre de poursuivre de façon durable les
efforts entrepris pour réduire la pauvreté, tels qu’explicités dans le Programme d’Action
Prioritaire d’Urgence 2013-14.

Améliorer l’environnement des politiques pour les infrastructures et l’investissement privé

28.         Le Gouvernement continue d’inscrire parmi ses actions prioritaires, le renforcement
des infrastructures et l’amélioration du climat des affaires. Le Gouvernement s’attèle aussi à la
levée des contraintes dans le secteur agricole et le secteur de l’énergie.

29.         Le programme de réformes du Gouvernement inclut des actions pour améliorer la
contribution du secteur agricole à la croissance pro-pauvre. A cet effet, les efforts seront
orientés vers davantage de productivité et de diversification. Le Gouvernement prévoit de
consolider les résultats significatifs obtenus pour les cultures céréalières, notamment le riz.




                                             - 47 -
30.         Il y a peu de chances de parvenir à faire reculer la pauvreté au Mali sans promouvoir
une productivité et une diversification agricoles soutenues. La performance de l’agriculture
détermine l’évolution de la production et de l’inflation, et constitue la principale activité
économique pour la plupart des maliens. Cependant, la productivité dans le secteur demeure
faible et, hormis le riz et quelques cultures horticoles, la croissance s’explique essentiellement
par l’extension des superficies emblavées. En outre, l’agriculture est très vulnérable à la
pluviométrie, aux invasions acridiennes, aux maladies et à la volatilité des prix sur le marché
mondial, celui du coton en particulier.

31.        Le Gouvernement entend poursuivre la réforme du secteur coton, et a adopté depuis
janvier 2005 un mécanisme de prix qui lie le prix au producteur aux cours du marché
international. Les producteurs de coton ont été investis des responsabilités dans la gestion du
secteur. Toutefois le processus de privatisation a été suspendu.

32.          Le Gouvernement entend accroître la productivité agricole et réduire la vulnérabilité
aux chocs climatiques en mettant à profit son potentiel d’irrigation. Des avancées ont été
enregistrées suite aux réformes institutionnelles et aux investissements consentis dans les terres
irrigables, en particulier pour l’accroissement de la production rizicole. En dépit d’un long retard,
la mise en œuvre du contrat-plan pour l’Office du Niger (ON) 2008-2012 a été satisfaisante et un
contrat plan intérimaire est en cours de finalisation. Les efforts se poursuivent pour renforcer la
gouvernance dans ce secteur crucial. Les objectifs comprennent la création d’un cadre pour le
développement d’une vision commune du développement de l’irrigation au Mali et un
mécanisme pour la participation constructive des parties prenantes dans la planification et la
surveillance des activités de l’irrigation dans l’ON. Ainsi, le Gouvernement s’est engagé à mettre
en place un nouveau mécanisme de Financement de l'Irrigation en zone Office du Niger, après
consultations avec les parties concernées, PTF inclus.

33.         Face au besoin récurrent et croissant des transferts budgétaires à l’Energie du Mali
(EDM) en raison du déséquilibre structurel entre les prix de vente de l’électricité et les coûts de
production 43, le Gouvernement s’est engagé à adopter et appliquer le mécanisme
d’ajustement tarifaire de l’électricité. Ainsi, le gouvernement a procédé à une augmentation
moyenne des tarifs de l’électricité de 7% qui est entrée en vigueur au 1er février 2013. Le
Gouvernement envisage d’examiner de nouvelles propositions sur les prix de vente de l’énergie
préparées par le régulateur du secteur en vue de rétablir une marge positive entre le prix de
vente et le prix de revient moyen de l’électricité. A cet effet, le Gouvernement compte sur
l’assistance des services de la Banque mondiale, en matière de transferts ciblés sur les couches
les plus vulnérables de la population qui pourraient être intensifiés en cas de hausse des prix des
produits énergétiques ou alimentaires.

34.         Dans le secteur privé, afin d’atteindre une performance plus élevée des exportations
et de promouvoir l’environnement des affaires, les procédures d’exportation ont été simplifiées.
En outre, des normes et réglementations pour les exportations, particulièrement en ce qui
concerne les exportations de produits agricoles ont été établies. Dans le domaine du climat
d’investissement, le Gouvernement a, au cours des dernières années, fait des reformes dans les

  En 2012, le prix de vente moyen de l’électricité était de 91 FCFA/kWh et le prix de revient de 127 FCFA/kWh. En
                                                                                          er
2013, le prix de vente moyen de l’électricité est de 96 FCFA/kWh après l’ajustement du 1 mars 2013 et le prix de
revient attendu de 119 FCFA/kWh.

industriel et commercial de 35% à 30% a été retenu dans la loi de finances 2012 en conformité
avec les directives de l’UEMOA. En plus de cela, un nouveau code des investissements a été
adopté en 2012.


Suivi et Evaluation

35.          Le Ministère de l’Economie des Finances et du Budget sera responsable, pour la
coordination d’ensemble, de la supervision et du suivi du programme de réformes à mener dans
le cadre du CSCRP. A ce titre, il sera en liaison avec les points focaux dans les Ministères, les
Directions et Agences impliquées dans le programme. Les Ministères, Directions et Agences
participants fourniront les informations et la documentation pertinentes sur la mise en œuvre et
le suivi de leurs programmes respectifs au MEFB, qui supervisera les progrès dans la réalisation
des objectifs du programme. Les principales sources le recensement de la population qui a eu
lieu en avril 2009, les enquêtes ménages réalisées par l’Institut National de la Statistique, les
statistiques de l’administration collectées annuellement par les Cellules de planification et de
statistiques des Ministères sectoriels, les statistiques économiques produites par l’Institut
National de la Statistique et les données budgétaires en provenance du MEFB contribueront au
suivi-évaluation des reformes en cours, dont celles soutenues par crédit d’appui à la reprise et la
réforme.

Mr. President,

1.         The Mali reform program was carried out in a difficult internal environment in
2012. Still, the Government continued its efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability and
pursue structural reforms.

2.         This Development Policy Letter reports on the recent economic situation and
the outlook for the next two years. It highlights strategic objectives of the Emergency
Priority Action Program 2013-2014, which includes the Government’s Road Map for the
transition period. It presents policies that the authorities intend to apply in the context of
the Strategic Framework for Growth and Poverty Reduction (GPRS) 2012-2017, taking
into account the emergence of new realities. To facilitate the financing and the
implementation of this strategy, the Government of the Republic of Mali requests the
support of development partners. The World Bank is, therefore, requested to make
available a credit for recovery and reform support.

Political, Social and Economic Context
Key Events in 2012

3.        Problems with security in the North and political troubles in the South plunged
Mali into an unprecedented political and institutional crisis in 2012. The subsequent
breakdown of democratic constitutional order led to the suspension of cooperation with
the country’s Technical and Financial Partners.

4.         At the beginning of 2012, the country faced a security crisis provoked by
attacks carried out in the north of the country by rebels demanding independence for the
three regions in the north and by terrorist organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda. These
attacks provoked a humanitarian crisis and the flight of about 420,000 people, with about
210,000 to neighboring countries (109,000 to Mauritania, 65,000 to Niger and 36,000 to
Burkina Faso). The social impact of this crisis was aggravated by a food crisis in
2011/2012.


                                          - 50 -
5.         In March 2012, the country underwent a political crisis that culminated in the
resignation of the President of the Republic. He was succeeded by the President of the
National Assembly with a mandate that runs until the next presidential elections. A Prime
Minister was named and his Government formed. The National Assembly went back to
work. In August 2012, the President enlarged the composition of the Government to form
a government of national union tasked with the priority tasks of reconquering the North
and organizing presidential and legislative elections.

6.         The Prime Minister changed again in December 2012 and a more inclusive
government put in place. The Government of national union asked for help from the
United Nations, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States
in order to recover the north of the country. Then, the National Assembly approved a
road map for the purpose of recovering the North and organizing clear and credible
elections.

7.         In January 2013, an intervention force of several thousand French soldiers
came to support Mali’s army in order to stop the progress of rebel groups toward the
South. Subsequently, together with soldiers from the African-Led International Support
Mission to Mali and soldiers from the Chad army, they took back towns in the North, one
by one, and attacked rebel sanctuaries in in a mountainous region north of the city of
Kidal near the border with Algeria and Niger. So far, all the big towns have been
liberated.

8.         New challenges as a result of the political-security crisis have required short-
term readjustment of the strategic framework for growth and poverty reduction. This
readjustment has made it possible to align the Emergency Priority Action Program
(PAPU) with the objectives of the political transition, as well as to continue
implementation of GPRS 2012-2017 after the crisis. The readjustment also serves as
point of reference for intervention by the transition Government and its partners over the
2013-2014 period.

9.          In this way, PAPU will make it possible to preserve social gains while
facilitating a post-crisis recovery consistent with development activities identified in the
GPRS 2012-2017. More specifically, it will (i) support the organization of humanitarian
aid and rescue of displaced people, along with those remaining in occupied zones; (ii)
consolidating Peace and Security; (iii) organizing, free, transparent and credible
elections; (iv) favoring the return of DPs within a stronger partnership framework.

Recent macroeconomic developments

10.        Food, security and political shocks rattled the Mali economy in 2012, forcing it
into recession. Most recent estimates predict a Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
contraction of 1.2% in 2012. But the negative impact of political instability on economic
activity has been attenuated by the good performance of agriculture and gold mining. Bad
agricultural performance in 2011 led to higher food prices that pushed inflation to an
annual average of 5.3% in 2012, compared with a Community norm of 3%.




                                         - 51 -
11.         The current account deficit (including grants) shrank slightly, by 3.3% of GDP,
because of strong increases in the export of gold and of cotton, as well as in foreign
remittances. Capital account and financial operations deteriorated as a result of strong
decreases in foreign aid and in foreign direct investment. The overall balance of payment
deficits, consequently, is estimated at FCFA 49 billion.

12.        Money mass grew by 15% as the State progressively used its reserves to
finance the budget deficit. Loans to the economy only grew 5% in view of the recession
in the secondary and tertiary sectors.

13.        In terms of the budget, the Government, in 2012, the Government moved
quickly to control spending in order to keep it at a level compatible with revenues and
reserves. To do so, the Government gave priority to salaries, pensions, student
scholarship and expenditures for the Army and security forces, followed, as much as
possible, by making pro-poor spending a priority as well: education, health and social
security. As a result, the public investment sector suffered greatly, with a drop of 60% in
real terms. On a cash basis (including grants), the budget deficit turned out to be slightly
less than FCFA 70 billion (1.3% of GDP). This result was obtained thanks to exceptional
tax collection efforts by the revenue services, higher taxes on petroleum products, lower
subsidies for the consumption of butane gas and at the price of cuts in spending for
investment.

14.       The sustainability of public finances remains one of the major pillars of
government economic and financial reform strategy. Policy aims to consolidate public
finances by controlling overall current expenditures and growing the tax base.

15.       The Government, furthermore, has continued to carry out a medium- term
action plan to reinforce and modernize the administration of public finances in the
context of implementing the Governmental Action Plan for the Improvement and
Modernization of the Administration of Public Finances (PAGAM-GFP).

16.         With regard to public procurement processes, the Government has established,
over the last few years, a solid legal framework for more transparency, competition,
equity, savings and efficacy. This framework includes (i) a         decree    that   covers
procurement procedure, execution and payment, as well as out-sourced public services;
ii) legal texts relative to the Regulatory Authority for Procurement and outsourced public
services, and iii) legal texts relative to the creation, organization, functional modalities
and organic framework of the Procurement Office (with provision for the creation of
regional Offices). Adoption of these texts formalizes the creation of a regulatory body
that includes a mechanism for independent recourse, that brings Mali’s regulatory
framework in line with West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA)
directives and that reinforces the contracting authorities.

17.       Rationalization of public spending will be at the center of reinforced
administration of public finances and will apply to the extension of the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to the priority sectors. The stated objective remains
more efficient provision of basic public services for the well-being of the population.


                                         - 52 -
Finally, improved good governance will allow us to assure the administration of public
finances while we modernize overall public administration and improve the business
climate.

2013-2014 Outlook
At macro-economic level

18.        After a 1.2% contraction of economic activity in 2012, growth should return in
2013 and 2014. Overall, real GDP should increase by 4.8% in 2013 because of a return to
normal in the south of the country and progressive resumption of TFP-financed projects.
Inflation could descend below 3% in 2013, thanks to a good crop year 2012-2013.

19.       The current account deficit on the balance of payments (including grants) is
expected to rise to 7.1% of GDP in 2013 because of the effects of export stagnation due
to a slight decline in the production and price of gold, lower cotton prices and the
recovery of imports needed by a reviving economy. The overall balance of payments will
remain in deficit (FCFA 36 billion).

20.       In terms of the monetary situation, money mass should grow 7.4% in 2013,
stimulated by economic recovery. Lending to the economy should grow by 6.2% because
of recovery in the secondary and tertiary sector.

21.        In terms of the Budget, the Government will continue to pursue a prudent
policy. A revised budget law for 2013 is being formulated to reflect renewed resources,
particularly recovery of TFP aid to the budget and to projects/programs. On the
expenditure side, there are new needs to cover, notably (i) implementation of the road
map, (ii) payment of domestic arrears to sustain the private sector, (iii) resumption of
expenditures for equipment and investment for reconstruction and rehabilitation,
financing for the national share of investment projects and debt service and project
payments delayed because of reduced credits and a budget freeze, (iv) supplementary
subsidies for the energy utility Energie du Mali (EDM), in order to improve its financial
position and provide financing for higher operating expenses incurred in order to re-
establish basic social services and improve accessibility to education, health and
hydroelectric power.

22.        The revised budget law for 2013 foresees revenues and grants at 21.3% of
GDP (compared with 18.2% of GDP in the initial law), net tax revenue at 15.1% of GDP
(15.5% of GDP in the initial law), net total expenditures and loans at 23.8% of GDP
((18.4% of GDP in the initial law) and a deficit in the basic balance of 0.4% of GDP (0%
surplus in the initial law). The need for financing is on the order of FCFA 30 billion. In
the absence of clear forecasts for foreign aid beyond 2013 at this time, financing needs
for 2014 and 2015 are, respectively, FCFA 120 billion and FCFA 172 billion. The
Government hopes to be able to cover its financing needs through commitments from
lenders attending the International Conference of High Level Support to Development in
Mali, planned for mid-May 2013 in Brussels.

Reform Program
Preserve social sector gains

23.         There is a pressing need to re-establish basic social services, especially in the
sectors of health, education, social security, water, sanitation and administrative and
financial administration, in order to restore activities indispensable to better living
conditions for the population of Mali. In this context, the Government is committed to
increasing the share of priority pro-poor expenditures to total expenditure through
the 2013 Budget Law in comparison with the 2012 Budget Law. Protection of social
and human resources development expenditure will favor a return to normal functioning
of basic social services, as well as the preservation of gains obtained over recent years in
terms of human development and poverty reduction. Moreover, budgetary provision will
be made to assure the rehabilitation and equipment of premises for the administration of
public finances (taxes, procurement, budget and audit). Also, the redeployment of
financial officials, as well as basic social services officials, to the liberated regions should
facilitate the return of the Administration to the North.

24.       In order to improve the efficacy of social security, the Government is currently
developing, with the support of the World Bank, the emergency Social Safety net project
for Mali, called Jigisemejiri, which is in the final stages of preparation. This project
should help to reduce poverty, sustain the poorest households and create an incentive for
the poorest families to invest in the education and health of children and pregnant women
and the prevention of chronic malnutrition.
Strengthen public financial management

25.         The Government will continue to improve the administration of public
finances, particularly by remedying the weaknesses revealed by the 2011 PEFA
evaluation, through continued implementation of the Governmental Action Plan for the
Improvement and Modernization of the Administration of Public Finances (PAGAM-
GFP). The 2012 crisis logically affected reform of the administration of public finances.
Only about half of planned actions could be carried out, with the notable exception of
four areas where there was progress: budget framework and execution; follow-up, which
still could be perfected, of delayed payments; cash-flow management and internal control
strategy. In this regard, the Government is committed to adopt a risk-based approach
for internal controls in the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. This
approach should be extended to other Ministries subsequently. Furthermore, the
Government is committed to adopt and transmit to the National Assembly the
budget execution reports for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and the legal opinion on the
budget execution report for fiscal year 2010, for more transparency in the execution of
the Budget and its external control.

26.        For 2013, the Governmental Action Plan for the Improvement and
Modernization of the Administration of Public Finances (PAGAM-GFP) aims to go
farther and address issues that concern the public finance administration system itself.
Measures to take or to reinforce during this phase of the reform process include those that
call for adoption of the draft law that contains provisions that would bring regulations and


                                           - 54 -
procedures relative to the preparation, formulation, adoption, execution and control of the
budget in line with the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA)
Directive, prior to transposing the Directive into national legislation. Accordingly, the
Government is committed to adopting the Budget Transparency Code and
submitting it to the National Assembly. To reinforce the State’s accounting system, the
Government is also committed to install the AICE software and its interface with
management applications for tax revenues (SIGTAS) and customs data
(ASYCUDA), covering all transactions at the central government level, for purposes
of integrating the management of tax and customs revenues in the accounting
information system. Finally, the Government is committed to establishing a selection
committee for public investment projects to make the choice of projects and programs
more efficient and to improve their governance. A new PEFA is planned for 2013, along
with a mid-way evaluation of the PAGAM-GFP.

27.       Rationalization of public spending will be the centerpiece of the reform of
public finances administration. The stated objective will continue to be more efficient
supply of basic public services for the wellbeing of the population. Finally, improvement
of good governance will allow us to assure the administration of public finances while we
modernize public administration and improve the business climate. Taken together, these
reforms will allow us to continue, in a sustainable manner, efforts to reduce poverty, as
spelled out in the 2013-2014 Emergency Priority Action Plan.
Improve the policy environment for private infrastructure and investment

28.         The Government continues to prioritize the reinforcement of infrastructure and
improvement in the business climate. The Government also intends to tackle constraints
that affect the agricultural and energy sectors.

29.        The Government’s reform program includes action to improve the contribution
of the agricultural sector to pro-poor growth. To this end, efforts will be directed more
toward productivity and diversification. The Government plans to consolidate substantial
results obtained for grain cultivation, especially rice.

30.       Chances for poverty reduction are slim in Mali without support for the
productivity and diversification of agriculture. Performance of the agricultural sector
determines the evolution of production and inflation and is the main activity for a
majority of people in Mali. Nevertheless, productivity in the sector remains low, and,
apart from the cultivation of rice and some vegetables, growth comes essentially from the
extension of cultivated land. Agriculture in Mali also is very dependent on rainfall and is
vulnerable to locust invasions, maladies that affect crops and the volatility of prices on
the world market, particularly for cotton.

31.       The Government intends to pursue reform in the cotton sector and, since
January 2005, has adopted a price mechanism that ties the producer’s price to prices on
the international market. Cotton producers have been given responsibilities for the
management of their own sector. And, the privatization process has been suspended.




                                        - 55 -
32.        The Government intends to increase agricultural productivity and reduce the
sector’s vulnerability to the vagaries of the weather by developing the irrigation potential
of the land. Progress has been registered subsequent to institutional reforms and
investment credits have been granted for irrigable land, particularly to increase rice
production. Despite long delays, the implementation of the contract-plan for the Office du
Niger 2008-2012 has turned out well and an interim contract-plan is being finalized.
Efforts continue to reinforce governance in this crucial sector. Objectives include the
creation of a framework for the development of a common vision for the spread of
irrigation in Mali and a mechanism for the constructive participation of the parties
concerned in the planning and surveillance of irrigation activities in the Office du Niger.
The Government is committed to adopt a new financial mechanism for irrigation for
the Office du Niger area, after consultation with the parties concerned, including DPs.

33.        Faced with the recurrent and growing need for budget transfers to Energie du
Mali (EDM) because of the structural imbalance between the sale price for electricity and
the cost of production44, the Government is committed to adopting and
implementing the automatic electricity tariff adjustment mechanism. So, the
Government proceeded to increase electricity rates by 7% on average, as of February 1,
2013. The Government plans to examine new sales price proposals by the sector’s
regulator, with a view to re-establishing a positive margin between the sale price and the
average cost price for electricity. To this end, the Government is counting on World Bank
services for assistance, in terms of targeted transfers to the most vulnerable segments of
the population that could be increased in the event of a rise in the cost of energy and/or
food products.

34.         In the private sector, in order to boost exports and promote a new business
climate, export procedures have been simplified. And, norms and regulations for export,
particularly for agricultural exports, have been established. In this area of the investment
climate, the Government has, over the last few years, implemented reform in the areas of:
(i) creation of a one-stop window, (ii) a property registry with the adoption of a new Tax
Code that contains a provision that reduces property transfer tax from 15% to 7%. Also, a
lower tax rate on industrial and commercial profits, down from 35% to 30%, has been
retained in the 2012 Finance Law in line with UEMOA directives. Plus, a new
Investment Code was adopted in 2012.
Monitoring and Evaluation

35.         The Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Budget (MEFB) will be
responsible for overall coordination, supervision and monitoring of the reform program
as it is implemented within the CSCRP framework. In the process, it will liaise with focal
points in the Ministries, Offices and Agencies involved in the program. Participating
Ministries, Offices and Agencies will provide pertinent information and documentation
on the implementation and monitoring of their respective programs to the MEFB, which
will supervise progress toward the attainment of program objectives. Principal sources:

  In 2012, the average price of electricity was FCFA 91/kWh. In 2013, the average price for electricity is
FCFA 96/kWh, after the March 1, 2013 adjustment and an expected cost price of FCFA119/kWh.

        IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Mali
                      Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 13/15
                                   February 8, 2013

On January 28, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mali. 45 The Board also approved a
disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) during the same meeting (See Press
Release No. 13/24 below).

Background
Mali’s economy is struggling under a series of shocks. The poor harvest in 2011, loss of
government control over the north part of the country following attacks by rebel groups;
and the military coup in March 2012 have all taken a heavy toll. Donors have suspended
budgetary support, while awaiting a clear road map toward free elections. It is estimated
that GDP declined by 1.5 percent in 2012, while average annual inflation reached 5.3
percent by December 2012 on the back of food price increases. A large balance-of-
payments deficit emerged, reflecting higher food imports and the reduction in donor
support.
The fiscal position came under pressure in 2012. The Government tightened spending to
partly offset the revenue losses. Cuts were made in public investment and in implicit
subsidies on petroleum products and cooking gas. As a result, the basic budget deficit
(revenue and budget grants minus domestically financed spending) was contained at 1
percent of GDP. Despite these efforts, and heavy reliance on net domestic bank financing,
Mali ran up arrears on external debt service in the amount of 0.5 percent of GDP.
The financial soundness of the banking sector has weakened in the worsening economic
environment. Overall, banks remain well capitalized, but the situation is uneven, and
nonperforming loans are on the rise. In the north, banks sustained financial and property
damage estimated at 0.3 percent of GDP.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ continued commitment to prudent policies
despite severe economic and political shocks. Taking note of the challenging internal and
external environment for the period ahead, Directors agreed that a new Fund-supported
program under the Rapid Credit Facility will help Mali safeguard macroeconomic stability

 45
    Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
 usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
 discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
 staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of
 the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
 Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
 used in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

and re-engage with donors. Directors also agreed that, over the medium-term, polices
should focus on strengthening the prospects for higher growth and further poverty
reduction.
Directors considered that a tight fiscal stance is necessary in the near term. They noted
that, while the 2013 budget is consistent with this objective, prudence suggests freezing
part of the budgeted capital spending until donor support resumes. More broadly, Directors
encouraged the authorities to prioritize expenditures and keep them in line with available
resources, while protecting social spending. They also endorsed the plan to increase
revenues through tax reforms in a variety of areas and the envisaged adjustment in oil and
electricity prices. In this regard, Directors stressed that careful communication and targeted
measures to protect the poor will be essential to gain public support.
While acknowledging the difficult financing constraints facing Mali, Directors regretted
the accumulation of external arrears and encouraged the authorities to clear them as soon
as possible. Welcoming Mali’s intention to meet all current debt service obligations,
Directors agreed that strengthening public financial management, especially expenditure
management, and implementing West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
directives will support arrear resolution and prevent their recurrence.
Directors underscored that, as the political situation stabilizes, economic policies should
focus on fostering strong sustainable growth and further reducing poverty. Priority should
be given to strengthening the financial sector, addressing the underlying weaknesses
arising from non performing loans and loan concentration in the banks’ portfolios.
Improving the business climate and removing structural and institutional bottlenecks will
play an important role in boosting competitiveness and diversifying the economy. More
investment in roads, irrigation, and education is needed to fully develop Mali’s agricultural
potential. A few Directors also pointed to the possible benefits from a reduction in
production subsidies in some cotton-producing countries.

  IMF Executive Board Approves US$18.4 Million Disbursement Under the Rapid
                           Credit Facility for Mali
                           Press Release No. 13/24
                               January 28, 2013

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a
disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 12 million (about US$18.4 million) for
Mali under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) to support the authorities with policy advice
and financial support to maintain macroeconomic stability and growth during the next
twelve months, as part of a broad-based support by Mali's development partners. The
RCF provides rapid concessional financial assistance with limited conditionality to low-
income countries facing an urgent balance of payments need.
The Executive Board also noted the authorities’ cancellation of the previous arrangement
under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), which was approved in 2011 for the
equivalent of SDR 30 million (then about US$46.3 million; see Press Release No.
11/487), which had been designed to cover 2012-14, but was derailed by the March 2012
coup d’état and its aftermath.
In November 2012, an IMF mission reached understandings ad referendum on the
components of an economic program that could be supported by the Rapid Credit
Facility (See Press Release No.12/437). The RCF will also pave the way for renewed
donor support following the events of early 2012.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Mali’s economy is traversing a particularly difficult period as a result of the 2011
drought, insurgent attacks in the north of the country and political instability in the wake



                                             - 62 -
of the military coup in March 2012. Economic activity contracted by 1.5 percent in 2012,
inflation was pushed up by escalating food prices, and a balance of payments deficit has
emerged. Fiscal stress intensified as a result of weakening tax revenues, the suspension
of donor budget support, and upward pressure on social and military spending. The
Government responded with fiscal austerity. The tight liquidity situation has led to the
accumulation of arrears to external creditors in the amount of 0.5 percent of GDP.
“The authorities’ 2013 program appropriately reflects near-term priorities. It aims to
maintain macroeconomic and financial stability by keeping spending in line with
available revenues and avoiding the emergence of new arrears.
“Steadfast implementation of tax policy, tax administration, cash flow management, and
energy policy reforms will be essential to maintain macroeconomic stability. The
ambitious tax revenue targets in 2013 will need to come from an increase in taxes on oil
products and progress in tax administration through systematic cross-checking of
information by the tax, customs, and procurement administrations. Prudent expenditure
execution and tight cash management will be needed to meet the deficit target and avoid
the accumulation of arrears. While electricity tariff adjustments are needed to bring the
sector back to a sustainable path, a clear reform, a public communication strategy, and
targeted measures to protect the poor will be essential to gain the population’s
acceptance.
“The disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility is designed to help Mali deal with
urgent balance of payments need and catalyze financial support from Mali’s international
partners, which is critical to Mali’s economic recovery.?

       Annex 4: Poverty and Social Impact Assessment of Electricity Tariff Revisions

a)      Access to electricity varies depending on several socioeconomic and demographic
characteristics. At the national level, the population's access rate to electricity is about 19
percent (see Figure 5, source: ELIM 2010). But the situation remains marked by geographical
disparities. For example, while 75 percent of the population of Bamako has access to electricity,
this rate drops to 49 percent in other urban areas, and 6 percent in rural areas. Southern regions
enjoy a 20 percent of population access rate, against 10 percent in the Northern regions, see
Figure 6. Another highlight is that households headed by women are more likely to have access
to electricity. Finally, access to electricity depends strongly on the level of wealth. For instance,
while 1 percent of the poorest quintile has access to electricity, this rate jumps to 53 percent for
the richest quintile.

b)      A contingency analysis is performed according to poverty status and the rate of
access to electricity. Figure 7 shows the classification obtained from this analysis. It appears that
from the 43.6 percent of poor in the whole country, more than 95%, which is equivalent to 41.6
percent of the total population, has no access to electricity. Thus, increasing the tariff will not
directly affect them. In contrast, poor people with access to electricity could see their situation
deteriorate further. However, these individuals represent only 2 percent of the population, which
means that the impact of a possible increase in the price of electricity will only marginally
impact on the population initially poor. Among the non-poor, 39.5 percent of the total population
does not have access to electricity. This population also will not be directly affected by a tariff
increase. Finally, nearly 17 percent of the population are non-poor and have access to electricity.
This population is most likely to be affected. Increased electricity tariffs would reduce its
purchasing power, push some below the poverty line, but also reduce inequalities (with respect to
households initially poor).

c)     The social impact of tariff increases will be more pronounced in Bamako. Figure 7
also shows that 69 percent of the population of Bamako is theoretically at risk of falling into
poverty with tariffs increase, as enjoying access to electricity and being non poor.

d)      The poverty impact of tariff increases also depends on the amount of electricity
consumed by the households having access to electricity. Considering only the sample of
households who have access to the grid, Figure 8 depicts the share of electricity consumption in
total consumption of the various deciles, from the poorest to the richest. Richer households
consume more electricity in relative and absolute terms than poorer households. A nonparametric
regression based on the overall sample confirms that the share of electricity consumption in total
expenditure increases with the level of per capita expenditure, see Figure 9. Poor households,
consuming less than 165,413 CFA per year, devote less than 1 percent of their total consumption
to electricity.

e)      Few households are located just above the poverty line, and thus vulnerable to
modest shocks. Figure 10 shows the density curves for the total sample (nationwide) and for the
population of Bamako. The vertical line on the left, which represents the current poverty line of
165,431 FCFA, appears to be located a little to the left of the median (in the center) and of the
mean (in the right) of the distribution in both samples. Moreover, the point of intersection of the
curve and the straight are located a bit far from the modal class. For Mali, the point is to the right
of the modal class while it is located to the left rather for Bamako. This means that few
individuals are near the poverty line and the effect of an increase in electricity tariff should be
fairly marginal. The effect would be greater for values of poverty located in the modal class

provided that households in this class are non-poor and have access to electricity. This does not
seem to be the case for Mali where the modal class corresponds to poor households.

f)      In February 2013, electricity tariffs were increased on average by 6.5 percent. This
average conceals some differences across categories, given the progressive nature of the tariff
structure. Residential tariffs for a monthly consumption inferior to 50 Kwh were not increased.
Tariffs for consumption between 50 and 100 Kwh were increased by 3 percent; between 100 and
200 Kwh by 16 percent; and by 23 percent above 200 Kwh per month. That is, most of
residential consumers are registered in the two first categories. However, it is methodologically
difficult to precisely estimate the actual consumption in Kwh of the different households,
depending on the number of households connected to the same meter. Thus, the analysis
considers that all households face the same relative tariff increase, which is a conservative
assumption as it ignores the potential positive impact of tariff progressivity. Besides 6.5 percent,
we also consider larger potential increases of 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent and 100 percent.

g)      A first approach to simulate the poverty impact of tariff increases consists in
measuring for each individual in the sample (from ELIM 2010) the loss in purchasing
power induced by more expensive electricity. The results for all considered scenarios are
shown in Figures 11 and 12, respectively, for the incidence of poverty and for the Gini index
measuring inequality. Figure 11 suggests that, although the effect on poverty is more important
in Bamako than in the rest of the country, this effect is generally negligible. Indeed, an increase
of 6.5 percent in electricity tariffs leads to an increase of about 0.05 and 0.2 percentage points in
the poverty rates of Mali and Bamako respectively. Doubling tariffs would entail a 2 percentage
point increase in the national poverty rate. As mostly consumed by rich households, increased
tariffs would also reduce inequalities, see Figure 12. As for poverty increases, inequality effect
remains also relatively marginal in magnitude.

h)      The second method is the marginal approach suggested by Duclos et al. (2008). 46 It
consists in deriving consumption dominance curves which indicate, for any given poverty line,
the impact of tariff increase on poverty of the population. Figure 13 shows the result for Mali
when the tariff increases by 6.5 percent. The effect increases with the value of poverty line,
which might mean that the price shock affects more the richer households who spend a higher

i)      Figure 15 and 16 depict the impact of larger tariff increases for Mali and Bamako. It
confirms that tariff increases are not likely to significantly aggravate poverty, in Mali overall and
Bamako in particular. However, if the impact on poverty is low, it is precisely because the rate of
access to electricity is itself low. This deprivation in electricity is a manifestation of poverty, and
a good energy sector reform should focus on granting access to all citizens, including the poor.
