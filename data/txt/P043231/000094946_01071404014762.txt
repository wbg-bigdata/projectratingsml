3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The short-term objectives of Tajikistan's First Institution Building Technical Assistance (IBTA) Credit
were to help meet skill shortages to develop and carry out reform programs in priority areas of privatization
and the financial sector. The long-term objective was to help strengthen the country's institutional capacity



to sustain reforms in these areas. The Bank's strategy was to support Tajikistan's transition toward a
market economy by helping the Government design and implement a comprehensive reform program.
These objectives were clear and consistent with the country's needs for capacity building in the key areas
identified in the project.
3.2 Revised Objective:
No revisions.
3.3 Original Compontents:
The IBTA Credit had three major components: (i) Technical Assistance to the State Property Committee
(SPC) in support of the privatization program; (ii) Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) in support of the farm restructuring program and the demonopolization of cotton processing and
marketing system; and (iii) Technical Assistance to the banking system to upgrade a number of key
operations crucial for the success of banking reforms. These components were consistent with Government
of Tajikistan (GOT) priorities to develop capacity to support the transition to a market-based economy.
The main rationale for and activities under each component were as follows:
Technical Assistance to the SPC
Tajikistan's largest barrier to privatization was the weak legal framework. The SPC was the main agency
in charge of privatization and needed to strengthen its institutional capacity in implementation and
monitoring. In response to these priorities, the IBTA Credit was designed to provide assistance with:
*   Preparation of the legal and regulatory framework for privatization and the private sector
*   Privatization of small-scale enterprises (SSEs)
o   Privatization of medium and large-scale enterprises (MSEs and LSEs)
*   Mass privatization (if necessary)
*   Public information in support of privatization
The Government eventually decided not to use the mass privatization approach that had been followed in
other Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries. Instead, it followed a cash-based auction method which the
Bank supported.
Technical Assistance to the MOA
As part of the reform program, the Government was determined to transform large-scale state farms into
collective farms and then into smaller, privately operated ones. The IBTA Credit provision of consulting
services and training programs as well as office equipment was designed to help the MOA to:
*   Identify and propose changes in existing laws that were needed to ensure secure land access rights
and full transferability of access rights, specify implementation mechanisms for the farm
restructuring program and develop
voluntary farmer associations
*   Revise the legal framework in cotton processing and marketing system, work toward design and
implementation of a strategy for demonopolizing the state cotton marketing entity and privatization
- 2 -



of cotton ginneries and provide further options for reforming the cotton sector
*   Train MOA staff in important aspects of farm restructuring and demonopolizing the state cotton
marketing entity
Technical Assistance to the Banking System
The Tajik banking system was organized according to the Soviet model of sectoral banks, with four major
banks dominating the banking system. Credit was allocated administratively in the form of directed credits.
The IBTA Credit coordinated with the IMF to help:
* Revise the current legal framework for banks
* Prepare and implement new accounting and auditing procedures for banks, based on internationally
accepted accounting principles
* Develop audit reports for the four major banks
* Develop effective supervision of the banking system
*   Improve payments mechanisms
3.4 Revised Components:
No revisions
3.5 Quality at Ent:y:
The quality at entry was rated satisfactory by the ICR as counterparts were deeply involved in project
preparation and the design was responsive to nationa]l priorities. The areas selected for institution building
and technical assistance under IBTA Credit were appropriate and directly facilitated successful preparation
and implementation of the First Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC). Another strength of the IBTA Credit
at entry was that detailed and comprehensive terms of reference (TORs) had been drafted and discussed by
various beneficiary agencies for the major activities of the credit. There was no Quality Assurance Group
(QAG) assessment.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The rating for the individual IBTA Credit components and the operation as a whole in meeting objectives is
satisfactory. The IBTA Credit met its objectives of meeting skill shortages to develop and carry out reform
programs in priority areas of privatization and the financial sector, as well as the long-term objective of
strengthening the country's institutional capacity to sustain reforms in these areas. This achievement is
shown in IBTA Credit's facilitation of a successful Structural Adjustment Credit. The QAG panel for the
review of SAC commended the role of IBTA Credit in supporting preparation and carrying out the SAC as
being consistent with best practices.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Privatization
IBTA Credit assisted the Govermnent in reforming the legal framework for privatization, as well as in
creating a privatization database and conducting auctions of state-owned enterprises. The rapid progress in
privatizing SSEs is shown in Table 1. By the close of the IBTA Credit on December 31, 2000, 95 percent
- 3 -



of all SSEs had been privatized. At the same time, 748 MSEs and LSEs were corporatized, 95 percent of
the total, 300 of all MSEs and LSEs subject to privatization, or 30 percent, were fully privatized. The
project also assisted the SPC's capacity building and organized seminars for enterprise managers to explain
both the incorporation and the privatization processes. Follow-up actions by the Government were critical
to privatization along with the hiring of a professional auctioneer.

Banking System Reforms
The main elements of GOT's financial program included improving payments systems, bank supervision,
accounting, auditing and legal framework, and were completed in 1999. Most of the agreed reforms were
carried out through the SAC with IBTA Credit's support. The Law on Banks and Banking Activities was
enacted and signed by the President in May 1998 and was one of the more significant achievements. The
payments systems improvement reduced the clearing time from four days to one by establishing an internal
clearing system within each bank, maintaining for each bank only one correspondent account in the
National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) and requiring each bank exchanging clearing items with other clearing
participants. On bank supervision, the NBT increased the number of qualified staff, provided training on
the application of the new prudential regulations and new accounting system and increased on-site
supervision of banks. Other achievements included in-depth diagnostic studies of major banks, completion
of the financial audits of the Vneshekonombank (April 1999), the State Savings Bank and the
Agroinvestbank (November, 1999).
Agriculture Sector Reforms
The report for the demonopolization of Cotton Processing and Marketing Systems was prepared in 1998
and the state cotton marketing entity, Pakhteh Tajik (RCPT), was restructured into the Cotton Service
Company, and the supervision of seed production transferred to the MOA. However, the transaction for
the sale of assets of the Cotton Service was not fully completed by IBTA Credit close. The IBTA Credit
provided technical assistance for the privatization of the 22 state-owned cotton ginneries under the SAC,
which included the planning and implementing of auctions and assisting the Government to arrange the full
- 4 -



payment for the cotton gunneries purchased during the auctions.
Annex 5 provides overall ratings for achievement of objectives.
4.3 Net Present Value/lEconomic rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.5 Institutional developnment impact:
The IBTA Credit main contribution to institutional development was in strengthening the institutional
capacity of the SPC and, the banking system and the MOA. This was achieved through improving the
legal framework to accommodate privatization, and reconfiguring the banking system through supervisory
and prudential functions. These capabilities were demonstrated in SAC successful implementation. The
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of the IBTA Credit was exceptional and its caliber was a key success
factor for this credit. The PIU functioned smoothly since its formation immediately following credit
negotiations, and was very effective as a liaison between the consultants and beneficiary agencies by
improving communication between the two and helping the consultants respond more effectively to
beneficiaries' needs. The PIU played an important role in strengthening the institutional capacity of the
beneficiary agencies as it developed competence in monitoring the work of consultants, maintaining
satisfactory accounts and assisting the beneficiary agencies in procurement of consultant services and
office equipment.  These capabilities will be valuable to further development of similar project
implementation units for other projects and deepening the reform program. Skills transfer was effective
and was reasonably successful at SPC. In the financiial sector, the strong reform commitment by the NBT
Chairman and the first deputy Chairman (who was a member of the PIU) paved the way for successful and
effective skills transfer. Although the guidelines on the new Accounting Standards were developed,
implementation of these guidelines did not fully take place and further assistance would be required in this
area. Successful training programs on important feature of farm restructuring facilitated skills transfer to
MOA staff.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Civil disturbances persisted after credit effectiveness and delayed consultants deployment by a few months.
Once in place, consultants performance were generally satisfactory. The GOT also benefited from
technical assistance provided by competent consultants for the privatization and financial sector
components. The agriculture component technical assistance was not as smooth as the other two
components, but managed ultimately to achieve its objectives.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The success of the SAC was driven in many ways by the success of the IBTA Credit, and, in many
respects, IBTA Credit provided the Government the tools needed to cope with interests and circumstances
that would impede privatization. As the ICR for the SAC documents, the Government's commitment to
reform overcame political obstacles within the Government (e.g., line ministries' resistance to MSE and



LSE privatization), and outside the Government (local anti-government forces).
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
There were no major factors affecting the specific performance of the lAs.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The total credit amount was US$5.0 million equivalent (SDR3.4 million) of which 100 percent was
disbursed. The credit was made on standard IDA terms of 40 years with 10 years grace period.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainiability rating:
Sustainability is rated as likely. Extensive training was provided in the banking system on improving the
payment systems, introducing international accounting standards, banking supervision for both the NBT
staff and the staff of the other banks. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman gained a great deal of
knowledge of the approach followed within a competitive market economy. During the IBTA Credit
implementation, the consultants provided substantial on the job training to at least 10 immediate
counterparts who are now able to carry out many of the functions of project management. One concern is
that although the supply side of skills transfer was substantial, not everywhere was this supply effectively
used. Although skills training may have been supplied in many areas, in a few instances, the actual
demonstration of skills acquisition may have been negated by some adherence to the "old" way of doing
things.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
To enhance sustainability and to move away from the "old" way of doing things, a Second Institution
Building Technical Assistance Credit (IBTA2) has been implemented, which is deepening institutional
capacity building effortF initiated under the IBTA Credit. IBTA2 Credit is providing technical assistance
to the critical phase of privatization program and further opportunity to the Government to strengthen its
capacity to establish a business environment conducive to private sector activities. Furthermore, IMF has
agreed to deepen reform of the banking system under its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
and any remaining and unattended issues will be supported under the Post Privatization Project, currently
under preparation.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Bank performance was satisfactory. In the area of project design, the Bank effectively involved Tajik
counterparts. The design of the IBTA Credit was forward-looking in that it laid the groundwork for a
successful adjustment operation under SAC that began in mid-1998. The IBTA Credit had considerable
impact on transfer of knowledge to the SPC and the banking system.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank worked well with the lAs and consultants. Establishing the three major consultancies was an
efficient way to install the basic implementation requirements of the IBTA Credit. The supervision
- 6 -



provided special emphasis to the privatization components which was a more difficult and sensitive
component to implement. The supervision for this component was especially intensive because there were
many privatization transactions supported by the IBTA Credit. Transfer of skills was good at the regional
level where most of the auctions were implemented. ]ntensive supervision was also required because of the
arrangements required to conduct auctions of the cotton ginneries. The supervision of the banking
component helped the NBT to develop effective supervision of the banking system and develop better
quality audit reports for the major banks. In the agricultural sector, the supervision missions were effective
in assisting the MOA to develop important aspects of the farm restructuring and demonopolization of the
state marketing entity.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. The Bank did well under challenging circumstances to develop
a forward-looking IBTA Credit that supported an ongoing reform program.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Government was fully involved in the discussions on the project design. Representatives of the lAs,
the MOA, SPC and the NBT worked well with the Bank to discuss and draft TORs and cost estimates for
the technical assistance components. All aspects of the components were laid out in detail jointly by the
Borrower and the Bank. The design was geared to establishing an institutional framework conducive to
transition to a private economy and to specific areas of reforms such as privatization as well as creating the
foundations necessary for a modem banking system.
7.5 Government implementation peiformance:
Government performance was satisfactory. The Government maintained its commitment to project as all
TORs were carried out. The Government achieved ambitious privatization targets, although with delays.
NBT's officials were highly committed to reforms and facilitated the process of capacity building and
transfer of international experience to the banking system.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of the lAs were satisfactory. The NBT was particularly dedicated to reform and carried
out a far-reaching overhaul of the banking law. The SPC had some difficulties in privatization, but, in the
end experienced delays of only a few months for the SSE auctions. Good progress was also made with
respect to MSEs and LSEs. The PIU was highly effective in monitoring the consultancies and in ensuring
good performance. In the banking system component, the NBT was very much receptive to effecting a
skills transfer. The MOA did well in initiating the process of farm restructuring.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Borrower performance was satisfactory overall because it met its main responsibility to effectively monitor
consultants and utilize their services to carry out a successful reform program.
8. Lessons Learned
The success of a Technical Assistance Credit will be enhanced to the extent that it is directly tied into
a Structural Adjustment Operation.



The IBTA Credit laid the groundwork necessary for the SAC by identifying the policy areas, the TORs for
IBTA Credit activities were directly related to the conditions under the SAC, and the IBTA Credit provided
capacity building and technical assistance for implementation of SAC.
In a post-conffict environment, Technical Assistance Credit can be effective under key conditions.
These conditions include: (i) a general readiness by the Government to undertake reform; (ii) deep country
knowledge by the task team which is embodied in project design; (iii) intensive supervision by experienced
Bank staff in new member countries; and (iv) a dedicated Project Implementation Unit that is in continuous
contact with consultants, beneficiary agencies, and the World Bank supervision team.

(a) Borrower/inmplementing agency:
Republic of Tajikistan
First Institution Building Technical Assistance Credit
Submitted as an Attachment to the Final Implementation Completion Report
The agreement for a credit of US$5 million, equivalent (SDR 3.4 million) between the International
Development Association and the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan for the First Institution
Building Technical Assistance (IBTA) Credit was signed on May 20, 1996 and became effective on June
12, 1996. The credit was provided for capacity building to implement the structural reform program in the
following areas:
Privatization program; and
Financial sector reform.
Privatization Program
The CARANA Corporation was selected to be the consultant for the State Property Committee to provide
technical assistance under the IBTA Credit for implementing the Government privatization program. The
CARANA Corporation started its activities in November 1996, and its first step was providing consulting
services and assistance for collecting information to create a database of the state-owned enterprises
supervised by the State Property Committee (SPC) of the Republic of Tajikistan. Considerable progress
has been made in the privatization of the small-scale state-owned enterprises and much has been done for
the privatization of state-owned trucks.
In addition, considerable assistance has been provided to the SPC in creation of a legal framework for
privatization. The SPC prepared laws, regulatory documents, regulations and instructions related to
procedure for the state-owned enterprise privatization, starting from corporatization to selling of the
state-owned block of shares through auctions and tenders and submitted them to the parliament. A
collection of regulatory documents and legislative acts on privatization of small enterprises, corporatization
and securities market has been compiled and published.  The regulatory and legal framework for
privatization as well as the laws relevant to the exercise of property rights have been developed, including
amendments to the following laws of the Republic of Tajikistan: Law on Joint Stock Companies,
Bankruptcy Law, and Law on Privatization of State-Owned Property.
Technical assistance was provided to the SPC in the corporatization of medium-size and large state-owned
- 8 -



enterprises and statutory documents of the state- owned enterprises were transferred into joint stock
companies.
Consulting services have been provided in the setting up and functioning of the Central Registrar in charge
of keeping share transfer records. Of particular importance was the proposal for the privatization of
incomplete construction projects that helped the budget of the Republic through the selling of vacated
buildings and unused structures.
Technical assistance was also provided in public education through a mass media campaign, which
explained the objectives, meaning and progress of privatization. In order to fulfill the task, the consultants
helped SPC to work closely with mass media, interviewed experts, organized round-table discussions,
wrote articles, published promotional and educational information and advertised auctions. The publication
of the Bulletin "Privatization" in Tajik and Russian coincided with the regular sessions of the Parliament.
Many activities related to the project were carried out in different regions of Tajikistan. Training courses
and seminars for the experts of regional SPC departments on small-scale privatization, corporatization and

Financial Sector Reform
Most importantly, the second part of the project was provision of technical assistance to the financial
sector. This component included banking sector restructuring and had the following objectives:
*          improving the legal framework for the banking sector activity;
*          improving the regulatory framework and bank supervision system;
*          restructuring of five large banks in Tajikistan; and
*          introducing Intemational Accounting Standards.
In order to achieve the above objectives, the firn, Arthur Andersen, was selected to provide technical
assistance to the National Bank of Tajikistan in the following areas:
*          adopting the "Law on Banks and Banking Activities";
*          developing guidelines on the new Accounting Standards both for NBT and commercial
*          banks of the republic;
*          inspecting the commercial banks,
*          issuing instruction for banks on the introduction of Intemational Accounting Standards
*          starting 1999;
*          selecting auditing firms to audit five largest banks according to the intemational standards;
*          restructuring the Bank Supervision Department with an increased number of highly skilled
*          staff-members;
*          initiating intensive training of NBl's employees on new prudential standards and
*          Intemational Accounting Standards; and
*          strengthening the supervision capacity of the NBT.
The important measures mentioned above enabled the banking system to make a definite step forward to
enter the world banking sector.
