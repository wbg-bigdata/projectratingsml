MEXICO
LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Publicos, S.A. (BANOBRAS)
Guarantor:     United Mexican States
Executing      Fideicomiso Fondo Nacional de Habitaciones Populares (FONHAPO)
Agency:
Amount:        US$150.0 million equivalent.
Terms:         15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending      Loan proceeds would be provided to FONHAPO by the Government
Terms:         as equity contributions.  The proceeds would be relent by
FONHAPO to states, municipalities, social and cooperative
organizations and authorized banking institutions on terms and
conditions which vary with the type of sub-borrower and the
unit cost of sub-project facilities.
Project        (i) to increase the supply of public housing investment
Objectives:    provided to the poorest and largest segment of the housing
market; (ii) to strengthen FONHAPO during a critical
expansionary phase; and (iii) to support the Government in
addressing sector issues.
Project        The project would finance sub-projects for the construction of
Description:   serviced sites and progressive construction units in rapidly
growing medium size cities. FONHAPO would onlend funds to
sub-borrowers who would implement sub-projects, participate in
their financing, provide collateral guarantees and allocate
constructed facilities to eligible beneficiaries (non wage
workers earning less than 2.5 minimum wages) under appropriate
mortgage arrangements. In addition, the project would provide
technical assistance to FONHAPO required to support an
increased lending program and to FO-HAPO's sub-borrowers.
Finally, the project would support the carrying out of a
Housing Finance Study. The project would permit the
settlement of about 142,300 families in serviced lots of which
about 15,200 would include starter dwelling units.
Project Risks: The main project risks are: (1) the possible reduction in
FONHAPO's operational efficiency through its rapid growth; (2)
the possible shortage of land sites of adequate quality,
quantity and price; (3) possible discontinuity in the
Government's housing sector policy; (4) eventual shortfalls or
delays in beneficiaries repayments to sub-borrowers which
would raise the level of implicit subsidy in the project.

MEXICO
LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
Staff Appraisal Report
I. THE SECTOR
A. Main Features of Demand and Supply
1.01      Size and Characteristics of Housing Demand:  However measured,
and there are problems of measurement, Mexico's housing deficit is large.
Official estimates, drawn in year 1980, put it at 4.5 million units. The
national housing problem is compounded by: (a) a large demographic base
(76 million) with a sustained rate of growth (2.9% per annum); (b) a rapid
pace of urbanization (centers with more than 2,500 inhabitants grew at over
5% per year during the last decade, passing from 59% to 68Z of total
population); (c) the spatial polarization of a large share of housing
demand (26.5% of Mexicans live in three main metropolitan areas); (d) the
extreme dispersion of the rest (the country has 146 cities of intermediate
size and 95,000 settlements with less than 2,500 inhabitants); and (e) the
uneven financial capacity of the consumers (72% of the economically active
population earns incomes of less than 3 minimum wages, which in present
terms is the equivalent of US$425 per month. (Chart VI-1, p. 101).
1.02      Unregulated (Informal) Housing Supply:  Like  other developing
countries, Mexico has a segmented structure of housing supply. Most
additions to the stock are not of up-to-code -standard' units. During the
past decade, as much as 65% of new housing was supplied either by consumers
themselves or by informal builders operating at the margin of the building
codes, the established construction industry and the regulated financial
markets. At present, this percentage could be as low as 45%, due mostly to
the intensification of public housing programs and the impact of the
recession on private initiatives.
1.93      In the three main metropolitan areas (Mexico City, Guadalajara,
Monterrey) as in many of the fast growing medium size cities, most of the
new housing units are built on subdivisions opened up by clandestine and
often unscrupulous developers on illegally occupied sites (generally on
public property) with inadequate public services and, almost always, with
infringements to planning ordinances and building codes. The lack of legal
titles and inspection clearances prevents the buyers f-om using land and
improvements as acceptable collateral for new loans and forces them to
continue to operate on the unregulated credit market. And because it is
unregulated and operates with higher risk, loan conditions in this segment
of the market are disadvantageous to the borrowers.

1.04      Regulated Housing Supply:  The Government intervenes in the
housing market through a large number of institutions, each with its own
norms of operation and financial arrangements. Schematically, they can be
grouped in three main categories:
(a)   financial agents, mainly nationalized commercial banks, regulated by
the Bank of Mexico, which in addition to making mortgages at
commercial terms, apply a msndatory reserve on their total
liabilities (currently 8.8%) in form of *social interest" housing
loans; these constitute the so called Programa Financiero de Vivienda
or PFV, supported by a second-tier public agency (FOVI-FOGA) which
finances and insures such loans. Although somewhat different in
statute and controlled by the Secretariat of Urban Development and
Ecology (SEDUE), the Fondo de Habitaciones Populares (FONHAPO) can
also be included in this category, since it operates as a wholesale
lender and is empowered to borrow funds from FOVI-FOGA and from the
market;
(b)   the three payroll funds, financed through a 5% compulsory
contribution on all wages and salaries paid by the orivate sector
(INFONAVIT), the public bureaucracy (FOVISSSTE) and the military
(FOVIMI-ISSFAM); and
(c)   the non-financial public housing agencies, supported by Federal
or State treasury transfers, part of which come under the supervision
of SEDUE, such as the State Housing Institutes or the Regional
Development Funds, while others are autonomously managed as part of
larger sector programs, such as the housing schemes for rural workers
(PIDER), the employees of the petroleum industry (PEMEX) and the
electricity corporation (CFE). The Federal District (DF) also has a
housing scheme for its own employees.
1.05      Dimensions of Supply:  Government sources have estimated that
11 million units should be built by the year 2000, to add to and partly to
replace the 1980 housing stock of 12.2 million units. Although staggering,
these figures are not alarming wheTi seen in light of past achievements.
During the 1970's, housing output averaged about 393,000 units per year,
with additions to the stock exceeding the rate of population growth. In an
economy that grew at an extraordinarily fast pace, the construction
industry grew at an even faster pace, averaging 12% annually over the
expansionary cycle from 1978 to 1982. During the past sexenio (1977-1982)
the regulated housing sector, supported by concessionary credit,
contributed about 135,000 units per year reaching a peak of 263,100 units
in 1982. The corresponding investment, measured in 1980 prices, was of
USS10.7 billion. The payroll funds accounted for 63% of this investment
total, the public agencies for 9Z and the banking system financed the
remaining 28%. Only about one fourth of housing loans made by the banks
was onlent at commercial terms, to support the highly cyclical activities
of private contractors operating almost exclusively for the upper segment
of the market. Over the same period, unregulated housing production may
have been on the order of 250,000 units per year. Of interest is the
substantial reduction in the real cost of the average unit produced by the
public sector during this period (-17%), which was achieved through changes
in the structure of supply and the general adoption of less expensive
design standards. In current dollars equivalent, the cost of the average
unit dropped from USS8,950 in 1977 to US$7,350 in 1982.



- 3 -
1.06       Supply Distortions:  The recent expansion and favourable past
performance did not, in themselves, resolve Mexico's housing problem. They
may in fact have aggravated some of its aspects, mainly those related to
efficiency and equity in the allocation of resources. First, most of the
credit programs remained beyond the reach of the poorest and needy
population. Second, improper lending terms caused a very low average rate
of capital recovery (about 40% of real value over the period) and the
transfer of some 100 billion pesos (about US$4.0 billion) to the consumers
of public housing: a sum that at average 1980 costs would have financed 35%
more units than those actually built during the sexenio.l/ Thirdly, the
massive structure of the payroll funds, financed througihdistortionary
earmarked taxes, was characterized by inefficient and inequitable
allocation criteria.
1.07      The 1982 Crisis and Beyond:  1982 was a turning point in the
evolution of the Mexican construction industry. There was a sudden, severe
drop in output and over half of the 1.9 million workers employed by the
industry in 1981 were reportedly laid off. Though necessary and
unpostponable, the current stabilization plan has had an enormous social
cost. The GOM is sensitive to the limits to which the social system may be
strairned without unrest and disruption. In fact, it has implemented
several measures to attempt to ward-off critical ruptures. Moreover and
more importantly, the Government is aware of the need for speedv recovery
in employment levels, once the basic macroeconomic balance has been
restored. The present recession and the slower growth expected through the
rest of the decade, as compared to the 1970's, heightens the importance of
employment generation as a policy concern in the coming years. Because of
its characteristics, the construction industrv, and housing programs in
particular, will have a central role in policies aimed at economic recovery
with rapid employment growth.
B. The Medium Term Housing Plan 1983-1988
1.08      Main Features:  President de la Madrid's Administration has
introduced a Medium Term Housing Plan for the 1983-1988 period (the PNDV or
Programa Nacional para el Desarrollo de Vivienda) which:
(a)    establishes a new institutional framework for programming and
monitoring public housing investment with the new Ley Federal de
Vivienda (February 1984), which should make more effective theTInk
between public spending and housing policy;
(b)    allocates extraordinary resources to the sector with the 1984
Programa Estrategico de Vivienda (US$760 million in addition to the
USS1,940 million of the authorized budget);
(c)    reduces the role of the payroll funds, (down from 63% to 49% of
planned regulated investment);
(d)    expands the role of the financial agents (from 28% to 44%) and
improves substantially the rate of capital recovery in "social
interest housing credits by Introducing (in March 1984) new
financial rules for both the batnking system and the FONHAPO
programs;
(e)    stimulates private savings and -rivate construction of medium income
finished housing through the modified terms of FOVI-FOGA;
1/ The issues reviewed in this Chapter have been discussed at some length
in the report: Public Housing Policy in Mexico, Urban Sector Report
No. 4993-ME (Green Cover) p. 92, IBRD, June 1984.



- 4 -
(f)    keeps to a minimum the contribution of the non-financial public
agencies (down from 9% to 6% of expected regulated investment);
(g)    concentrates budgetary transfers on the cost-effective FONHAPO
program (increasing from 3% to 14% of regulated investment), which
is tailored for the poorer segments of the population and their
capacity to pay; and
(h)    favors cooperative community efforts organized at local level with
appropriate technologies and labor-intensive construction methods.
1.09      Proposed Role of Regulated Housing Agencies:  The Government's
strategy, as reflected in the Medium Term Housing Plan, aims to achieve the
desired targets of housing production by simply assigning different rates
of growth to different agents of supply. This course of action (probably
dictated by the political rigidities of the existing system) does not
address the need for structural change and still implies a questionable use
of resources, as will be discussed below. The changing role of different
housing agencies, with respect to their past and present activities, can be
gleaned from the following table:

1.10      Quantitative Aspects:  The Medium Term Housing Plan, echoes the
recommendations made by COVE at the end of 1982.2/ It represents a
rational response to then prevailing Mexican conditions, but its structure
and quantitative targets would now require further elaboration. The
revised 1984 volume of sector investment, complemented in March by a 40%
.strategic allocation, amounted to a substantial MexS357 billion (US$2.7
billion) which has probablv exceeded the target of 1% of GDP set for
previous annual programs and is expected to generate 270,000 units. By
1988, the original Plan expected the realization of 1.6 million units,
doubling the supplv of housing from regulated programs with respect to the
previous sexenio.
21 COVI, the Interministerial Commission on Housing, formed at the end of
the previous Administration, formulated the basic estimates of housing
needs and traced possible scenarios for public intervention.



1.11      The target of 1.6 million new units would be achieved through a
mere 11% increase in real investments, which implies a reduction of the
average unit cost of production of 45% in real terms. Considering the
dramatic drop in unit prices already achieved during the last sexenio, this
calls for a dramatic expansion in the proportional output of least cost
housing solutions (sites and services and progressive construction units),
which are mainly financed by FONHAPO. The annual production of this agency
should therefore increase from 69,000 starts in 1984 to an improbable
200,000 starts in 1988, virtually triplicating its output over five years.
And since FONHAPO's growth largely depends on Government transfers, the
Plan is (at least implicitly) based on a substantial provision of budgetary
resources to the housing sector. This is to be made without the sacrifice
of the earmarked taxes contributed to the payroll funds or the compulsory
reserve requirements applied by the banks in -social interest mortgage
loans. Whether or not the fiscal budget will afford these initiatives, in
a new era of greater austerity in public spending i4 a matter that deserves
closer scrutiny.
C. Main Issues of the Sector
1.12      Public vs. Private Sector Role:  One issue not addressed by the
PLan is the extent to which public sector intervention is justified for the
supply of a private good such as housing.3/ Increasing public sector
expenditures for this purpose has been advocated ambivalently in terms of
anticyclical objectives (to exploit the large output multipliers and low
import coefficients of a construction industry with high rates of
unutilized capacity) and also in terms of distributional equity, pointing
to the free market's failure to provide affordable homes for the poor
and to the fact that appropriate shelter is recognized by the Mexican
Constitution as a basic right of all citizens. The 1984 Strategic Housing
Program concentrates budgetary contributions on minimum cost schemes,
particularly in the provision of land, infrastructure and progressive
construction assistance, for which the public sector's comparative
advantages over the private sector can be more readily justified. This
approach may help rationalize the construction initiatives of the informal
market and support local organizational efforts and employment generation,
but will have a rather muffled effect on the main construction industry.
It also clashes with the existing structure of supply which remains
dominated by agencies specialized in finished, up-to-code, "standardized"
housing, and still accounted for most of the sector's investment in 1984,
even after the drastic corrections made with the "strategic allocations.
The Fragmentation of Government Initiatives
1.13      Mexican authorities define as the "public sector's  housing
program the combination of investment activities by various types of
regulated institutions. However, there is no central financial authority
to oversee aU these institutions. Neither are there consolidated accounts
3/ According to a favorite indicator of Mexican housing authorities, the
public share of investment in housing increased from 0.9% of GDP in
1978 to 1.2% of GDP in 1982. This order of magnitude is not uncommon
in Latin American countries.  In Mexico puL ic sponsored housing
programs have been responsible for about 5% of gross capital formation
and up to 12.5% of public capital formation during the last sexenio.

for the system as a whole4/. Excluding the banks, the agencies involved
operate outside the mainstream of the financial system and therefore are
not directly regulated by the monetary authorities. Their funds are
alternatively provided (in the case of the public housing agencies) or
collected (in the case of the payroll funds) by the Secretariat of Finance
(SHCP), but their rules of operation and procedures for onlending are
determined by internal, agency specific arrangements. The resulting
proliferation of activities and the variety of credit terms and conditions
make it virtually impossible for the Government to carry out effective
accounting and budgeting of the aggregate sector investment and of the
implicit subsidy.
1.14      Low Rates of Capital Recovery:  With an average cost of funds for
the banking system on the order of 50% per annum and about the same level
of inflation in housing production prices, the generally low interest
rates on current mortgages involve considerable decapitalization, in spite
of the recently introduced instruments of progressive adjustment which are
described below.
1.15      In the FOV'-FOGA scheme (that of the banking system), the
starting interest rates are quite negative, varying between 15% and 30% and
are implicitly adjusted through the annual increment of loan repayments
(set at 70% of the minimum wage increases) until they level off with the
average cost of funds (CPP),5/ when amortization of principal would
actually begin. In substance, mortgage payments in the initial years are
wholly used to offset the accumulation of negative interest, until a
second-tier mortgage is made. Strictly speaking the subsidy applies only
for re-financing interest accrued on the loan, but it should be noted that
the banks are obliged to refinance all loans up to 70% of their original
value and that the resources used in these operations are charged against
the compulsory reserve requirements in the rubric of social interest
housing. In fact, this has led to a change in the volume and structure of
the bank's mandatory reserves. The Whole procedure is complex and
obfuscates the true measure of the subsidy in the effective rate of
interest, while trying to achieve two contradictory objectives: the
reduction of the overall subsidy and, at the same time, the containment of
debt service charges. Inevitably, the re-financing formula produces an
average rate of interest well below the average cost of funds (CPP) even in
the event that the starting rate would equal the CPP. Moreover, the
subsidized average rate is not known a priori.  In fact, the rate of
interest is a dependent variable and not a parameter of the system.
4/ Some basic data for the system as a whole have been compiled by COVI up
to 1980 (published in 1982) and since then in special tabulations
prepared by COVI or by the DGCPV-SEDUE. These agencies, though not
empowered to control housing credit institutions act as coordinators of
the public sector's effort.
5/ The average cost of funds (Costo Porcentual Promedio de Captacion) or
CPP is an index published each month by the Bank of Mexico, reflecting
the weighted average interest rate paid by the financial institutions
on time deposits in local currency.



1.16      In the FONHAPO scheme, which must be affordable to a much poorer
target group, the payments are fully kept in line with the annual minimum
wage adjustments, but the starting interest rates are set as low as 9X up
to a maximum 15X p.a., and are upgraded each year during the life of a loan
according to a factor of 1.1. Effect.ve rates are somewhat higher than
nominal rates because they are charged monthly, while amortization of
principal is applied annually (para. 5.10).
1.17      The payroll funds instead continue to offer mortgages at a flat
rate of 4% per annum! Should inflation persist at the present high annual
rates the level of capital recovery might range between 25% and 50% for the
payroll funds, would hover about 60% for FONHAPO and possibly reach 70% for
the PFV. In Mexico, as in the Bank, it is generally assumed that inflation
will follow a descending path over the years to come. Since all Mexican
schemes of housing credit are linked to the minimum wage and the real value
of the latter is likely to be gradually readjusted, the relative rates of
capital recovery will probably improve from the present low ebb.
Nevertheless, all current credit schemes involve a sizeable amount of
implicit subsidy and some of them are barely replicable.6/  Wbat is more
disturbing is that the financial rules now in place makeit difficult to
monltor, lest to predict, the actual amount of public subsidy involved as
well as the long-term sustainability of housing programs.
1.18      The Distribution of Housing Subsidies:  The question is not
whether "social interest" housing should or should not bear subsidies but
rather to determine a level for such subsidies which may be tolerable for
the Mexican economy and to ensure their appropriate distribution to
"deserving" social groups. Under the present system, the bulk of housing
subsidies goes to the beneficiaries of the payroll funds and to those of
the regulated banking system, many of which could afford higher interest
mortgages. A rough estimate of the total public subsidy involved in the
1984 investment program is on the order of US$1.4 billion, of which nearly
half (47%) attributable to the payroll funds, over one third (35%) to the
FOVI-FOGA system and some 14% to the public agencies. FONHAPO accounted
for only 4% of the total housing subsidy while contributing 26% of the new
housing units.
1.19      Although the payroll funds are limited to workers earning less
than five minimum wages and should favor the lower wage workers, their
impact is probably regressive. These programs are incapable of attending
but a small portion of their captive demand. Yet, aside from making it
difficult for account holders to withdraw deposits made in their behalf,
the funds fail to pay either interest or monetary correction on the
individual accounts. Moreover, the payroll tax is probably shifted on to
prices and may have a regressive incidence on the distribution of family
budgets. And, because it leads to an increase in unit labor costs, the tax
may also have an indirect unemployment effect.
6/ WUD advisory staff considers a housing project replicable when the
investor (in this case the Government) recovers sufficient cash flow to
finance a repeater project of the same size. To the extent that such
decision implies a stable commitment of public resources, social
replicability could be achieved with a cost recovery (in real terms) as
low as 50%. However, any increase in the volume of the repeater
investment entails incremental public transfers unless returns on the
prior investment are greater than 50%.



- 8 -
1.20      The 1984 structure of bank mortgages under the PFV will
concentrate credits on families with incomes in excess of four minimum
wages (i.e. belonging to the top two deciles of the income distribution:
see Chart VI-1). Given the fact that the PFV is implemented through the
initiatives of private developers (who subsequently transfer bank loans to
the final buyers) it is likely that, as in the past, the actual patterm of
investment be heavily tilted to the upper limit of the PFV allowable income
brackets, presently set at 7.5 minimum wages.
1.21      This leaves to the informal housing market the immense task of
attending to the shelter needs of some 70% of the Mexican population. Only
a minor portion of the total fiscal resources allocated in various forms of
concessionary housing credit is assigned to FONHAPO to assist this market.
In this respect, should the FONHAPO program be successful in rapidly
expanding the supply of appropriate shelter solutions with a much lower
fiscal subsidy per household than the conventional public housing programs,
a consensus may gradually develop in the direction of supporting its
further growth by diverting to it funds from other sources.
D. Bank Strategy
1.22      The Government has officially stated its objective of improving
the public management of subsidies. Specifically, this involves
controlling and budgeting the subsidy element of preferential credit and
making it explicit and transparent. For credit components under
Bank-financed projects in sectors other than housing, the Government's
commitment to the control and gradual reduction of subsidies was formalized
in the General Agreement on Interest Rates (GIRA). Signed in August 1984,
and effective since November 1984, the GIRA framework focusses on the
progressive adjustment of preferential interest rates in accordance with
variations to a central reference rate, the CPP (see footnote 5 on page 6).
1.23      Housing credit was not included in the GIRA because of the
conceptual difference in the adjustment mechanism applied to such credits.
The Government felt that adjustment through linkages with the minimum wage
was socially and politically more acceptable in the case of housing credit,
since this formula offers a more direct expression of affordability and can
be easily explained to and understood by the target population. However,
the current onlending terms for housing credit present obvious difficulties
in respect to the Government's objective of improving the public management
of subsidies. Because of their sensitivity to inflation trends and minimum
wage policies, these credit terms result in subsidy transfers which remain
unpredictable, uncontrollable and not transparent.
1.24      The proposed project would be the first in a series of lending
operations in the housing sector and would support the establishment of a
sector policy dialogue. The project would address the issue of capital
recovery and measurement of subsidies for the FONHAPO program. While
FONHAPO is presently responsible for only 5% of the regulated housing
investment, the Government has targetted a rapid increase in the relative
share of funds devoted to this program by 1988. The proposed loan would
therefore assist the Government in pursuing a stated objective of fiscal
policy during the critical expansionary phase of FONHAPO, while achieving
greater distributional equity in the sectoral allocation of resources.



-9-
1.25      At the same time, the project would support the carrying out of a
housing finance study which would address system-wide issues such as
replicability, cost recovery, measurement of subsidies, the adequacy of the
payroll retention system, and the impact of general housing policy on
financial savings, employment and the budget. The Government would forward
terms of reference to the Bank, for comment, by December 31, 1985 (a first
draft is proposed in Annex VIII), and exchange views with the Bank on the
progress of the study by March 31, 1986. The Study would be finalized by
December 31, 1986, at which time the Government would discuss results and
conclusions with the Bank. Future housing loans of the Bank would support
gradual reform of sector wide issues as addressed and discussed in
connection with the study.
Rationale for Bank Involvement.
1.26      By supporting the FONHAPO program, the Bank would be endorsing
the Government's objectives of re-directing an increasing percentage of
total public housing investment to the poorest and largest segment of the
housing market. The rationale for the proposed loan would be to strengthen
capital recovery and to develop better criteria for future replicability of
the program after the critical mintial phase of FONHAPO's expansion. Bank
participation would complement necessary initial budgetary allocations,
ensure maintenance of GOM commitment to this window of housing credit and
require FONHAPO to meet specific standards of financial performance,
thereby gradually increasing the agency's own contribution towards new
investment financing, and reducing the need for incremental fiscal
transfers. The proposed project would provide technical assistance
required by the projected growth of FONHAPO's investment program. Finally,
the project would be beneficial towards the establishment and maintenance
of a comprehensive housing policy dialogue with the Government.
E. Bank Experience with Past Lending in the Sector
1.27      Past Loans:  Bank involvement in Mexican housing and urban
development activities began seven years ago, with Loan 1554-ME signed in
April 1978 (US$16.5 million) which has been fully disbursed. This project,
located in the Lazaro Cardenas Conurbation, constituted a satisfactory
experiment with the provision of serviced lots and progressive construction
units to about 1000 low income families. A second project was signed in
December 1981 (Loan 1990-NE of US$164 million) comprising a sites and
services component for 1,900 units, distributed in 10 cities of the Gulf
Region. The new Government has confirmed interest in the original
objectives of this loan, but has requested some of its administrative
arrangements to be revised in light of the new institutional organization
for regional development. A third project is currently in course of
implementation (Loan 2194-ME of US$9.2 million signed in August 1982),
supporting the preparation of the pre-investment stage of a development
program for the Mexico City-Region, which will also involve land and
housing development schemes.



- 10 -
1.28      The Bank has been assisting Mexico also in the implementation of
a number of urban infrastructure projects. In June 1973, a US$90 million
loan was signed to support bulk water supply for the Mexico City
metropolitan area (Loan 909-ME now closed). Three other loans for water
supply and sewerage projects were channeled to local companies through
FIFAPA, a specialized Government Trust Fund (Loan 1186-ME of US$40 million,
signed in January 1976, Loan 1913-ME of US$125 million, signed in November
1980, and Loan 2281-ME of US$100.3 million, signed in September 1983).
Mexican performance under these loans is satisfactory in terms of sub-loan
commitment and execution. Compliance with tariff increases required by
loan covenants can be considered adequate in the majority of cities, given
the critical economic situation of the country. Urban infrastructure
components have been satisfactorily implemented with Bank participation
also for projects in the tourism sector (Loans 793-ME of US$22 million,
December 1971; 1420-ME of US$42 million, May 1977; and 1524-ME of US$50
million, March 1978).
F. Sector Work and EDI Seminar
1.29      Two sector reports in the Housing and Urban Development sector
(IBRD No. 4939-ME and IBRD No. 4993a-ME) have been produced in Green Cover
in March and June, 1984 respectively, and informally discussed with
Government officials. Two other urban sector reports concerning
Territorial Development and Fiscal Devolution are presently in Yellow Cover
stage (IBRD-5188a-ME of June 1984).  A Sector Report on Water and Sewerage
Policy has been completed in April 1984 (IBRD Nb. 4840a-ME).
1.30      At the invitation of the GOM, EDI has helped organize a Seminar
on Urban Management which took place in Mexico City during October 1980,
following the publication of the first Mexican Housing Plan. Bank
experiences with low-income housing projects in several Latin American
countries were reviewed by operational staff with the authors of the
Housing Plan and with senior officials from several States of Mexico.
II.  THE BORROWER, THE TRUST FUND, THE SUB-BORROWERS AND THE
FINAL BENEFICIARIES
The Borrower (BANOBRAS)
2.01      The loan would be made to the National Bank for Public Works and
Services (BANOBRAS), which is a financial agent of the Government, legally
empowered to act as a World Bank Borrower. BANOBRAS is a public
development bank, which obtains its funds from the Mexican Government and
the international market. According to BANOBRAS Organization Law, the
Federal Government controls its policies and supervises its lending and
borrowing activities. The Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP)
has veto power over the resolutions of BANOBRAS' Board of Directors and
approves BANOBRAS yearly budgets.  BANOBRAf is authorized to carry out such
other functions related to its credit activities as may be approved by
SHCP.

2.02      BANOBRAS operates several trust funds, each corresponding to a
specific investment program, such as FIFAPA (the water and sewerage fund
partially supported by three Bank loans); the FM or Municipal Development
Fund (supported by an IDB loan) which finances a variety of urban
facilities; FONHAPO (the low-income housing fund), and others. In
addition, BANOBRAS makes direct loans to States, Municipalities and other
public sector enterprises and is functioning as the financial intermediary
for a number of World Bank loans in urban development, highways and
railways.
The Trust Fund (FONHAPO)
2.03      Brief History:  From 1949 to December 1980, the Fideicomiso Fondo
Nacional de Habitaciones Populares (National Trust Fund for Low-Income
Housing, known by the acronym of FONHAPO) existed merely as a division of
BANOBRAS, which had the mandate to construct low-cost housing. Two changes
in the legislation under which BANOBRAS operates (December 31, 1980 and
1981), granted FONHAPO its own administration as a trust fund of the
Government ("fideicomiso") and a new mandate to finance the construction of
non-conventional housing types for low-income households as envisaged in
the National Housing Program. The programs in which the World Bank would
participate began in 1982.
2.04      The formal establishment of FONHAPO as a public credit agency
took place through a Decree published in the Diario Oficial de la Republica
on April 2, 1981 and the Agreement of May 13, 1981, stipulated between the
Goverament through the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) as
the sole Trustor (the fideicomitente or the entity who owns the fund) and
BANOBRAS, as the Trustee (the fiduciaria or the entity which administers
the fund). This Agreement indicated that the then Secretariat of Human
Settlements and Public Works (SAHOP, which is now SEDUE or the Secretariat
of Urban Development and Ecology) would acquire tutorial and normative
responsibility for the Trust Fund, and that funds would be allocated for
FONHAPO's operations as part of the yearly budget of this Secretariat.7/
2.15      Organization of FONHAPO:  the Fund has a Board of Directors
(Comite Tecnico y de Tjistribuclon de Fondos) which is chaired by the
Secretary of SEDUE and includes representatives of otber concerned
Secretariats (SHCP and SPP), of the banking sector (BANOBRAS and FOVI -
Banco de Mexico) as well as the Federal Controller, a Secretary and
FONHAPO's General Director. Internally, seven Departments (Gerencias)
report to the General Director. These include Administration, Finance,
Real Estate, Legal, Technical, Planning, and Social Promotion. In
addition, there are the Operational Coordination office, and that of the
Internal Controller (Chart II-1 in Annex). FONHAPO's headquarters employ a
qualified and motivated staff of about 300, more than half of which at
7/ The idea of establishing FONHAPO dates back to 1979, when an
intersecretarial committee (COVI) was formed under the coordination of
SAHOP, to carry out the technical, financial, administrative and
economic studies necessary to frame the objectives of the new Fund in a
general context of public housing policy. This preparatory work was
concluded in December 1980, when the Secretariat of Planning and
Budgeting (SPP) recommended to the Presidency to alter the structure
and activities of a fund operated by BANOBRAS.

professional level. In addition, nine regional offices have been recently
created to assist locally sub-borrowers in the preparation and
implementation of projects and to supervise their execution. FONHAPO also
keeps a roster of pre-qualified consultants to provide professional
assistance to sub-borrowers under contract.
2.06      A detailed description of the Statutory Objectives, Sources of
Financing, Rules of Operation, and of the current Terms and Conditions for
onlending of FONHAPO is presented in Annex II. The main features of the
typical sub-loans are summarized in Table 4 (para. 5.08). Typical
amortization tables are supplied in Tables 5.4 and 5.5 and in Charts V-1
and V-2.
2.07      Performance to Date:  Since the inception of the new Government
in January 1982, FONHAPO has rapidly expanded its operations to the 31
States of Mexico with a total of over 250 sub-loans to date. During 1984,
it has invested the equivalent of US$107 million (June 30, exchange rate)
of which 25% in Sites and Services, 59% in Progressive Construction
Dwellings, 16% in Home Upgrading. In terms of umits financed, 36,000 were
completed at the end of 1984, and about 69,300 have been started, to be
completed in 1985. Sub-loan preparations for 1985, include 98,000 new
units.
2.08      FONHAPO's records have been accurately kept, separating the new
from the old portfolio, and an examination of its accounting and auditing
procedu-es has proven satisfactory. The Fund maintains its own monitoring
and evaluation program and bases its internal planning and financial
projections on the marketing and implementation results achieved in the
prior years. The disbursement period on a sample of 105 implemented
sub-projects examined by the mission averaged less than one year. Under
the new terms of onlending, sub-loans reach maturity in four to seven
years, which woul_ allow FONHAPO to reinvest two to three times the funds
received during the period of Bank loan repayment.
2.09      Growth Management:  FONHAPO is already, and will be be more so in
the future, a prime lender for housing projects meeting its requirements.
During the three years it has been operating under the new statute the
agency has competently managed its own growth. The present management's
awareness of the problems of rapid expansion is revealed by the attention
paid to development of a new organizational structure, with appropriate
internal controls and a suitable information system. The Comite Tecnico
(Loan Committee) which is responsible for the evaluation of all loans,
receives a complete information package, much of it computerized, for its
monthly meetings. In addition to the timely prepared monthly financial
statements, the report contains recent information of all loans granted and
in process under the new programs. To control loan processing and
operations, operation manuals have been recently revised. A good example
of these is the new procedural guide for the regional offices
(Instrumentacion de las Delegaciones Regionales).  Another example is the
borrower's guide on loan processing (Instructivo para la Elaboracion de los
Formatos para la Contratacion del Cretito). Finally, the whole structure
of FONHAPO is being reorganized on the basis of an Organization Manual
(Manual de Organizacion) prepared during 1984 by a team of management
consultants, which details the new structure of the Fund and specifies the
functions and responsibilities of its various branches (Charts IV-1 to IV-9
in Annex IV).



- 13 -
2.10      Possible Improvements:  further progress can be achieved in three
main directions: (i) advances in computerization; FONHAPO has undertaken
a modest program of mechanization, which has been slowed down by budget
constraints imposed by the Mexican Government: completion of this
computerization program would be supported by the Bank under the Technical
Assistance Component; (ii) better financial information: the Finance
Department should be encouraged to produce more details in its monthly
financial statements on interest income by program, interest charged on
overdue accounts and a more complete analysis of the new portfolio by
dividing it into interest and non-interest bearing portions; (iii)
borrower's guidance on collection: PONHAPO should consider designing a
standard collection system for its borrowers, with manuals for organizing
field collection offices, mechanization of collection records, and enforce
its use by FONHAPO's borrowers (para. 4.13).
The Sub-borrowers
2.11      FONHAPO channels its credits to sub-borrowers, which are
responsible for the implementation of the sub-projects and the allocation
of the facilities built to a pre-identified group of beneficiaries.
sub-borrowers are authorized to apply a one point spread above the
applicable FONHAPO interest rate an the mortgage contracts they stipulate
with final beneficiaries, which is considered adequate to cover the
sub-borrowers' administrative costs in view of the supplemental assistance
furnished by FONHAPO. FONHAPO controls the process of allocation (para.
4.12), but has no direct contractual relationship with the ultimate
beneficiaries of its lines of credit. The intermediary agents of FONIHAPO
can be:
i)    Federal public sector institutions, when their schemes and
budgets for low-income housing developments have been approved by
the Federal Government;
ii)    State and Municipal governments, decentralized institutions and
parastatal or paramunicipal enterprises (most frequently State
Housing Instltutes), when developing low-income housing schemes
consistent with the objectives of FONHAPO;
iii)    authorized banking institutions operating in accordance with the
General Law of Credit Institutions and Auxiliary Organizations;
iv)    cooperative housing associations; and
v)    legally constituted groups, which are implementing programs
consistent with the norms of FONEAPO.
The Final Beneficiaries
2.12      FONHAPO's loans are destined to benefit a segment of Mexican
population which must be: (a) preferably choosen among non-wage workers;
(b) with heads of household receiving incomes no larger than 2.5 times the
minimum wage (about US$355 per month in January 1985);8/ (c) intending to
8/  Reference to the level of income of the head of household which is more
easily quantifiable than that of the household is geuierally adopted for
normative purposes in Mexico. As discussed in Annex VI (para. 5) total
family income per capita would represent a better measurement of the
affordability of debt service. However FONHAPO does collect data of
household income and household composition in its monitoring surveys of
the target group.



- 14 -
purchase a home in order to live in it; and (d) not owners of other real
estate property. In order to qualify for a credit from FONHAPO,
sub-borrowers are required to submit an analysis of potential beneficiaries
and FONHAPO's Loan Committee may reject selectively or totally the
corresponding documentation if insufficient evidence is submitted of: i)
the authenticity of the stated income of beneficiaries; ii) the absence of
other real estate property; or iii) the composition of the households
(para. 4.12).
2.13      From the 1984 Monitoring and Evaluation Survey of FONHAPO, one
learns that less than half (48.5%) of the beneficiaries of completed
projects, held a permanent job and the remainder were supporting themselves
with informal sector activities. Prior to access to the sub-projects, some
58% of the surveyed population used to spend 21% of their income to pay
rent, while the monthly payments on their FONHAPO-financed premises
averaged only 17% of their current income. The remaining 42% of residents
faced no special hardship in meeting the required monthly payments. The
average household size was of 5.1 people. In general, the survey
population had been previously residing in an urban area for approximately
10 years.
2.14      The analysis of a smaller, but carefully planned and executed
sample of families in sites and services projects, conducted by FONHAPO's
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit between May and July 1984 (details in
Annex VI), affords the following conclusions:
a)    FONHAPO's Sites and Services projects do reach their intended
target population, which constitutes a low, but not the lowest
segment of the income distribution (the mean income of the
household head is 1.33 MW (about US$189 per month) well below
the established level for FONHAPO (2.5 MW); the average family
income is expectedly higher, but still below 2.0 MW);
b)    this population is not reached, but exceptionally, by the other
existing Government housing programs;
c)    FONHAPO's product and the associated financial schemes are
affordable by the average family in the target population, even
when due allowance is granted for supplementary expenditures in
house-building.
2.15      These data confirm the effectiveness of the FONHAPO program.  An
explanation of its marketing success, particularly in medium size cities,
can be gleaned from Chart VI-1 in Annex, which illustrates the income
distribution of Mexican households. While the graphic represents the
findings of a national survey conducted in 1977, it must be noted that
income distribution in Mexico has shown a remarkably constant structure
over time and has probably not improved significantly since then, in light
of the recent recession of the economy. The 1980 Census analysis confirms
that the bulk of housing demand comes from households below the seventh
decile of income distribution (2.5 minimum wages).

III. THE PROJECT
Background
3.01      During the Annual Meetings of September 1983, the Mexican
Government expressed interest in a significant amount of World Bank support
to the housing sector. This first loan through FONHAPO has been prepared
for Bank approval in response to that request. Project preparation has
been based on the findings of a study on Public Housing Policy in Mexico
(IBRD-4993a-ME) which has been produced by Bank staff in June 1984.
3.02      The report on public housing policy in Mexico explains the
present structure of housing institutions and their very recent operational
reorganization, following the new federal housing law (Ley Federal de
Vivienda of December 29, 1983). Staff reviews of the report concluded that
early but limited circulation of its findings to Mexican authorities would
already serve as the foundation for a more intensive review, centered on
the financial issues encountered in the housing sector.
3.03      During discussions of the housing policy report and the
preparation of the proposed project, preliminary agreement was reached with
the Government to undertake a more analytical study on housing finance
through the joint efforts of the Bank and the four key Mexican agencies:
SHCP (finance), SPP (budget), SEDUE (housing policy), and Banco de Mexico.
The Government gave assurances during negotiations that it would carry out
a Housing Policy Study, and discuss the study's conclusions and
recommendations no later than December 31, 1986.
3.04      It is recognized that the Bank desire to support a gradual reform
of the Mexican housing finance system cannot be properly addressed on a
project specific basis, but only through a system-wide policy dialogue to
be developed over time, eventually supported by a sequence of lending
operations during the next five years. The proposed project should
therefore be interpreted as a first step towards concrete cooperation.
Project Objectives
3.05      The proposed project is aimed at the following objectives:
a) support replicability and growth of the FONHAPO program, which
focusses housing investment to the poorest and largest segment of the
housing market;
b) support FONHAPO during a critical expansionary phase by
promoting the application of new onlending terms while assuring specific
standards of financial performance and providing technical assistance for
institutional strengthening; and
c) support the Government in addressing sector issues.
Project Description
3.06      The loan would finance a slice (para. 3.09) of the 1985-1988
credit program of FONHAPO, a trust fund administered by BANOBRAS, which
would be the Borrower.   Counterpart funds would be appropriated annually



- 16 -
in the Government budget and passed on to FONHAPO as equity contributions.
FONHAPO would enter into Sub-loan Agreements, secured by collateral
guarantees, with States, Municipalities and social or cooperative
organizations for the preparation of serviced sites for low-income housing
schemes. FONHAPO will provide technical assistance to: (a) support
sub-borrowers in the preparation, appraisal, implementation, selection of
beneficiaries, allocation and transfer of facilities, collection of
charges, monitoring and evaluation of sub-projects; (b) establishment of a
computer program system for financial information; (c) designing and
promoting the use of collection models for its sub-borrowers; and (d)
carrying out a study to develop a medium term program.   Bank funds (the
proposed loan amount is US$150 million) would be used to partially finance
basic infrastructure works (earthworks, drainage, roads, sewerage, water
and electricity networks) and starter dwellings on the serviced lots in
which about 140,000 low-income households could settle. The target group
would be formed by households with incomes below 2.5 times the minimum
wage9/. They would be expected to make an initial deposit and to make
mortgage payments to the sub-borrowers indexed to the current value of
minimum wages. In parallel with the execution of the project, the
Government would carry out a joint study with the Bank on the national
housing finance system.
Project Costs
3.07      The estimated costs of the proposed project, excluding taxes, are
shown in the Summary Table (page vi). The appraisal of project cost has
been based on actual cost experience, corresponding to the average unit
prices of a sample of 105 sub-projects financed by FONHAPO during the first
half of 1984. These costs were expressed in constant 1984 dollar
equivalents (i.e. US$890 for a serviced lot of 117 m2 and US$3,700 for a
3-room unit of 38 m2). A flat rate of 10Z has been included for possible
physical increases in all components. The price escalation on the annual
investments has been calculated according to a seven year disbursement
profile (Bank-wide average for lines of credit) and to standard projections
of dollar inflation, in the assumption that corresponding adjustments in
the value of the local currency will maintain the exchange rate parity.10/
Bank Participation
3.08      The Bank would finance 50% of the total cost of selected
sub-projects, corresponding to the foreign exchange component (estimated at
25% of total costs) and an equivalent contribution towards local costs,
given the social nature of the project. Thus the loan would assist in
financing works equivalent to US$233 million and another US$67 million of
related expenditures in land purchases and preparations, professional,
9/ According to the 1980 Census, 72% of Mexico's economically active
population earns incomes below 3 minimum wages and 57% earns less than
1.6 minimum wages. Eligibility for FONHAPO's sub-loans is limited to
heads of households whose monetary income is below 2.5 minimum wages
(currently equivalent to US$355 per month). The figure of 2.0 MW is
usually interpreted as the absolute poverty level in Mexico.
10/ International inflation assumptions were made as follows: 1985 (5.0%);
1986 (7.5%); 1987-90 (8.0%); 1991 and thereafter (5.0%).



- 17 -
administrative and technical assistance services for a total of USS300
million equivalent. At current average costs this investment would permit
the settlement of 142,000 families in serviced lots and the financing of
15,200 starter dwelling units (Table 5.23 in Annex V).
3.09      The Bank-financed Project would represent about 19X of FONHAPO's
planned production of about 400,000 units under the 1985-1988 Medium Term
Program and about 11% of the 800,000 units expected under the 1985-1992
Long Term Program (both figures based on 1984 constant dollar prices).
Bank participation would be slanted in favor of Sites and Services rather
than Progressive Construction sub-projects (45% versus only 5% respectively
of the total units financed under these two lines of credit). In dollar
terms, about 2/3 of Bank disbursements would be made against sub-projects
of the first kind and the remaining 1/3 against progressive construction
sub-projects (compare Tables 5.12 and 5 22 in Annex V).
Criteria for Sub-project Selection
3.10      Selection of sub-projects for Bank financing would be based on
considerations of unit costs and affordability by the chosen target group
according to FONHAPO's general credit conditions (Table 4 on page 28) and
would have to meet the following additional criteria:
a) only sites and services and progressive construction sub-projects,
(i.e. financed under FONHAPOs two iain lines of credit, which account
for 85% of the agency's activities) (para. 7.03);
b) sub-projects above a certain size (e.g. costing not less than
US$500,000 equivalent) so as to reduce the Bank's supervision, and
disbursement activities to a manageable number of operations;
c)  sub-projects yielding a rate of financial return of not less than 9X
per annum; and
d) sub-projects located in the priority cities which the National Urban
Development Plan has singled out for preferential attention on the
basis of: (i) relative size and growth rate; (ii) specific role in the
national urban and productive systems; (iii) industrial development
potential; (iv) local entrepreneurial and management capacity; (v)
accessibility and area of Influence; (vi) diversity and quality of
available urban services; (vii) specific administrative role.ll/
Commitment of Bank Funds
3.11      Presentation to the Bank of Programs for commitment of Bank Loan
proceeds would be required annually by December 31 for each forthcoming
fiscal year and would be jointly reviewed in light of FONHAPO's annual
investment budgets. Sub-loan Agreements bearing Bank financing would be
sent to the Bank for approval.   Assuming that the average sub-project
11/ Bank loan proceeds would be directed to the 59 'strategic' medium-size
cities and to comunities on the fringes of the three metropolitan
areas (Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey), complementing
investments supported by the Bank's FIFAPA credits for water and
sewerage networks and the IDB funded FM loans vhich are also directed
to these cities.



- 18 -
approved for Bank financing would cost US$1.5 to US$2.5 million equivalent
(in-keeping with the mean cost of FONHAPO's larger operations which include
750 to 1200 units) the Bank loan would support the financing of about
twenty five sub-projects per year.12!   Commitment of Loan Funds is
expected to be completed by December 31, 1990.
3.12      FONHAPO's processing of sub-loan applications follows a
structured three-step procedure (promotion, preparation and evaluation)
which is described in Chapter IV and involves an average period of 6 to 12
months. The Fund would continue to offer technical assistance to
sub-borrowers as needed during the three stages through its regional
offices. The central office would be mainly concerned with the general
administration of the program and the final steps of sub-loan approval.
Based on a review of the files of sample sub-projects in course of
execution Bank staff have found the regulations, forms and procedures
currently in use of acceptable quality.
Procurement
3.13       Mexicos's construction Industry is highly developed and capable
of executing works at costs competitive with international bidders and none
of the individual contracts would be large enough to attract foreign
firms. Therefore, most construction contracts would be awarded through
local competitive bidding procedures (LCB) acceptable to the Bank. The
sub-borrowers (States, Municipalities, building cooperatives and community
organizations) would be responsible for inviting bids, evaluating them and
awarding construction contracts under FONHAPO's supervision.13/ Mexican
Federal and State laws controlling procurement in publicly funded programs
provide a satisfactory competitive climate but differ from Bank policy and
guidelines on certain specific aspects.14/ Agreement was reached with
BANOBRAS to follow procurement procedures consistent with Bank guidelines
on those sub-projects which would be partially financed with loan proceeds.
12/ During the first seven months of 1984, FONHAPO has funded 105 sites and
services and progressive construction sub-loans. During 1983, 79
sub-loans were made in the two selected lines of credit.
13/ FONHAPO emphasizes the rapid and efficient execution of sub-projects as
the best protection against escalating construction costs. According
to information provided by the agency, the average implementation
period of a large sample of recent sub-projects ranged from nine to
twelve months (Table 3, page 23). The agency expressed concern with
the time lag and price escalation which may result from tendering works
under LCB in some specific situations.
14/ The exceptions noted concern: (i) a tendency to keep advertisement
time to the statutory minimum in ICB tenders and the generally
inadequate circulation-publication of bid invitations; (ii) the
possible re-evaluation of the financial, technical, equipment or
manpower capacities of previously pre-qualified bidders during the
review of tenders; and (iii) the possible rejection of the lowest bid
on the basis of unreasonably- low pricing.



- 19 -
3.14      Given the wide territorial distribution of sub-projects, such
agreement would have a useful and diffused impact on local procurement
practices in different parts of the country. Therefore FONHAPO would:
a)  undertake a formal commitment to enforce fully congruent LCB
procedures in operations financed under the loan (which would
represent its largest and more structured initiatives) while
strongly suggesting their adoption to all Sub-borrowers;
b) use force account procedures, up to a 21Z share of loan financed
works only in situations where their greater efficiency and
economic advantage over alternative methods can be reasonably
demonstrated, and will supply such justification with the
submission of the corresponding Sub-loan Agreements for Bank
approval.
3.15      The adoption of force account methods (administracion directa)
for execution of part of the infrastructure works (up to an aggregate
amount of US$50 million equivalent) would be consistent with the Government
policy of progressive devolution of construction, maintenance and operation
responsibilities to local utility corporations. Furthermore, low-income
housing projects are often financed as part of the Emergency Employment
P,lan (PEZUC) which supports deployment of labor-intensive procedures.
Finally in many municipalities the sub-borrowers contribute directly a
portion of the investment resources in kind, providing self-help or
contracted labor, off-site infrastructure, construction materials or land
tracts to be developed.
Loan Disbursement
3.16      No Bank disbursement is anticipated against the purchase of land,
or external infrastructure which are generally provided by the
sub-borrowers, nor against design and engineering fees or project
administration charges which are typical local costs shared between FONHAPO
and the sub-borrowers. The Bank would disburse only against civil works at
the rate of 65Z of expenditures. Disbursements in respect of expenditures
under construction contracts exceeding US$500,000 equivalent would be fully
documented. All other disbursements would be against statements of
expenditures. It is proposed to establish a Special Account at BANOBRAS on
the order of US$8.5 million, from which the Borrower would withdraw the
peso equivalent of the Bank's share of expenditures made on eligible
sub-projects according to the exchange rate in effect at the time
disbursements were made by FONHAPO. The Bank would further withdraw from
the Loan Account to replenish the Special Account pari-passu with the
submission of withdrawal documents by the Borrower. It was agreed that the
Bank would finance expenditures made by FONHAPO after January lst., 1985,
as eligible for retroactive financing up to the equivalent of US$8.5
million, provided that such disbursements were made in accordance with the
criteria and procedures stipulated in the Loan Agreement. December 31,
1992, is the Closing Date.

Supervision and Monitoring
3.17      Given the territorial spread and the number of subprojects (at
least 100 would Include Bank financing), FOINHAPO would adequately staff
regional offices and comply with agreed supervision and monitoring
procedures limiting Bank personnel verification to intermittent control on
a sample basis. FONBAPO would forward to the Bank quarterly reports on
project progress and expenditures according to an agreed format. The
appraisal wission was satisfied that the supervision system applied by
FONHAPO is adequate (para. 4.07) and anticipates that Bank supervision
commitments on this project would not represent an extraordinary burden,
falling within the norm of 2-3 field mission per year. FONHAPO would
forward to the lank civil works contracts exceeding the equivalent of
US$500,000, which would be subject to ex-post review an a sample basis.
Review of contract documents would be carried out ex-post and ex-ante for



- 21 -
all contracts exceeding US$1.5 million equivalent. FONHAPO would continue
evaluating annually the impact of the project according to a program
satisfactory to the Bank, regularly forward to the Bank its monitoring
reports. The proposed key monitoring indicators are presented in
Table 5.24.
Accounting and Auditing
3.18      FONHAPO's accounts have been regularly audited by a firm of
independent public accountants acceptable to the Bank. The 1983 audited
report qualified the financial statements relating to the final disposition
of the old mortgage portfolio, an area of activity that win shortly become
immaterial to the financial statements as a whole (para. 5.04). With the
exception of the controls surrounding the collection of the old mortgage
portfolio, the accounting and internal controls are adequate. The records
are current and audit reports are presented on a timely basis. The
independent auditors would be requested to extend their normal audit scope
to include a special review of and a report on Bank financed disbursements.
The Special Account would be audited by BANOBRAS independent auditors.
IV.  IMPLEMENTATION ASPECTS
General
4.01      As already mentioned (para. 2.05), FONHAPO is structured in
several functional departments (gerencias).  Each of these departments
intervenes In different stages of the preparation and management of
subloans, according to the procedures established in FONHAPO's
Organizational Manual. The new structure of the agency is presented in
Annex II (Chart II-1). Charts IV-1 to IV-9 of Annex IV detail the specific
responsibilities of the various departments and their interactions. A
description of the cycle of subloan preparation and of the required
technical features of subprojects is given in the same Annex.
Planning and Budgeting (Charts IV-1 and IV-4 in Annex)
4.02      Every year, the Governuent appropriates to FONHAPO a certain
amount of resources, in the sector investment budget of SEDUE. Within the
month of September, FONHAPO's Planning Department, in consultation with
other departments, must submit a Program of Annual Operations which is
discussed first with SEDUE's budgeting authorities and then with SPP. The
budgetary request must specify FONHAPO's intended contribution to
investment through internally generated resources, the number and type of
units the PFnd proposes to finance during the year and the geographical
distribution of the credits under consideration. Eventual deviations of
the annual programs from the targets set In SEDUE's Medium Term Housing
Plan must be justified in light of the marketing experience acquired
(Monitoring and Evaluation Department), the current status of the pipeline
(Social Promotion Department), the operating results of the previous year
(Finance Department), as well as other aspects (Legal, Operations,
Technical Departments). The Planning Department also follow up on
implementation of the annual investment program, ensures its adherence to
sectoral objectives (as defined by SEDUE), and recommends to the General
Director any strategic changes that my be required.



- 22 -
Promotion (Charts IV-1 and IV-4 in Annex)
4.03      This is the main responsibility of the Social Promotion
Department, which makes the first contacts with potential Sub-borrowers.
The Department keeps the general public informed on FONHAPO's objectives
and procedures through field visits and the media, identifies opportunities
for local investment, carries out meetings with interested groups,
illustrates prototype technical solutions and financial schemes, and checks
out proposed project sites. It keeps a register of potential sub-borrowers
and holds the relevant information on file. Social Promotion operates in
close coordination with the Regional Delegations and can periodically
suggest to the Planning Department appropriate modifications to FONHAPO's
credit conditions based on the findings of direct surveys of the
socio-economic characteristics of target groups (para. 4.14).
Design Standards and Building Codes
4.04      The technical standards currently adopted In FONHAPO' s
subprojects (see Technical Notes in Annex IV) are economical for both
infrastructure and dwellings. Infrastructure specifications and levels of
service generally comply with the minimum requirements of local utility
companies, which do not deviate substantially from national regulations. In
the absence of local codes, FONHAPO has been adopting the mlnimum Federal
norms which are acceptable to the Bank. Dwelling design, layouts and
specifications mostly conform with SEDUE's tested prototypes, which are
generally cost-efficient and consistent Bank experience in low income
projects.
Progressive Construction and Self-help Activities
4.05      Different patterns of site development can be observed In the
ongoing sub-projects. In the first pattern, the beneficiary household
occupies its lot as soon as it is improved. The family erects a temporary
shack on the back of the lot, moves in, and undertakes the construction of
the house with more permanent materials on the front only later. In the
second pattern, a single-room, multi-purpose unit is built with durable
materials, in which the household finds shelter while it keeps adding on to
the construction. Finally, in other cases, the household continues to live
in the original rental premises elsewhere, until the unit in which it will
transfer is sufflciently 'complete".
4.06      The share of construction works carried out through self-help
labor also varies. In general it can be said that in 50% of the cases
the beneficiaries contract construction or improvement works to specialized
labor; for another 25%, there takes place a combination of self-help with
contracted labor; and only for the remaining 25% beneficiaries construct
the entire building themselves with little or no contracting of external
labor. FONHAPO estimates that a typical loan including 500 units,
generates about 216 temporary jobs over a period of 8 months, with an
average investment of Mex$80 millions.



- 23 -
Works Supervision (Charts IV-2 and IV-6 in Annex)
4.07      One critical role of FONHAPO's regional offices is to supervise
the progress and the proper execution of the works financed. The
Department of Operations Staff visits each sub-project monthly and records
the physical progress of the coostruction against the expected disbursement
profile. This information is reported to the Central Office on well
designed and useful forms, which permit close monitoring of the progress.
Implementation Periods
4.08      The construction  period of a typical Sites and Services
sub-project ranges from six to seven months (1983-1984 average for about
105 sub-projects). Tendering normally requires one to one and a half
months. Progressive Construction sub-projects generally take a little
longer, nine to ten months, with basically the same tendering period as
sites and services sub-projects.  FONHAPO's reports on physical progress
indicate that execution delays may take up to 20% of contracted
construction time. In its calculations, the appraisal mission adopted the
following average implementation schedules, starting at the tim the
sub-loan agreement is approved by PONHAPO's Loan Committee:
Table 3: Average Sub-project Implementation Schedules
Sites & Services   Progressive Construction
Tendering & Contract Award       1 to 1.5 months       1   to 1.5 months
Construction Q to Contract       6 to 7   months       9   to 10 months
Allowance for Delays             1 to 1.5 months       1.5 to 2  months
Implementation Periods           9 months average      12 months average
Advance Disbursement and Guarantees (Charts IV-2 and IV-6 in Annex)
4.09      Once a Sub-loan Agreement is approved by FONHAPO's Loan
Committee, and signed by the General Director, the Finance Department
issues and advance (up to 40% of the credit) to the sub-borrower who must
secure it by providing collateral guarantees. Sub-loan guarantees may take
the form of a real collateral, or of an affidavit ("aval") by the ttate
Government, which authorizes the Federal Authority (SUCP) to retain the
sub-loan amount from the fiscal participations of the State in case of
default by the sub-borrower. In addition the Sub-borrower must provide a
mortgage guarantee as well as pledge and trust guarantees.
4.10      The remainder of the sub-loan is disbursed on the basis of work
progress, as certified by the Department of Operations. The advance is
recovered proportionally from each successive payment. The final
disbursement is released upon the issuance by Operations of a certificate
of final acceptance of the executed works (para. 4.11). The Planning
Department keeps track of each disbursement made by Finance for control and
budgetary purposes.



- 24 -
Works Completion and Final Disbursement (Charts IV-2 and IV-6 in Annex)
4.11      When sub-project construction is finished, the Sub-borrower
applies for an inspection by FONHAPO's Operations Department which issues
the document certifying the satisfactory completion of all works (finiquito
de ejercicio fisico-financiero). Upon receipt of this document, Finance
pays off the sub-loan balance with a final check. The grace period thus
expires and the Sub-borrower initiates loan repayment to FONHAPO.
Allocation to Final Beneficiaries (Charts IV-2 and IV-7 in Annex)
4.12      An important feature of FONHAPO's operation is that sub-loans
become effective only after the sub-project facilities have been built and
a pre-identified group of buyers has been assigned the legal possession of
mortgaged premises by the Sub-borrower. FONHAPO controls this process
of allocation to the ultimate beneficiaries through the following steps:
a) Pre-selection: during the stage of sub-project identification, the
sub-borrower is required to carry out a study of the target group and
to produce a preliminary documentation with the assistance of FONHAPO's
Social Department Staff. A Cedula Socio-Economica must be compiled for
each beneficiary household and a tentative register of potential
beneficiaries is prepared  (Cuadro de Concentracion de la Demanda
Captada) which constitutes an integral part of the sub-loan
application. FONHAPO reviews and analyzes this profile of
socio-economic characteristics of the target group in view of their
family composition and the employment condition of the heads of
household and compares their paying capacity with the estimated unit
costs of the proposed sub-project.
b)  Allocation Plan:  prior to sub-loan approval, FONHAPO counsels the
co,munity organization involved and supervises the formulation of a
plan for the allocation of the serviced plots and dwellings to
individual beneficiaries: it controls the authenticity of the
information supplied by the borrower and verifies the legal validity of
individual household contracts. This plan must be updated as soon as
works reach the stage of 85% advance.
c)  Allocation Process:  Finally, the Social Department authorizes the
actual process of allocation after the final cost of the units is
determined and the financial a:rangements between the sub-borrower and
the beneficiaries are approved. It then releases a document upon its
satisfactory completion of allocation procedures.
Collection of Payments (Charts IV-3 and IV-9 in Annex)
4.13      The sub-borrowers recover sub-project costs from the final
beneficiaries through mortgage schemes, which include recuperation of
FONHAPO's subloan as well as other investment and administrative costs
borne by the Sub-borrower. Mortgages entail a 10% deposit and monthly
amortization payments up to the full amortization of loaned principal
amount. As part of its extension services, FONHAPO's staff advises the
sub-borrowers in setting out repayment schemes and collection programs.
This assistance covers three major steps:



- 25 -
a) Collection of Deposits: the program for collection of down payments
must be prepared as part of the sub-loan application. Actual
collection initiates at the nmment physical works achieve 85% advance
and is expected to be completed before the full credit amount is paid
out (upon FONHAPO's final acceptance of the works) and the repayment of
the subloan is undertaken; when necessary, the amount of down payments
is re-adjusted once the final price of the unit has been determined;
b) Collection of Monthly Payments: the sub-borrower must present to
FONHAPO a finalized plan for collection of mortgage payments from
beneficiaries as a condition for signing a sub-loan agreement; at this
moment suitable legal and financial arrangement must be in place,
including the specification of the legal remedies to be applied when
necessary;
c) Final Liberation of the Guarantees: before FONHAPO's Loan
Committee authorizes the final liberation of the guarantees and the
formal closing of the sub-loan (Finiquito Total de Credito), it
must be satisfied that the recuperation process has been
satisfactorily established.
Monitoring and Evaluation (Charts IV-3 and IV-9 in Annex)
4.14      The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit reports directly to
FONHAPO's management assessing the impact of the agency's programs (see
Annex VI). The reports are yearly and based on a stratified samples of
sub-projects and beneficiary households. They generally include the
following:
a) a statement of the evaluation criteria used in the survey, including
critical comments on particular aspects of the process;
b) the main findings of field visits and interviews, and a review of
the performance of specific lines of credits and sub-projects;
c) the evaluation of the impact of FONHAPO's lending program in specific
areas of the country; and
d) the global evaluation of FONHAPO's operations, products and impact.
V. 17INANCIAL ASPECTS
FONHAPO's Old Portfolio
5.01      Original Assets:  The original capital of FONHAPO as a separate
entity consisted of approximately Mex$8,448 million (Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 1981 in Table 5.1 of Annex V), and was composed for 20% of
cash and receivables, for 501 of a mortgage porcfolio, and for 30Z of land
and projects in process. FONHAPO inherited numerous administrative
problems connected with the latter assets. Many accounts due to FONHAPO
were from purchasers who withheld payments complaining that damages caused
by seismic tremors should be repaired. Almost immediately FONHAPO had to
start protecting the land properties against illegal invasions.



- 26 -
5.02      Land Properties:  The initial problems of title defense have been
substantially resolved and management currently maintains detailed records
of each property to periodically determine its highest and best use. The
financial projections accompanying this report assume all land will be sold
by 1992. The July 31, 1984 value of these assets was of Mex$3,360 million
(US$20 million).
5.03      The Original Mortgage Portfolio:  FONHAPO will incur losses
relating to the final collection of these accounts which at July 31, 1984,
were valued at Mex$3,411 million (about US$20 million). Unreliable lists
of payments prepared by BANOBRAS, the continued complaints of tenants,
costly repairs, and a standing FONHAPO's offer to deliver a clear title at
a 20% discount, all indicate potential losses. The Government recognizes
this fact and supports FONHAPO's efforts to divest these assets as soon as
possible by granting supplementary funds for the repair activities (Table
5.2). In practice, the Fund maintains separate accounts and a separate
administration (the Gerencia de Desarrollo Inmobiliario) for the activities
related to the original portfolio. Management expects to liquidate these
accounts within five years and a provision for losses has been recorded in
the financial projections in this report (Table 5.16). Not only will the
final disposition of these accounts relieve FONHAPO's management of an
administrative burden and clear the way for the new programs, it will also
remove all reasons for the external auditor's qualified opinion of the
financial statements for the last three years, which deals exclusively with
items related to the founding assets.
5.04      Relevance to Future Operations:  The possible defects in the old
mortgage portfolio should be viewed in relation to current and projected
activities. For instance, as of July 31, 1984, the investments in the new
program that began in 1982 were four times bigger than the old mortgage
portfolio (Table 5.3). Projected annual investment in the new programs for
1985, will be ten times the old portfolio. In 1985 the losses relaced to
-he old portfolio will be in the order of 3% of net income. The
cowlectibility of this old portfolio does not therefore emerge as a
significant issue in the appraisal of the loan program for 1985 to 1988.
TLe New Lending Programs and the Level of Government Support
5.05      For its new operations, FONHAPO depends heavily on Treasury
transfers. In 1983, this item represented 63% of the Fund's new
investments, which amounted to 7.2 billion pesos (about US$60 million at
the June 1983 controlled exchange rate). For the following year, SPP
initially authorized an investment budget of 8.8 billions pesos with
Federal transfers amounting to 54X of the total. However, the total
Government contribution was raised to 13.4 billion pesos with a
complementary allocation made in March 1984, reaching 75.1% of FONHAPO's
17.9 billion pesos of new sub-loans. Converted in June, 1984 dollars,
these represented about US$107 millions.15/ The 1985 Budget raised
Government transfers to 20.5 billion pesos (76.5% of total), to which
FONHAPO intends to add 6.3 billion of internally generated resources,
15/ See: FONHAPO, Programa Operativo Anual, 1984, p.25.



- 27 -
achieving an investment total of 26.8 billion pesos (approximately US$140
million in December, 1984 equivalent), which should result in the
completion of 69,000 units now in progress and the initiation of 98,000 now
ones.
5.06      Will the Government's fiscal effort to continue FONHAPO's
expansion be sustained indefinitely? The Medium Term Housing Plan set out
the ambitious target of reaching an annual production capacity of 200,000
units in year 1988. While the priority attached to the program by the
Administration is not in question, persisting inflation and fiscal
constraints justify some doubts as to the achievability of the original
targets.
5.07      Therefore the appraisal mission drew two alternative scenarios:
Scenario A, in which housing starts are levelled off at 100,000 units per
year with a gradual phasing out of budgetary transfers; and Scenario B, in
which the annual support of the Government is maintained constant Jin real
terms (the equivalent of US$100 million per year) and housing starts
achieve the expected volume of 200,000 by 1991. Both cases were analyzed
through a computer model (described in Annex V), in which a number of
assumptions are made as to the composition of FONHAPO's program and the
level of capital recovery in each sub-program. Before reviewing these
results. it is important to discuss the main features of FONHAPO's formulae
of capital recovery.
FONHAP0's Capital Recovery
5.08      Main Features:  As in all schemes of Mexican housing finance, the
monthly repayments of FONHAPO's loans are indexed to the variations of the
minimum wage. Moreover, the unit costs of the subproject facilities to be
financed must be contained within set multiples of the minimum wage
applicable at the moment a subloan is approved. Monthly charges are
established as a constant fraction of nominal wages and are inclusive of
interest and capital amortization. Loan maturity is flexible, depending on
the speed of inflation. Because the minimum wage rates are officially
adjusted to the accumulated value of inflation (once or twice a year,
albeit with some delay), this system has the merit of introducing some
adjustment in loan repayment, but also renders the prevailing credit
conditions in the housing sector difficult to comrare with those of other
sectors of the economy. A detailed description of FONHAPO's mortgage
instrument is given in Annex II para 4. The basic information is displayed
in Table 4. The amortization schedules for two typical subloans are given
in Tables 5.4 and 5.5 of Annex V.
5.09      As long as the minimum wage increases (in nominal terms) faster
than the applicable interest rate, most of the monthly payments go to
amortize outstanding principal, therefore shortening sub-loan maturity.
This rapid pattLen of disbursement and repayment is FONHAPO's chosen weapon
against escalating project costs and diminishing returns due to inflation.
In sum, the Fund's present financial scheme emphasizes the quick turnover
of capital and the relative affordability of housing solutions.

Notes:  Beneficiaries households are pre-identified by the Sub-borrower
during sub-project preparation; sub-loan conditions are then determined by
FONEAPO as follows:
a/  the unit cost of the sub-project (total cost including contingencies
divided by the number of units) is compared to stated price ranges ex-
pressed in multiples of the daily minimum wage prevailing In the
region; costs and minimum wages are updated to the time of Loan
Committee review;
b/  the percentage of total cost that FONHAPO will finance is 5% higher for
social organizations and cooperatives, than it is for institutions and
local governments;
c)  thus, the loanable amount (to Sub-borrowers) varies accordingly and is
also related to the unit cost of the sub-project;
d) the starting interest rate is again based on the cost of the unit; it
increases by one point above 11% for each 100 MW cost increment beyond
1600 MW (e.g.: 15% for projects with unit loanable amount of 2000 MW);
e/  all interest rates are adjusted annually by a 1.1 factor;
f/  monthly payments: these must be contained below the stated proportion
of monthly MW for different unit cost categories (1 NMW - 30.4 DNW);
>/ proportion of monthly payments to the 2.5 KW income ceiling for
FONHAPO's beneficiaries;
h/  the Sub-borrower begins collection of the 1OZ down payments from the
from the beneficiaries prior to the signing of the Sub-loan Agreement
as soon as works reach 85% progress.

5.10      Compared to the average cost of funds (51.9% p.a. as of April
1985) FONHAPO's starting interest rates of 9% to 15% p.a. are markedly
negative. The gap is somewhat reduced over the life of the sub-loans. As
the starting rates are adjusted yearly by 1.1 per year, the impact of this
factor is rapidly compounded because interest charges are applied monthly
on the outstanding principal, which is reduced through amortization
payments only at the end of the year. The spread between nominal and
effective interest rates thus increases quite rapidly during the life of
the loan and helps capital recovery. For illustration purposes, assuming a
given pattern of inflation and corresponding adjustments of the minimum
wage, the correlation between nominal and effective interest rates on
typical FONHAPO sub-loans would result as follows:

5.11      Expected Capital Recovery: For the purpose of this report,
capital recovery is defined as the percentage of loaned principal amount
that is paid off over time by the discounted stream of payments made to
FONHAPO by the sub-borrower. To determine the present value of future
payments, assumptions must be made on annual inflation rates over the life
of the loans and eventual deviations from the forecasted values will have
to be monitored. This approach appears necessary to evaluate the Project's
mechanism for the amortization of sub-loans which, as explained above,
indexes monthly payments to the current value of minimum wages, which are
periodically adjusted to the accumulated level of inflation.16/
5.12      Future Inflation Assumptions:  Table 5.6 and Chart V-3 compare
the historical behavior of minimum wage rates (MW) with the consumer prices
index (CPI), the construction price index for social housing (INCEVIS), and
the average cost of funds to the banking system (CPP). Expectedly, the
correlation among these variables is not stable from year to year, but a
remarkable consistency can be observed in their trends over time. The
inflation projections adopted as basic reference in the appraisal of this
16/ While the "real' terms results of this approach are possibly more
reliable, they are not immediately comparable with the average targets
of "nominal' cost recovery on other housing projects of the Bank
which a 1981 staff survey reported to be the range of 2/3 of investment
costs. More recent evaluations, made in real terms, point to
considerably lower results.

project are deliberately conservative and assume a slow and gradual decline
from 1984 values of -30% per year. To gain awareness of what could happen
under alternative conditions, a more optimistic projection was also
outlined at -45% per year and a pessimistic one at -15% per year.
5.13      Sensitivity to Inflation:  Using a computerized model of the
typical amortization schedules for FONHAPO loans (Tables 5.4 and 5.5) the
mission tested the sensitivity of the capital recovery ratio (CRR) to
different evolutionary hypotheses of descending inflation. This was done
for: (a) the individual loans of different types and vintages; and b) for
the entire project portfolio assuming given shares and investment profiles
for different type loans.
5.14      Under plausible circumstances (Scenario A.1), in which inflation
rates are assumed to contract each year to 70% of the previous year's rate,
and that corresponding adjustments are made to the value of the minimum
wage, hence of the monthly payments, the typical sub-loan made by FONHAPO
would yield acceptable real terms recoveries. Under the same inflation
assumptions, the returns on the overall project including sub-loans of all
kinds and vintages show a small positive balance (Table 5.12). This
virtual surplus would become progressively larger (and capital recoveries
correspondingly higher) under less conservative assumptions of domestic
inflation.
5.15      The approach presented above assumes that the pace of inflation
continue to decline steadily over the life of the individual sub-loans,
down to a chosen cut-off rate of 9% in year 1990, after which inflation
would supposingly level. Alternative projections were made, assuming the
rate of inflation to remain constant throughout the life of the loans
(Chart V-4). Corresponding results are obviously less optimistic, as shown
in Table 5.08 and this comparative summary:

a) inflation declining, or b) inflation constant, during the loan life.
5.16      Other Sensitivity Tests:  Some complementary analyses were
carried out to determine the sensitivity of the ratio of capital recovery
to variations of: a) the starting rates of interest; b) the factor of
yearly adjustment of interest rates; and c) the percentage of down
payments. These tests were also performed under two conditions: (i)
assuming inflation to remain constant throughout the life of the sub-loan;
and (ii) assuming different scenarios of gradual decline of inflation.



- 31 -
5.17      The results, presented in Table 5.09 to 5.11 and in Table 5.7
afford the following conclusions:
a) the sensitivity of Capital Recovery Ratios (CRRs) to variations of the
starting rate of interest is obviously high in both circumstances;
b) the speed of annual adjustment of the interest rate is siglificant (for
the reasons explained in para. 5.10) but their Impact is limited by the
brevity of the amortization period which ranges between 45 and 125
months; and
c) the variations in the percentage of down payment are not affecting
significantly the real returns on the Investment; in an environment of
rapidly declining inflation they make little difference as soon as
inflation hovers around 30% per year and actually induce diminishing
results thereafter, but it should not be forgotten that down payments
constitute a critical factor of liquidity for FONHAPO at the present
time.
5.18      In conclusion, the most critical factor in FONHAPO's oulending
terms remains the level of the starting rate. Any modification aiming at
improving cost recovery should therefore concentrate on this variable.
Financial Prospects of FONHAPO
5.19       If the inflation assumptions of our Scenario A.1 (a  -30% decline
each year, with a 9Z cut-off), are accepted as reasonable, and supposing
further that FONHAPO's overall program would level off to a production of
100,000 housing starts per year (e.g. at half the original target level set
for 1988 by SEDUE's Housing Development Plan), the returns from the
agency's new portfolio should rapidly reduce the need for Treasury grants
to a tolerable level (about US$50 million equivalent by 1988) (Table 5.12
and Chart V-5). Albeit decreasing, budgetary support would still be needed
up to 1991 because of the following reasons: (i) the high level of erosion
experienced on capital loaned in the initial years; (ii) the deliberate
decision to keep repayment terms affordable by the target group; and
(III) the maintenance of a substantial level of investment.
5.20      A sensitivity analysis, based on a slower pace of inflation
decline (of -15% per year), and correspondingly lower adjustments to the
nominal value of minimum wages, produces the results shown in Scenario A.2
(Table 5.13). In this case, Government transfers would still be on the
order of US$70 million equivalent in 1988.
5.21      An altermative projection has been run (Scenario B), assuming
that the GOM should decide to maintain the present volume of budgetary
support to FONBAPO at US$100 million equivalent per year. Under similar
inflationary assumptions as in Scenario A.1, this would permit FONHAPO to
achieve indeed the planned production target of 200,000 housing starts
(in 1991) but, in this case, the Government would still be financing about
23% of the agency's investment in 1992 (see Table 5.14).



- 32 -
FONHAPO's Total Program
5.22       Only estimates of the actual volume of future government
transfers to FONHAPO are available. The Medium-Term Plan for Economic
Development identifies this program as a cornerstone of its social policy
and of the Emergency Employment Scheme, but no specific price tag is
attached to this recognized priority. The only figures available are those
originally proposed by SEDUE in the Mid-Term Housing Plan 1983-1988,
setting out the ambitious physical targets mentioned in para. 5.06, which
now may have to be reconsidered in light of persisting fiscal difficulties,
higher than expected inflation, competitive public expenditures
commitments, and the unpredictable flow of future revenues.
5.23      The only reliable information that can be obtained at this point
in time is the 1985 authorized budget which is for FONHAPO in the order of
Mex$26,800 million (US$140 million at the December 31 exchange rate), of
which MexS20,500 (US$107 million) constitute committed Government transfers
and Mex$6,300 (US$33 million) FONHAPO's own resources. For the years to
come it is safe to assume that fiscal transfers (including the Bank loan)
are unlikely to supercede the 1985 volume and that any incremental
expansion of the program would have to be financed out of FONHAPO's
increasing pc:tfolio returns.
5.24       In Scenario A, which was adopted as the basic reference for
project appraisal, it has been conservatively assumed that during the
sexenio the yearly production of FONHAPO would level off at 100,000 starts,
a volume that the agency might achieve as early as 1985 or 1986. Should
this become the case, the internally generated funds from FONHAPO's
portfolio would progressively reduce the need for Government support.
Treasury transfers would represent a diminishing percentage of total
investment and could eventually be phased out as the agency becomes
independently viable for a production of the stated, constant volumr   The
detailed analysis of FONHAPO's pro-forma financial statements (Balance
Sheets, Income Statements, Sources and Application of Funds, Government
Transfers and Annual Movements in the Mortgage Portfolio) presented in
Tables 5.15 to 5.19, has been limited to this perspective situation.
The Bank-Financed Project
5.25      In light of the uncertainty on the actual size of future
Government transfers, it is proposed that the Bank participation be limited
to a strategic, but circumscribed portion of FONHAPO's Investment Program
which we have defined as the Project. According to a seven year projection
of disbursement and to the conservative assumptions made above, this means
that the Project's expenditures (including the Bank loan and the
counterpart funding) will be on the order of 1/8 of the expected FONHAPO's
onlending in any given year (see Chart V-5). However, when related to
Government transfers, the Bank disbursement may amount to nearly 25Z of the
external support needed by FONlHAPO to maintain a production of 100,000
units over the next four-year period (1985-1988). In this respect, apart
from the foreign exchange benefit, Bank participation in the FONHAPO's
program would help significantly in relieving the Government short-term
fiscal burden. Tables 5.20 to 5.24 display the basic information
concerning the proposed project.



- 33 -
Financial Rates of Return
5.26      Financial rates of return (IRR's) have been calculated for the
Bank-financed project as a whole and separately for each of the two lines
of credit which would be supported with proceeds of the Loan. Furthermore,
IRR's have been computed for typical sub-loans of different vintages at
constant levels of inflation (Table 5.8) and under varying rates of
inflation decline (Table 5.7). Calculations have been made on the
discounted streams of payments (real IRR's) and on the nominal streams
(nominal IRR's).
5.27      The Project yields a positive IRR (above 10%) only if calculated
in nominal terms, but the IRR is expectedly negative (by a couple of
points) when calculated in real terms (an inequivocal indication of the
need of subsidy). With inflation slowing down during the life of the
sub-loans (by -30% each year), the real IRR improves from an average -14.3%
on loans made during 1985 to -0.8% on loans made in 1988, and would become
positive thereafter. Results vary between -15.5% to zero on Sites and
Services sub-loans and between -11.8% to +2.4% in Progressive Construction
sub-loans. If instead the calculations are repeated assuming inflation to
keep level, the IRR's are correspondingly lower as shown in Table 5.8.
5.28      These calculations assume the equity contributions to have
zero opportunity cost for FONHAPO, which is evidently not the case for the
GOM. A true measure of the amount of public subsidy involved in the
FONHAPO program would need to account for this as well as for other costs
implicit in the running of the Fund which are shown in the Projected Income
Statements (Table 5.19). The proposed joint annual reviews of FONHAPO's
performance and investment programs would include these considerations
(Annex V, para I-a).
5.29      The foregoing analysis has been developed to illustrate the
financial and fiscal implications of public intervention in low-income
housing credit, and to measure the extent of its replicability on a wider
basis. The project would include a broader study (Draft Terms of Reference
in Annex VIII) under which similar analyses would be performed for other
and weightier programs of Mexican housing credit with the intent of
achieving an integrated picture of the sector. It is in tbis comparative
context that the operations of FONHAPO are likely to emerge as a useful
indication for system-wide improvement.
VI. ECONOMIC ASPECTS
General
6.01      The main economic benefit of the project, gauged by its lasting
contribution to national income, would be the flow of rental value
generated by the additions to the housing stock. Reference could be made
to other benefits, most notably to the project's impact on the level of
employment during a situation of generalized underemployment of the
available labor supply. By FONHAPO's own estimates, an investment of one
million dollar equivalent in the production of Sites and Services would



- 34 -
generate approximately 500 direct jobs during 8 months of constructionl7/.
These other benefits are not quantified in this report. Likewise, in
regard to costs, the only measured cost used in the analysis is the market
value of investments in land acquisition, infrastructure, buildings and
maintenance18/.
6.02      -Two alternative methods have been adopted for the evaluation of
imputed rental values. The first one uses the traditional approach based
on current levels of rent (sale prices) paid by the household for
equivalent units after moving into the project sites. It is based on data
collected in six existing projects developed with FONHAPO's financing. The
projects were selected so as to represent the diversity of solutions
encompassed by the program. The other approach uses costs for a "typical"
lot (i.e. the averages for all sub-projects implemented in the first
semester of 1984) and rental values derived from current levels of rent
paid by the target population before moving into the sub-project as
reported in the 1984 FONHAPO Evaluation Sample (FES) (see Chapter VI
Annex).
Costs and Benefits: Market Value after Access to FONHAPO Sub-projects
6.03      Table 7 below summarizes the relevant information on the selected
projects. In all cases, the cost of land is based on actual market values
and the quoted price includes each lot's share of land donated for
infrastructure and services. Investment costs equal actual costs as
recorded by FONHAPO and --for the reasons discussed in Chapter VI Annex--
without adjustment for inflation, taxes or conversion factors. In the case
of Sites and Services the estimated rental value is based on equivalent
sites with some improvements, typically a non-durable structure without
services.
6.04      The resulting economic rates of return (ERR) are rather high --
in the range of 16% to 26% per year. Moreover, the sites and services
projects have systematically higher rates of return than projects involving
the production of semi-finished or finished housing19/. In theory the
ERR's based on rental streams should equal those based on sale-prices.  In
fact, for the examples at hand they differ - but by an acceptable small
margin. In four out of six cases, the ERR's calculated with the sale
prices exceed those estimated with rental values, but only in one case by
more than 30% (project 003).

Alternative Measurement of Benefits: Rents Paid before Access to Project.
6.05       In this alternative approach (based on current levels of rent
paid by the target population), we consider the aggregate sub-project data
for all renters in the FES sample.  As measure of the increasing
willingness of families to spend on housing of better quality, we raised
the percentage of the budget spent on housing by one standard deviation:
this laises the share from 16% to 24% (calculated on the basis of the head
of household's income alone). The higher market value of the new umits
would normally be associated with an impmovement in the average income of
renters. To capture this effect we increased the average income of the
head of househo.ld by one standard deviation, from Mex$23,785 per month to
Mex$36,244 (a rise of 52%). With these upward adjustments the rent payable
per room in the new housing units (in mid-1984 prices) is estimated at
Mex$4,367 per month.

6.06      Expectedly, there is considerable variation among the ERR's shown
in Table 8, which correspond to different sensitivity assumptions
concerning the costs and the benefits of the project. However, and this is
the important result, the range of values and the direction of this
variation are compatible with the figures in Table 7 which shows that Sites
and Services projects have higher rates of return than Progressive
Construction projects. Under the preferred set of assumptions (A, a) the
estimated ERR for a typical Sites and Services project is 21% (the range in
Table 7 is from 16% to 26%). For a Progressive Construction project the
race falls to 17% (with a range between 16% and 19%). The juxtaposition of
pessimistic assumptions concerning benefits (C) and costs (c) yields ERR's
of approximately 1OZ for either Sites and Services or Progressive
Construction projects. In sum, this alternative approach to the evaluation
of economic costs and benefits of a typical unit in the proposed project
supports the previous results based on actual market values for six case
studies. It confirms the conclusion that the project has high and
apparently stable rates of return.
VII. PROJECT RISKS
General
7.01      Several factors could have an adverse impact on the successful
implementation of the Bank financed project or its expected results. These
'concern:  (i) the capacity of FONHAPO's present structure to expand over
time and yet to maintain the present degree of operational efficiency;
(ii) the availability of land sites of adequate quality, quantity and price
to permit development of FONHAPO's projects; (iii) the consistency and
continuity of the Government's housing sector policy; (iv) the evolution of
the general conditions of the economy and the market; and (v) possible
delays or shortfalls in beneficiaries repayments to sub-borrowers, which
would raise the level of implicit project subsidy.
Growth Capacity of FONHAPO
7.02      Will FONBAPO be able to sustain a continued process of growth,
without loosing its present efficiency? Undoubtedly, further expansion of
its operations is desirable for the agency to make a significant impact on
the sector, but this expansion can be only as rapid as afforded by gradual
development of its institutional base and by the extent of financial
support it will obtain from the Government. At present, the Fund appears
to be well organized and staffed for the present scale of cperations. Some
significant structural changes have been introduced last year to accompany
the rapid expansion of the pipeline (i.e. the new organizational chart, the
creation of the regional offices, the adoption of a series of operational
manuals and of new financing rules). The growing volume of operations
requires new processing techniques, greater computerization of records, an
improved system of information and intensified technical assistance, and
supervision and monitoring of the projects' impact.



- 38 -
7. 03     Special care must be taken to Limit the agency's involvement in
sideline activities such as home upgrading, finished housing units, and
supplies of building materials, which demand staff deployment and resources
not always proportionate to their benefits (para. 3.10 a)). Similarly,
political pressures or the ambition of extensive geographic coverage,
should not prematurely dilute FONHAPO's operations into an excessive number
of small projects (para. 3.10 b)). The technical preparation of sub-loans
and the reliability of cost estimates and implementation schedules need to
be kept up to standard. Finally, the future financial viability of the
agency will greatly depend on the rational management of its resources and
their rapid turnover. All these potential issues have been addressed in
the desiga of the Bank financed project and are the object of corresponding
loan covenants.
Land-Sites Availability
7.04      Shortage of areas with suitable pricing and characteristics for
low income housing development has traditionally plagued housing policy in
Mexico. To some extent, the origin of this shortage is political and is
rooted in the perceived opportunity cost of available public land reserves
which tend to be allocated to "higher- (but not necessarily 'best") uses.
The present Administration has focussed early on this problem and has
attributed to SEDUE special powers for the priority utilization of
unutilized public property for low income housing. It has also made
available to SEDUE a limited budget for advance purchase of land reserves.
To the extent that these powers will be used to support FONHAPO's
operations, they could go a long way towards providing suitable project
sites at prices affordable by its target group. In addition, FONHAPO
itself makes available part of its resources to Sub-borrowers to finance
land acquisitions. While land purchases related to Bank-financed
sub-projects would not be the object of direct disbursement of loan
proceeds, they would be recognized in respect of cost sharing to the extent
of 11.6% of base costs (approximately US$35 million equivalent including
contingencies).
7.05      Admittedly, there is the possibility of speculative (windfall)
gains resulting from future extra-market constraints in the supply of urban
land for low-income housing, specially in sub-projects built on land
previously owned (or expropriated) by the Government. To neutralize these
gains (and not to further subsidize the original credit recipients), the
Bank should encourage FONHAPO (or its agents) to price all project-related
land at market values.
Possible Policy Changes
7.06      Continuity of Government support is deemed critical for the
future of FONHAPO.  This involves three main risks.  First, the Government
could find itself in a position that does not afford sustaining fiscal
allocations to FONHAPO at the scale planned. It must be noted in
this respect that the extraordinary expansion of the agency's activities
during 1984, was permitted by a "strategic" (i.e. complementary) allocation
made in the month of March, which nearly doubled the resources granted
under the ordfnary budget (para. 5.05). A sudden contraction in the annual



- 39 -
volume of funds transferred to FONHAPO would not cause grave concern for
the counterpart financing of the Bank project, since the latter represents
only a portion of the planned 1985-1988 investment program of the agency
(para. 3.07), but it would affect its public outlook as a rapidly expanding
financial agent and the morale of its staff.
7.07      Second, it is quite conceivable that, in the future, the
Government may seek to obtain alternative financing for the FONHAPO program
through the banking system (e.g. from FOVI-FOGA), or through the devolution
to FONHAPO of some of the deposits in the payroll funds (e.g. from
INFONAVIT) (para. 1.21). This might involve the need for some changes in
the rules of operations of FONHAPO and some shifts in product and target
population. Protective covenants in this respect are included in the legal
documents.
7.08      Thirdly, the onlending terms on FONHAPO's sub-loans (para. 5.08)
have been considerably hardened only last year. While it is probably too
soon to assess the full impact of these changes on the market, demand has
remained quite high, which may point to the fact that no alternative
sources of financing are available to the clientele of FONRAPO at present.
While new alternative credit windows could be opened by the Government,
possibly at more concessionary terms, this risk is mitigated by the high
level of commitment the Government has accorded to the FONHAPO program.
This consideration also underscores the fact that a certain gradualism must
be used in the introduction of measures to increase the profitability of
FONRAPO's operations, at least until the time the agency's activities had
reached fuller maturity and the paying capacity of its target population
had actually improved.
7.09      The latter point is critical, when one considers FONHAPO's
statutory objective of serving a large target population of very limited
personal income. The purchasing power of this group has been eroded by
inflation during the last years and the threshold of affordability of
Government-financed conventional housing slid up to higher and higher
income levels, to the extent that 70X of Mexicans became excluded from the
benefits of regulated housing credit. A reasonable measure of subsidy to
FONHAPO could be accepted as long as its production remains clearly
targetted to the low-earning groups (para. 5.19).
Inflation and Minimum Wages
7.10      As we have seen in Chapter V, FONHAPO's terms of capital recovery
are closely tied to the minimum wage policy. This may be justified in an
economy experiencing high rates of inflation, where wages are not
automatically indexed and their adjustments often lag behind the escalation
of prices (as is the case at present). Should the Government be successful
in progressively reducing the inflation rate (and we believe the
conservative expectations upon which this appraisal is based are realistic)
FONHAPO's current terms allow for acceptable rates of recuperation. If, as
can be expected, the Government should gradually up-grade real wages to
reapproach historical levels, this would have direct impact on construction
prices, but would not adversely affect FONHAPO's capital recovery since it
would also result in proportionately higher monthly payments. Only in the
case that construction costs should rise much faster than minimum wages,



- 40 -
would FONHAPO's present formula become vulnerable. However, this
circumstance could be offset by the introduction of additional charges for
interest during construction or similar adjustments. A protective covenant
involving joint review of the terms of cost recovery for the agency by the
Bank and the Guarantor is included in the Loan Agreement.
Other Risks
7.11      Two risks usuilly associated with low-income housing projects
have been substantially reduced by FONHAPO's past and current practice.
Because of its experience in the field, it is improbable that FONHAPO will
face technical difficulties in identifying affordable sub-projects for its
target population (see Annex VI). And there appear to be no danger that
the demand resulting from a country-wide shortage of housing could lead to
higher income groups obtaining the facilities targetted for tie lower
income population. These risks are reduced by the combination of FONHAPO's
procedures for pre-identification of credit recipients (who are not
individuals but organizations) which minimize delays in effective occupancy
of the improved sites and by the active role of other financial
intermediaries for the higher income brackets.
7.12      Finally, the project faces one additional risk, associated with
the wholesale character of FONHAPO's lending. There is the possibility
that beneficiary households delay payments or fail to pay the intermediary
agencies (i.e. FONHAPO's Sub-borrowers). Because many of these agencies
are well established and often governmental entities, this would not cause
default in payments to FONHAPO whose loans are properly secured
(para.4.09). But it would, of course, lead to an increase in the level of
final subsidy implied in the project. To reduce this risk, FONHAPO should
establish closer monitoring of the collection procedures of the
intermediary agencies and enforce legal action against unusual failures in
individual repayments.
VIII. ASSURANCES
8.01      During loan negotiations the following assurances were
obtained:
(a) The Government would carry out a Housing Policy Study, and
discuss the study's conclusions and recommendations not later than
December 31, 1986 (para. 1.25, 3.06 and Annex VIII).
(b) FONHAPO would prepare and forward to the Bank, for comment, not
later than December 31, 1985 a technical assistance program based
on an evaluation of sub-borrowers' requirements and carry out such
program not later than March 31, 1986 (para. 3.12).



- 41 -
(c) Not later than December 31, 1985, FONHAPO would forward to the
Bank for its comments a program to monitor the economic, financial
and social impact of sub-projects. This program would be adopted
not later than March 31, 1986. The preliminary results and values
of agreed monitoring indicators wculd be forwarded to the Bank
beginning March 31, 1986 and annually thereafter. FONHAPO would,
by December 31 of each year, forward to the Bank for review and
comment, the proposed investment program for the following fiscal
year as well as the final evaluation of activities during the
previous fiscal year (para. 3.17 and 4.14).
(d) FONHAPO would, by December 31, 1985, furnish to the Bank for its
comments tbe results of a study of FONHAPO's medium term financial
viability. The recommendations of the study, would be adopted not
later than December 31, 1986.
(e) FONHAPO would adopt the Statement of Policy (condition of
effectiveness) (para. 7.07 and Annex II, para. 4).
(f) BANOBRAS would enter into contractual arrangements with the
Government providing for the transfer of loan funds to FONHAPO as
equity contributions of the Government and repayment of the loan
by the Government (condition of effectiveness).
(g) FONHAPO would calculate expected capital recovery on a yearly
basis for typical sites and services and progressive construction
subloans and would forward results to the Bank by March 31 of each
year. If in any year capital recovery, calculated in accordance
with agreed assumptions, falls below 50%, FONHAPO would take
appropriate measures to increase capital recovery to such level.
(h) The Government would monitor FONHAPO's economic cost recovery on
the basis of a formula accertable to the Bank and to exchange
views on the results of this calculation during annual reviews of
the FONHAPO program (para. 5.28).
8.02      With the above assurances and conditions, the project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$150.0 million to BANOBRAS for a period of 15 years,
including a grace period of three years at the standard, variable interest
rate.

LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
FONHAPO's NEW OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE
1.        The statutory objectives of FONHAPO are as specified below:l/
i)    to finance the following schemes envisaged in the National
Housing Program: (1) land reserves; (2) sites and services; (3)
progressive construction dwellings; (4) home upgrading; (5)
complete dwellings; and (6) production and distribution of
building materials;
ii)    to finance housing projects of agencies of the federal, state and
municipal governments, and of cooperative associations and
organizations legally constituted to build low-income housing;
iii)    to finance the purchase and construction of rental dwellings and
residential estates;
iv)    to request, receive and purchase land of any type of tenure; to
sell such land in order to obtain resources for financing
low-income housing and to constitute FONHAPO's own land reserves
for its purposes;
v)    to promote, support, and develop mechanisms which lower the cost
of housing construction inputs;
vi)    to make loans for the acquisition, construction or upgrading of
low-income housing;
vii)    to make loans for the supply of building materials, supporting
low-income housing construction;
viii)    to discount, re-discount or give out to be re-discounted credit
titles corresponding to operations consistent with the Fund's
objectives;
ix)    to guarantee the amortization and the payment of interests on
titles or certificates which may be issued through other credit
institutions in order to obtain resources to implement the Fund's
objectives;
x)    to obtain loans in national currency from whatever credit source
in accordance with the relevant legislation, ensuring that the
interest rate and other charges on its active lending operations
shall cover the payments due on its passive lending operations;

xi)    to promote and participate in research, technical or other
activities, related to the provision of low-income housing;
xii)    to support other activities of information, support,. advice,
study and promotion for the provision of low-income housing;
xiii)    to promote in general the improvement of the residential
conditions of population groups with lesser incomes.
2.        The sources of financing of FONHAPO are listed below:
i)    the active patrimony of the pre-existing Fondo de Habitaciones
Populares, according to the audited statements of December 31,
1980 (see para. 5.01 and Table 5.3 in Chapter V Annex);
iI)    the contributions of whatever type by the Federal Government,
Federative Entities (the States and the D.F.), Municipalities and
other public or private institutions;
iii)    the resources generated by direct investments of the Fund;
iv)    the income obtained from the transferred equity capital;
V)    whatever other contribution and flxed or movable assets which the
Fund may acquire under whatever legal title.
3.        The rules of operation of FONHAPO include the following:
i)    ensure the consistency of its lending programs with policies of
national/regional development and with local demographic,
economic and social characteristics, giving priority to
sub-projects located in areas or centers specified by the
Government;
ii)    allocate no more than 1OX of its resources to the Federal
District in the geographical distribution of funds;
ii')    require Sub-borrowers to supply appropriate social, legal,
technical and financial justification for each sub-loan
application, and demand a study specifying the characteristics of
final beneficiaries;
iv)    revise the marketing studies and financial projections prepared
by Sub-borrowers to ensure the economic feasibility of the
planned operations;
v)    ensure that sub-projects meet appropriate architectural and
planning standards and minimize the cost of the housing units;

Page 3
vI)     require updating of sub-projects investment costs (prices must be
adjusted to one month prior to sub-loan signature) and include
price escalation in the loan amount so as to minimize need for
later complements;
vii)    achieve the best possible combination of local contributions and
own financing;
viii)    supply technical assistance and management advice to
sub-borrowers for the preparation and processing of their
projects, and supervise works, providing consultants selected
from a roster and financing if necessary for these purposes;
ix)    require full documentation of disbursement of sub-loan proceeds
and request auditing of expenditures for works, supplies and
services;.
x)    review and approve sub-loan applications through a Technical
Comittee for the Distribution of Funds on the basis of
standardized procedures and documentation.
4.        Terms and Conditlons for FODHAPO credits (Table 4 and para. 5.08)
were revised In March, 1984, as follows:
i)    Cost Sharing:  Sub-borrowers must make a direct contribution to
the cost of investment, either in cash or In kind (e.g. land,
infrastructure, materials, labor); in practice FONHAPO finances
from 75 to 95 percent of total investment costs, depending on the
line of credit and/or the characteristics of the Sub-borrower;
ii)    Sub-loan Amount:  established in function of the cost of the
units to be produced, expressed in multiples of the daily minimum
wage prevailing ID the geographical zone where the sub-project is
located at the time the sub-loan is signed; there is a specified
range of units costs for each line of credit and a maximum
ceiling of 2,000 times the applicable minimum daily wage (In
January 1985, this unit cost ceiling was equivalent to US$9,364);
III)    Down Payment:  a*1  FONEAPO's sub-loans, except thowe for building
materials, require down payments of an average IOZ of the
principal amounts, which Is deposited at the begluning of the
financing period, one month after certification of works
completion;
Iv)    Monthly PayMents: established as a fixed proportlon of the
applicable miLn  um wage at the time of each payment (end of the
mw'th) and lncreased over time as the minimum wage is adjusted to
inflation; the percentage is established by PONHAPO in function
of the costs of the units;



-46-
CHAPTER II ANNEX
Page 4
v)    Interest Rates: charged at the end of each month on outstanding
principal amount; starting rates vary for the different lines of
credit and are adjusted annually by a factor of 1.1;
vi)    Amortization of Principal Amount: computed on a yearly basis:
thus the portion of monthly payment accruing to capital
amortization is smaller than it should be, while the balance
represents interest payments; this result is compounded by the
yearly adjustment of interest rates and creates over time a
significant differential between nominal and effective annual
rates (see para 5.10, Table 5);
vii)    Maturity: the maximum amortization period is established in 20
years; however, rapid inflation in the nominal level of monthly
payments may result in much shorter periods of loan repayment
(presently they vary between 3.5 and 7 years);
viii)    Loan Insurance:  there are two types of mandatory loan insurance
covering 75% of outstanding principal amount: one on the
amortization of the loan, and one against exceptlonal events;
ix)    Collateral: a sub-loan must be secured by a fiscal guarantee from
the Government of the State in which the sub-projects are located
or by other securities to the satisfaction of FONHAPO;
x)    Penalties for Arrears:  a charge of 5X per month is levied on
delayed payments; FONEAPO reserves the right to foreclose
sub-loans after a 90 days delay.

LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
TECHNICAL NOTES
Preparation of Sub-projects
1.        Once the interest of a potential sub-borrower in receiving a loan
is ascertained by FONHAPO, the next step consists in the development of the
studies necessary for the preparation and the execution of a credit
contract. Four phases can be distinguished:
a)  Identification of Sub-projects and Sub-loan Application:   this
includes the promotional efforts and advisory services described
in para. 4.03 of Chapter IV. During this phase, a first
documentation on the sub-project is compiled on the basis of a
standardized format. Various Departments of FONHAPO are called
upon to give their opinion on the technical, operational,
financial, legal and social aspects of the sub-project. Once the
favorable opinion of each is obtained, the application is
considered viable and the sub-borrower is instructed to proceed
with actual preparation.
b)  Feasibility Studies and Preparation of Sub-loan Documents:  this
second phase consists in the preparation of the sub-project
documents (technical, financial, legal and social). Preliminary
engineering design and studies are prepared. Occasionally, FONHAPO
makes a project preparation loan to cover the costs of surveys and
engineering drawings,/ but in the majority of cases, these costs
are borne by the sub-borrowers.  This process is iterative, and
may require two or three consultations with FONHAPO's
professionals. The legal aspects of land tenure, and the
Sub-borrower's criteria for selection of ultimate beneficiaries are
also preliminarily reviewed. This phase ends with the
authorization of the credit by FONHAPO's Loan Committee, which is
based on the amount estimated through preliminary costing plus an
allowance for physical and price contingencies.
c)  Final Engineering and Sub-borrowers Commitments:  this phase lasts
from 35 to 45 days, during which time the engineering drawings,
cost estimates and sub-loan documents are finalized. FONHAPO's
technical personnel then makes a field visit, to ascertain the
1/ Since the fund requires that engineering documents and working drawings
be signed by a professional, FONHAPO maintains a roster of qualified
consultants which it makes available to sub-borrowers on request. The
roster includes specialists in Urban Design, Architecture, Equipment,
Infrastructure, Building Site Organization, Construction Supervision,
Cost Estimates and Legal Services.



-48-               CHAPTER IV ANNEX
Page 2
congruence of the design to the topography and soil characteristics
of the site, its present land use and tenure situation, and the
availability of off-site infrastructure. At the same time, the
sub-borrower's representatives are instructed on FONHAPO's
supervision, monitoring and disbursement practices. It is during
this phase that a formal commitment is obtained from the
sub-borrower and the local utility companies for the provision of
off-site infrastructure, if this is not already available.
Similarly, the tenure situation of the proposed land-site is
subject to verification. In all cases, one of FONHAPO's conditions
for granting the credit is that the sub-borrower must produce clear
title for the subproject site.
d) Sub-Loan Agreement: the Sub-loan Agreement is formalized between
FONHAPO's General Director and the Sub-borrower, only after the
project documentation is completed in all its details and has
received satisfactory review by all concerned departments of the
Fund. To ensure compliance with effectiveness conditions, the
Legal Department pays a visit to the sub-borrower. The planning
Department makes the relevant budgetary controls. The Loan
Agreement is stipulated according to a standardized form, which has
been reviewed by the Mission and found acceptable. FONHAPO
requires that a contingency allowance be included in the loan
amount and discourages the practice of subsequent adjustments to
the loan amount for cost overruns. However, in those cases where
an adjustment to the original terms and conditions of a contract is
justified (whether due to changes in specifications, number of
solutions or loan amount) a formal application must be made and
meet with the approval of the Operations, Finance, Legal and Social
Departments. Prior to the stipulation of a Revised Loan Agreement,
the sub-project must be re-programmed in all its aspects.
Extension Services
2.        FONHAPO's own staff contribution focusses on two Stages of the
development of a sub-project. In the preparatory stage, it assists in the
creation of a Support Committee (when no social organization exists as yet)
or provides advice to an existing organization (for the establishment or
strengthening of a suitable technical cadre). During a second stage, that
of administration of the credit, FONHAPO's staff meets periodically with
the Support Committee to accompany and guide its relation with the
sub-borrower during the various phases of loan processing, and for
obtaining the services and infrastructure envisaged in the Loan Agreement.
Although FONHAPO is basically a financial rather than an implementation
agent, it considers extremely important to set up the initial structures of
the Support Committees, so that they can eventually develop into larger and
effective community organizations within which the future residents can
supervise and manage the credit themselves, solve all problems typical of
the settlement and promote social, cultural, and recreational activities.

Technical Aspects
3.        Land Availability.  In the =.Iority of cases the sub-borrower
already owns the land. Quite often, FONHAPO's financed sub-projects are
implemented on areas which had been acquired in the past by the State
Housing Institutes or by Federal housing agencies like INDECO.2/ In other
cases the site is acquired On the market by sub-borrowers and only rarely
it is the product of expropriation or re-use of ejido property. The lack
of adequate planning in the past account for the fact that generally, the
sites available for FONHAPO's programs tend to be located at the periphery
of cities, sometimes separated from the presently urbanized areas, with
poor access roads and scant, if any, urban services. ID time, these
problems will be lessened as the cities expand and the areas where
FONHAPO's settlements took place become mDre accessible and better
serviced. In order to facilitate the purchase of suitable sites, FONHAPO
makes available sub-loans for this purpose.
4.        Lot Sizes and Land Use:  The average lot size on the sub-projects
fin.tnced by FONHAPO during 1983 and 1984, was of 117 m2, with a modal range
of 60 to 200 m2. This plot size, which applies to both sites and services
and progressive construction sub-projects, is in line with recommended
standards and similar experiences of the Bank. Typically, some 2/3 of the
land sites are salable to individual households. About 10% of the gross
area is reserved for community facilities (schools, health and social
center&, recreational areas) which are improved through various ongoing
sectoral investment programs. The corresponding portion of the sites is
generally donat.d to the corresponding authorities. The rest constitutes
rights of way which are turned over to the municipalities.
5.        Infrastructure Standards:  As mentioned above, one of the
requirementi for credit approval is the formal commitment by the
sub-borrower to provide the needed off-site infrastructure, complying with
the specifications and levels of service prescribed by the public utility
companies. FONHAPO finances only on-site infrastructure, which generally
include the following:
i) streets and pedestrian walkways: levelling and compacting of
sub-grade for the whole roadway width, concrete curbs and unpaved
sidewalks; in some cases a compacted base course is laid out, with
or without asphalt seal spray (asphalt pavement is rarely
provided);
2/ INDECO, the National Institute for Housing and Community Development was
a public low-income housing agency, active from 1970 to 1982. After
1982, its activities were incorporated in the FONHAPO program. Its
actions included slum rehabilitation and the acquisition of land
reserves for sites and services and urban upgrading. INDECO financing
was often obtained through bridge loans granted by the FOVI program.
The conditions of the loans were similar to those granted by the PFV for
the least expensive housing type (VAIN). The total output of INDECO
during the last sexenio was on the order of 130,000 units.

ii) drainage of surface waters: open gutters are used as much as
practicable, with concrete pipes only when strictly necessary;
iii) sanitation: some type of sanitation is always provided, usually in
form of concrete-pipe waterbcrne sewerage with individual household
connections;
iv) fresh water: PVC is the material mostly used in the networks, which
always include household connections; ground reservoirs,
watertanks and electrically driven pumping wells when necessary;
and
v) electricity and public lighting: aerial distribution with copper
conductor wire and pole-mounted transformers are mostly used for
low tension networks; the same poles are used for the installation
of public lighting lamps.
6.        Shelter Standards.  The line of credit for progressive
construction dwellings (Vivienda Progresiva) provides funds for the
erection of dwelling units as well as for implementation of the
corresponding infrastructure facilities. The average size nf a start-up
unit, in subprojects initiated during 1983 and 1984, was of 38 m2 with a
modal range of 27 m2 to 42 =2. The covered space is generally divided into
a living room, one or two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. Construction
techniques are generally labor-intensive, typical of the regions in which
sub-projects are built. Materials also tend to be traditional: stone
masonry and concrete for the foundation works; bricks, cinder blocks or
wood for the walls; and concrete, asbestos, or zinc plate for the roofs.
Design layouts are elementary, mostly conforming with well tested
prototypes supplied by SEDUE, which in general result satisfactory.

MEXICO
LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
A.  DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPUTER MODEL USED FOR THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
General
The financial analysis, projections and statistical tables
presented in the repor-. were produced with a computer model that uses LOTUS
1-2-3 on an IBM-PC or compatible equipment with a minimum of 512K memory.
The modules are fairly complex and require approximately 200 KB of memory.
The model consists of three distinct modules. The first, the
amortization module, is a simulation of PONHAPO's lending practices, which
producea a monthly amortization table of a given FONUAPO loan together with
accompanying statistics such as the length of amortization, the internal
rates of return and the percentage of capital recovery, based on either the
nominal or the discounted cash flows.
The second module, the program and investment module, produces a
projection of FONHAPO lending activity from 1984 to 1992 and a forecast of
cash revenues from the mortgage portfolio which can be expressed In current
Mexican pesos or in constant 1984 dollars.
The third module, the financial statement module, produces
projected balance sheets and income statements from 1984 to 1992 and
contains historical financial statements since the founding of FONUHAPO in
1980.
Model Flexibility and Future Use
The user inputs provide for flexibility, allowing to change many
assumptions such as interest rate and relation of minimum wage to
inflation, loan size, etc. With a modest amount of additional work, the
underlying assumptions built into the tables of FONHAPO's loan conditions
such as the percentage of miniwmu wage devoted to mDnthly payments and the
starting interest rates may be changed as well. Also the model can
incorporate actual inflation rates or user supplied projected an annual
inflation rates for each disbursement year.
The basic conceptual characteristics of the model are described
in the following pages, Use of the model as it stands requires a person
familiar with LOTUS 1-2-3, although with additional work the model could be
made more 'user-friendly" for deployment by financial analysts with no
prior computer experience and could become a useful tool to unify World
Bank and FONHAPO's criteria in monitoring loan activities.
I.    Amortization Module
The amortization module simulates PONHAPO' s lending practices and
produces a monthly amortization table. A description of current FONHAPO's
lending practices is contained in paras. 5.08 and 5.09 of the report and



-62-                    CHAPTER v ANNEX
Page 2
will not be repeated here other than to mention that the interest rate and
monthly payment vary each year and are dependent on the original amount of
the loan and the periodic changes in the minimum wage . To calculate
discounted cash flows and expected levels of current peso lending activity,
the model incorporates inflation assumptions supplied by the user for the
years 1984 to 1995.
a.  User Input
The model requires the user to input the following information:
Inflation rate in 1984
Annual rate of change in the inflation rate
The minimum (cut off) inflation rate
Start year
Financed amount, expressed in multiples of minimum wages
Relationship between inflation and the minimum wage.
b. Computer Supplied Input to the Amortization Table
Annual inflation rate 1984 to 1985 based on user inputs of inflation
rate in 1984 and projected changes.
Size of the loan, expressed in multiples of minimum wages (escalated
by the computer supplied inflation rates).
Disbursement schedule, based on the current FONHAPO practice of
advancing 40% of loan upon effectiveness followed by an 11 month
disbursement period which is the current average disbursement period
for a typical loan.
From a data table incorporated in the model the computer supplies the
loan amount and the percentage of down payment, the starting interest
rate corresponding to the origina'. size of the loan, the yearly
percentage increase in starting interest rate, and the percentage and
amount of monthly payment adjusted yearly for the change in the
minimum wage.
c.  Output:  Amortization Table (see Tables 5.4 and 5.5)
The model calculates a monthly amortization table showing monthly
payments of capital and interest until maturity. In addition, the
amortization table calculates a cash flow discounted by the annual
projected inflation rate compounded monthly.
d.  Output:  Financial Indicators (Table 5.7)
Upon completing the amortization table, the model calculates the
internal rate of return and the capital recovery ratios based on the
nominal or discounted cash flows as well as the number of months of
amortization.
In addition, the model calculates the factors of annual capital
amortization and interest charges to be used in the program and
investment, and in the financial statement modules.

CHAPTER V ANNEX
Page 3
By incorporating the projected number of units to be financed each
year, a data table will supply levels of investment and the
corresponding statistics over the disbursement period of the World
Bank loan in order to evaluate the capital recovery on the project
and on the program as a whole (see Module II, below).
The Bank financed project contemplates participation in two of
FONHAPO's programs, sites and services and progressive housing, each
with distinct terms as to starting interest rates and level of
monthly payments. Consequently, the project data evaluation prepares
the key statistics of each component and combines them in a
consolidated analysis.
f. Sensitivity Analyses (Tables 5.7 to 5.11)
The module allows to produce a series of tables based on selected
values of all the basic inputs (starting inflation rate, rate of
annual charge in inflation, cut off rate of inflation, start year for
the loans, financed amount, relation between inflation and minimum
wage, percentage of down payment and pace of annual change in the
interest rate). It also allows to derive rates of return and capital
recovery ratios for loans of different types (sites and services or
progressive housing) and vintages (start years) and combines results
to analyze returns on the total project portfolio under varying
conditions.
g.  Interpretation of Key Indicators
The most critical indicator of FONHAPO's operation is, of course the
capital recovery of the loan itself. It is recognized that any
corrective measure to improve recovery would involve changes in the
basic loan conditions. Other cost factors, such as the complementary
share of investment directly contributed by the sub-borrowers or the
general administrative expenses of FONHAPO are not treated in this
model, but have been considered in the formulation of the project's
total costs (see Project Costs Table on page vi).
It is also recognized that the cost recovery levels of the loan terms
are discounted only for inflation and do not account for the
opportunity cost of the capital transfers that FONHAPO as a public
agency receives In form of equity contribution from the Central
Government. The model has been conceived for eventual use by FONHAPO
itself and is strictly intended to produce indicators for internal
financial control.
I-a.      Economic Variant of the Amortization Module
The Program Division has studied a variant to the Amortization
Module. This consists in the introduction of a formula-derived measure of
the opportunity cost of capital, which would permit to express the returAS
on FONHAPO's subloans in terms of market or shadowr costs (i.e. in an
economic mode). On the other hAnd, by zeroing the values of the variabies
introduced, the computer falls back into its unmodified version and
produces the original results (i.e. in the financial mode). The formula
proposed by the LClMX economist consists in the following:

(whe ..- _eo _=zh; L - loas; D - debts , deposits)
Zera-Profit- Coaditio&4--
(2) R (1 -a); - D   - %.R + L.CI             from UVich
(3)  R- m iD + R[rkT + CZ                    where
(4)  iD   (I + Rd) ( + dP) -                 and
(5) t - X (by definition)
The following parameters would be specified by the model user:
Rd = real opportunity cost of loanable funds
Rk = required rate of return on equity
1 - equilibrium debt-equity ratio
Cl - intermediation cost per loan unit
a = rate of default and arrearage
dP = inflation rate
The economic discount factor in equation 3 is simply equal to the social
rate of return to capital (Rk) when the debt-equity ratio is zero (the
intermediary does not borrow, it only receives equity or transfers),
provided that the cost of intermediation is zero and the rate of default
and arrearage is also zero. Alternatively, if intermediation costs and
default and arrearage are zero, and if the debt-equity ratio is infinite
(the intermediary funds all its lending by borrowing), than the discount
rate is simply the opportunity cost of loanable funds (equation 4). The
latter becomes equal to the (expected) rate of inflation if the real
opportunity cost of loanable funds (Rd) is zero. Hence the financial (cash
management) mode of the model is seen as a special limiting case of
economic mode.
II.       Program and Investment Module (Tables 5.12, 5.13, and 5.15)
This module imports the amortization statistics, for different
loan-sizes escalated by inflation and produces a projected level of loan
placements during the estimated seven-year (1985 to 1992) disbursement
period. By incorporating the cash flow from the mortgage portfolio and
other estimates of miscellaneous incomes such as supervision fees and
income from land sales the module estimates the level of Government
transfers necessary to finance the projected level of activity.
a. User input
Inflation assumptions used in the amortization module.
Projected units of investment during the seven year disbursement
period 1985-1992 by line of credit (sites and services, progressive

b.  Output
Average loan size and investment for each line of credit and for each
disbursement year (the model assumes FONHAPO stops loan operations in
1992, the last disbursement year, in order to evaluate post
disbursement portfolio recovery).
Yearly and accumulated cash receipts.
Yearly and accumulated cash deficit (Government transfers) or surplus
during the disbursement period.
Post disbursement cash receipts from the mortgage portfolio to
maturity in 1998.
Percentage of Government transfers required to finance the projected
loan activity.
III.      Financial Statement Module (Tables 5.1 to 5.3 and 5.15 to 5.19)
This module imports the project investment data together with the
cash flow projections and converts it into projected balance sheets,
statement of results of operations, a statement of yearly and accumulated
Government transfers and a statement of sources and uses of funds. The
premises used in these projections are detailed in Chapter V Annex B ofthis
report.
a.  User input
User supplied premises relating to miscellaneous income and expenses.
b.  Computer input
Levels of investment and cash recovery from the program and
investment module.
c.  Output:  1985 to final maturity in 1998
Balance sheet (Table 5.15)
Income statement (Table 5.16)
Statement of source and uses of funds (Table 5.17)
Statement of yearly and accumulated Government transfers
(Table 5.18).
d.  Interpretation of output
It is interesting to note that FONHAPO's operating expenses represent
approximately 3.5% of loan placements and are substantially covered
by its miscellaneous income from other sources. Barring anomalies in
the pattern of expenses or significant changes in the nature of its
operations as a wholesale mortgage lender, monitoring of FONHAPO's
operations can be reduced to close analysis of the discounted capital
recovery results from lending activities simulated in the
amortization module.

B. PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Income projections
1. Loans under the new bousing program
a. All FONHAPO loans to sub-borrowers are guaranteed by the Mexican
federal government.   Consequently, the projections carry no
provision for uncollectible accounts.
b. The interest rates charged are based on the current FONHAPO
regulations (Politicas de Administracion Crediticia y Financiera,
page 11). Based on the average size loan for each program as of
July 1984, the projections contain the following rates:
Starting   Annual
Rates     increase
Program
Sites and Services               9%          10%
Progressive Housing             11%          10%
Rome Improvements                9Z          10%
The loan terms provide for a 10% down payment and the nonthly
payments vary each year according to inflation assumptions. These
variables have been extensively analyzed in computer mDdels
prepared by Bank staff.
c. Amortization and construction costs
The amortization of FONHAPO project loans include the following
assumptions:
Inflation starts in 1984 at 60Z and decreases at the rate of 30%
per year down to a minimum of 9%.
Minimnm wages increase annually by a percentage equal to the
inflation of the previous year.
The monthly payments increase each year in the same proportion as
the increase in minimum wages.
Construction costs increase annually by a percentage equal to the
current year's inflation; on the average, 67% of construction costs
are incurred in the start year with a carry-over of 33% (at the new
costs) in the following year, except in 1992, the last year of the
program, when all costs of 1992 starts are incurred in 1992.
The down payment is received in the last month of the start year
and mDnthly payments begin the first month of the following year.



CHAPTER V ANMnx

2. Interest income and expenses
a.  Short-term investments
Under current bank regulations FONHAPO may borrow funds at
lower-than-market rates but receives market rates on any short-term
deposits. In 1984 FONHAPO's short-term borrowings costs were 152
and interest paid on short-term deposits is approximately 30Z. The
financial management of FONHAP0 proudly asserts that all
administrative costs are covered by this difference. As inflation
decreases, however, this margin between interest Income and
interest costs will decrease. The projections show this Income
decreasing from Mex$ 1,116,079 (72Z of net income) in 1984 to
Nex$ 189,000 (.5% of net income) in 1992.
b.  Constructlon funds
FONHAPO's financial management estimates that the interest income
earned on government transfers received before they are needed for
disbursements to sub-borrowers approximates 2.1Z of construction
costs.
3. Construction income
Management estimates its income for supervision projects will
approximate 2% of construction costs.
4. Sales of property
FONBAPO's inventory of developable land will be completely sold by
1992. Cost of sales will average 60% of sales, including modest
amoumts invested each year.
Expense projections
1. Personnel
The projections show personnel costs increasing at a rate equal to the
inflation of the previous year with the exception of 1984, 1985 and
1986. During these years personnel costs increase an additional 20Z to
reflect the costs of new personnel as FONHAPO builds its
organization and staffs its field offices.
2. Repairs grant buildings
The projections show repairs tO the buildings (received from BANOBRAS
when FONHAPO was created) ending in 1987 under the assumption FONHAPO
will be successful in its intensive campaign to dispose of these units.
3. Administrative expenses
The projections show administrative expenses increasing at a rate equal
to the inflation of the current year.



-68-             CHAPTER V ANNEX
Page 8
4. BANOBRAS commissions
The commissions BANOBRAS charges for processing collections from the
low-cost housing portfolio will end in 1984 according to FONHAPO's
financial management.
5. Depreciation and amortization
Depreciable assets, an immaterial item in FONHAPO's financial
statements, v.111 be completely depreciated by 1992. Because new
equipment requirements are not expected to be significant In relation
to program costs, the projections mke no provision for equipment
acquisitions after 1984.
6.  Old portfolio losses
FONHAPO's uanagement should not be held responsible for losses incurred
in the collection of the low-income mortgage portfolio received when
FONHAPO was created. Several buildings needed extensive repairs and
the computer tab runs of clients were unreliable.
The losses recorded to 1986 in the disposition of the low-cost housing
portfolio reflect the differences between the tab runs and the
accounting records and the up to 20Z discount FONHAPO offers an owner
to settle immediately his outstanding balance. These losses are not
material to the scale of projected operations.

LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
A. FINDINGS OF THE 1984 FONHAPO EVALUATION SAMPLE (FES)l/
Distributional Impact of the FONHAPO Program
1.        FONHAPO's projects are intended for low-income families who,
given their low incomes and independent employment relations, do not
qualify for credits from other public housing programs. Nonetheless, it is
realized that even the mDst affordable of FONHAPO's solutions, through
Sites and Services projects, are not accessible to the very poorest sectors
of the population2/. Table 6.1, presents the best possible match-up of
the available country-wide income distribution data with the information in
the FONHAPO Evaluation Sample (FES) of 1984.
2.        While 40% of the 1980 Census respondents reported incoues below
0.9 of the minimum wage (MW), the equivalent share for the FES is 24%. On
the other hand, 52% of the workers in the FES earned between 0.9 and 1.6
HWX versus 32% in the Census distribution. Admittedly, the comparisOn iS
fraught with problems, beginning with the mis-match of dates and the
difficulty of comparing data on head-of-household income (in the FES) with
the distribution of income between all members of the economically active
population (Census data)3/. The direction of the finding is clear enough,
nevertheless. The FONHATb program, though accessible to the large group of
workers in the lowest Income bracket, is primarily addressed to workers
with earnings close to, but not below the minimum wage.
1/ The survey upon which this analysis is based was conducted between Hay
and July 1984 by FONHAPO's Monitoring and Evaluation Unit. Special
thanks are due to Dr. Noemi Stolovsky and Mr. Ernesto Sodi for access to
this material and for the help given to Mr. Paulo Vieira da Cunha
(Consultant) in the interpretation of the six case studies explored in
this Annex.
21 A recent survey of self-help housing experiences in Mexico City
concludes: "In the past twenty five years squatter settlements... have
not usually hosted the poorest of the urban poor within them' (P.M.Ward:
'The practice and potential of self-help k.ousing in Mexico City', p. 182
in Self-Help Housing:  A Critique, London: Mansell Pub. Co. (1982).  In
a similar vein, a study by the World Bank found that Sites and Services
solutions are generally too expensive for the bottom 20% of families and
serve the upper segment of the groups that can afford them". (IBRD:
Sites and Services and Upgrading, A Review of Bank Assisted Projects,
p. 22, Washington D.C. (1978)).
3/ Note that: a) almost 17% of the EAP failed to disclose income data on
the Census; b) the real value of the KW was higher in 1980 than in 1984;
and c) the income of heads of households is usual'ly higher than that of
other members of the EAP.

3.         In this respect it is important to observe that the main thrust
of the Programa Financiero de Is Vivienda - the competing housing finance
program - is, according to the Census data, directed to the upper 10%
income distribution: a share which, in Mexico is reached with the scant
figure of three or more minimum wages. This group is not represented in
the FONHAPO's program. Note also that the distributional criteria of
FONHAPO's Sites and Services sub-program compares most favorably with that
implied by the output of INFONAVIT, the main public agent in the housing
market (Table 6.2 below).

4.     As shown in Table 6.2, despite the increased progressivity in the
allocation of credits by INFONAVIT (mainly the result of the enlarged
production of Sites and Services in 1983), 15% of the 1983 total was
directed to workers earning more than 2 MW. FONHAPO's equivalent share.
also shown in Table 6.2, is 9Z (in 1984). Moreover, and more importantly,
37% of FONHAPO's credit recipients earned less than the statutory minimum.
The INFONAVIT program does not reach this population.

5.        The foregoing discussion has been based on ii,dividual incomes.  A
preferred measure of either the affordability, or the distributional merit
of the progran would be the level of family income (including transfers and
income-in-kind). Indeed, the distribution (interpersonal welfare)
yardstick should ideally be marked in levels of total faaily income per
capita. Unfortunately, this kind of data is not reported in the published
Census material; and it is simply unknown in the case of INFONAVIT housing
recipients. The FES does report it (though curlously FONHAPO's own
allocational criteria also exclude measures of family income). According
to FES daLa (see Table 6.3), 75% of the families in the Sites and Services
program had monthly earnings below 2 MW. The lower quartile of the
distribution showed levels of income below or up the relevant regional
minimum. This is most certainly a situation of acute poverty, in this case
concentrated in one of the four projects analyzed in the FES.

6.        Variations in sample size and the very small size of some samples
limit reliability of the project specific findings reported in Table 6.3.
With this caveat in mind, the evidence shows that at least some of
FONHAPO's Sites and Services projects are tilted towards the upper range of
the low earning population. For example, of the buyers in project 91
(located in Quintana Roo, within a petroleum exploration zone). 74% had
family earning in excess of 1.7 MW and none had a level below the minimum.
Meanwhile, the fragile evidence of 11 observations for project 139 (in a
depressed urban area of the State of Aguascalientes) would indicate that
nearly the whole project is dir2cted to families with incomes below the
minimum.

7.        Table 6.4 summarizes the distributional characteristics of the
FES and its disaggregation at project level. The mean income of the
household head is 1.33 MW, well below the maximum level established for
FONHAPO (2.5 MW); the average family income is, expectedly, higher but
still below 2 MW. This figure is usually interpreted as the poverty level
for the family. The average per capita income is 0.43 MW, a surprisingly
low figure (approximately US$61 per month). In conformance to the goals of
the program, a substantial share of recipients are workers in the
informal' sector; that is, they are not employees. In fact, given the
earnings data, it is apparent that most employees are themselves workers in
enterprises which operate at the margin of the minimum wage, and perhaps
other legislation. At one extreme (project 139), 73% of the heads of
household are own-account workers with average earnings of 0.75 MW per
month, leading to an extremely low family income per capita of 0.15 MW (16
US$ per month). At the other extreme (project 152), the per capita family
income is nearly four times as lTrge.

8.        Other information gathered by the staff of FONHAPO indicates that
the majority, of workers in the sample could be classified as "semi-skilled"
or better, and many of these had factory employment. Most had worked
continuously over the previous twelve months, and while the data summarized
in paragraph 7 suggest that they were not well paid, there is indication
that they formed a moderately "privileged" and thus financially viable
group in terms of borrowing/repayment capacity.
9.        The data on Table 6.5, also suggest this conclusion.  The
majority of families lived before the project in units with access to
public services (water, light, and to a lesser extent drainage), built of
durable materials, and with access to Loth kitchen and bath. The most
notable deficiencies are the lack of internal bath (51% of the units used
before did not have them) and public drainage (32% of the unit without
access); and except for the latter case, it would not seem that the
"richer' households in the sample enjoyed a disproportionate share of the
desirable characteristics. In comparison to the national average as
measured by the 1980 Census, this particular housing stock is of higher
quality, though it is inferior to the average for Mexico City and other
major metropolitan areas.

10.       In sum, based on an evaluation of FONHAPO's own past experience,
it is evident,that the Sites and Services program is reaching its intended
target population.   It is meeting the demands of the low-income housing
market but not the poorest segment in this market. Within this spectrum,
the program allows for considerable divergence in income most noticeable
across projects;-and, understandably so, for FONHAPO projects are organized
around pre-existing groups or organizations with pre-established levels of
housing demand. The groups are not homogeneous, however. Therefore, there



-105-                CHAPTER VI ANNEX
Page 7
are significant variations in total earnings, household size and levels of
welfare at the project level. Undoubtedly, these deficiencies, if stable,
will be reflected in the uneven development of the sites4/.
The Household budget: Is FONHAPO's solution affordable?
II.       It is commonly assumed that a low-income family could spend UP to
about 20Z of its monthly income on housing. Less than 10% of FONHAPO's
beneficiaries were spending more than that share before the project, and as
it is shown on Table 6.6, practically none of them were spending (or were
planning to spend) in excess of this guideline after the project, though it
is important to note that the definition of housing expenditure is, in this
case, limited to the repayment of the loan and does not include building
and maintenance costs.

12.       Before the project, 22% of the recipients declared no monetary
expenditures for housing. For these families, the new credit will further
constrain the household budget.  Moreover, for the entire sample, the
average share of the budget to be spent on loan repayments alone is
approximately equal to the share of total housing expenditures before the
project. This means that total expenditures on housing (including the
piecemeal production of the new unit) will increase for the average
family. Yet, as we have mentioned, for the FES the average level of
expenditures on housing is typically low with nearly 60% of respondents
declaring an after-project share not exceeding 9% of the household 'budget.
Thus, it is safe to conclude that the mean household could spend an
additional 10% of its budget on housing construction (this would amount to
4/ The data in the FES do not permit a more detailed examination of the
life-cycle of the families in the program. Some indication point in the
direction of typically young fansllies who have not reached the toP of
their earning potential.



-106-               CHAPTER VI ANNEX
Page 8
approximately 2 MWs per year, on average, currently the cost of
construction is 27.6 MW per m2). The lingering doubt in an examination of
the ability (vs. willingness) to spend on housing, concerns the weight of
the other itpms in the budget, most importantly, food (Table 6.6).
13.       Returning to Table 6.6, we observe that nearly 30% of the
families spent only 40-55% of their budget on food and that no more than a
quarter of them, spent in excess of 55%. When combined with housing, the
two items account for more than 60% of the budget of 32% of the families
before the project, and 40% of the families after the project. Thus, it
appears that most families should be able to meet the additional demand for
house building funds. Indeed, the proportion of families with severe
budget limitations (i.e. spending more than 3/4 of their income on food and
housing alone) is relatively low, below 15%.
14.       To conclude, FONHAPO's Sites and Services program is affordable
to its target population even when proper account is taken of the required
complement of funds for progressive house building. There are however
indications that a minority of credit recipients (perhaps as many as 15%)
will face difficulties to meet the additional costs of construction. For
this reason (and considering that in the consolidation of a Sites and
Services project those factors, which relate to income and the creation of
an investment surplus at the household level, should be the most important
in explaining the levels of improvement that can be achieved) it is
advisable that supplementary loans be extended to the original credit
recipients, for the purpose of house building. The FONHAPO program allows
and presently encourages such loans.
Housing Conditions After the Credit
15.       The FES contains data on 20 households who had already built a
housing unit on the new, improved lot (approximately 30% of the sample).
Most of those who built are among the poorest in the sample: 45% of the
families who had built new units belonged to the lowest quartile of
income. The units are built in two projects, one finished in June 1984
(Rincon del Ramos, Aguascalientes, with 664 lots), and another still in
construction at the time of the survey (Chatumel, Quintana Roo with 430
lots). It appears that in neither case there has been as yet a substantial
gain in living standards, though admittedly the projects are at the very
early stage of consolidation. To a large extent this is due to the
maintenance of previous housing standards: mostly one-room units but with
internal kitchen and bath. Both projects are to be served by public light
and water, but only one of them will have public drainage facilities.
Though deficient in some respect, this pattern of supply maintains the
pre-project level of access to public utilities by the households. In the
decision to approve loans for Sites and Services projects, FONHAPO takes
into consideration the provision of basic (i.e. off-site) urban services.
This means that, as a norm, Sites and Services projects have standard
access to transport, education and health facilities. However, because
they are generally located in the periphery of urban areas, it is expected
that residents will have longer trips to work, shopping and recreation.

B. NOTES ON THE MEASUREMENT OF COSTS AND BENEFITS
1.        In evaluating costs and benefits, we have focused on the changes
in total consumption (or net value added) which are likely to result from
the proposed project. Costs and benefits have been measured in domestic
market prices. The goods and services involved are for the most part
non-tradeable. When tradeable, as in the case of steel, the quantities
consldered would not affect significantly the foreign balance. Therefore,
the introduction of either border pricing or of appropriate conversion
factors would unnecessarily complicate an already complex valuation
problem. Note further that no deduction has been made for the Value Added
Tax (IVA), which normally is charged On all final sales. By law, purchases
for the production of Social Interest Housing (VIS) are exempt from this
tax, which does not appear in FONHAPO's own accounting costs. Shadow
prices, applicable only to unskilled labor which constitutes a minor
fraction of total construction costs, were judged not to have a major
impact on the rates of return and were not considered.
2 .       For the calculation of the ERRs it has been assuxed that the new
stock lasts for 25 years from the date the project begun. A yearly
allowance of 1Z of total construction costs has been made for maintenance,
with uniform incidence for the first 10 years following the completion of
the unit. The residual value of stock and land at the end of the project
cycle has been ignored. Since all housing is progressively built, the
following conventions were used in the analysis of the typical unit in the
standard project: (a) the unit was defined as a 3-room construction (each
room with 12 m2) progressively built in the case of Sites and Services
projects, or delivered 'finished' in the case of start-up dwellings (with a
total construction area of 40.50 m2); (b) data on costs provided by FONHAPO
were based on the first semester 1984 averages. Accordingly, the cost per
m2 of construction was established at Mex$16,371; the market price of a
standard lot with 11.80 m2 at Mex$56,813 and the cost of urbanization at
Mex$l,278 per m2; (c) since no account could be taken of differences in
construction costs and/or in layouts favored by own account builders, both
of. which would result in additional benefits for the units, we have assumed
equal imputed rent for both the -finished' start-up units (with 40.50 m2)
and the 'finished" self-constructed unit (with 36.00m2); and (d) a cash
flow sequence defined as shown in the following Table 6.7.
3.        Given the difficulties In imputing a market price to a product
that does not yet exist and is not easily compared to others, the
measurement of future streams of rental values is fraught with problems.
And, in this case, the task is further complicated for the project does not
involve the production of standardized, ready-to-market units. Rather, the
units are to be built progressively and the price of half a bouse is
probably not equal to one-half the price of a finished house. Moreover, it
is one of the merits of this project, that houses are to be produced in
accordance to the tastes, willingness and capabilities of the families
involved. Thus, in this case, the estimate of Imputed rental Values
requires additional assumptions to current practice.

4.     More than one half of the household covered by the FONHAPO
Evaluation Sample (Annex II B) were previously renters (see Table 6.8 below
and Table 8 in Chapter VI). Of these, approximately one half used to rent
finished units and only one third, finished units including bath and
kitchen. Curiously, renters of the nore endowed units used to pay lower
rents per room - a result that may reflect the increasing instability of
the samples (due to their small sizes) and/or the possibility that
"finished units" are in fact dilapidated and rent-controlled portions of
the stock. Note that according to the FONHAPO Evaluation Sample, average
income decline as quality supposedly "improves" when, in fact, one would
expect the opposite to occur.
ERR Sensitivity Analysis
5.        Concerning the economic benefits of the project, in addition to
the preferred set of assumptions (termed A) in Table 8 on page 36, two
other sets were considered: B) a sensitivity experiment supposing a 25%
reduction in the imputed rental value implied by the assumptions in set A);
and C) the value which results from combining the use of the average income
reported in the first row of Table 6.2 with a one standard deviation
increases in the share of the head's income to be spent for rent. Set C)
depicts the following simulation: on the one hand, a greater willingness
of households to spend income on housing because they are purchasing
(building) a home of their own (which leads to an increase in the share of
housing expenditures in the household budget); on the other hand, set C)
supposes that households are incapable of raising their income levels over
time (which leads to their building a unit without market improvement in
quality with respect to their previous situation(*).
6.        Concerning the economic costs of the project, two alternatives
are explored in Table 8. For Sites and Services projects, under
alternative a) the share of adm-iinistration costs (and the implicit profit
margin of commercial builders) in total project costs are deducted from the
construction investments. According to FONHAPO's practice, this share is
usually set at 30% of total investment costs. Alternative b) corresponds
to full cost pricing on the assumption that self-built practices are
uncommon and do not amount to a large share of total construction costs.
For Progressive Construction projects, alternative a) assumes a one-year
production cycle which in fact over-estimates current FONHAPO experience.
Alternative b), in this case, presumes a conservatively long, two-year
project cycle.
() The income reported in Table 7 (page 35) is that of the head of
household only. Considering total family income, the average FES
household spends a below-average share of the budget for housing. Thus
the assumption of an increased share could be realistically met even
with stable incomes.

MEXICO
LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE: MEXICO HOUSING FINANCE SECTOR STUDY
Issues in the Housing Finance System of Mexico
1.        The three main questions facing the housing finance system of
Mexico at present are:
a) How well is the system adjusting to the current period of high
inflation and reduced economic activity?
The current housing finance system of Mexico has been developed
incrementally in an environment of considerably lower inflation than
at present and the resource base of the sector has been seriously
eroded by inflation since 1979, dramatically so since 1982. In early
1984, the Government has taken three major decisions: it has
reorganized the public institutional framework, it has increased the
allocation of resources to housing, and it has changed the onlending
conditions of the publicly sponsored agencies in the housing market.
The adjustment of lending conditions to inflation has been only
partial and it has not covered all major housing finance
institutions. There are therefore two unanswered questions regarding
the current transition: first, will the variable rate mortgages
recently designed lead to a more complete adjustment and full capital
recovery as inflation declines; second, how quickly and with what
kinds of mortgage instruments is it possible to improve the various
payroll funds such as INFONAVIT which have yet to make the necessary
operational adjustments to their new economic environment.
b) What are the possible avenues for increasing the coordination of the
variety of financial institutions intervening in the housing sector?
The Bank's public housing sector report (*) shows the complexity of
the housing finance system of Mexico and its fragmented nature.
Simplifying somewhat, the Mexican housing finance system is based on
three distincts approaches which have led to the emergence of three
differential sub-systems most clearly distinguishable by the sources
of their funds: (a) the banking sector; (b) the special housing
funds financed by payroll taxes; and (c) the public housing programs
financed through Government equity and budgetary allocations.
Flow of funds information on the total housing finance system that is
comprehensive and up to date is not readily available. During the
period 1977-1981 the total amount of annual housing financing
available was of the order of US$1.8 billion. The composition of
(*) Public Housing Policy in Mexico, Urban Sector Report No. 4993-ME (Green
Cover) IBRD, June 1984.



-112-         ~~CHAPTER VIII ANN~EX
-112-              Page 2
total housing finance resources was approximately 24% from the
banking sector, 63% from the housing funds and about 13% from
Government programs. The various social housing programs which cut
across the three sources of funds accounted for little over one half
of total sector resources. In 1984, the housing sector received a
high level of priority in order to stimulate the economy and to
soften the impact of the economic crisis on middle and low income
households. The total amount of resources earmarked for housing was
US$2.7 billion with a planned composition of financing as follows:
45% banking sector, 40% housing funds 15% public programs.
c)  What kind of actions are possible to improve the availability of
housing finance to an increasing proportion of the Mexican
population?
All the evidence points to a rapidly growing demand for housing
fueled by population growth and urbanization over the next two
decades, and housing has been defined as a priority sector in
Mexico. On the other hand, the need to restore the strength of the
economy dictates that national priority be given to raising the level
of domestic savings and to increasing the efficiency of the existing
productive system. In the case of housing, such national priorities
imply that attention be given first to capital recovery and the
ability of financial institutions to expand their program in a
sustained and viable way without requiring external injections of
scarce financial resources. Increasing the efficiency of the housing
finance system also means serving a wider proportion of the Mexican
households. Therefore a review and technical analysis of the current
situation is necessary on three fronts:  resource mobilization for
housing finance; lending policies and lending instruments; an
evaluation of the structure of the present system and of coordination
requirements, including smn examination of the support facilities
already in place or needed such as deposit insurance, mortgage
insurance, refinancing facilities.
2.        It should be noted that this study's priority is on the
improvemtnt of the financial institutions serving housing but that the
Mexican informal sector is very large. The growth of the informal sector
is due for a significant part to non-financial constraints which should be
the object of another study. The main area of overlap lies in improving
access to financing for low and middle-income households through improved
lending policies.
Objectives of the Study
3.        The objectives of the study are:
a) to describe in a comprehensive manner the current structure of the
Mexican housing finance system and the various institutions which
make up that system;



CHAPTER VIII ANNEX
-113-                Page 3
b) to inventory and analyze the financial instruments that are presently
available to finance the various phases of the development process;
c) to provide an evaluation of the performance of the various
institutional components of the housing finance system: efficiency
in resource mDbilization, capacity to adjust to the current
inflationary environment, ability to finance various household income
groups;
d) to propose possible strategies for the evolution of the housing
finance system (instruments, institutions) which could improve its
contribution to national savings, increase the coordination and
efficiency of rhe system in an inflationary environment and make
financing available to a higher proportion of Mexican households,
particularly middle and low income households. These strategic
proposals would cover both financial instruments and institutional
interactions.
An Illustrative Outline
4.        The outline which follows is not meant to represent the final
structure of the report, rather it is intended to be a vehicle for the
determination of the scope of study, for the clearer identification of the
technical work to be performed and as a means to determine the allocation
of tasks among participants.
Part I. CONTEXT
5.        This section should draw as much as possible from existing
sources. It should cover:
(i) The Housing Sector
a) income and housing in the 1980s: an overview of the sources of income
growth in the past decade, a close analysis of these sources and a
forecast of income growth;
b)  price of housing and tenure choice in the 1980s: demographic trends,
household formation and impact on housing prices. Balance between
formal and informal housing;
c) housing production in the 1980s: distinction between residential and
non-residential construction; analysis of the statistical record by
type of units and by local housing markets; projection of the
composition of output in the 1980s.
(ii) The Housing Finance Institutions and Windows:
a) an overview of the banking sector in Mexico and latest trends;
b) the Banking sector, FOVI-FOGA;
c) the housing funds: complete inventory description of major types;
d) public programs (such as FONHAPO).

Page 4
Part II. EVALUATION
6.        Housing Finance and Housing Demand:  The Broider Issues
a) financing housing: is the cost of financing housing out of line with
costs of financing other investments or activities?
b) inflation, nominal interest rates and housing demand: cash flow and
affordability problems created by high levels of inflation and
fluctuating interest rates.
7.        Current Financial Instruments:  Description and evaluation.  The
objective of this section would be to establish the extent to whicbs
identical borrowers may be fs:ing widely different financing according to
sources and the degree of consistent pricing fir essentially identical
household characteristics and/or housing units. Given tht: fragmented
institutional structure of Mexico, another question to be addressed in this
section is how households who have been successful in financing their house
might be combining loans from different sources and what the impact of such
multiple borrowing might be on their income cash flow and credit risk.
It would cover:
a) types of financing for various real estate development activities
(land acquisition, construction, long term finance);
b) variations in financial terms offered by various institutions.
Performance of the Various Institutions
8.        In spite of the magnitude of the task, it would Se very important
for the study to have maximum coverage of all the institutions and agencies
financing housing. Since the comparison of financial terms offered to
borrowers will have been performed in the earlier section the focus of this
section would be on three major issues:
a) sources of funds and mobilization of Fe-ings;
b) volume, types of loans and borrowers;
c) capital recovery and financie: viability.
9.        The performance of the major individual institutions within each
of the three components of the present housing fi.nance system (banking
sector, housing funds, and government-firanced programs) will be evaluated.
Part III. RECOMMENDATIONS
10.       As noted earlier, the three major issue. facing the Mexican
Housing Finance system at present are: its degree of adaptation to high
levels of inflation, effective coordination mechanisms and reduced
fragmentation of the institutional structure; improved access to financing
on the part of households. Recommendation regarding the system will cover
two major parts: improvement of the financial instruments and
institutional improvement.

11.       Improvements of financial instruments:  this section should
discuss several important facts of the "mortgage menu problem" in Mexico,
i.e. the needs of the borrowers (inflation and the "tilt problem"), the
needs of the lenders (maturity matching, profitability and capacity to
expand) and the needs of the long-term investors (capital recovery,
inflation and interest levels, credit risk, call protection, etc.).
a) policies toward adjustments to inflation (adjusting without
comprehensive indexing);
b) interest rates;
c) types of financing needed for various components of the housing
sector (land, development, construction finance, mortgage finance).
12.       Institutional improvements and  financial viability:  more uoney
less important than its better use, especially in the housing funds;
systemic issues of institutional coordinations in Mexico:
-   money and capital market constraints (competing claims on financial
savings);
-   improvement of institutional set-up missing institutional mechanims?
-   non-financial constraints (land, legalizatien, standards and
controls) for the record only.
13.       Strategies for housing finance:
