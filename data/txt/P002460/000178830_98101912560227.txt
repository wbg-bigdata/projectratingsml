SOMALI DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      Somalia with a land area of 637,000 km2 lies in the northeastern
corner of Africa bordered by Ethiopia on the west, Kenya on the south, the
Indian Ocean to the East and the Gulf of Aden to the North (Map IBRD 15924R).
The terrain is mostly plateau and steppes gradually sloping from the Ethiopian
highlands toward the coastlines. In the northern part, the relief is broken by
some steep escarpments; in the south, there is a relatively broad coastal plain.
Apart from the escarpments, the terrain does not pose serious difficulties for
land transport. Most of the country is arid to semi-arid. The areas more
favored with rainfall and, therefore, of greatest agricultural potential are the
northwest and the south.
1.02      The population of Somalia is estimated to be 4.6 million (1982) with a
high average annual growth rate of 2.4%. In addition, there is a large number
of refugees, now estimated to be over 0.5 million. The population is unevenly
distributed; the highest concentration is in the southern part around the
capital, Mogadishu, and in the basins of the Juba and the Shabele rivers. In
the northern part, the main population concentration is around Hargeisa, the
second largest city. About 80% of the population lives in rural areas and most
of them are nomads.
1.03      Somalia's economy is based on livestock and agriculture.  In 1978,
livestock, agriculture and forestry accounted for more than 60% of the gross
national product (GNP), industry about 7%, transport 5%, and trade and services
accounted for the balance. Livestock and associated products are the main
exports accounting for more than 75% of export earnings. The only other impor-
tant export is bananas, grown near the southern coast; in recent years, bananas
have contributed about 10% of the annual export earnings. Livestock and agri-
culture will continue to dominate the economy. Areas of most potential for
agricultural development are the Bay region and the basins of the Juba and
Shabele rivers in the south and the West Galbeed region in the north.
1.04      In the period 1972-1980, GNP is estimated to have grown at a rate of
about 2.8% per year in constant prices. Per capita GNP was estimated at US$280
in 1981 making Somalia one of the poorest countries in the world. The country
is presently in the midst of a deep economic and financial crisis. The
productive sectors of the economy have grown considerably slower than the
service sectors, causing a stagnation in production and exports. Increasing
budget deficits and a steeply rising rate of inflation have been coupled with a
sharply worsening balance of payments position. The economic situation has been
reflected in inadequate funding of road maintenance operations (para. 2.19); it
has also caused a strain on new capital investments, calling for priorities to
be accorded to those projects which preserve past investments.



2-
B. The Transport System
1.05      Transport infrastructure of Somalia is composed of about 21,600 km of
roads, consisting mainly of dry-weather roads with only 2,460 km of bituminous
paved roads; three principal ports; and fifteen airfields, four of which have
paved runways. There are no railways, pipelines or inland waterways.
1.06      Road transport is by far the principal means of internal transport.
However, animal transport--camels and donkeys--is also an important means of
transport, the former over long distances (carrying an average load of 100 kg
over an average distance of 30 km per day) and the latter for small loads within
urban areas and their environs. Despite a coastline of about 3,000 km, one of
the longest on the continent, coastal shipping has had a very limited signifi-
cance so far, although it has some potential. Internal air transport is
provided by Somali Airlines (SA) operating with five aircraft.
Highways
1.07      Details of the highway sub-sector are given in Chapter II.
Ports and Shipping
1.08      Somalia has three major ports:  Berbera in the north on the Gulf of
Aden and Mogadishu and Kismayo in the south on the Indian Ocean. The Somali
Ports Authority (SPA), created in 1962 as an autonomous Government agency under
the authority of the Ministry of Marine Transport and Ports (MMTP), is responsi-
ble for the operation and maintenance of these ports as well as a small port at
Merca. All of them, except Merca, have sheltered deepwater facilities. The
ports rely on ships' gear for general cargo loading and unloading. Mogadishu is
the main port, handling most of Somalia's export/import traffic (58% in 1981).
The ports of Berbera and Kismayo are mainly for the export of livestock and
bananas, respectively. Merca, a lighterage port, exported bananas in the past
but has been virtually inactive since 1978 as a result of the diversion of
banana traffic to Mogadishu port after the latter's extension and improvement in
1977.
1.09      Traffic in Mogadishu port exceeds its present capacity (600,000 tons
of general cargo). In the period 1975-80, traffic in the port increased by
14.6% annually due to rapid increases in imports of dry cargo and of petroleum,
while Berbera port had only a moderate annual growth of 4%; Kismayo, the third
largest port, experienced an annual traffic decline of about 4%. In 1981, total
traffic (in tons) in the three ports was as follows: Mogadishu, 577,000;
Berbera, 271,000; Kismayo 119,000. As a result of increases in traffic, the
ports of Mogadishu and Berbera require expansion. Accordingly, at Mogadishu, a
general cargo berth is under construction and at Berbera two new berths are
expected to be built beginning in 1981 or 1982. Berthing facilities in Kismayo
are sufficient but in urgent need of rehabilitation which is included in the
1982-86 development plan (para. 1.18).
1.10      SPA seems to be better organized than other agencies in the sector.
Currently, about 20 Somalis are being trained abroad (with Arab Fund and ECC
assistance) to become naval/shipping engineers, navigators, etc. Financial



- 3 -
operations of the SPA (including all ports) have been successful and total net
income increased from So Sh 11.25 million in 1977 to So Sh 64.20 million in
1981.
1.11      While foreign vessels handle most of Somalia's international trade,
about 8% is carried by the Somali Shipping Agency and Line (SSAL), established
in 1978 as an autonomous parastatal agency under the authority of MMTP. SSAL
operates two refrigerated ships (about 5,000 dwt) primarily for banana exports,
one livestock ship (about 4,000 dwt) and two small general cargo vessels (1,500
and 2,000 dwt). SSAL plans to purchase two new ships with assistance (US$7
million) expected from the Islamic Development Bank (IDB). In 1980, total
freight transported by SSAL was about 105,000 tons, mostly exports of livestock
and bananas to the Near East and Italy, respectively. After incurring deficits
for the first two years of operations, SSAL recorded a profit of about So Sh 14
million (US$2.23 million) in 1980.
1.12      Coastal shipping is limited despite the 3,000 km coastline mainly
because there is little inter-regional trade suitable for such shipping.
However, individual operators with small boats of up to 300 dwt carry some
passenger and freight traffic along the northern coast between Seyla and
Bereda. The development of commercial fishing (a fishing project has been
proposed for financing by the Bank Group) is expected to stimulate coastal
shipping.
Civil Aviation
1.13      In view of long distances and inadequate land transport, civil
aviation has good potential for development in Somalia as evidenced by a strong
growth pattern. Between 1975 and 1979, internal passenger transport increased
by 21% per year and freight by 28% per year. Somalia has fifteen airfields; SA
serves eight of them with scheduled domestic flights. Mogadishu and Hargeisa
have international airports and two other airports, Kismayo and Berbera, have
paved runways. Between 1975 and 1980, international passenger traffic at
Mogadishu airport increased 24% annually; the volume of passengers in 1980 was
70,000. The Government has requested Bank Group assistance in the construction
of a new airport at Mogadishu. The Bank Group recommended and is willing to
finance a study of Somalia's civil aviation system, including a complete review
of the airfields, communications and navigational aids system. The Government's
decision is still awaited.
1.14      SA, established in 1964, operates one Fokker (F27) and two Cessnas on
its domestic routes. Its two Boeing 707 jet aircraft connect Mogadishu with
Rome, Frankfurt, Cairo, Nairobi, Djibouti and Seychelles and several places on
the Arab peninsula. A few foreign airlines link Somalia with cities in Africa,
the Near East and Europe. SA is an autonomous parastatal company under the
Department of Civil Aviation of the Ministry of Transport (MT). Technical and
management assistance to SA is provided by Lufthansa (Germany). UNDP is also
providing fellowships for overseas training and technical assistance experts for
training Somali personnel. SA's financial situation has deteriorated; in 1980,
it had a deficit of So Sh 25 million (US$3.97 million). The deficit could
partly be explained by substantial increases in the price of jet fuel and



- 4 -
inefficient operations (on international flights, SA has an occupancy rate of
only about 53%). The civil aviation study (para. 1.13) would also address SA's
financial, management and staffing problems.
C. Transport Planning, Policy and Coordination
Planning
1.15      Planning in the transport sector is not a major problem.  Planning
units exist in MT and MMTP but are understaffed, and the planning process has
been basically oriented to preparing lists of proposed projects. The Ministry
of National Planning (MNP) has a section for infrastructure and prepares a
development plan on the basis of inputs from other ministries and Government
agencies. In that regard, MNP, in finalizing the list of projects and in
shaping the plan itself, has a decisive role. UNDP and Germany are furnishing
MNP with technical assistance which is helping to bring about improvements in
transport planning.
Policy
1.16      Although the Government has not prepared a long-term strategy for the
development of the transport sector, investments realized or planned (para.
1.17) indicate that it has assigned transport infrastructure an important place.
Given the still undeveloped state of the transport infrastructure, such a policy
appears to be sound in principle. The Goverment's broad objectives in the
transport sector as enunciated in the most recent development plans are to
(i) open new areas for development in order to increase the productive capacity
of the economy; (ii) foster economic integration of relatively isolated areas;
and (iii) facilitate movement of goods within the country at low cost.
Somalia's specific objectives for the road sub-sector include upgrading primary
and secondary roads, which still are mainly (75%) earth and gravel, in order to
prevent serious traffic interruptions during rains and to reduce vehicle
operating costs.
Sector Investments
1.17      Under the 1974-1978 development plan, transport investments accounted
for about 20% of total planned public investment, or So Sh 1,104.7 million
(US$175.6 million). The actual funds expended exceeded the amount planned by
about US$18 million which includes US$13.5 million for a parastatal road
transport company (para. 2.07) that had not been planned for. However, due to
cost overruns caused by implementation delays and inflation, a number of
projects were carried over to the 1979-81 plan. Investments in roads accounted
for 63% (So Sh 695 million) of transport sector investments and an additional 8%
was spent for the parastatal road transport company; 26% was invested in ports
and marine transport; and only 3% in civil aviation. The Government financed
about 27% of the projects' costs in the sector; external aid or loans
contributed the remaining 73%. The plan generally followed investment recommen-
dations made by consultants (Grimble, Canada) in their 1966 Transport Survey and
was basically well conceived; however, certain projects such as relocation of
the Mogadishu airport and the Gelib-Dinsor road construction had questionable
economic viability and have not been carried out yet. Overall, the plan was



only partially successful in meeting the targets in the sector. During the
1979-81 plan period, 25% of total public investments were directed to the sector
which is in line with the needs of a poorly developed transport infrastructure.
The roads and road transport sub-sector still had a major share, 80%, followed
by civil aviation, 8%, and ports, 5%. About 76% of planned investments actually
materialized during these years; the shortfall in the planned targets occurred
due to the overall economic crisis and was particularly pronounced in the ports
and civil aviation sub-sectors. Investments made in the transport sector during
the period 1974-1981 are shown in Table 1.1.

Development Programme 1979-81", Mogadishu, August 1982.
1.18      In 1982, the Government of Somalia completed a 1982-86 Development
Plan. According to the plan, out of So Sh 16,299 million (US$1,072 million)
of investments planned for the whole economy, only 8.3% or So Sh 1,349 million
is envisaged for the transport sector. This represents a substantial reduction
of the sector's share from the previous plans and appears to be low for the
sector's needs. For the transport sector, the document notes that about 50% of
the financing of the planned investments has already been secured (some projects
started under the 1979-1981 Plan). The roads subsector's share (So Sh 867
million) amounts to 65% of the total investments in the sector which is
justifiable given the predominance of the subsector and its poor state. Ports'



-6-
share is 25% and that of civil aviation 10%. The plan is basically designed to
cover priority projects in each transport mode. Included in the plan is the
construction of the Dinsor-Gelib road (So Sh 360 million), which does not appear
to be economically justified (para. 1.22). In addition to planned total
investments of So Sh 16,299 million, the plan includes a group of projects which
are still at the conceptual stage; among them are a number of transport projects
totalling So Sh 2,360 million. Three major projects in this group, construction
of Garoe-Bosaso and Erigavo-Las Koreh roads and a new international airport at
Mogadishu (total estimated cost, So Sh 2,030 million), do not appear to be
economically justified. In light of the current financial and economic
situation, it is unlikely that this additional program will be carried out.
Coordination
1.19      Four ministries are involved in the transport sector:  (i) Ministry of
Public Works (MPW), through its Civil Engineering Department (CED), is respon-
sible for planning, constructing, and maintaining roads and constructing ports
and airports; (ii) MT is responsible for road transport including vehicle
registration and for civil aviation through its Civil Aviation Department; (iii)
MMTP is responsible for port operations and, through SSAL, for marine transport;
and (iv) MNP, through its Infrastructure Section, for general planning of the
sector and for monitoring project implementation. Despite the dispersion of
transport responsibilities among four ministries, intermodal coordination is not
a major issue. There is no railway nor are there any plans for one; the limited
coastal shipping is unlikely to increase significantly to compete with road
transport in the foreseeable future.
D. Previous Bank Group Involvement in Sector
Highway Projects
1.20      The World Bank Group has been extensively involved with the develop-
ment of the transport sector in Somalia through seven IDA credits -- three for
highway and four for port projects. IDA support for the road subsector has had
two major goals, namely, the completion of a basic system of trunk roads and
building up of an effective institution for highway planning, design, construc-
tion and maintenance. The First Highway Project (Credit 74-SO, US$6.2 million,
March 1965), co-financed by the European Development Fund (FED), UNDP and the
Government, comprised construction of the Afgoi-Baidoa Road (216 km), purchase
of road maintenance and workshop equipment, construction of an office building
and technical assistance to CED. In order to keep costs within available funds,
Government, FED, and IDA decided that the pavement be designed for a service
life of seven years using staged construction. Bids received for road construc-
tion were US$2.8 million more than the appraisal estimate of US$8 million which
led to a supplementary Credit (Credit 123-SO) of US$2.3 million in June 1968.
Road construction was completed in March 1971, about two and a half months later
than the 36-month contract period. Claims for the construction work arbitrated
in favor of the contractor were initially contested by Government but were even-
tually settled. Traffic on the road has been greater than what was estimated at
appraisal resulting in a re-evaluated economic rate of return of 13-15%,
compared to 7-8% at appraisal. The Project Performance Audit report (No. 2391,
March 1, 1979) concluded that the project's objectives were largely achieved,
namely that the road had facilitated agricultural development and social and
economic cohesion. Purchases of road maintenance and workshop equipment and



construction of an office building for the CED provided essential infrastruc-
ture; technical assistance helped to reorganize the road agency and initiate
effective road operations. The road has, however, reached the end of its
economic life and now needs strengthening and improvement (para. 3.03).
1.21      The Second Highway Project (Credit 295-SO, US$9.6 million, March
1972), co-financed by the African Development Bank, comprised construction of
the Hargeisa-Berbera Road (158 km), a feasibility study and detailed engineering
for the Hargeisa-Borama road with a link to Tug Wajale and technical assistance
to update the 1966 Transport Survey. In view of the uncertainties involved in
contracting in Somalia, the Association decided to call bids for road construc-
tion prior to board presentation. Road construction was completed in May 1975,
about six months behind schedule. As traffic on the road developed much more
rapidly than had been expected, the economic rate of return was re-evaluated at
36% compared to 19% at appraisal (1971). The Project Performance Audit Report
(No. 2391, March 1, 1979) concluded that the objectives of the project were
achieved; the road has allowed trucking of livestock, the major export
commodity, from market to the port. The 1978 Transport Survey carried out by
consultants served as a general guide in preparing the road program under the
on-going 1979-1981 development plan (para. 1.17).
1.22      The Third Highway Project (Credit 699-SO, US$7.0 million, June 1977),
co-financed by Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AF), Islamic
Development Bank (IDB) and African Development Fund (AfDF) and the Government,
comprises construction of the Hargeisa-Borama Road with a link to Tug Wajale,
(132 km), an extension of the paved road westward from Hargeisa to Berbera, a
feasibility study and detailed engineering of the Dinsor-Bardere-Gelib Road, and
strengthening of the CED through provision of technical assistance, training and
workshop equipment. Construction works on the road started in November 1978,
but came to a standstill after an air raid in the project area in August 1980.
Only 56 km of road from Hargeisa had been completed. At the contractor's
request, the Government terminated his contract as of December 27, 1980. The
supervisory consultants' proposals, supported by the Government, to build the
remaining 76 km of the road by force account under the management of a
consulting firm were found to be inadequate and technically unsound. As an
alternative, the Government has proposed inviting bids from other contractors
(local or foreign) operating in Somalia to complete the road. Since the road
has been completed to a point 13 km short of a large town, Nabadid, the
Association has decided to continue participation in completing the road up to
the town using the balance of uncommitted funds (about US$2 million) for civil
works. It has, however, decided not to participate in completing the remaining
sections, Nabadid-Borama (44 km) and Nabadid-Tug Wajale (19 km), in view of the
very low rate of return estimated (about 6%) due to the sharp decline in traffic
and economic activity and large increase in construction costs resulting from
the difficult situation in the area. The feasibility study of the
Dinsor-Bardere- Gelib road has been completed and the final report, submitted by
the consultants, indicates the economic rate of return is too low to justify
construction of the road at this time. The technical assistance to CED,
financed by the AF, is continuing (para. 2.14).
1.23      Although the technical assistance included in the First Highway
Project and ongoing Third Highway Project helped initiate effective road
maintenance operations, there has been limited success in institution building.
The principal reasons for this have been the transfer of trained personnel to
other agencies and departure of staff for neighboring oil-rich countries (para.



- 8 -
2.14). Continued attention to manpower availability and training of staff is,
therefore, necessary. The proposed project will provide technical assistance
and training using local institutions.  In the short term, apart from providing
some technical assistance to aid CED in improving road maintenance operations
and in drawing and implementing training programs for staff, the Government has
agreed to assign to CED, from 1983 until the completion of the project, at least
one newly graduated civil engineer from the Somali National University every
year (para. 2.15). For the longer term, the country-wide road maintenance study
included in the project (para. 3.08) will review the present road maintenance
organization and make recommendations for its improvement including staffing
required, overall training needs, design of incentives for efficient performance
of staff at various levels and any technical assistance that might be requiredi
for implementing the findings of the study.
Port Projects
1.24      Port project financing began in 1964 with a technical assistance grant
of US$311,000 followed in 1969 by a Credit (Credit 55-SO) of US$550,000 for
engineering and accounting consultancy services for the SPA. Although the
Mogadishu port project was first identified in 1964, it took nine years to put
the project together because sufficient IDA funds were not available, lengthy
negotiations with FED on co-financing arrangements were required, and a
political revolution broke out in the country. In 1973, a US$12.9 million IDA
Credit (Credit 359-SO) and an FED grant of US$12.5 million financed construction
of a sheltered deep-water harbor at Mogadishu, including sheds and other
facilities. In 1975, a third IDA Credit (Credit 586-SO, US$5.2 million) was
approved for an additional general cargo berth and corresponding extension of
the breakwater. Both projects were completed in 1977, about six months behind
schedule. The physical execution of the project was plagued by disputes with
the contractor which were eventually settled without resort to arbitration. A
Bank staff economic re-evaluation in 1979 indicated an economic return of 17%
which is slightly higher than that derived during appraisal. During execution
of the project, it became evident that there were some fundamental weaknesses in
SPA, such as the scarcity of skilled staff, and that to overcome these defi-
ciencies, additional institution building would be required in future projects.
The Project Performance Audit Report (No. 3052) for the Second and Third
Projects (combined), issued on June 27, 1980, found that the project has resu:Lt-
ed in much more efficient port operations.
1.25      The Fourth Port Project (Credit 838-SO, US$5.5 million, 1978)
consisted originally of the construction of a tanker pier and related facilities
for handling crude oil tankers and small products tankers. Bids were received
on November 21, 1979, and the lowest bid was substantially higher than the
appraisal estimate. As a result, the project was modified to exclude construc-
tion of the tanker terminal and to include the building of a new general cargo
berth as well as alteration of the present facility for better handling of oil
products. Construction of the new berth began early in 1981 and is expected to
be completed in February 1983.
1.26      The Bank Group has had a major impact on the development of transport
facilities in Somalia and is also helping to establish and improve transport
institutions. Benefits from the construction and subsequent expansion of
Mogadishu port include augmented capacity to handle growing levels of traffic,
reduction in ship-waiting time and reduced cost of transport, less loss and
damage to cargo, and reduced handling time for cargo moving through port.

II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The road network totals about 21,600 km (Tables 2.1 and 2.2) of which
2,460 km are paved, 570 km are gravelled and the rest are earth roads and
tracks. In terms of administrative classification, the lengths of primary,
secondary, and rural/feeder roads are about 4,300 km, 5,300 km and 12,000 km,
respectively.

2.02      The coverage of the network is adequate for the country's present
needs, but the standards and condition of the roads are not satisfactory. Low
standard roads prevail, although there has been considerable road upgrading; the
paved roads increased from about 900 km in 1971 to 2,460 km in 1981. In the
past, earth roads were upgraded to paved standards in order to provide a basic
road network linking major commercial centers. In the future, the normal
development from earth/gravel to paved standards should be followed. The
backbone of the country's road system is the north-south link between Mogadishu
and Berbera via Galkayo, Garoe and Burao (about 1,900 km). The other most
important roads are the coastal road from Mogadishu to Kismayo leading on to
Liboi on the Kenyan border (about 700 km) and the road from Mogadishu to Dolo on
the Ethiopian border via Afgoi and Baidoa (about 600 km).

B. Road Use
Vehicle Fleet
2.03      Available data on fleet composition, age and condition, indicate that
there were about 15,600 privately owned vehicles in 1980 when the first
systematic data collection was made. In addition, the Government has a fleet
of 2,900 vehicles (excluding the military) yielding a national total of about
18,500 motor vehicles (Table 2.3). Statistics do not distinguish between trucks
and buses, as both are classified as trucks. The composition of the vehicle
fleet by size shows that pickups and vans constitute the largest category, 3L%;
passenger cars, 28%; and medium and heavy trucks, 26%. Most of the truck 3iiet
consists of trucks of 6-8 ton capacity. No systematic records of the vehicie
fleet size and composition have been kept which makes it difficult to estimate
the growth rate of the fleet. There are no vehicle manufacturers in Somalia;
Italy is the principal source of supply.

Traffic
2.04      The collection of traffic data is the responsibility of CED which has
done little work in this field. CED has made only random counts on primary
roads rendering the reliability of its data questionable. The technical
assistance included in the project will assist with improving the traffic count
system (para. 3.09). Although road traffic statistics are not available, some
indications of traffic growth could be obtained from the data on fuel consump-
tion provided by the National Petroleum Agency, NPA (Table 2.4). Nearly all-
gasoline and a significant portion of the diesel fuel are consumed by motor
vehicles. The significantly high growth rate of gasoline consumption (12% per
year) implies a correspondingly high growth rate in traffic by passenger and
other light vehicles. The average annual growth rate of fuel consumption in the
period 1974-79 is estimated at over 5%.  On the basis of this past trend in fuel
consumption as well as production of and demad for goods in Somalia and informa-
tion available from occasional traffic counts, the average annual traffic growth
rate is estimated at about 5%.

Road Transport Industry
2.05      There is a shortage of information available on the road transport
industry. Freight transport is carried out by private truckers (who are not yet
organized into an association) and by a parastatal company (para. 2.07). There
are no specific regulatory barriers to entry into the freight transport
industry; the Government seems to encourage the growth of the industry.
Although there are official tariffs, they are not always enforced (para. 2.08)
and most of transport services between transporters and customers are settled by
mutual agreement. The market appears to be reasonably competitive. However,
modest economic activity of the private sector, poor road conditions, shortage
of spare parts and fuel (temporary fuel rationing started in late 1980) and
seasonal demand for freight transport services render profitability low, thereby
inhibiting growth of the industry.
2.06      The private sector has about 4,000 trucks (light and heavy) and
handles most of the internal demand. However, commercial operations are small-
scale comprising mainly single owner/operators with very few having more than
five trucks. They provide almost all the transport services demanded by the
private sector and cater to a part of the needs of the public sector especially
for services off the main trunk routes and those for which the larger, heavier
vehicles are not needed.
2.07      The National Transport Agency (NTA) is a parastatal company
established in 1978 to provide freight transport services. NTA operates under
the authority of MT and primarily serves the Government's needs. NTA handles
about 25% of the country's freight transport demand, while the private sector
handles the balance. The current NTA fleet is about 290 trucks (mostly new) of
which 87% are heavy trucks, 10 tons and above. NTA plans to expand its fleet,
train additional drivers and mechanics and expand maintenance facilities both at
headquarters in Mogadishu and at its regional offices. In the first two years
of operations, NTA incurred losses making the agency dependent on Government
subsidies for fleet expansion and replacement.



- 12 -
2.08      Freight and passenger rates are set by the MT in consultation with NTA
and cooperatives representing private sector interests. The freight rates
effective December 1982 are shown in Table 2.5. These rates reflect an increase
but do not provide an adequate margin for the truckers to cover depreciation
costs in addition to other operating expenses. The rates are observed only when
a public sector agency or Government department is one of the parties involved;
transactions between private individuals are usually settled at higher rates.

2.09      Passenger transport, provided only by the private sector, appears to
be a relatively thriving business in Somalia, especially in and around the
larger towns. Passenger transport facilities are also used to transport goods
and commodities by individuals between towns and rural areas. Inter-urban
transport is provided by buses and converted pickups, of which there are more
than 1,000 in the Mogadishu area alone. In addition, by mid-1980, there were
about 680 taxis in Mogadishu and 350 in the southern part of the country., Rates
are established by the MT. In inter-urban transport, the average official rate
is fixed at about So Sh 1.05 per passenger/km, though the actual prevailing rate
is about So Sh 1.15; there are some variations depending on the route. Given
the relatively high demand for passenger transport, these rates make the opera-
tions commercially viable.
2.10      There is a growing demand for passenger services.  Entry into the
intra-urban transport industry in the Mogadishu area is regulated by local
authorities to avoid over-capacity and undue demand on scarce foreign exchange
resources; less than 50% of applications were approved in 1980. There are no
limitations on inter-urban and rural transport, and they are exhibiting signi-
ficant growth. So far, only a few routes have scheduled services. The industry
faces the familiar problems of lack of spare parts and of adequately trained
maintenance personnel. Poor road quality in the rural areas has also been cited
as a barrier to expanding operations there.
Road Transport Regulations
2.11      As explained in para. 2.05, there are no specific regulations (for
entry, route allocations, etc.) which would limit operators in the freight
transport industry. Vehicle weight and dimension regulations were introduced in
September 1972. The maximum gross vehicle weight permitted is 32 tons; the
maximum load for a single axle is 10 tons and for tandem axle, 16 tons.
Overloading is not a problem since the regulations are enforced. Commercial
vehicle operators engaged in public transport are required to register with the
Public Registration Agency of MT. MT is also in charge of vehicle inspections
which are performed twice a year for commercial vehicles.

Automotive Fuel Prices
2.12      The NPA is the sole importer and distributor of petroleum products in
Somalia. The refinery in Mogadishu, which started production in 1979, ceased
operations in 1980 due to the curtailment of supply of crude oil from Iraq as a
consequence of the Iran-Iraq war. Saudi Arabia is now the primary source of
refined fuel imports as well as for crude oil for the refinery which has
recently started operations again. Table 2.6 provides the retail price deve-
lopment, tax and duty component for gasoline and diesel fuel, together with
import prices of fuel (C.I.F. Mogadishu). The C.I.F. import prices are in line
with those in the Region. Retail prices rose sharply in July 1981 reflecting a
substantial devaluation of the Somali Shilling; no price increase, however,
followed the 20% devaluation in July 1982. The tax component in the gasoline
price (over 40%) is one of the highest in the region, and there are no subsidies
of the retail prices.

C. Administration
2.13      The CED, under the MPW, is responsible for planning, building and
maintaining all roads. CED also constructs ports and airports which, however,
are maintained by other Government organizations. It has six divisions
(Planning and Design, Construction, Maintenance, Materials Laboratory, Equipment
and Administration) and sixteen regional road maintenance sections. The
regional road maintenance sections, while receiving technical support from CED,
operate under administrative control of regional directors who report to MPW.
CED has three main workshops at Hargeisa, Mogadishu and Kismayo, set up under
the First Highway Project, which handle major repairs for vehicles and
equipment; regional workshops take care of minor repairs and routine servicing.
MPW's Workshop and Equipment Department exercises overall control over workshops
and equipment. The present organization of the MPW and the CED is shown in
Chart 1.



- 14 -
2.14      Under the UNDP-financed Technical Assistance Program included in the
First Highway Project, CED's activities were reorganized and expanded during
1965-1974. Based on recommendations made by management consultants employed
under the program, a large number of new positions were added both in CED's
headquarters office and in the regional sections. The consultants assisted CED
in organizing, staffing and operating the highway administration, and provided
on-the-job training to professional and lower level staff in various areas of
highway operations; some eighteen Somali engineers and technicians received
training abroad. However, with the departure of the management consultants int
1974, the full burden of the operations rested on CED which had, by then, fa'_1. n
short of its authorized strength due partly to staff transfers to other agenMies
and departure of staff for neighboring oil-rich countries offering higher
salaries. An increase in the number of regions from eight to sixteen in 1973
caused weakening of the organization, adversely affecting CED operations,
particularly road maintenance. Currently, several senior and middle management
positions as well as lower level posts at CED headquarters and in the regional
sections are vacant. Under the ongoing Third Highway Project a technical
assistance team, provided by consultants Dorsch Consult (Germany) and financed
by the Arab Fund, is assisting CED to alleviate staffing shortages and to
improve highway operations. The team comprises a senior highway engineer (team
leader), a highway design/construction engineer, a highway maintenance engineer,
two workshop superintendents and a financial/administrative officer. The
technical assistance contract, originally for a period of two years and later
extended, will expire in July 1983. While the team has provided assistance to
CED, more work is needed especially in the field of road maintenance. The
technical assistance included in the proposed project (para. 3.09) will continue
the aid in building CED's strength with the main focus on road maintenance
operations.
2.15      At CED headquarters, three key posts in the Planning and Design, Soils
and Materials Laboratory and Administration Divisions have been vacant for
several years. The first two were filled in mid 1982 with recently graduated
engineers who are being supervised and trained by the technical assistance team;
the post in the Administration Division is effectively filled by a technical
assistance expert while training a local counterpart. The present set-up will
continue under the proposed project until the local staff is deemed to have
acquired the necessary qualifications to head the Divisions on their own.
Further, to fill other vacant positions, the Government agreed during
negotiations to assign to CED, from 1983 until the completion of the project, at
least one newly graduated engineer (civil) from the Somali National University
(SNU) every year with the total number of additional engineers reaching at least
10 at the completion of the project. SNU has sufficient potential to meet CEDI's
needs. Of the 27 engineers graduated from SNU in 1980, 13 were in civil
engineering; the yearly intake of students in engineering courses currently is
around 60. As for the vacant posts in sub-professional grades, CED plans to
recruit high school graduates from the country's technical schools including the
Mogadishu Polytechnic (para. 2.17) which turns out 150-200 technical graduates
every year.
2.16      CED submits all invoices to MPW for payment; MPW maintains accounts of
all capital and recurrent expenditures for works under the direct supervision of
a representative of the Ministry of Finance (MF) who is administratively
responsible to the Minister of Public Works. The accounts are audited by
Government auditors under the Magistrate of Accounts. The audit and accounting



- 15 --
procedures followed are generally satisfactory. The administrative/financial
officer included in the technical assistance team (para. 3.09) will help improve
the accounting system.
D. Training
2.17      The technical assistance team, employed under the ongoing Third
Highway Project (para. 2.14), is providing on-the-job and classroom training to
Somali sub-professional staff (mechanics and equipment operators). However,
training classes are not held regularly, and no records are maintained c the
individuals trained or courses taught.  The training generally is hind   i by
the low level of skills and lack of adequate Somali staff. The maintenance
study included in the project will assess manpower needs for maintenance
operations and formulate appropriate training programs (para 3.08), while the
technical assistance included in the project will help assess other manpower
needs of the CED, identify possible sources for recruiting additional staff, and
draw up, coordinate and implement the overall training program. CED already has
most of the required facilities (classrooms, equipment and training aids) for
training its staff. In addition, it can use facilities at the Mogadishu
Polytechnic, a four-year technical secondary school for general mechanics, auto
mechanics, electrical and building technicians.
E. Planning
2.18      CED, under MPW, is responsible for road planning but has limited
capacity for this function; the key position in the Planning and Design Division
has just been filled (para. 2.15). CED has used consultants for long-term
transport planning and for project feasibility and design studies. In preparing
the ongoing 1979-1981 road development program, the 1978 Transport Survey
carried out by consultants Renardet-Sauti (Italy) served as a general guide.
The German technical assistance team in MNP is currently assisting CED in road
planning. A summary of current and planned road projects is presented in Table
2.7 (page 16).
F. Financing
2.19      The outlay for road construction in the period 1974-78 was So Sh 695
million (US$110.5 million) of which external sources financed 73%. In the
1979-81 period, the outlay was So Sh 739 million (about US$103.0 million) with
about 91% financed by external sources. The investment planned for road
development for the period 1982-86 is So Sh 867 million (para. 1.18). The
Government expects a large portion of the investment to be financed by external
sources. There has been a decline in funds allocated to road maintenance and
present allocations are far below requirements (para. 2.24). Table 2.8 shows
the allocations for road maintenance during the period 1976-83.

2.20      Road users contribute to Government revenues through taxes and duties
levied on fuel, lubricants, imported vehicles and spare parts, vehicle registra-
tion and inspection fees and licence fees. Data on total annual revenues from
road user charges are not available. However, taxes and duties on fuel -- the
major source of Goverment revenues from road users -- could be estimated on the
basis of actual fuel consumption and the corresponding tax and duty component of
retail prices. The revenues from fuel taxes and duties (Table 2.9) have been
rapidly increasing, over 7% on an average per year, and exceed the Government's
contribution to road construction and road maintenance. In the period 1975-
1979, average annual Government contribution toward road maintenance and
construction combined was estimated at about So Sh 48 million while the corres-
ponding average annual revenue from fuel taxes and duties alone was about So Sh
130 million.

G. Engineering
2.21      CED's Planning and Design Division carries out minor road and bridge
design using its own staff, but all economic feasibility studies and detailed
engineering for major projects are done by foreign consultants. The Somali
Consulting Agency, a parastatal organization under the MPW, occasionally
undertakes some minor design work for highways but is generally involved with
building design. There are no local private consultants in the country. CED
has a well-equipped materials and soils laboratory, set up under the First
Highway Project, which assists in investigations and design for major road
projects. The design standards adapted by CED are appropriate for local
conditions.
H. Construction
2.22     Major road and bridge construction works are generally undertaken by
foreign contractors and supervised by consultants. Contracts are let out on
unit-price basis, following suitable prequalification and tendering procedures.
Apart from a few small contractors capable of carrying out minor road or culvert
works, no local highway construction industry exists in Somalia. The National
Construction Agency, a parastatal organization under the MPW which generally
undertakes building construction, however, is currently building by force
account a 200 km approach road to the proposed dam at Bardere in south-central
Somalia. CED itself carries out some rehabilitation/reconstruction works on
roads.

I. Maintenance
2.23     Although CED is responsible for the maintenance of the road network,
actual field operations are carried out under the administrative control of the
regional directors (para. 2.13). The road maintenance organization in the
regional sections is unsound due to the lack of adequate, trained manpower (road
superintendents, foremen, equipment operators). Apart from a few speciaL crews
set up for rehabilitation/reconstruction of roads, there are no organized crews
to carry out road maintenance. The regional workshops lack facilities for
servicing and day-to-day repair of road maintenance equipment. CED's main
workshops, too, lack adequate equipment, tools and spare parts and are short of
properly qualified and trained mechanics. Equipment repair and control
procedures established by the management consultants employed under the First
Highway Project have fallen into disuse. Much of the road maintenance equipment
is in need of repair; consequently, equipment availability is very low, and road
maintenance is carried out only sporadically. Staff shortages prevent CED
headquarters from overseeing maintenance operations, and the quantity and
quality of road maintenance is poor. There are no regular programs for routine
and periodic maintenance. Paved roads which have not been resealed for several
years have developed potholes and surface cracks; maintenance of gravel/earth
roads has been completely neglected and most gravel roads have reverted to earth
roads. The project will help finance a country-wide road maintenance study to
review the current situation and to determine how maintenance planning, organi-
zation and operations should be improved (para. 3.08). The study will, among
other things, make recommendations for establishing road maintenance procedures
using an appropriate mix of equipment and labor.
2.24      There has also been a decline in the funds allocated for road
maintenance (para. 2.19). Present allocations are far below what is required.
Based on data from CED, the 1981 expenditure was So Sh 8.2 million, and the
amount allocated for 1982, So Sh 5.3 million, is far short of the So Sh 20
million requested by CED on the basis of recommendations made by the Arab Fund
technical assistance team. CED's budget requests, however, do not present a
clear picture of the amounts needed for road maintenance because maintenance and
upgrading/reconstruction funds are not clearly differentiated. The technical
assistance included in the project will assist in preparing and monitorirLg the
road maintenance budget (para. 3.09). The Government has recently confirmed
that the 1983 budget allocation for road maintenance is So.Sh 20 million. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that pending
recommendations of the road maintenance study on the recurrent funds required,
the budgetary allocation for road maintenance for 1984 will be at least So Sh 20
million in 1983 prices and that by September 1 of each year up to and including
1987, the Government shall review and agree with the Association on the
budgetary requirements and the budgetary allocation for road maintenance
2.25      Another serious problem is that road maintenance equipment and staff
are frequently diverted to other public works projects such as rehabilitation/
reconstruction of roads, airfield improvement, etc. Certain road maintenance
equipment purchased by MPW with the German Commodity Aid is currently deployed
on the construction of the approach road to the Bardere dam. During negotia-
tions, the Government agreed not to divert road maintenance staff and equipment
to other uses.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The objectives of the proposed project are to:
ii)    protect the capital investment in and increase the service li-e
of a primary road in south-central Somalia;
ii)    help improve road maintenance planning, organization and
operations; and
iii)   help alleviate the staffing shortage of the CED.
B. Project Description
3.02      The project comprises:
i)     strengthening and improvement of the Afgoi-Baidoa Road (216
km);
ii)    consultants' services for:
a) supervision of (i);
b) a country-wide road maintenance study;
c) technical assistance to CED; and
iii)   assistance for urgent road maintenance needs.
1)        Strengthening and Improvement of the Afgoi-Baidoa Road
3.03      The Afgoi-Baidoa Road (216 km) forms part of a main artery connecting
Baidoa -- administrative capital of Bay region in south-central Somalia -- with
Mogadishu, the principal port and capital of the country (see map), and serves
areas of good agricultural potential (para. 4.05). Apart from a slightly
rolling terrain near Baidoa, the road traverses flat terrain. Baidoa itself is
located on a plateau, and the road climbs a gentle escarpement for the last few
kilometers into town (Chart 2). The road was constructed in 1971 with the
assistance of the FED and IDA under the First Highway Project (para. 1.20). The
pavement was originally designed for a service life of seven years using staged
construction. Although traffic has developed more than what the road was
designed to carry, it has held up well and retained its camber and profile
except in sections where it crosses poor soils. On the first 30 km from Afgoi
where lime stabilized soil was used as sub-base, it has developed sinkholes (a
kind of pothole caused by burrowing mole rats), and the road is in poor
condition; the sub-base has also become weakened. A section of the road from Km
173 to 181 (O at Afgoi) where the underlying soil is expansive and moisture
susceptible, the road has poor riding quality and the surface is badly rutted



- 20 -
and cracked. The road has not been resealed since its construction and shows
signs of distress. Due to the lack of maintenance, road shoulders have eroded
and have encroached on the road making it narrower. The road has reached the
end of its economic life and is in need of strengthening and improvement.
3.04      Consultants Halcrow International Partnership undertook a technical
and economic evaluation study including detailed engineering for strengthening
and improvement of the road. The study, financed under Technical Assistance
Credit 821-SO, started in September 1980 and was completed in June 1981. The
road was divided into six sections on the basis of traffic volumes and into
seventeen sub-sections of similar physical characteristics on the basis of
surface condition, pavement deflection, road drainage and construction details.
In considering pavement strengthening and improvement alternatives, the
consultants identified two possible solutions, one for a service life of 10
years and the other for a service life of 20 years. Based on their technicaL
and economic evaluation, the consultants concluded, and the Government and IDA
agreed, that the preferred solution was for a service life of 20 years.
3.05      The proposed road strengthening and improvement works consist of
crushed stone overlay of varying thickness (160 mm to 200 mm) on 111.7 km,
bituminous macadam (50 mm) overlay on 61 km, pavement reconstruction on 27.5 km
and resealing of surface on the remaining 16.2 km. In addition, the road
shoulders will be widened and reconstructed and drainage improved along the
whole road. Pavement reconstruction will be done in sections (Km 1.5 to 21 and
Km 173 to 181) where the road has developed extensive sink-holes and/or the
pavement is badly rutted and cracked (para. 3.03); the existing material in the
pavement will be salvaged as far as possible. Suitable construction materials
are available within reasonable distance from the road. No land acquisition is
involved since the road will follow the existing alignment.
3.06      The design standards adopted for the road are in accordance with the
national primary road standards and are shown below (Table 3.1):
Table 3.1 Design Standards of the Afgoi-Baidoa Road

ii)       Consultants' Services
a)     Construction Supervision
3.07      Consultants will be engaged for construction supervision.  The
Association has agreed with the Government's proposal to engage the same
consultants who carried out the economic evaluation and detailed engineering
study for the road (para. 3.04).
b)     Countrywide Road Maintenance Study
3.08      The quantity and quality of road maintenance is unsatisfactory (para.
2.23). The project will help finance a country-wide road maintenance study to
make recommendations for improving road maintenance planning, organization and
operations. The study will define a five-year comprehensive road rehabilitation
and maintenance program including a time schedule for its implementation and
requirements for staff, funds, materials, equipment, workshop facilities, road
camps, etc., which could form the basis for future assistance to the country.
It will also formulate a training program to help CED meet staff requirements
for maintenance on a continuous basis; the training would be both in-house and
through local technical institutions. The study will be undertaken by
consultants; draft terms of reference for the study are given in Annex 1.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government that the findings and
recommendations of the study will be reviewed with the Association, and an
action plan satisfactory to the Association will be drawn up within six months
of completion of the study to implement its recommendations.
c)     Technical Assistance to CED
3.09      The project will provide technical assistance to strengthen CED's
administration but mainly to improve its road maintenance operations, prepare
and monitor the road maintenance budget, improve traffic count system; and to
draw up and implement suitable training programs for Somali staff. The
technical assistance team will comprise a road maintenance engineer (team
leader), a design/construction engineer, a road maintenance superintendent, two
workshop superintendents (master mechanics) and an administrative/financial
officer for a period of 30 months each. The technical assistance staff will be
provided by a consulting firm; the draft terms of reference are given in Annex
2. The Government agreed during negotiations that it will, (i) by October 31,
1983, assign counterpart staff with qualifications and experience satisfactory
to the Association to the technical assistance personnel and (ii) by June 30,
1984, submit to the Association, for its review and approval, a suitable
training program including any agreements and arrangements with the local
technical institutions for training of CED's staff.
iii)      Assistance for Urgent Road Maintenance Needs
3.10      Due to the lack of adequate maintenance, the country's road network is
deteriorating rapidly (para. 2.23). The road maintenance study, while providing
CED with a five-year road rehabilitation and maintenance program, will also
recommend any urgent action necessary to save the roads from disintegration.
The project includes a notional amount to cover the foreign exchange cost of
materials (cement, steel, bitumen), basic equipment, spare parts and tools



- 22 -
required for any immediate road maintenance needs recommended by the consul-
tants. Specific items of equipment, spare parts and tools to be financed will
be decided when the needs are determined. During negotiations, agreement was
reached with the Government that lists of goods to be purchased shall be
submitted to the Association for its review and approval.
C. Cost Estimates
3.11       The total project cost including contingencies is estimated at
US$43.8 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$35.17 million or 80%.
Excluding taxes and duties (US$0.26 million, see further in para. 3.12 [a]), the
total cost is US$43.54 million. A breakdown of costs is shown below (Table

3.12       The base costs are estimated as of December 1982 and have been derived
as follows:
a)  Strengthening and Improvement of the Afgoi-Baidoa Road:  In view
of the generally difficult and uncertain economic situation in
Somalia, it was decided that bids for civil works would be



- 23 -
received and evaluated prior to Board presentation. The cost for
the strengthening and improvement of the Afgoi-Baidoa road, there-
fore, reflects the price of the lowest evaluated bid of the seven
bids received on October 30, 1982; the lowest bid is about 2%
below the consultants' estimate. Costs for road strengthening and
improvement average between US$45,000 and US$215,000 per km
depending upon the amount of work involved in different sections;
these appear reasonable. The foreign exchange component of cons-
truction costs is estimated at 83% which includes depreciation of
equipment, imported materials, spare parts, fuel, foreign expense
of expatriate personnel, contractors' overheads and profits. The
local component (17%) mainly comprises labor, local expense of
expatriate personnel and taxes; the tax component, however, is
very small (US$260,000, see para. 3.11) and comprised mostly of
the local wage tax as the contract documents permit the contractor
to procure all fuels and materials free of duty and taxes.
b) Consultants' Services: The supervision of strengthening and
improvement of the road will require about 135 man-months of
consultants' services over a 35-month period; the country-wide
road maintenance study, about 36 man-months over a 12-month
period; and the technical assistance to CED, about 180 man-months
over a 30-month period. The average man-month costs including
salary, social costs, international travel, subsistance allowance,
the firm's overhead and profit, are estimated at US$8,800 for the
construction supervision and technical assistance to CED and
US$10,000 for the road maintenance study. In addition to these
personnel costs, the contract costs include the cost of accommoda-
tion, local transportation and other minor expenses. The compara-
tively lower man-month costs for the supervision of civil works
and the technical assistance to CED is because some experts will
be of technician level. These costs are in line with recent
experience in Somalia.
c) Assistance for Urgent Road Maintenance Needs: A notional amount
has been included to cover the foreign exchange cost of materials
(cement, steel, bitumen), basic equipment, spare parts and tools
as may be required for any immediate road maintenance needs
recommended by the consultants in the course of the road
maintenance study.
D. Financing
3.13      The project will be financed by IDA (US$23.0 million or 53% of total
project cost), the Arab Fund (about US$16.3 million or 37%) and the Government
(about US$4.2 million or 10% net of taxes and duties). The IDA credit would
finance about 65% of all foreign costs, the Arab Fund the remaining 35% of
foreign costs and about 50% of local costs while the Government will finance the
remaining 50% of local costs. The detailed financing plan 1/ is as follows
(expressed in US $ Million):
1/ Including contingencies, excluding taxes and duties.

E. Implementation and Procurement
3.14      Project implementation will be the responsibility of the CED of the
MPW. Consultants will be engaged for supervision of the strengthening and
improvement of the Afgoi-Baidoa Road, the countrywide road maintenance study and
the technical assistance.  The draft terms of reference for the consultants wore
agreed upon with the Government at negotiations.
3.15      The road strengthening and improvement will take about 32 months
beginning mid 1983 with an estimated 15%, 30%, 35% and 20% of works to be
carried out in 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986, respectively; the road maintenance
study will take about 12 months and should be completed in the latter half of
1984; the technical assistance will be spread over a period of 2j- years starting
in mid-1983. An implementation schedule shown in Chart 2 was agreed with
Government during negotiations.
3.16      The civil works will be procured under unit-price contract(s) through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group "Guidelines
for Procurement". This was agreed with Government during negotiations. The
Government will engage the same consultants for construction supervision who
carried out the study for the road (para. 3.07). For the road maintenance study
and technical assistance to CED (paras. 3.08 and 3.09), consultants will be
employed in accordance with the Bank Group "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants" and will be selected solely on an evaluation of technical
competence of the firm, the personnel undertaking the assignment, and the
suitability of its proposal; this was agreed with the Government during
negotiations.   Materials, equipment, spare parts and tools required for urgent
road maintenance needs (para. 3.10) will involve a number of relatively minor
individual purchases that would not attract international competitive bidding
and will be procured on the basis of at least four responsive quotations from
suppliers eligible under the Bank Group "Guidelines for Procurement"; this was
agreed with Government during negotiations.



- 25 -
F. Disbursements
3.17      The IDA Credit funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
a) 50% of the total costs of the strengthening and improvement of the
Afgoi-Baidoa road;
b) 50% of the total cost of consultants services for supervision of
the road strengthening;
c) 90% of the total cost of the consultants services for the road
maintenance study and the technical assistance to CED; and
d) 100% of foreign cost of materials, equipment, spare parts and
tools (for urgent road maintenance) if procured internationally;
90% of local cost if procured locally.
All disbursements will be fully documented. The Arab Fund will disburse its
loan on the following basis:
a) 40% of the total costs of the strengthening and improvement of the
Afgoi-Baidoa road; and
b) 40% of the total cost of consultants services for supervision of
the road strengthening.
3.18      An estimated disbursement schedule is set out in Table 3.3 (page 26).
The disbursement estimates are based on the project implementation schedule as
well as on the typical disbursement profile for the highway sub-sector in
Somalia.
G. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting Requirements
3.19      Project accounts will be maintained by the CED of the MPW with
separate accounts for each component and will be available for inspection by the
Association during project supervision missions. MPW's accounts are audited
annually by the Magistrate of Accounts, an independent Government agency, which
submits its report to the Presidency. In previous IDA projects, accounts have
been audited by the Magistrate of Accounts; as this arrangement has proved
satisfactory, it would also be followed for the proposed project. During nego-
tiations, the Government agreed that all project accounts will be audited by the
Magistrate of Accounts who will prepare a report on the audit for submission to
the Association not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.
3.20      During negotiations, the Government agreed to progress reporting
requirements (Annex 3), which include indices for measuring implementation
progress, and submission of a project completion report in a form satisfactory
to the Association not later than six months after the closing date of the
Credit.

Mission Estimates
H. Environmental Aspects
3.21      The project is not likely to have any adverse effect on the
environment. The project road would follow the existing alignment, and no
disburbance to land use should occur. In fact, improved drainage facilities
along the road will benefit adjacent areas and soil erosion would be less than
at present.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01      One of the main objectives of the Somali Government in the transport
sector is to facilitate low-cost movement of goods within the country (para.
1.16). The proposed project will reduce transport costs on a major artery, the
Afgoi-Baidoa road (216 km), which is one of the busiest roads in Somalia and
connects Mogadishu, the capital city, with the Bay region. It will also protect
past capital investment by extending the road's service life. The project would
also help improve road maintenance planning, organization and operations in
Somalia.
4.02      The economic analysis of the strengthening and improvement of the
Afgoi-Baidoa road takes into account the fact that larger investments will be
needed later for reconstruction of the road if the proposed works are not
carried out now at comparatively much lower costs; the proposed civil works are
expected to yield an economic rate of return (ERR) of 17%. No ERR has been
calculated for the assistance for the urgent road maintenance needs and
technical assistance to CED. However, it is expected that substantial benefits
will occur through the much needed improvement of the Government's capability to
maintain the road network.
B. Benefits and Beneficiaries
Afgoi-Baidoa Road
4.03      The main benefits expected from the proposed civil works are reduced
vehicle operating and road maintenance costs; there will also be savings in
deferred major reconstruction works which would be necessary if the road were
allowed to deteriorate further. Benefits from improved road safety and accident
reduction could not be quantified and have not been included in the computation
of the ERR. Since a paved road has existed for a decade, it is estimated that
traffic generated due to the strengthening and improvement works will be
negligible; consequently, vehicle operating costs savings have been limited to
the normal traffic on the road. Savings in transport costs of some additional
traffic expected to develop on the road (para. 4.06) have also been included as
benefits from the project. There would also be various non-quantifiable
benefits in terms of improving access to social and administative services as
well as facilitating regional development.
4.04      The major direct beneficiaries of the reduced transport costs would be
local truck and bus operators. Since the private market is essentially competi-
tive and the tariffs set by Government are based on operating costs, it is
expected that the benefits will be passed on to the rural population and to
consumers of goods originating in the road zone. The Government will also
benefit directly through a significant reduction in transport cost of materials
for a planned cement plant in the project area. Finally, the refugee relief
operation, which has placed heavy demands on this road, would greatly benefit as
well.

C. Economic Analysis
Area of Influence of the Afgoi-Baidoa Road
4.05      The Afgoi-Baidoa road is part of one of the main arteries in south-
central Somalia, linking the capital with the Lower Shebele and Bay regions.
The road traverses a relatively heavily populated area; an estimated one million
people live in its zone of influence. It crosses the largest cereal producing
area in the country and the region has good potential for expanding dry-land
farming and increasing agricultural output. About 700,000 hectares are now
cultivated in the road zone, but could possibly be expanded. The road is
essential to the Bay Region Agricultural Development Project (financed by IDA)
which is an important part of the Government's rural development strategy for
the southern part of the country. According to 1978179 data, sorghum has been
the principal crop in the road zone (annual production was about 140,000 tons),
while the livestock was estimated at 800,000 head.   Finally, the road provides
the vital link for supplies to a large number of refugees in the country.
Traffic
4.06      Some traffic counts have been taken on the road in recent years.  A
comparison of the most recent counts (December 1980) and those of the 1970s
indicates that traffic on the road has been growing at more than 5% per annum.
For economic analysis, the road has been divided into six sections on the basis
of current traffic volumes (para. 3.04). At the end of 1980, the actual traffic
on the road varied from 115 to 530 vehicles per day (vpd) with heavy vehicles
ranging between 60% and 70% (Annex 4). Table 4.1 below shows the estimated
traffic levels by vehicle type for each section at the completion of works in
late 1984/early 1985. It is expected that normal traffic will continue to grow
at 5% annually; the additional traffic forecast is based on the estimated
requirements for the proposed development projects in the region and for
supplies to refugee camps. Due to gradual resettlement of refugees in the
country, the refugee traffic is assumed to taper off from an estimated 32 trucks
in 1985 to 8 trucks in 1990; some additional transport demand is anticipated by
1989/90 by two projects in the region (Bay Region Agricultural Development
Project and a planned cement plant).

Economic Return
4.07      The economic analysis was carried out by comparing "with" and
"without" project cases.  VOC unit savings were treated as a function of
deteriorating road surfaces in the "without" project case; consequently, unit
savings of VOC's were gradually increased in the course of the project's
economic life. Savings in transport costs are based on operations of typical
vehicles under four different surface conditions, ranging from good to very
poor (Annex 4). Currently, the road is assessed to be in fair to poor condition
but deteriorating. In the "without" project case, it is assumed that the
condition of some sections of the road would rapidly worsen within the next few
years to very poor requiring costly repairs to keep the road passable.
4.08      The economic analysis was done in November 1982 prices net of taxes
and duties; cost of local labor was shadow-priced at 50% of the market rate.
The cost/benefit analysis, including the detailed assumptions underlying the
calculations, is presented in Annex 4. The costs included in the economic
evaluation comprise: (i) cost of civil works (strengthening and improvement) in
1983-85; (ii) 10% physical contingencies; (iii) cost of work supervision; and
(iv) cost of routine and periodic maintenance on the road.
4.09      The benefits considered in the economic analysis include:  (i) savings
in vehicle operating costs of the normal traffic (until 1989) growing at 5% per
annum; (ii) savings in VOC of added traffic (related to refugee traffic, the Bay
Region Project, etc.); (iii) savings in avoiding costly restoration works and
other road maintenance costs; and (iv) savings in avoiding full reconstruction
costs which were assessed to become imminent for five sections of the road by
1989/90 and by 2000 for the sixth section in the "without" project case. The
proposed strengthening and improvement will extend the economic life of the road
by 20 years.
4.10      The cost/benefit analysis based upon the assumption explained in
paras. 4.07 - 4.09 shows that the proposed civil works are economically justi-
fied. ERR for the whole road is estimated at 17%; six different road sections
will have ERRs ranging from 12% to 23% (Table 4.2) exceeding the estimated
opportunity cost of capital in Somalia of about 10%.

D. Other Project Elements
4.11      The other project components include a country-wide road maintenance
study, assistance for emergent road maintenance needs, and technical assistance
to CED of the MPW. These components are clearly justified although the benefits
could not be quantified. Together, they are designed to provide CED with much
needed assistance in improving road maintenance planning and operations.

E. Sensitivity and Risks
4.12      A sensitivity analysis was carried out for a 15% rise in construction
costs or a 15% decrease in benefits and in either case, the ERR of about 13% was
above the estimated opportunity cost of capital.
4.13      As regards institution building, there is a high risk in Somalia o:E a
delay in improving CED's road maintenance capability in the event planned local
staff leave for lucrative jobs outside the Government or leave the country
altogether. This is a risk which needs to be taken given the vital importance
of improving CED's capability.

FOOTNOTES
1/        Economic analysis was done net of taxes and duties in November 1982
prices; due to different traffic volumes, the road was divided into six
sections.
2/        Includes normal traffic plus additional traffic (trucks only); up to
1990, the additional traffic is mostly composed of the refugee traffic in the
function of assumed declining number of refugees, from 460,000 in 1985 to
120,000 by 1990; Bay Region Agricultural Project and cement plant project make
only minor contribution to the traffic. The total additional traffic declines
gradually - 1986:28; 1987:24; 1988:20; 1989:16; and 1990:14.
3/        For normal traffic only.
4/        Costs include 10% physical contingencies and 5% for works super-
vision. Due to high unemployment in the country, the cost of local unskilled
and semi-skilled labor was shadow-priced at factor 0.5 in both costs and bene-
fits stream. Furthermore, in view of the exchange rate effective July 1, 1982,
the exchange rate used for economic calculations was US$1.00 = So Sh 15.227 to
reflect the true economic value.
5/        Includes also provision for urgent restoration works which were
assessed to be unavoidable in *without project case" to keep the road passable.
6/        The benefits in years 1989 and 1990 also include avoided reconstruc--
tion costs, which would be required without the project.
7/        Includes provision for periodic maintenance - resurfacing.
8/        In 1981, road sections are found to be in levels 2 and 3:  assuming
"without project case", by 1985, it is estimated that three sections will be iLn
level 3, two in level 4 and one in level 2. Emergency repairs would only
postpone disintegration of the road.
