HUNGARY
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
loan and Project Summary
Borrower;               Magyar Tavkozlesi Vallalat (MTV)
Guarantor:              Republic of Hungary
Amount:                 $150 million equivalent
Terms:                  The proceeds of the Bank loan would be lent to NTV at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate with
fifteen years maturity, including five years of grace.
The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the
borrower.
Pro*ect Ob7ectives:     The project supports Hungary's reform program by
helping the Telecommunications (TC) sector evolve into
a flexible, efficient, commercial, technologically
modern, and competitive sector. In particular, the
project would support rapid improvement of services
for high volume (especially business) users, selective
introduction of competition, institutional
strengthening and reform of MTV, automatization and
extension of the local network, modernization of the
trunk network, improved efficiency and quality of
service, increased integration with international TC
networks, and introduction of new services.
The size of the overall TC development program
necessitates a sectoral approach which incorporates
the TC manufacturing industry. For this reason
project preparation has focused simultaneously on both
aspects of the sector: services and manufacturing.
For reasons of convenience, Bank financing of the
industry side of the program is being implemented
under the ongoing Industrial Restructuring II and the
Technology Development projects. However, from a
sectoral, strategic and planning perspective, the two
aspects have been conceived and prepared as a coherent
whole.



- ii -
Proiect Description:    The Project would consist of a three-year time-slice
of HTV's investment program (1991-1993 including some
preparatory works in late 1990) combining physical
expansion and modernization of the network with
institutional strengthening plus technic;-_ assistance
and training. The specific focus would be: (i)
finalization of a strategy for digitalization and
automatization of the network together with
implementation of the first phase of that program; the
main element of which will be: (ii) construction of a
digital overlay long-distance network with attendant
connections to local networks and, directly, to large-
volume customers; (iii) strengthening of the
commercial orientation and capacity of MTV; and (iv)
implementation of a regulatory framework for
introducing competition into selected portions of the
TC sector.
The total project cost is US$1,354.7 million, of which
US$352.2 million is in foreign exchange. The proposed
Bank loan of US$150 million equivalent would meet 43Z
of the foreign exchange requirements of the project.
A parallel loan of US$100 million by the European
Investment Bank will meet an additional 28X. The
remainder of the foreign exchange requirements will be
arranged by MTV via additional loans from the
international lending institutions, commercial
credits, sale of equity or suppliers credits. Local
costs will be met by MTV and through domestic
borrowing.
Proiect Benefits:       Business and government subscribers will be the major
beneficiaries of the expansion of long distance and
mobile telephone, telex and data facilities. Business
will benefit generally from improved international and
inter-city communications. In particular, 250,000 to
300,000 customers will be connected directly to the
new overlay digital network, thereby gaining access to
full-featured modern services. However, all
subscribers will benefit from improvement in
automatization, service quality and efficiency.
Further, during this project the groundwork will be
laid for a rapid increase in penetration and access to
telecommunications to the general population, which
will take place later in the decade.
Project Risks:          There is some small risk associated with COCOM export
restrictions. However, the current cUimate of
relaxing East/West tensions, recent major additional
relaxation of COCOM restrictions (e.g., reclassifi-



- iii -
cation at the Administrative Exception level of full-
feat1sred digital switching and transmission capacitiea
up to 156 Mbs for both microwave and optical fiber),
plus experience under the Telecommunications I and
Technology Development projects strongly suggests that
this risk is minimal. A greater risk concerns the
performance of the Hungarian TC manufacturing
industry. If the industry is unable to provide the
expected variety and quantity of equipment (about 50X
of total equipment for the project period) at
competitive prices, technology, quality, and timing,
then MTV will have to decide whether to import a
higher proportion of equipment--which will necessitate
reducing the pace of development- -or to tolerate
suboptimal equipment and/or prices. Both of these
options involve substantial costs to the econory.  The
ptogram for reforming and modernizing the ind.ustry,
being supported by the Bank under the Second
Industrial Restructuring Project and the First-
Technology Development Project (see above), will
reduce this risk.

1.01        The Hungarian Telecommunications (TC) sector consists of three
main parts: (a) the telecommunications service provider, Hungarian
Te'ecommunications Company (Magyar Tavkozldsi Vallalat (MTV)), under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Water Management
(MTCW); (b) the Telecommunications Manufacturing Industry (TCMI), under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry (IpM); and (c) the users of
telecommunications services.
1.02        Until recently the Hungariali TC sector was straightforward. A
limited range of basic services--telephone, telex and telegraph--was provided
solely by MTV's predecessor, Magyar Posta (HP), using relatively simple (and
now outdated) technology under an institutional regime of traditional public
service government department. MP made do with whatever equipment the
domestic industry, whose main focus was exports, could supply and TC customers
made do with whatever MP could provide. Relations between the various
interested groups were negligible. However, this regime has become untenable.
As elsewhere in the world, greatly increased importance of TC, commercial
pressure, Government budget deficits and a revolution in technology are
forcing major changes.
1.03        Magyar Tavk6zlesi V4llalat.  The Hungarian Telecom Company, MTV,
was formed on January 1, 1990 when the postal, broadcasting and
telecommunications functions of the Magyar Posta were divided. Although
Hungarian law gives monopoly control over telecommunications to MTV, certain
Government departments, e.g., the military, the police, the railroads, power,
oil and gas refineries and pipelines, have internal telecommunications systems
for their own use which are not connected to the public switched network.
Traditionally, MP sets the technical standards and in some cases, helps
maintain these networks. Responsibility for setting standards now rests with
the MTCW, along with other regulatory functions, but MTV still provides much
of the technical support for these activities.
1.04        The law governing telecommunications is being revised to reflect
the goals of the economic reform and economic and technological changes in the
sector. The new Law of Telecommunications expected to be adopted by June 1991
focusses on: (a) commercial orientation of telecommunications activities; (b)
definition of regulatory responsibility, as distinct from operational
activity, and vesting of these in the GOH; (c) a legal framework for new
services (data, informatics, videotex, etc.); (d) clarifying the boundary
between the market segments where MTV will have a monopoly and those where

Infrastructure Survey (Report No. 7775-HU).



other providers will be permitted; and (e) strengthening public
accountab:lity.
1.05        Telecommunications Manufacturing Industry.  Hungary's
Telecommunications Manufacturing Industry consists of eight major enterprises
and numerous smaller ones. GOH authority over the telecommunications
manufacturing industry rests with the IpM. As enterprises have become more
independent, the IpM's direct administrative authority has declined, and it
has assumed more of a coordinating role.
1.06        The TCMI is well established and highly developed relative to the
size of the domestic market--indeed i. is one of Hungary's largest industries
and the mainstay of its electronics sector. In recent years, it has been one
of the most successful sectors of Hungarian industry, exporting about half of
its output, as well as providing over 80Z of Hungary's own equipment needs.
COCOM limitations and other factors have kept the level of technology several
generations behind current world levels in the area of switching. Transmnission
technology also lags behind, but cables are generally of modern design and
technology.
1.07        In the past, the TCMI's concentration on less demanding exports
has prevented Hungarian TC products from reaching the highest technological
level possible within the constraints of given resources and COCOM
restrictions. This has also affected the development of the Hungarian TC
network by constraining the quality, technology and timely delivery of
domestic equipment. However, the drive for domestic network expansion and the
growing competitiveness of export markets will force the industry to focus
more on domestic needs and on improved quality, timeliness and technological
level.  Whether its succeeds in doing s_ will be a fundamental factor in the
success or failure of plans to expand and modernize the TC network.
1.08        Telecommunications Users.  The user community is relatively
unorganized and there are no national telecommunications user associations in
Hungary at the present time. However, general consumer organizations, the
Economic Chamber, large users, various academic, computer-users, and similar
groups have begun to voice an interest in telecommunications questions. The
GOH has responded to this; e.g., it convened a group of such representatives
to advise it in drawing up the Ten-Year Development Program.
1.09        The RePulatogy Regime.  Up to January 1989, a part of the
President's Office of MP exercised regulatory authority over the sector. In
January 1989, the Ministry of Transport Communications and Construction was
formed; in June 1990 it was reorganized into the Ministry of Transport
Communications and Water Management (MTCW) which assumed responsibility for
the policy and regulatory matters, including frequency spectrum management,
standardization and licensing. The new Ministry is in the process of refining
a regulatory scheme to deal with the broad range of new issues, some of which
will arise following the passage of the new telecommunications law in mid
1991. Support for this exercise is being provided under the First
Telecommunications Project.

B.  Institutional Relations
1.10        MP ar.4 Industry Relations.  Traditionally, the relationship
between MP and the Hungarian Telecommunications Manufacturing Industry has
been similar to other centrally planned economies (CPEs): physical and
technical requirements were set in consultation between MP, suppliers and GOH
ministries with little or no commercial influence or criteria. Despite the
nominal environment of central planning, co-ordinat.on among different
elements of the industry and between the industry and MP was po r. As a
result, products were often redundant, incompatible, suboptimal and behind
schedule.
1.11         This pattern is beginning to change and must continue to do so as
economic liberalization progresses. Central to this change must be a
combination of better technical communication and co-ordination and greater
commercial competition. A critical factor in this process will be MTV's
procurement process. The growing commercialization of MTV itself and the
growing importance of MTV purchases give it the opportunity and the duty to
play such a pivotal iole.
1.12        Discussion of the need for more active coordinatio-n between MTV
and the manufacturing sector has been supported by the Ministry of Industry.
To this end, an interministerial committee was formed by the Ministry of
Industry and the MP in 1987, which has been helpful in working out several
differences between the two. Furthermore, the President of MP and the
Minister of Industry agreed to create a joint Industry-MP (now MTV) liaison
office in order to attend to coordination at the working level. Far more
needs to be done, however.
1.13          In particular, given Hungary's strong R&D capabilities,
cooperation will be crucial in making the best choices between licensing and
independent domestic development in each area of technology   The Bank has
already acted as a catalyst for improved consultation and co-ordination among
the MTV and various parts of the industry. Second, competition must be
gradually, but relentlessly, introduced into MTV's purchasing process,
heretofore served only by monopoly suppliers. So far, the issue has appeared
most sharply in the fields of mobile radiG, subscriber equipment, and small
capacity switching equipment. Because of MTV's role as a major purchaser of
domestically produced equipment, the development of a competitive
manufacturing environment will greatly depend on MTV's procurement strategy.
The development of and agreement on such a policy and strategy will be an
important part of the proposed TC II project (paras 3.32 and 7.01 (a)).
1.14        MTV4User Relations.   Currently, there are no for.mal institutions
that represent users' interests in the telecommunications sector. Development
of this kind of association is an important part of the process of making MTV
a user-oriented, commercial enterprise. One step in this direction was the
initiation of local telephone associations. These were originally designed as
temporary organizations of business, cooperatives and local governments to
mobilize additional resources and accelerate extension of service. Telephone

associations have been an overall success--not least because they brought
telecom providers and users into contact in non-traditional fora--and MTV is
both extending them and examining ways to expand the concept.  Another
important step will be for MTV to create a special office to deal with the
' -rge user community -- especially business: to ascertain their needs and push
.ys of meeting them rapidly and efficiently. A program for such a mechanism
is part of the agreed Action Plan.
TI.   THE TELECOMWJNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER -
MAGYAR TAVKOZLE3I VALLALAT (MTV)
A. Existing Facilities and Access to Service
2.01        Telephone.  At the end of 1988 there were 1.57 million telephones
and 858 225 direct exchange lines (DELs) in operation in Hungary, giving a
density of 15.8 telephones and 8.1 DELs per 100 population. This compares
poorly with other iuropean countries at a similar level of per capita income,
including other Bank borrowers, such as Yugoslavia and Portugal, whose
penetration rates, in 1988, w.re about 40% and 83% higher, respectively, than
Hungary's (see Annex 2). In addition, telephone facilities are geographically
unbalanced. Budapest, with only 20% of the population, has about 50X of ti.e
telephones. Outside Budapest, the west and north are better served than the
south and east. In 1988, penetration was 37 telephones per 100 population in
Budapest, but averaged only 10:100 for the rest of the country (ranging from a
high of 14:100 in the best served county to 6:100 in the worst served county).
Total installed exchange capacity in Hungary at the end of 1988 was 1.05
million, of which 858,225 were connected -- giving an exchanige/fill ratio of
82%. Automatic switching capacity is equally divided between rotary and
crossbar/electromechanical types. Ninety-one percent of local exchange
capacity is automatic -- 100% in Budapest and 83% elsewhere. This is one of
the lowest percentages of automatization in Europe. Of 2,226 local telephone
exchanges in the country, 1,916 (86%) are still manual. Some of these are
without 24 hour service allowing calls to be made only during office hours.
2.02        Long Distance.  The long distance network is comprised of 39 trunk
exchanges interconnected with some 31,000 circuits  irried by microwave,
coaxial cable and open wire systems. Long distance automatization is even
lower than local -- 93X of DELs in Budapest have subscriber trunk dialing
(STD) but only 77% elsewhere, giving a nationwide average of 85.2%. At the
end of 1987, only 1,000 towns and villages out of 3,066 were connected to the
STD network. The rest (2,066 localities) were served by manual trunk
exchanges. From about 1,829 million trunk calls in 1987, 481 million (26%)
were made via manual trunk exchanges. There are 23,044 public call offices
(PCOs).
2.03        International.  Hungary now has international direct dialing (IDD)
access to 107 countries through an international exchange, and through
microwave and satellite circuits. At the end of 1988, there were 4,500
international circuits, up from 1,489 in 1980, a growth rate of 14.81 p.a.



- 5 -
2.04     International traffic has increased by 25.6% p.a. during the seventh
Five Year Plan (FYP), well above the rate of growth in the number of circuits.
Despite the installation of a new digital international exchange in Budapest
in 1988, the rapid increase in demand is outrunning the growth in capacity --
causing congestion and decreased service quality as more customers seek more
and better international access. The majority of international traffic is
business-related. As the firms cannot do business without telephone contact
with their foreign suppliers and customers, a shortage of circuits is
constraining growth of Hungarian business abroad.
2.05    Telex. telegraph. data.  These services are even less developed than
telephone. Only 12,614 subscribers have telex service at the end of 1988 (a
density of 11.9 per 10,000 population). There is one main exchange in
Budapest, and one in each of the five main regional cities, plus 17 other
exchanges, located elsewhere in the country. The Budapest exchange is stored
program controlled (SPC) and handles telex, data and automatic telegraph
traffic. The remainder of exchanges are electromechaaical and handle telex
and telegraph traffic. The network is fully subscriber dialed with access to
most countries of the world. There are 325 post offices and 1,200
teleprinters connected to the automated telegraph network. Since 1981,
Hungary has had a small data network based on the Budapest exchange, to which
approximately 1500 customers are currently connected. The total number of
data terminals is around 2,364.
2.06        Usage of Service.  Tariffs for telephone usage (as distinct from
rental and connection charges) have remained constant from 1981 to the
present. Revenue from telephone usage charges is, therefore, a good indicator
of total traffic, and of overall usage of the telecommunications network
during that period. As can be seen from Table 2.1, usage growth has
accelerated dramatically during the decade. During the first period, 1981 -
1985, this measure of usage (revenue) grew by 10.2% p.a. while the number of
subscribers with access to service (i.e., the number of DELs) grew by 3.8%
p.a. Usage (revenue) per DEL thus grew by 6.2% p.a. In the second period,
1985 through 1989, usage (revenue) grew by 16.2% p.a., the number of DELs grew
by 5.2% p.a. and usage per DEL grew by 10.5%   Thus, nOt only has total usage
accelerated, but each DEL has been used ever more intensively. The high rate
of traffic growth per DEL indicates the large demand for telecommunications
services and the low usage tariffs -- which have been stable in nominal terms
and declining in real terms. Rapid acceleration in traffic per DEL is
compounding the problem of congestion and poor service quality caused by past
low levels of investment and maintenance.

Note:  Call revenue, at constant tariffs, is a proxy for usage; connected DELS
is a proxy for access.
2.07        Quality of Service.  The quality of service is poor, reflecting
poor planning, unbalanced expansion, and inadequate replacement and
maintenance. Given the low level of resources allocated to telecommunications
in the past, GOH and MP policy was to allocate a disproportionate share of
available (and inadequate) resources to new DELs. As a result, maintenance
and replacement of obsolete and worn-out equipment received insufficient
attention prior to 1983. MTV estimates that at the end of 1988, 25% of the
exchanges and 18% of outside plant facilities required replacement. System
overload is such a severe problem that MTV had to introduce partial or
complete restriction on new connections in more than 100 of 344 exchanges.
Overall call completion rates are poor at 46% for local calls, 52% for long
distance and 34% for subscriber-dialed international calls. Based on
international experience, for a country at Hungary's level of development,
these rates should be 70%, 60% and 45% respectively. Long delays (up to
several hours) in manual long distance calls are a problem, as are excessive
noise, echo, and signal attenuation.
2.08        Specific technical factors in the low quality of service include
the following:
(a)   worn-out local subscriber networks (both cables and local
exchanges);
(b)   insufficient traffic handling capacity in local exchanges;
(c)   obsolete and insufficient long distance switching and transmission
capacity--especially outside of Budapest and a few main cities;and
(d)   insufficient fault monitoring, traffic measuring and traffic
engineering.
MTV management is aware of these problems and, as part of the Seventh Five
Year Plan (1986-1990), is executing a plan to improve operations and service
quality. This plan, which is supported by the First Telecommunication
Project, gives priority to replacement of old cables and the oldest switching
systems, rehabilitation of local and long distance networks and increase in
the traffic handling capacity of the system.



2.09        Network Growth and Demand for Service.  In the past, the
telecommunications network has not grown sufficiently to provide balanced
support for the overall development of the economy. During the period 1980-
1986, investment in telecommunications averaged only 0.38Z of GDP. Countries
at similar GDP levels typically invest 2 - 4 times as much. From 1980 - 1985,
the number of DELs grew at 3.8% p. a., when the growth rate for similar
countries was 2 - 4 times higher. In the Seventh FYP, the average growth rate
of DELs has improved to over 5.0% p. a. This is still relatively low,
however, by the standards of comparable middle-income countries.

2.10        During the Seventh FYP, the waiting list for phones increased from
460,000 in 1985 to 524,000 in 1988. This constitutes 38X of expressed demand
(expressed demand is the sum of installed DELs plus the waiting list) which is
about what it was in 1985. (In other words, as the number of DELs has
increased the waiting list has also grown at about the same rate.) The
telephone waiting list represents a 10-year backlog at the average rate of new
DEL installation achieved during the 1985-1989 period. Furthermore,
experience suggests that many potential residential customers do not sign up
because the backlog is so large. Business customers who have a phone line are
not recorded on the waiting list although, in fact, they may need and want
more lines. There were 1,400 potential telex subscribers on the waiting list
for telex services (101 of expressed demand). One factor which aggravates
long waiting lists in many LDCs and NICs is low connection charges. However,
Hungary has some of the highest connection charges in the world--and these
were raised further in 1987 without greatly reducing the waiting list (though,
presumably, at some point they would begin to bite if the initial backlog
could be cleared).   The Bank's experience elsewhere is that demand for
telecommunications is price inelastic at a given income per capita until
penetration rises above a critical level. Hungary's penetration rate appears
to be well below this critical threshold for its income per capita.
2.11        Despite rehabilitation efforts and large increased investment
during the decade, the supply of telecommunications facilities and services
will remain inadequate relative to demand throughout the 1990s. Therefore,
measures to improve the efficiency of network use are critical. Such measures
were begun as a part of the First Telecommunications Project. They include
better fault monitoring, improved traffic engineering, and expanded use of



- 9 -
differential tariffs to ration capacity. More, however, will be needed.
Development of an agreed program for improving the efficiency of r.etwork use
will be part of the project (para. 4.18).
2.12        Previous Bank Activities and Experience.  The Bank has been
involved in Hungarian telecommunications development from 1985 and had made a
loan fr- US$70.0 million -- First Telecommunications Project, Loan 2847-HU
(Report No. 6709-HU of April 27, 1987). The main objective of the project,
scheduled to be implemented during 1987-1991, was to support Hungary's program
of reform and development of the telecom sector by increasing MP's financial
and administrative autonomy, flexibility and efficiency, as well as providing
modest expansion of the network and technical assistance for finance and
technical matters. The project has been successful so far, the physical
targets have been slightly overachieved, technical assistance was very
effective. Fifty-one percent of the loan had been disbursed as of June 15,
1990 which is ahead of both the original schedule and the Bank profile (44%
and 48%, respectively). Institutional goals have been met both regulatory,
authority and postal operations have been separated from telecom operations.
The latter have been reconstituted as a commercial company (MTV) as of January
1, 1990. Further institutional improvements are called for and expected during
the Second Project. Improvements in operating costs and efficiency have not
been achieved at the desired level and will therefore constitute an important
focus of attention in the second project (para 7.01, Annex 8).
2.13        The highlights of the Technical Assistance during the first
Project are: (i) a tariff structure study which helped MTV to better address
its weakness in cost allocation and traffic data required for better financial
projections and the need for tariff rebalancixtg; (ii) a digitalization
strategy study which validated the concept of an overlay digital network
strategy and exposed the need for centralized computerized operation and
maintenance organization and management in the emerging digital network; (iii)
design and staffing of a national software center for digital exchanges in
Hungarian environment; (iv) a traffic engineering study which exposed traffic
inefficiencies and a need for a complete traffic matrix for network
optimization; (v) other activities included initial study of a MIS system,
telephone associations, regulatory options and development of an accounting
system.
2.14        The other substantial work performed in the sector was an
Infrastructure Review, with a separate telecommunications section (Report No.
7775-HU). The main benefit was an objective valuation of the difficult
situation in the Hungarian telecommunications manufacturing industry and the
recommendations. For practical reasons, assistance to the industry is being
channeled through the Second Industrial Restructuring and the First Technology
Development Project.

III. THE PROJECT AND THE PROGRAK
A. Project Obiectives
3.01        Overview.  The modernization of systems for generating,
transmitting and processing information is indispensable for the success of
Hungary's reform program. The reform calls for decentralization, flexibility,
reliance on market signals and increased exports. These cannot occur without
improved information transmission and processing--which in turn depend on
expanding, modernizing and improving the quality of the telecommunications
system. There is general agreement that the current TC system is severely
underdeveloped and constitutes a significant impediment to economic
development and reform. Estimates have been made in Hungary that show losses
to the economy of 40 to 80 billion Ft per year from inadequate TC, while
investment in TC during the Seventh FYP has only been around 10 Ft billion
p.a. These losses affect export as well as domestic income, especially
exports to convertible currency markets in which rapid access to buyers,
suppliers, and market information via electronic means is crucial for success.
Furthermore, in the coming years, the growth of new business activity,
catalyzed by the revolutionary changes in economic and political environment,
foreign investment, etc., will stimulate a significant increase in demand for
business related services, adding to the existing problem of high and
unsatisfied demand for TC services.
3.02        Beginning in the mid-1980s the GOH, recognizing the importance of
telecommunications to economic development, decided to give it a higher
strategic priority and to increase investment substantial'ly. In the Seventh
FYP (1986-90), approximately Ft 40 billion will have been spent, double the
amount in the Sixth FYP. By the end of the Seventh Plan in 1990, about
450,000 lines of capacity will have been installed of which approximately one-
third is for replacement of worn-out existing lines. The First
Telecommunications Project supports this development, which has several
specific goals: connecting some 200,000 new subscribers, major rehabilitation
work, automatization of some areas, expansion of the long distance and
international network, and expansion of the telex and data network. The
strategy of this period has focused on rehabilitation and expansion of the
local and long-distance cable and transmission infrastructure rather than on
switching because it was felt that it was better to wait for the expected
relaxation of COCOM control of digital equipment before making major
investments in switching and, in the meantime, improvement of the transmission
infrastructure was needed in any event and would not be affected by the
ultimate choice of switching system.
3.03        The GOH's Telecommunications Development Program.  There is
consensus in Hungary that a major program of expansion, modernization and
reform of the TC sector is needed in order to keep pace with Hungary's effort
to catch up with the rest of Europe. The overall TC goal is to achieve a
rough parity with the West European average (about 45-50 DELs per 100
population) by around 2010.



- 11 -
3.04        Such a program must address all t:hree segments of the sector:
services, manufacturing, and the user community. Recognizing the need for a
comprehensive sectoral approach, the MP prepared a Concept Paper on TC
development from 1991 - 2000 for the GOH's Planning and Economic Committee
(PEC) "Tervgazdasagi Bizottsag" dated May 18, 1988. This paper described the
achievements and issues related to the execution of the Seventh FYP, proposed
new activities to prepare for the next five years and requested permission to
draw up a detailed plan. In preparing the Concept Paper, MP relied on several
of its own earlier studies and strategy papers (e.g., MP's Long-Term
Development Concepts; MP's Digitalization Plan; Guidelines for the Preparation
of the 10-Year Plan; Hardware Requirements for the 10-Year Plan; and, The
Economic Position of Telecommunications in Hungary). The goals of the Concept
Paper were by the year 2000 to: (i) approximately treble the number of
subscribers; (ii) complete automatization of the network; (iii) substantial
improvement in quality of service.
3.05        The PEC accepted MP's Concept Paper in May, 1988 as a basis for
further work, and, in June the Council of Ministers confirmed this. As a
result, the PEC authorized the MP, the IpM and the Ministry of Trade to
jointly prepare a draft for a detailed TC Development Program, 1991-2000,
which would harmonize the activities of the entire sector in pursuit of the
above goals. The PEC also authorized the creation of an Advisory Group to
advise and comment on the preparation of the 10-Year Program. This group was
made up of representatives from academia, users, other Government departments,
TCMI and MP, and was chaired by the State Office for Technology Development
(OMFB).
3.06        The technical, economic and financial calculations were largely
completed and the final proposal readied for presentation to the Government by
the end of 1989. Actual presentation, however, was delayed by the political
situation and the election. The main determinants of the 10-Year Development
Plan are the following:
(a)   Installed capacity to reach 3.46 million by 2000. Starting from
958,000 connected DELs at the end of 1990, there should be a net
addition of 1.85 million connected DELs. This implies a growth
rate of 11.4X p.a. in connected DELs, and would achieve a density
of about 27 DELs/100 by the end of the decade. This in turn would
reduce the avere-e waiting time from 12 years today to about one
year (see Annex 3).
(b)   The costs of the 10-Year Plan are currently estimated to be
approximately Ft 326 billion. Calculations are based on an
average cost per new DEL of Ft. 140,000 (approx. $2150) including
land, buildings, outside plant, local and long distance switching,
facsimile etc.) MTV's current estimate for convertible currency
requirements is $1.2 billion over the 10 years (23X of the total).

3.07        In the course of developing the 10-Year Program, there has been
extensive debate, e.g., regarding how large a share of national resources
should be devoted to TC development, what institutional and structural
arrangements are optimal, what role is appropriate for Government vis-a-vis
the MTV, other potential service providers and the TCMI, etc. This debate has
led to significant modification and reduction from the original concept to the
present plan. It is quite likely that this discussion will continue under the
new government and that strategy and the key parameters deriving from it will
continue to be modified. This is normal and desirable -- every successful TC
entity around the world engages in this kind of rolling, flexible and dynamic
process of continuously forecasting, planning, then re-examining and adjusting
its plans. This is far better than the rigid planning of the past in which
targets were "fixed in stone" for five year periods.
3.08        The proposed 10-Year Plan is ambitious.  The percentage of GDP
devoted to TC investment would rise from the 0.37% in the early 80s and 0.6%
in the last few years to over 1.5% and 2.0% in the 90s. The rate of growth in
DELs would rise from 3.8% p.a. in the early 80s and 5.6% in the late 80s to
11.3% p.a. in the 90s. However, judged by international experience and by
internal projections, the plan, while ambitious, is certainly feasible.
Several other middle income countries have invested equal or larger
percentages of their GDP in TC and have achieved similar or greater rates of
growth (Tables 2.2 and 2.3).
3.09        Structural Reform.  Together with the physical expansion and
modernization of the telecommunication network, Hungary must reform the
institutional structure of its telecommunication sector to accommodate rapidly
changing technical and economic environment. This reform will necessarily
involve:
(a)   reducing the traditional telecom monopoly and permitting new
enterprises to enter selected portions of the market;



- 13 -
(b)   changing the ownership structure and governance of MTV to permit
it to compete in a commercial fashion; and
(c)   the creation of a regulatory framework and institution to manage
the transition from a traditional monolithic state PTT to a more
open, liberal and diversified sector.
3.10        Such a regulatory framework must address, inter alia, the
following questions:
(a)   which enterprise will be permitted in which market segments and
when;
(b)   how franchises and licensees (including for radio spectrum) will
be awarded; and
(c)   the obligation of MTV and other carriers to provide services, and
to interconnect, quality of services, tariff, standards, protocols
and interfaces, anti-competitive activity, monitoring, dispute
resolution, and modification of regulations over time.
3.11        In the past, these functions were exercised within the single
monolithic PTT. Once competition enters the market and commercial criteria
become dominant, it is no longer appropriate for the MTV to be both
competitive and regulatory. This is universally recognized thrcughout Europe,
the developed world and most of the developing world. However, different
countries are experimenting with different solutions. It is not clear which,
if any, is the best. Each country must find a solution which fits its own
needs, circumstances, and stage of development.
3.12        At the end of 1989 and early 1990, the Bank supported through the
First Telecommunication Project the creation of a team of Government and MTV
experts to prepare a study of structural and regulatory options. This study
is now nearly complete and will form a major input to Government. The
proposed project includes a requirement that, six months after the date of
effectiveness, the Government will develop and furnish to the Bank time-bound
action plan to address the structural issues (e.g., the introduction of
commercialization and competition into selected subsectors such as terminal
equipment, value-added services, mobile telephone, etc., and the regulatory
issues arising therefrom: interconnection, franchising, tariffs, quality of
service, etc.) and thereafter implement the recommendation agreed with the
Bank (para. 7.02 (a)).  In 1987 the European Commission issued a broad
framework for development and harmonization in these areas. The Green Paper,
as it was known, has subsequently given rise to several specific directives
dealing with terminal equipment, value added services, private lines, etc.
While leaving some room for individual country interpretation, the Green Paper
policies are beginning to establish the basis for regulatory harmonization in
Europe. In keeping with Hungary's goal of increasing integration with Europe
it would be desirable for her TC regulatory policies to move gradually into
line with the rest of Europe.

3.13        The Bank's Strategy.  The Bank has consistently supported a TC
policy in Hungary consisting of:
At the entekprise/network level:
(a)   faster development and modernization of the TC system (including
automatization and digitalization);
(b)   increased commercialization of MP/MTV; and
(c)   self-financing of TC investment on commercial terms.
At the regulatory/Government level:
(a)   separation of operations from regulatory/policy functions;
(b)   definition and legalization of the regulatory regime; and
(c)   gradual and orderly introduction of alternative suppliers and
competition.
3.14        These remain keystones of the Bank's strategy.  They will be
elaborated and specified for the three year period of the proposed Project as
follows:
(a)   continuation of the ongoing reorganization of MTV's activities
into an efficient, independent commercial company;
(b)   emphasis on digitalization (now that COCOM makes this possible);
(c)   emphasis on servicing the business community by improving
traditional services and rapidly introducing new services directed
at business subscribers (in order to maximize revenue to finance
system growth and to maximize short-term contribution to the
economy's supply respo-nse);
(d)   a strategy for supporting restructuring TC manufacturing sec_or
into a modern, competitive industry;
(a)   reform ef procurement ar.l related procedures to reduce costs of
investment and to supp3rt (d);
(f)   a program for introducing new entrants into selected TC markets
together with development of a regulatory regime to manage this
process; and
(g)   preparation and introduction of outside finance and managerial
expertise into the new company.

B. Teleconunications Network and Serice
3.15        Overview.  The Project focuses on improvement and expansion of the
telecommunications network and services. The Project is a time slice of MTV's
investment program for the period 1991 - 1993. The two principal objectives
of the Project are:
(a)   to build an overlay digital long-distance network, expand
international communications capability, and connect the majority
of high-volume business subscribers to these new facilities.  This
will nave the combined effect of relieving the most congested
pnrtion of the network -- thus improving service for all
subscribers -- anu cf providing high quality nationwide TC
services to the critjcal business sector in the shortest possible
time; and
(b)   institutional improvement of MTV designed to increase efficiency,
quality of service and commercial orientation.
C.  Proiect Description
3.16        The Project consists of the following elements:
(a)   the physical investment program;
(b)   institutional strengthening through:
(i)   human resource management and development;
(ii) measures to increase efficiency and
productivity; and
(iii) measures to increase quality of service; and
(c)   technical assistance to support the institutional
strengthening.
D. The Investment Program
3.17        The investment program comprises:
(a)   an overlay digital long-distance network consisting of:
(i)   19 trunk exchanges with capacity of some 158,000 trunk
lines;
(ii)  1,400 km fiber optic (FO) transmission systems with about
1,050 2MBs channels ani 40 microwave systems with some 640
2MBs channels.



- 16 -
(b)   expansion of the international network with (i) Intelsat and
Eutelsat grcund stations; (ii) expansion of the international
gateway exchange with about 2,000 new international circuits; and
(iii) expansion of international telex and data circuits.
(c)   provision and installation of 520,000 lines of local switching
capacity of which 490,000 will be new (139,000 in Budapest) and
30,000 for replacement; associated local network and subszriber
plant for some 393,000 new subscribers who will be connected. Of
the new subscribers, about 284,000 (72%) would be high-volume
business customers.
(d)   expansion of the rural network by 1,300 km of FO cable
transmission systems with about 1,140 2Mbs channels and 200
microviave systems with 470 2Mbs channels.
(e)   expansion of mobile radio telephone network with 13,200
subscribers; introduction and expansion of telex and data services
to about 11,800 subscribers; and the installation of some 1,000
card pay phones.
E. Institutional Strengthening
3.18        The institutional strengthening of MTV will have two parts:
(a)   development and execution of a master plan for human resources
management and development in conformity with the corporate
objectives of MTV to be used as a vehicle for organizational
changes; and
(b)   measures to increase efficiency and productivity of MTV's
operation through the design and implementation of performance
criteria, HIS systems, accounting systems, incentive structures
etc., which would be customer and service-oriented, cost and
efficiency-conscious, and market-driven.
F. Technical assistance. cooReration and training.
3.19        Technical assistance and cooperation will consist of consultancy
and cooperation with foreign TC administrations designed to:
(a)   implement findings of studies undertaken during the first Telecom
Project for improving efficiency in operation and investment,
i.e.:
(i)   optimal digitalization strategy;
(ii)  Management Information System; and
(iii) adaptation of software to integrate digital systems with the
existing network.



- 17 -
(b)   develop measures to improve efficiency made possible by new
legislation, i.e.:
(i)   design and implementation of commercial accounting system;
and
(ii)  reorganization of MTV into commercial joint stock company.
(c)   help adapt MTV to new commercial and competitive environment,
i.e.:
(i)   development of new services;
(ii)  rebalancing of tariffs;
(iii) development of marketing system;
(iv)  development of competitive procurement system; and
(v)   strategy and plan for improving the management and
development of Human Resources.
Foreign assistance will amount to about 88.5 manmonths
complemented with some 126 manmoaths of study visits aud training of Hungarian
experts abroad (see Annex 11).
3.20        The training component will be related to both the investment
program and to MTV's organizational changes, especially in the training of
middle and top managers in commercial operation in the new environment. The
estimated amount of training is some 1,000 manweeks mainly in Hungary but
using foreign trainers amounting to about 100 manmonths. Training will be
directed at reducing costs and improving operating and investment performance.
Main elements will relate to:
(a)   accounting and financial analysis as it relates to improved
operations and investment;
(b)   implementation of digital system (network design and optimization,
software development, etc.);
(c)   marketing and new service development;
(d)   human resource management and development; and
(e)   operations and maintenance.
3.21        During negotiations, the project objectives and descriptions have
been confirmed.
G. Cost Estimates
3.22        Total project cost is estimated at FT 83.99 billion ($1.355
billion) with a foreign exchange component of FT 21.84 billion ($352 million).
These costs are based on estimated late 1989 prices for equipment services and
civil works. The local cost component includes customs duties and taxes (FT
3.95 billion). Cost details are given in Annex 6 and summarized below.

H. Least Cost Solution
3.23             The  timing  and dimensions  of various  elements  in  the  system are
based on generally accepted engineering practice for selection of techniques
and equipment after study of feasible alternatives subject to the
international restrictions on export of equipment and technologies. Project
planning is based upon least cost solution methodologies which are
satisfactory. The agreed investment program represents the least cost
solution for providing the service levels planned with the constraints imposed
by the existing configuration and technology of the telecommunications
network.
I. Contingencies
3.24             Physical  contingencies  are based on 4.0%  for  local  and  foreign
equipment, 5% for local civil works and 8% for local and foreign services.
Price contingencies are based on annual foreign cost increase of 4% p.a. in
1990 and 3% p.a. thereafter. Local cost increases are based on 11.5% p.a.
during the project period.

J. Financing
3.25        The proposed sources of financing are as follows:

* Includes EIB loan of $100 million expected to be approved in
October 1990. Financing sources for the remaining foreign costs
($90 million) have been identified.
3.26        The project cost estimates and financing arrangements were
confirmed during negotiations.
K. Procurement
3.27        Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.4.  The Bank
loan would finance $150 million of equipment, materials and associated
services, $143.3 million (or 95.5%) of which would be procured through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines. Farticipation of Hungarian suppliers in the bidding
is expected to be limited since equipment and supplies to be procured under
the loan are generally not manufactured in Hungary or not manufactured in
sufficient quantity. Nevertheless, Hungarian enterprises competing under ICB
will be eligible for a preference of 15% on the delivery at frontier (DAF)
value of the bids, or the amount of custom duties and taxes, whichever is
lower. International shopping based on price quotations from at least three
suppliers from at least two eligible source councries, would be used for
packages with an estimated value below US$300,000, and not exceeding an
aggregate of US$5.0 million. Procurement of goods which are of proprietary
nature, which require standardization with existing equipment or for which
early delivery is crucial for expedient project execution, would be carried
out through direct contracting.
3.28        All bid packages for goods estimated to cost US$1 million
equivalent and above and proposals for invitation packages for consulting
services would be subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement
documentation. It is estimated that the Bank's prior review of procurement



- 20 -
documentation would cover about 75% of the total estimated value of contracts.
The balance of contracts would be subject to the Bank's review after contract
award. Recent relaxation of COCOM limits, effective July 1, 1990 will
practically eliminate restrictions on most of the equipment to be purchased
with the Bank loan. Nevertheless, the Bank will continue to review bid
documents prior to issuance for possible residual problems.
3.29           .-rocuremeaLt of items financed by EIB would be in accordance with
EIB's procurement regulations which are acceptable to the Bank. The remaining
import items (not financed by the Bank) would be procured by MTV under
procedures similar to ICB, negotiated contracts and direct. purchase. Locally
produced goods are procured according to usual MTV and telecommunications
industry practice, through local competitive bidding, direct purchase, and
negotiated prices as appropriate, subject to GOH regulations which are
satisfactory. For outside plant and building construction not being financed
by the Bank, local competitive bidding woutld be sought from qualified local
contractors with due regard to economy and efficiency. Contracts for
consultant services and training being financed by the Bank. totalling $1.73
million would be awarded according to Bank guidelines for use of consultants.
During negotiations, the procurement arrangements have been confirmed.

L. Disbursements
3.30        Disbursements from the proceeds of the proposed loan would be made
for:
(a)   100% of foreign expenditures of directly imported goods and 100%
of local ex-factory costs for goods manufactured in Hungary;
(b)   100% of total expenditures for consultants' services.
Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for
expenditures in respect of contracts valued below $300,000 equivalent, which
may be submitted on the basis of certified statements of expenditure (SOEs).
In this case, supporting documentation would be retained by MTV for at least
one year after teceipt by the Bank of the audit report for the period during
which the last disbursement was made and would be made available to auditors
and Bank supervision missions upon request. In order to facilitate project
implementation, a special account in the amount of $10.Om equivalent
representing four months of average expenditures would be established and
maintained by the Borrower and would be used for all expenditures.  No
retroactive financing is envisaged in the proposed project. The estimated
disbursement schedule for the project is shown in Annex 10. The loan closing
date is June 30, 1996.
M'. Project Implementation
3.31        MTV will be responsible for overall project implementation.
Depending upon the organizational setup of the new MTV company, the investment
and implementation will be divided. A central unit will handle all World Bank
procurement, through specialized trading houses in the case of import or
through its own import organization (creation of which is under
consideration). The evaluation and award of bids is under the authority of
MTV and does not need further approval. The award committees are comprised of
headquarters technical staff assisted by economists and lawyers.
Decentralized development staff around the country, are in charge of day-to-
day implementation.
3.32        In order to improve cost effectiveness, especially at a time when
the network is fast developing, investment cost per DEL must be very closely
controlled. As material and equipment costs constitute a substantial part of
investment, competitive procurement is essential to keep costs down. In the
changing environment, MTV has to adopt a procurement strategy, supported by
adequate policy and day-to-day implementation practices, which will advance
this objective. During the First Telecommunications Project, domestic
procurement was mainly from monopoly suppliers and therefore without
competition. Under the proposed Telecom II project, a limited competitive
environment would gradually coming into place. MTV is determined to use its
buying power on the domestic market to facilitate competition as much as
possible. One tool is MTV's Procurement Policy Statement to be announced
early 1991 and followed in a pragmatic way in the future. MTV believes, and



- 22 -
the Bank supports the notion, that the gradual introduction of a competitive
purchasing process will benefit MTV as well as the suppliers. Agreements were
reached during negotiations that the competitive purchasing process aimed at
doubling the percentage of purchase covered by competitive procedures by 1993,
as compared to 1990, will be introduced. The projected percentages of
competitive procurement would be 25%, 35% and 45% of all purchases in 1991,
1992 and 1993, respectively, as set out in the Procurement Policy Statement
which will form a part of MTV's corporate behavior (para 7.01 (a) and Annex
4).
3.33        MTV is contemplating using more contractors and complex subproject
deliveries on a turnkey or similar basis in the implementation of the proposed
project in order to cope with the anticipated increase in volume and
complexity of development activity. There are also plans in hand to create a
specialized technical unit at headquarters responsible for writing, evaluating
and awarding the different tenders and supervising their implementation and
final acceptance from contractors. The unit will be supported with a
management information subsystem with financial and time control functions
built in. MTV's staff has adequate experience in project implementation and
their implementation capability has been satisfactory so far. However, the
plans for more aggressive development together with elimination of state
support will necessitate still more efficient and cost conscious mechanisms.
Although MTV is fully aware of this, and is making preparations, whether
actual performance will be fully satisfactory is yet to be seen. In any case,
the more complex installations and new technology will require special
assistance and supervision by contractors and suppliers.
3.34        Under the first World Bank project, MP set up a small World Bank
Project Unit to coordinate the tender document preparation, bid evaluation and
contract award and to monitor the execution of contracts. This unit is also
responsible for administration of the technical assistance program and for
preparing the semiannual progress report for the Bank. This unit has been a
success and will, although in a changed form, be continued by MTV for the
second project. The proposed project is expected to be completed by December
31, 1995.
N. Performance Indicators
3.35        Performance indicators for monitoring the execution of the project
have been agreed upon during negotiations together with targets for each
indicator in each year of the project. The main indicators, which are
detailed in Annex 8, cover:
(a)   development indicators:  e.g., connected DELs, switching capacity,
etc.;
(b)   quality of service indicators:  e.g., call completion ratio, fault
incidence, operator response time, etc.;
(c)   efficiency indicators: e.g., staff per 100 DELs, cost and revenue
per DEL, etc.; and



- 23 -
(d)   financial performance indicators:  e.g., internal cash generation,
debt service coverage, rate of return, etc.
3.36        Agreement was reached that MTV will provide semi-annual reports to
the Bank in which it will analyze its performance vis-a-vis the agreed
indicators and will annually reach agreement with the Bank on targets,
monitoring and any necessary corrective measures for the subsequent years.
0. Tariffs
3.37        Under the first Telecom Project, a major study of tariff structure
was undertaken by foreign consultants working with MP staff. The final
report, which appeared in mid-1989, recommended re-balancing tariffs: (i)
initially to reflect scarcity and congestion; and later (ii) to reflect cost
modifi3d by Ramsey principles as congestion and supply constraints are eased.
The Bank has broadly supported this direction in its dialogue, with the
addition that reasonable consideration must also be given to social goals
(e.g. rural development) and political constraints on drastic tariff changes,
and a good understanding now exists between Bank staff and both MTV and GOH
authorities.
3.38        The overall level of tariffs needed to meet financial and economic
goals depends upon a number of important factors, e.g.: success (or
otherwise) in reducing operating costs, the level and cost of investment,
growth of traffic per line, success in increasing the call completion rate,
etc. The above mentioned study estimated, based on assumptions which the
authors themselves believed to be too pessimistic, that aggregate real tariffs
would need the rise by 5X p.a. through 1995 and could fall by about the same
amount in the second half of the decade. Using later information (e.g.
reduced investment needs, and the influence of revenue from new services),
Bank staff estimated that the real tariff level of 1989 (prior to the recent
burst of inflation), if maintained, should be broadly sufficient for the
foreseeable future.
3.39        Of course, actual needs and developments cannot be known with
certainty at this time. Tariffs must be adjusted to evolving circumstances in
a sensitive, rational and timely manner. Sincn January 1989. responsibility
for tariffs has been shared by the MTV (as operator) with the MTCW (as the
Ministry with direct responsibility) and with other interested Ministries
(principally the Ministry of Finance). Therefore, Bank strategy on tariffs
has focussed on: (i) restoring the aggregate real tariffs to the December
1989 level (para. 7.02(a)) in order to prevent short-term financial
deterioration; and on, (ii) establishing a modern, flexible and responsive
tariff-setting mechanism and methodology which will be robust through time.
This, in turn, involves both the company, which must improve its price setting
competence, and the Government which must clarify and improve its tariff-
regulating capacity. The first is addressed in the Action Plan and Technical
Assistance for MTV (paras. 3.19(c), 4.18(d), Annexes 11 and 21). The second



- 24 -
is addressed in ongoing technical assistance under the first Telecom Project
and agreements reached with the Guarantor (paras 3.20 and 7.02(a)).
IV. THE BORROWER
A.  Organization of MTV
4.01        Until July 1983, MP was a department within the Ministry of
Transport. During the period 1983 to January 1989, Communications was
separated from Transport and made a discrete sector for national planning
purposes under its own Secretary of State. In addition, MP was converted into
a separate state enterprise, with its own budget, investment plan, internal
organization and legal authority. The Secretary of State was also the
President of MP. Both the President and the four Vice Presidents were
appointed directly by the Council of Ministers. The President of MP, in his
capacity as Secretary of State, also had the powers of a Minister for the
Communications sector.
4.02        In January 1989, the MP was incorporated into the new Ministry of
Transport, Communications and Water Management (MTCW), and a new President of
MP was nominated. The title of Secretary of State was devolved to the newly
created Ministry. Regulatory and policy responsibilities for the sector were
transferred to the new Ministry. Within MTCW, the Telecommunications Division
is responsible for regulation and the Policy Division for studying and
preparing GOH's policy decisions in the field of telecommunications. The most
important task is preparation of the new Communications law.
4.03        In January 1990, MP's operations were separated into three parts:
Posts, t;-oadcasting and Telecommunications. The latter were organized into a
new gov-rnment enterprise, Magyar Tavk6zlesi VAllalat or "Hungarian
Telecommunications Company". The intention is to transform this entity into a
limited liability joint-stock company in the middle of 1991. Initially, the
GOH will own all the shares -- responsibility for which will be exercised by
the newly created State Property Fund -- but efforts are already underway to
attract outside equity.
4.04        The new Government in June 1990 reorganized the Ministries and the
MTTC lost its construction part but gained responsibility for water management
becoming the new Ministry for Transport Communications and Water Management
(MTCW).
4.05        In the past, MP was organized as a traditional Government
department, and exhibited traits characteristic of a non-commercial Government
administrative agency. In the years since its initial change in status
(1983), it has moved steadily toward a more decentralized, and commercial form
of organizational structure. As soon as legislation permitting it is passed,
the Government intends to convert MTV into a joint stock company operating
under commercial law. Initially all of the stock would be retained by the
Government, but efforts would begin immediately to seek minority equity
participation from both foreign and local sources. The Bank has strongly



- 25 -
urged and supported this direction, believing it to be important to: (a)
break the de facto operational and managerial umbilical cord between the
Government and the MTV; (b) clarify and distinguish the Government's
legitimate ownership and regulatory interests in MTV; and (c) obtain needed
capital and expertise.
4.06        The current MTV is organized into three levels:  the Directorate
General (DG), the Regional Directorates and the Local Directorates (see Annex
11, page 1). The Director General and three Deputy Directors General, for
Development, Operations and Economics, are governing the Directorate. Legal
and Inspection matters, as well as International Relations, report directly to
the DG. The regulatory and policy functions and responsibilities are now
separated from MTV and vested t.n the Ministry of Transport, Communications and
Water Management. Full articulation of the separation between: (a)
regulatory/policy responsibilities of the MTCW; (b) ownership responsibilities
(exercised by the State Property Fund); and (c) operation responsibilities,
exercised by MTV, will be addressed in the new telecommunications law that is
expected to be enacted in mid 1991.
4.07        As before, the Directorate General (DG) exercises overall
authority and performs policy-making, central planning, and budgeting
functions for MTV. Most routine investment projects are handled by the DG.
Most day-to-day operations, including investments up to a given ceiling, are
carried out by the eight regional directorates. A number of other activities
which were previously centralized activities have been placed in Independent
subsidiaries (ventures) which contract with MTV but can also offer services
outside (see Annex 10). Examples include: research and development,
design and planning, training, transport, etc. The forthcoming organizational
review will analyze and propose further improvement to the organizational
structure of MTV.
B. Human Resources Management and DeveloRment
4.08        With the demise of government funding and gradual introduction of
competition in selected markets, MTV will have to go faster and further in
transforming itself from public utility to a commercial enterprise. For this
it will need to:
(a)   develop a management structure which is able to offer
telecommunication services in an enterprising and businesslike
manner and improve system support for the management of the
business;
(b)   delegate decision making and accountability down to the lowest
feasible levels in the hierarchy and encourage new attitudes in
the staff with appropriate performance-oriented rewards; and
(c)   improve human resources management and development, in order to
achieve its better utilization.



- 26 -
4.09        As a first step, it has been agreed during negotiations that MTV
will initiate actions to improve and actoelerate the development of its human
resources in order to equip itself to: (i) implement technological change and
modernization; and (ii) adjust to the changing economic environment in the
telecommunication sector (commercialization, customer orientation,
competition, demand for new services, etc.).
4.10        'ith the help of foreign consultants, MTV will develop and
implement a Human Resources Management and Development Master Plan. This
Master Plan should define the strategic objectives in the field of human
resources in order to achieve the overall (corporate) strategic objectives of
the new company. The main elements of HR strategic objectives would fall in
the following main categories:
(a)   organization structure;
(b)   organization processes;
(c)   stock of human skills and resources;
(d)   utilization of skills and capacities; and
(e)   motivation.
4.11        Beside defining the main human resources objectives and a strategy
to achieve them in the Master Plan, a review of the most important human
resources functions should be undertaken. The main functions are:
(a)   organizational design and maintenance;
(b)   management control and information system;
(c)   productivity improvements;
(d)   human resources strategy and policy including: (i) overall
planning, (ii) recruitment, (iii) education and training, (iv)
incentives, (v) career structure planning, etc.;
(e)   grievance procedure;
(f)   legal compliance;
(g)   employee relations and communications;
(h)   administration;
(i)   welfare activities; and
(j)   health and availability.
4.12        Manpower and Staffing.  MTV has a total staff of 24,116.  This
gives a staff/DEL ratio of 26.4 per 1,000 in 1989 which is high compared to
other countries at similar levels of development. This measure has shown slow
but steady improvement in recent years, and further reductions will be
monitored by means of performance indicators and the related review and remedy
process.
4.13        Overall, the level of education and training compares favorably
with that of many other Bank telecommunications borrowers. Higher management
and senior technical staff are well educated, experienced and dedicated.
Middle management is well qualified but lacks experience in modern technology
and the commercial approach to operations. Manual and technical workers are
well qualified in traditional technologies but very unfamiliar with new
digital, electronic and optical technologies.



- 27 -
4.14        Training.  Two main sources of training are available to MTV:  (a)
State-run universities, colleges and high schools and (b) specialized
telecommunications and postal training insticutions traditionally run by the
MP but now hived off into independent subsidiaries. A total of 8,500 students
from all of these graduated in the last five years with a specialization in
telecommunications. In addition, 100 - 200 different courses are organized by
MTV for continuing education annually. Training appears adequate for the
equipment in common use, most of which is produced domestically. So long as
system expansion uses domestic equipment, there would be an adequate pool of
qualified personnel in the country to meet MP's needs. More effort will be
required for the introduction cf the new digital electronic technology, and
for the incorporation of commercial management practices (see paras 4.15 -
4.16).
4.15        Project related training.  The project related training will
consist mainly of activities related to the introduction of new technologies
such as maintenance of the new digital exchanges including software, training
in the operation and maintenance of the new fiber optic transmission systems,
training for the new centralized and computerized national network management
centers, training for packet switching network and operations, etc. The
estimated volume of training is for some 1,000 manweeks of Hungarian experts
and some 100 manmonths of foreign trainers. Part of the project related
training will take place with the domestic manufacturing industry where under
licencing the new equipment may be manufactured. This project related
training is in addition to the training provided by the suppliers of the new
equipment and technologies.
4.16        Management training.  Due to massive organizational changes, the
new company will need a huge training program in order to change the culture
of operation and gain a new image. The main aim is to transform MP
telecommunications staff into an efficient, modern, educated and well trained
and motivated work force which will be able to run the telecommunications
operation as a commercially oriented, efficient enterprise. Success will
depend critically on instilling both new attitudes and new skills in all
levels of management. This will be a long-run continuing process. An initial
program for management training to take place during the project period is
being formulated. Preliminary estimates suggest that will require
approximately 100 manmonths of foreign trainer participation and would entail
some 1000 manweeks of training mostly in Hungary. The Master Plan for Human
Resources Management and Development, to be agreed with the Bank, would define
more precisely the requirements and the divisions between different types of
training for different levels of staff with a timebound distribution on the
whole geographic and hierarchical landscape. MTV is considering the use of
the institution of the "twinning" arrangement with some more advanced TC
company for this purpose.
4.17        The salary spread between unskilled and highly skilled staff is
exceptionally narrow, with the rate of pay for top engineers being low by
market standards. With the liberalization of the Hungarian economy, and the
growing importance of telecommunications and related fields to companies



- 28 -
operating in an increasingly commercial mode, MTV will lose trained and
experienced manpower to firms which can pay higher wages for critical skill
categories. MTV is aware of the problem and is addressing it with a program
consisting of incentive schemes based on performance and alternately, by
contracting out some activities (especially construction and maintenance).
C. Action Plan
4.18        The new MTV will have to undergo substantial organizational,
operational and management changes in order to improve its financial viability
and operational efficiency. This has to be dcne simultaneously with the
massive expansion and technical modernization of the network in an environment
undergoing substantial political, economic and regulatory change. As these
are interdependent, the Action Plan (AP) is designed so that priorities in
different areas could be identified, quantified and monitored, allowing for
timely corrective action both from MTV management and GOH. The main areas of
the AP are:
(a)   Definition of corporate mission, strategies, policies, image,
etc., through a Corporate Plan.
(b)   Improvement of operational efficiency, i.e., better utilization of
physical plant, higher quality of service, higher labor
productivity, lower cost and higher revenue per DEL.
(c)   Improvement in investment efficiency, i.e., lowering unit
investment cost per installed capacity, shortening the
construction period, development and in;-oduction of competitive
procurement policy.
(d)   Improvement in financial performance, i.e., introduction of a
modern, commercial accounting system, internal cash generation,
debt service coverage, ROR, tariffs.
(e)   Preparation and implementation of HRM&D Master Plan including,
inter alia, training component; management training.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
5.01        This section reviews the past financial performance of MTV's
Telecom activities and presents projections for the future performance of the
new MTV to the year 2000. The feasibility and profitability of the MTV's
investment program is analyzed--both for the entire 10-year period and for the
1991-1993 time-slice thereof which forms the Bank project. Historical and
projected financial statements have been reclassified and are presented in
accordance with international accounting standards. The detailed financial
statements, upon which the review is based, are included in Annexes 12 through



- 29 -
16. A schedule of tariffs as of December 31, 1989 and a Schedule of Equity
Capital and dividends are provided in Annexes 17 and 18 respectively.
5.02        Historical and future revenues and costs are presented on
different bases owing to the unpredictability of inflation. Historical and
estimated 1990 data are given in current forints, while the 1991 - 2000
projections are presented in constant 1989 prices. Price indices for past
years are provided in Table 5.1 to enable comparison of historical trends in
real terms with future projections.
B. Past Performance and Present Position
5.03        The actual Investment Program and Financing Plan, Income
Statements, Statements of Sources and Applications of Funds, schedules of
Comparative Ratios and Data, schedules of key quantitative and value analyses
and assumptions of revenues and costs for MTV for the years 1986 to 1990 are
set forth in Annexes 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, respectively. Table 5.1 below
provides financial data and ratios summarizing past and present financial
performance.
5.04        During the period 1987 through 1990 the number of telephone lines
(DELs) in service will have increased by about 6% per year while total
operating revenue will have increased by an average of 18% per year, the
additional margin being due to the combination of increased traffic per line
and tariff increases. Abstracting from the increase in DELs: the rate of
revenue increase per DEL will have declined over the period--from 15% in 1987
to an estimated 12% in 1990 (averaging a decrease of 11% per year) --largely
due to absence of tariff increases in the latter years. Operating expenses,
on the other hand, have continued to expand increasing by an average of 20%
per year over the period. Op3rating Expenses per DEL show the same trend,
rising at an average rate of 22% exceeding the rate of increase of operating
revenue per DEL. This is reflected in the operating ratio which was 55% in
1986 and is estimated to be 57% 1990.
5.05        The lack of improvement in operating performance is due to a
combination of tariff adjustments which have been inadequate to counter
inflation and of inadequate improvement in productivity. Both of these
matters will be addressed by the Action Plan and attendant covenants to the
proposed loan (see paras. 5.17, 7.01(c), 7.01(d), and 7.02(a)) and the trends
they reflect are projected to be improved over the coming period. A further
negative factor is the high cost of investment which has averaged about
137,000 Ft/net DEL added during the Seventh Five Year Plan (approximately
$2800-$2900 equivalent at the average official exchange rate) and has so far
shown no tendency to decline. An important objective of the project and the
Action Plan will be to initiate measures to bring these costs down. The
centerpiece of these measures will be agreement between the Bank and MTV on a
general procurement policy to facilitate competition in price, quality and
delivery time for non-Bank financed items (para 7.01(a)), the objective of
which will be for competitive Bank procurement to cover some 45% of all
purchases by the closing date of the project.

5.06    Given these trends, it is not surprising that the Rate of Return on
Net Fixed Assets will have declined from 25% in 1986 to 23% in 1988, and to
20% in 1990.
5.07        Debt service coverage (internal funds generation times debt
service obligations), though remaining satisfactory during the period, has
declined markedly from 14.2 to 6.6 times. Internal funds generation as a
percentage of capital investment has likewise declined from 65% to 55% as a
result of stagnant operating performance and a rapidly increasing investment
program. In principle this ratio of internal funds generation contribution to
investment is not, by itself, unsound (nor is it unusual among Western telecom
companies). However, it is a cause for some concern given the downward trend,
the context of Hungarian capital markets, national indebtedness, the drive to
wean Telecom from the Government budget, etc. In addition to Action Plan
remedies (see para. 5.05 above), a minimum ratio of internal funds generation
to investment will be a covenant of the proposed loan (para 5.17).
C. Future Financial Performance
5.08        MTV's projected Investment Program and Financing Plan, Income
Statements, Statements of Sources and Application of Funds, schedule of
Comparative Ratios and Data, schedules of key quantitative and value
assumptions of revenues and costs, and a Schedule of Equity Capital for the
years 1991 to 2000, are set forth in Annexes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18,
respectively. Explanations of the assumptions, on which the projects are
based, are provided in Annex 19.  Financial data and ratios summarizing
financial performance for the 1991 - 2000 period of projections are provided
in Table 5.2.
5.09        Operating revenue is projected to increase by an average of 17%
per year from 1991 to 2000 while operating expenses are projected to increase
at a rate of 13%. The operating ratio is projected to decrease from 57% in
1990 to 44% in 1993 (the last year of the proposed World Bank project) and to
41% by the year 2000. The average for the decade is projected to be 44%.
5.10        Net profit after taxes, as a percentage of operating revenue, is
projected to increase from 25% to 36% during this period. The rate of return
on net fixed assets is projected to increase from 21% in 1990 to 31% in 1993,
and continue to increase year by year to 35% by the year 2000. Actual tariff
increases for 1989 fell behind inflation by approximately 10%. Adjusting the
notional tariff index by this amount and taking this as a base for future
tariff performance, the projections indicate an increase of 0.65% p.a. which
is sufficient to cover financial requirements and meet Bank covenants through
to the year 2000, provided MTV meets projections for improved productivity.
5.11        Due to the high level of debt financing of MTV's large investment
program, debt service coverage is projected to decrease from 6.6 times in 1990
to 5.1 times by the year 2000. Internal funds generation as a percentage of
the three year moving average of investment (self-financing ratio) is
projected to fall initially (from an average of 70% in 1988-90 to 46% in
1991). It will remain low during the three years of the project, when

investments will be heavy. During these years internal funds generation is
projected to be at 46%, 62%, and 63% of investment for each year,
respectively, while averaging 57% for the period. As revenues from these
investments come on stream and the relative investment burden lightens, the
internal investment financing ratio will rise, about 62% by 2000 and averaging
about 71% over the decade.
5.12        The projections for MTV reflect no state equity investment during
the decade. Dividends to the GOH are paid to the extent of the availability
of funds as indicated in Annex 18. Dividend payments to GOH are projected for
each of the years 1993 to 2000, amounting to a total of Ft 68 billion over
that period.
D.  Investment Program Financing Plan
5.13        The Investment Program and Financing Plan are set forth in
Annex 12. The financing plan for the 10-year period from 1991 to 2000 meets
the investment requirements as projected. The First Telecommunication Project
loan, the proposed Bank Telecom II loan, and a possible Third
Telecommunication Project loan are projected to provide about Ft 19 billion or
6.0% of total requirements. The EIB is expected to provide about Ft 6
billion, or 1.9%, and bond financing about Ft 34 billion or 10.5%, state and
suppliers credits and other sources about Ft 21 billion or 6.5%. Internally
generated funds are projected to finance at least Ft 244 billion or 74.7X of
total investment.
E. Accounting Systems
5.14        MTV plans to develop and implement financial and cost accouiting
systems complying with International Standards of Accounting and incorporating
profit and cost centers. The WB fully supports this and stresses its
importance in effective management, improving productivity, operational
efficiency and profitability. MTV plans to engage foreign assistance in the
de-elopment and implementation of such systems with a heavy emphasis or.
training MTV personnel and management in the design, operation and integration
into decision making processes of the enterprise.
F Billing and Collection
5.15        Computerized billing for telecom services is completed within
fifteen days of the end of the month. The month-end balance of accounts
receivable reflects less than one montlh's revenue. This is attributable to
strict enforcement of disconnection of services where accounts are in arrears,
as well as the extreme shortage of telephone lines available for reconnection
of disconnected subscribers.
G. Auditing
5.16        Annual audits of MTV will be carried out in accordance with
International Accounting Committee Standards, by independent qualified
external auditors acceptable to the Bank. Audited financial statements and



- 34 -
the related auditor's report will be submitted to the Bank within six months
of the end of the fiscal year, starting with the year 1991.
H. Financial Covenants
5.17        Agreement with COH and MTV was reached during negotiations (para
7.01 (d)) that: (i) internal generation of funds will fall no lower than 40%
of the 3-year moving average (previous year, current year and projected
following year) of investment (para 5.11); (ii) the ratio of operating income
to net fixed assets will fall no lower than 18% in 1991, 20X in 1992, and 22%
for each of its fiscal years thereafter (para 5.10); and (iii) the debt-
service coverage ratio--i.e., the ratio of internally generated funds to total
debt-service obligations including interest and principal -- will be
maintained at a level not lower than 3:1.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Return on Investment
6.01        The calculation of the rate of return on all new works over the
period 1991-93 is given in Annex 20. The principal benefits arose from: (a)
the incremental 393,000 telephone subscribers and 2,730 new telex subscribers;
(b) incremental traffic (especially long-distance and international); (c) the
avoided estimated 3% annual decline in revenue per subscriber that would
probably occur due to rising congestion. The financial rate of return on
these benefits is 26%.
6.02        The financial rate of return based on conservative projections
(especially regarding traffic) does not fully reflect the net benefits to the
economy from the new works. The value of telecom service is far in excess of
both the cost of providing it and the price charged for it. One indicator of
this is the implied market price for a telephone connection contained in the
price differential between housing or business premises which have telephone
connections and those which do not. In Budapest this is in the region of
Ft 200,000 - 300,000 for flats and twice that for small business premises. By
revaluing telephone connections to account for this surplus, the project
yields a minimum economic rate of return of 33%. Even this does not account
for the substantial external benefits accruing to the economy at large from
improved telecommunications.
6.03        The following sensitivity tests were carried out on the financial
rate of return:
-     a 20% increase in capital costs yields a 20% ROR
-     a 20% increase in operating costs yields a 22% ROR
-     a 20% decrease in operating revenue yields a 13% ROR
-     a combination of these effects yields a 7% ROR
-     a 2-year delay in benefits yields a 18% ROR

B. Benefits
6.04        Economic development in the l990s and beyond requires accelerated
improvement in telecommunications services. Business used to be conducted by
Post and other media. Today the world's business is conducted electronically
and this will only increase. No country which wishes to participate in, let
alone join, the modern world economy can afford to let its telecommunications
infrastructure remain ten or twenty years out of date--as Hungary's is. In
addition Hungary's reform program specifically emphasizes increased
decentralization of decisions and reliance on market mechanisms by producers
and consumers--which further enhances the need for telecommunications since
modern, decentralized market systems cannot operate without fast, efficient
communication. With adequate telecommunications, the level and variety of
productive activity can by increased considerably and activities which
otherwise could not be realized at all can be undertaken.
6.05        In terms of specific constraints on Hungary's economic
development, the heavily congested long-distance and international networks
plus inadequate high-quality connections for large-volume subscribers are
particularly significant. Relieving these bottlenecks would:
(a)   reduce cost for all businesses but especially for those located,
or planning to locate, outside Budapest, thereby helping to
decentralize economic activity and encourage balanced regional
development;
(b)   improve the working of market mechanisms by expediting and
extending access to and transfer of information;
(c)   increase the efficiency of transport by co-ordinating vehicle use
and substituting communications for travel resulting in energy
savings, reduction of pollution and greater overall efficiency;
and
(d)   improve access of all businesses to market and supplier
information in overseas, especially West European, markets.
6.06        Key areas of Hungary's economy, upon which development, and
especially hard currency earnings, depend include agriculture and agricultural
processing, tourism, software and computer services, specialty chemicals and
pharmaceuticals, and selected manufacturing industries (e.g., automotive
parts, vacuum technology, shoes), etc. All of these require close
communication links with foreign buyers, suppliers and financial centers.
Poor telecommunications is a serious handicap which unless overcome will
truncate or prevent growth of these and other promising industries.

C. Risks
6.07        The principal risks concern:
(a)   The pace and solidity of sectoral and institutional reform.
Although progress has been made and more is planned, the fluid
political situation together with severe outside pressure could
prevent clear and reliable decisions about basic matters such as
sectoral structure, regulatory framework and substance,
licensing/franchising, etc. Lack of clarity and decisiveness in
these key areas would inhibit progress of MTV and of potential new
service providers;
(b)   Export controls on high-technology imports.  These have already
been relaxed and will almost certainly be relaxed further.
However, the pace and precise timing for specific types of
equipment is unpredictable and could cause delays:
(c)   The Hungarian telecommunications manufacturing industry (TCMI) has
traditionally supplied 80% of domestic TC equipment needs. This
ratio will decline as the rate of growth in. the network and the
introduction of new technology accelerates. However, the domestic
TCMI is still projected to supply 60X-70% of the MTV's equipment
needs, on average, over the coming decade. This will require
substantial restructuring and introduction of new technology in
the industry. If the TCMI is unable to supply modern equipment,
on time, at competitive prices, then the ability of the MTV to
achieve its growth targets will be undermined since its ability
either to import all it needs or to tolerate substandard, obsolete
or excessively costly domestic equipment is distinctly limited.
Several lines of action will be pursued to reduce this risk: (a)
Hungarian TCMI firms are actually seeking foreign partners to
upgrade their products and improve efficiency; this process is
supported by the Bank; (b) specific steps to encourage
rationalization and modernization are being supported by the Bank
through the IRP II and TD I projects; (c) increasing competitive
procurement processes by MTV (designed and implemented with Bank
support) w_.ll increase the pressure/incentives of the TCMI to
accelerate its modernization and restructuring; and (d) increasing
liberalization of the foreign exchange regime will facilitate
increasing flexibility in MTV purchasing decisions in the event of
inability of traditional suppliers to meet needs.
D. Environmental and Health Risks
6.08        The project is expected to have no adverse environmental or health
impacts. Indeed, the net effect of the project is expected to be positive on
both counts since it will result in a substitution of environmentally benign



- 37 -
communications for environmentally damaging transportation. In addition, it
will improve marginally the delivery of health services through better
communications between health units and with the population.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01        During negotiations, the following agreements were reached with
the Borrower:
(a)   Competitive Procurement:  the development and initial introduction
of a competitive procurement policy (para. 3.32);
(b)   Training:  the development and implementation of a Human Resources
Management and Development Master Plan covering, inter alia, the
training component of the project and management training (paras.
3.20, 4.13-4.16);
(c)   Action Plan:  a detailed timebound Action Plan covering: (i)
cverall performance; (ii) institutional development; (iii)
financial performance; and (iv) operational efficiency (para
4.17);
(d)   Financial covenants:  (i) internal generation of funds will fall
no lower than 40% of the 3-year moving average of investment; (ii)
the ratio of operating income to net fixed assets will fall no
lower than 18% in 1991, 20% in 1992, and 22% for each of its
fiscal years thereafter; and (iii) the debt service coverage ratio
- i.e., the ratio of internally generated funds to total debt
service obligations including interest and principal - will be
maintained at a level not lower than 3:1 (para 5.17); and
(e)   Joint review with the Bank of -erformance (as measured by agreed
indicators) compared to Action Plan Targets; and agreement of
remedial measures to be taken in the event of any shortfall and
annual review thereof (paras. 3.34, 3.36 and Annex 8).
7.02        During negotiations, the following item has been agreed with the
Guarantor:
(a)   By March 31, 1991 the Guarantor develop and furnish to the Bank, a
time-bound action plan to address the structural and regulatory
issues, especially (i) role of competition in various market
segments, role of government vis-a-vis MTV and other commercial TC
firms) and, thereafter, implement the recommendations agreed with
the Bank; the objective is to progressively harmonize Hungarian
policies and practices with West European norms (para 3.12); and
(ii) tariffs (reestablish the level of real tariffs obtained on
December 31, 1989 by June 30, 1991.



- 38 -
7.04        There are no special Conditions of Effectiveness.
7.05        On the basis of the staff appraisal and the above mentioned
agreements, the Project is considered suitable for a Bank loan of US$150
million for 15 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate to Magyar Tavkozlesi Vallalat.

PROCUREMENT POLICY STAT
1.          MTV's procurement policy for materials and equipment needed for
investment will substantially change in the immediate future. At present, the
market is limited, because for much of the equipment only one monopoly
supplier exists.
2.          The procurement process during the World Bank's First
Telecommunications Project already contributed to the development of a
competitive market, i.e., in several areas accelerated development took place
(cables, transmission). Unfortunately, this process, so far, has not lowered
the prices. In the future, with its procurement policy, MTV will try to have
more than one supplier for all equipment and material, including switching, so
that competitions can be achieved, thereby bringing the prices closer to the
world price level. In order to facilitate competition and price level
advantages in the field of switching, MTV, apart from having two suppliers,
will systematically use the competitive tendering processes and, in a given
technology, some 25% of the required equipment and materials will be procured
through open competition. In that way, the division of market share of the
two switching suppliers will be achieved naturally, and due to competition,
the prices could be stabilized.
3.          MTV is prepared to negotiate the question of market shares, and if
it is advantageous for MTV, it is ready, for a limited period, to conclude
cost agreements with its supplier. In order to facilitate the process it is
necessary that the efficiency of the manufacturing be increased and that
technological changes and technical development be speeded up. In some areas,
it is necessary to liberalize import, because as long as insufficient domestic
suppliers exist, it is necessary for efficient competition to assure the
participation of world market suppliers. The presence of world suppliers is
important, not only for price competition, but also in respect of the quality
and delivery time comparison.
4.          MTV will, in the coming years, increase the share procured by the
competitive processes, not only in equipment, but also in network
construction, building construction, installation and other areas, with the
aim of better prices, quality and delivery time. It is MTV's resolve to
double the percentage of purchase covered by competitive procedures by 1993 as
compared to 1990. The projected percentage of competitive procurement would
be 25%, 35% and 45% of all purchases in 1991, 1992 and 1993 respectively.

5.          In order to improve the efficiency of the procurement process, MTV
will improve its own organization: it will develop the methodology and
processes for the preparation of tenders and their evaluation and award
process, harmonizing it within the overall investment process, in order to
support the objectives of competition.
6.          The Telecom II Project, supported by the World Bank and European
Investment Bank will contribute considerably to the modernization and
improvement of the purchasing process of MTV, thereby achieving better prices,
which will reduce both the investment and operational costs.
