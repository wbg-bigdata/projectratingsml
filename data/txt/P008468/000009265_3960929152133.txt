MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE HUNGARIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY
FOR A SECOND TEL.COMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Hungarian Telecommunications Company for US$150 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms
with a 15 year maturity, including 5 years of grace, and would help finance a
telecommunications project.
2.    Backronmd.  Hungary's Telecommunicatione (TC) System is one of the
least developed in Europe and a significant constraint on economic
development. Hungary has less than one-half as many main lines per 100
population as Portugal, less than one-quarter as many as Greece. Indeed, the
penetration rate of Hungary is similar to that of countries whose overall
economic development is well below that of Hungary. F-rther, overall quality
of service is poor, congestion is severe, and there are only a few of the
modern data-related services required by businesses that must compete in the
world economy. By the mid-80's, the GOH gradually recognized the high cost of
inadequate TC and therefore the need for increased TC investment and
instituted a number of reforms in MP. The Bank supported this program with
the first TC Project (Loan No. 2847-HU) covering the years 1987 -1991.
Unavailability of modern digital technology forced investment during this
period to be concentrated on rehabilitation and extension of the long-distance
transmission and local cable network. Institutional strengthening focused on
improving MP's financial systems, management information systems, traffic
engineering, training and software development. This project has been
successful so far: physical targets have been exceeded, technical assistance
has been effective, and institutional goals have been met. Targets for
increased efficiency, reduced unit costs, and tariff adjustments in line with
inflation, however, have not been fully met and therefore will be a major
objective under this project in which performance targets, financial covenants
and the Action Plan will all emphasize improved efficiency, productivity, and
tariff adjustments to offset inflation. Fifty-one percent of the loan had
been disbursed as of June 15, 1990 which is ahead of both the original
schedule and the Bank profile (44X and 48X respectively).
3.    The first project was designed to lay the groundwork of basic
transmission infrastructure which is necessary for subsequent modernization of
the network. That work is continuing and will be successfully completed,
probably ahead of schedule. In September 1988, Western export restrictions on
digital equipment were relaxed significantly. This, plus subsequent further
relaxation of export controls and progress in other aspects of Hungary's



reform process, make it now feasible to begin a major program of
modernization, extension and restructuring of the TC sector. This difficult
undertaking will build upon the essential foundation being laid by the first
project. As over 75X of the first loan has been committed and the rest is
targeted for remaining infrastructure a program of modernization and expansion
is now required and opportune, which is supported by the proposed loan.
4.    Lank Assistance Strategy.  Since lending to Hungary began in 1983, the
Bank's country assistance strategy has focused on supporting the Government's
program of reform and structural adjustment to make the economy more
efficient, flexible, market-oriented and competitive, especially in
convertible currency markets. This strategy has been implemented mainly
through a series of hybrid loans for industrial restructuring, combining quick
disbursing funds to support institutional and policy reform, and investment
funds to support restructuring at the enterprise and subsector levels.
Investment loans in other sectors, in particular in agriculture and transport,
have also supported implementation of the reform, as well as improvement in
enterprise efficiency. Following the adoption by the Government in 1987 of a
medium-term program of stabilization and adjustment to correct imbalances
created by economic deterioration, the Bank stepped up its support to the
reform through an industrial sector adjustment loan. This loan, combined with
an IMF Standby in 1988, provided crucial external support to strengthen the
Government's reform and adjustment efforts. The Bank's strategy will continue
to focus on support to the Government in carrying out its adjustment efforts
and will also address medium to long term constraints to sustainable growth,
assist in developing institutional capacity in line with system reforms and
help ensure Hungary's continued access to external financing. This strategy
will be implemented through both adjustment lending, such as the FY90
Structural Adjustment Loan, which was approved by the Executive Directors in
June 1990, and investment lending operations. In addition to direct lending,
the World Bank is helping Hungary mobilize resources through official and
commercial cofinancing.  The fii.t expanded cofinancing operation ("ECO") for
Hungary was approved by the Executive Directors on July 31, 1990.
5.    Because of the large, well-established role of the domestic
Telecommunications Manufacturing Industry (TCMI) which has traditionally
supplied nearly 80% of MTV's equipment, a major modernization and expansion
program for telecommunications must have a coordinated sectoral perspective.
Therefore, preparation for the proposed project has focused simultaneously on
development of the TC network and on restructuring, modernizing and
strengthening the competitiveness of the TCMI. From a conceptual and proje---
preparation perspective both aspects (TC and TCMI) have been developed in a
close and integrated way. For reasons of convenience and timing, the
financing of the TCMI will take place under the ongoing Second Industrial
Restructuring Project (Loan 2834-HU) and the ongoing First Technology
Development Project (Loan 2966-HU). However, from a conceptual and project-
preparation perspective both aspects (TC and TCNI) have been developed in a
close and integrated way.
6.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Through its lending program (SALs,
FSALs, Investment Operations), ESW and policy dialogue, the Bank is supporting



- 3 -
Hungary's overall restructuring and reform efforts. The thrust of these
reforms is to increase flexibility, decentralization, market mechanisms and
export orientation. All of these require improved communications. Thus,
support for TC improvement is an important cornerstone of support for economic
reform. Other sources of support, such as suppliers credits or bilateral
finance, while sometimes available, have limitations; e.g., they often do not
cover certain types of equipment and they are often unable to provide optimal
support for institutional and policy reforms. In addition, the Bank's
presence and procurement rules can help ensure economic decisions on equipment
purchases.
7.    Proiect Objectives.  Consistent with Hungary's overall reform program,
the project aims to help Hungary develop a flexible, commercial,
technologically modern TC sector. In particular, the project would support
phased introduction of competition in selected sub-markets, institutional
strengthening and reform of MTV (especially in the area of human resource
management and development), improved efficiency and quality of service,
improved long-distance service and integration with international TC networks,
technological modernization and introduction of new services, auto'atization
of rural and provincial networks, and increased penetration.
8.    Project Description.  The Project would consist of a three-year time-
slice of MTV's investment program for 1991-1993, including some preparatory
works in late 1990, combining physical expansion and modernization of the
network with institutional strengthening through technical assistance and
training. The specific focus would be finalization of a strategy and
implementation plan for digitalization and automatization of the network
together with implementation of the first phase of that program, the main
elements of which will be: (a) construction of a digital overlay long-
distance network with attendant connections to local networks and, directly,
to large-volume customers; (b) strengthening of the commercial orientation and
capacity of MTV (e.g., by implementing the Management Information System (HIS)
d veloped under the First Telecommunications Project, developing and
implementing modern accounting systems, reorganizing operations along
commercial lines, etc.); and (c) introducing a regulatory framework to
encourage competition in selected portions of the TC sectol
9.    The total project cost is US$1,355 million, of which US$352 million is
*       in foreign exchange.  The proposed Bank loan of US$150 million equivalent
would meet 43X of the foreign exchange requirements of the project. The
remainder of the foreign exchange requirements will be arranged by MTV via
additional loans from international lending institutions (e.F., EIB loan of
$100 million expected to be approved in October 1990), commercial credits,
sale of equity, suppliers credit and/or purchase of foreign exchange by MTV.
Local costs will be met by MTV and domestic borrowing.
10.   Procurement of 96% of equipment purchased with the proceeds of the Bank
loan will be under International Competitive Bidding (ICB). EIB-financed
purchases will also be under ICB conditions very similar to the Bank's.

11. Disbursements would be made against full documentation, except for
contracts not exceeding US$300,000, for which Statement of Expenditures
procedures would be used. To facilitate access to loan proceeds, a Special
Account will be established by the Government covering four months of
expenditures, equivalent to US$10 million. The Bank loan is expected to be
diqbursed by the loan closing date of June 30, 1996. A breakdown of costs and
toe financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Procuremen'. methods and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Scbpdule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the Status of Bank Group operations in HWngary are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8571-HU,
dated September 12, 1990, and a Map (IBRD 22348) are also aitached.
12.   The project is expected to have no adverse environmental or health
impacts. Indeed, the net effect of the project is expected to be positive on
both counts since it will result in a substitution of environmentally benign
communications for environmentally damaging transportation. In addition, it
will improve marginally the delivery of health services through better
communications between health units id the population.
13. Actions Agreed. MTV wvill implement the project and, based on its
successful experience with the First Telecom project and further technical
assistance under the proposed project, is clearly competent to do so.
Agreements have been reached with the borrower (MTV) regarding: (i) project
implementation and monitoring; (ii) financial covenants (internal generation
of funds to cover no less then 40X of investment, ratio of operating income to
net fixed assets of at least 18X in 1991, 20X in 1992, and 22X for each year
thereafter, debt service coverage ratio of at least 3:1) (iii) the Action
Plan to improve performance and efficiency: key targetr re to reduce faults
per 100 Direct Exchange (telephone) Lines (DELs) per r   h by 152 from 11.2 in
1989 to 9.5 in 1993, reduce staff per 1000 DELs by 25% :om 26.4 in 1989 to 20
in 1993; (iv) technical assistance and training; key components relate to
implementation of the MIS, design and implementation c! a commercial
accounting system, design and optimization of a digitalization plan,
preparation for ISDN, development of new services, human resource management
and development; (v) progressive increase, over a three year period, in
competitive procurement aiming at increasing the percentage of purchases done
by competitive procurement from a minimum of 25X in 1991 to at least 45X in
1993. Agreements have been reached with GOH regarding: (i) development, by
March 31, 1991, of a program to address issues of sectoral structure
(especially, role and degree of competition in various market segments) with a
goal of approaching West European norms by January 1992; (ii) development of a
blueprint for a regulatory framework by March 31, 1991 (especially regarding             a
tariffs, franchising, interconnection, quality of service, standardization and
dispute resolution) together with a timebound implementation plan to be
completed by the end of the project period; and (iii) tariffs to be increased
in real terms to the December 1989 level by June 1991. Agreement has been
reached with both the Borrower and GOH regarding completion of the
reorganization of MTV into a limited stock company by July 1, 1991.

14.  Prolect Benefits.  Businers and other high voluie subscribers will be
.he major beneficiaries of the expansion of long distance and mobile
telephone, telex and data facilities. Business will benefit generally from
improved international and inter-city communications. In particular, 250,000
to 300,000 customers will be connected directly to the new overlay digital
network, thereby gaining access to full-featured modern services. However,
all subscribers will benefit from improvement in automatization, service
quality and efficiency. Further, during this project the groundwork will be
laid for a rapid increase in penetration and access to telecommunications to
the general population, which will take place later in the decade.
15.   Proiect Risks.  There remains a small risk (i.e., of a reversal in
political climate between East and West) associated with COCOM export
restrictions. However, the recent major additional relaxations in COCOM
controls (e.g., reclassification at the Administrative Exception level of
full-featured digital switching and transmission capacities up to 156 Mbs for
both microwave and optical fiber) strongly suggest that this risk is minimal.
There is also some risk associated with the new political situation in Hungary
which may delay clear decisions regarding competition, regulatory policy,
joint ventures with foreign partners, etc.  A third risk aoncerns the
performance of the Hungarian TC manufacturing industry. T; the industry is
unable to provide the expected variety and quantity of equipment (about 50% of
total equipment is expected to be supplied by the domestic industry without
any World Bank fiuiancing) at competitive prices, technology, quality, and
timing, then MTV will have to decide whether to import a higher proportion of
equipment -- which will necessitate reducing the pace of development -- or to
absorb suboptimal equipment and/or prices. Both of these options involve
substantial costs to the economy. The program for reforming and modernizing
the industry, to be supported by the Bank under the Second Industrial
Restructuring Project and the First Technology Development Project (see para 5
above), will reduce this risk.
16.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
