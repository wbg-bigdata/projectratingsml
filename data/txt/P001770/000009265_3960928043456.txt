BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrowers          People's Republic of Mozambique
Beneficiaries:     Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC), National
Directorate of Ports and Railways (DNPCF), Beira
Corridor Authority (BCA), Central Railway System
(CFM(C)), Southern Railway System (CFM(S)), Northern
Railway System (CFM(N) and Secretariate of State for
Technical and Vocational Training (SETEP).
Amounts             SDR 31 million (US$ 40.0 million equivalent).
Termst             Standard IDA Terms with 40 years maturity.
Onlendini Terms:   The credit will be on-lent to the Mozambique Ports and
Railways Administration (DNPCF) for a period of 30 years
including five years of grace, at an interest rate of
7.65%. DNPCF will bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project's
Descriptions       The main objective of the Beira Transport Corridor
Program is the rehabilitation and upgrading of the Beira
Corridor to restore its cost efficient transit
functions. The IDA assisted project would contribute to
this objective through the provision of technical
assistance, manpower development and training and motive
power.  IDA components will provide for (i) technical
assistance to run port and railway operations during the
1989-1995 period; (ii) manpower development and training
for all levels of staff in the port and railways; (iii)
rehabilitation and acquisition of motive power for main
line and shunting operations; and (iv) implementation of
a railway/port cost accounting system and a management
information system.
Benefits
and Risks:         The main benefits are the reduction of transport costs
and increased efficiency which will allow Beira to
compete with Durban (RSA), providing Zimbabwe and Malawi
with cheaper alternatives to the sea and Mozambique with
foreign exchange earnings. The main risks are (i)
delays in project implementation and consequent
inability to provide acceptable levels of service may
affect financial and economic viability; and (ii) the
security issue: in spite of the presence of armed forces
guarding the corridor, possible disruptions may occur.

BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
I. SECTORAL AND SOUTHERN AFRICA REGIONAL CONTEXT
A. Introduction
1.01     The Economic Rehabilitation Program (ERP) Implemented by the
Government of Mozambique (GON) since January, 1987 has initiated a major
shift in economic policy and, in the two years since its introduction, has
achieved considerable progress in the adjustment process and helped to
revitalize the economy. Thus, after years of economic decline, GDP is
estimated to have grown in real terms by 4.0% in 1987 and 4.1X in 1988 and
a growth rate of 5.0% is forecast for 1989. In parallel with the ERP,
there has been increased emphasis on rehabilitation of essential economic
infrastructure, particularly in the transport and urban sectors, as a means
of restoring economic growth and generating foreign exchange earnings. The
Beira Transport Corridor Program, which is the subject of this report, is
financed by 18 bilateral and multilateral donors and is the largest and
most advanced of Mozambique's transport corridor rehabilitation projects.
B. Geographic Setting
1.02.    Mozambique has three international ports: Maputo in the south,
Beira in the center and Nacala in the north. Maputo has direct rail
connections with the Republic of South Africa (RSA), Swaziland and
Zimbabwe; Beira with Zimbabwe &nd Malawi; ane Nacala with Malawi (see IBRD
Map 20101 and paras 1.11-1.18). Indirectly, there are links with other
landlocked countries: Zambia and Botawana.
1.03.    As the map and Table 1.1 show, Mozambique's geography makes it
eminently suitable as a transit country for the international trade of its
neighbors. The rail and road distances to Mozambican po_-ts are considerably
shorter than those to alternative ports in RSA.

1) Rail distances from Blantyre & Lilongwe to RSA ports are via road between
Blantyre and Harare
2) Distances from Zimbabwe to Richards Bay and Durban assume use of rail route
through Swaziland.
1.04     These differences in distances, in turn, are reflected in
differences in inland transport costs, as illustrated below:

1.05    As a result of the comparative advantage in transit transport
costs, in the past, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and to a lesser extent
Zambia and RSA (Transvaal), relied on Mozambique's port and railway system
to handle their overseas trade flows.
C. Role of Transport Corridors in Mozambique's Economy
1.06    The transport sector is an important part of Mozambique's economy.
It accounts for over 10% of the national social product and is potentially
of vital importance as an earner of foreign exchange and a generator of
employment. Prior to independence in 1975, the balance of payments had



- 3 -
consistently shown a considerable deficit on the merchandise account which
was mainly financed by a surplus on the services account. Thus in 1973,
two years before independence, the deficit on the merchandise account of
the balance of payments was US$115 million while the corresponding surplus
on the services account was US$122 million. The transport sector accounted
for US$109 million or 90% of this surplus. On the other hand, for a more
recent year, 1983, the situation was entirely different: the merchandise
deficit was US$355 million while the services account (including transport)
of the balance of payments showed a deficit of US$16 million. This
primarily reflects the steep decline of international transport services
(rail and port) provided by Mozambique over the past decade; a decline of
some 70% to 80%. The transport sector can and should play a much more
important role as a foreign exchange earner than it is playing at present.
D. Southern Africa Regional Context
1.07    Mozambique's neighbors too have a vital interest in Mozambique's
transport system. They are very much interested in having the traditionally
cheapest transport options to the sea restored. Moreover, this would
simultaneously help to meet one of the primary objectives of the Southern
Africa Development Coordination Conference (SADCC), the grouping of nine
Southern African countries (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe): reduction of the current
dependency on RSA for their international transport needs.
1.08    Table 1.2 summarizes trade flows for each SADCC country through
SADCC and RSA ports for 1987. As could be expected, all of Angola's import
and export traffic moved via Angolan ports, while Mozambique and Tanzania
also relied primarily on their own ports. Botswana and Lesotho, on the
other hand, used South African ports exclusively, while Swaziland shipped
almost half of its overseas traffic via South Africa. The BLS countries
(Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland) all participate in the Southern Africa
Customs Union, which facilitates their use of South African ports and
surface transport. From a distance perspective Botswana could, if all
lines were in operation, make use either of Maputo or Durban ports, which
are 1,030 and 1,170 km from Gaborone, respectively. Lesotho bas no choice
by virtue of its location but to use South African Transport System (SATS).
However, for Swaziland, there is a clear distance advantage of using Maputo
port over Durban, as the former is 275 km from Matsapa and the latter 540.
Malawi shipped approximately three-fourths of its overseas goods via Durban
but also made use of Beira, Dar es Salaam, and minimal use of Nacala port.
For Malawi, the distance penalty of being forced to ship via Durban is
significant, as most routes to Durban are in the order of 3,500 km in
length versus 1,770 to Dar es Salaam, 640 to Beira, and 815 to Nacala.
Zambia shipped most of its goods via Dar es Salaam. Zimbabwe made
significant use of both Beira (mainly for petroleum products) and Durban
ports, with a small amount of traffic via Maputo. It is clear that
significant savings could be made, particularly by Malawi, Zimbabwe and
Swaziland, through greater use of SADCC ports, particularly those in
Mozambique.

E. Government Strateey
1.09    As shown in Table 1.3, since independence in 1975, the transit
function of Mozambique has steadily declined, until recently, from a peak
of 18.26 million tons handled by the system in 1973, of which 95Z was
transit traffic, to 4.25 million tons by 1986, of which 3.6 million were
transit. The improvement observed in 1987 is the result of initial
rehabilitation activities (see paras 2.03 - 2.16 below).
1.10    The principal reasons for the dramatic decline in Mozambique's
transit function are:
(i)    the departure of most Portuguese personnel at the time of
independence and the lack of an adequate training program,
leaving the transport system with a severe shortage of
competent personnel to manage and operate the system;
(ii)   the steady deterioration of port and rail physical
facilities since the early 1970s because of lack of
maintenance and rehabilitation;
(iii)  the loss of much of the RSA (Transvaal) and Swaziland
traffic since independence;
(iv)   the closure by Mozambique of the border with Rhodesia 1
from 1976 to 1980, and;
(v)    the activities of armed bandits, since 1980, in Mozambique.
1.11    As a result of the bandit activities, the rail connections between
Malawi and the ports of Nacala and Beira as well as the rail link between
Zimbabwe and Maputo are closed at present. The rail and pipeline
connections between Zimbabwe and Beira are guarded by Mozambican and
Zimbabwean troops and are open to traffic, although rail and port
capacities are limited.
1.12    Given the importance of the transport corridors to Mozambique's
economy, their rehabilitation has become a key element in the Government's
strategy of structural adjustment, which seeks to revitalise the economy
and reverse the economic decline of previous years. Thus, in parallel with
the ERP launched in 1987, is a major program of investment in the
rehabilitation of urban and transport infrastructure facilities as a means
of rapidly restoring economic growth and generating foreign exchange
earnings. Implementation of the strategy, with the help of bilateral and
multilateral donors, has been quite successful. The following paragraphs
describe the current status of the three corridors.

used in reference to the period before independence.

(a) The Nacala Corridor
1.13    The Nacala system, operated by CFH(Norte), consists of the port of
Nacala and a single line track between Nacala and Malawi, through northern
Mozambique. The system used to serve Malawi's foreign trade and Mozambican
exports of tea, cotton and cashews from the provinces of Nampula and
Niassa. For a period, between 1973 and 1976 after the Zambian-Rhodesian
border closure, the line also carried some Zambian cargo. The 814 km line
(from Blantyre) was closed in 1984 because of bandit activities, and
despite current multi-donor assistance to rebuild the track and the port,
which commenced in 1984, the line remains closed to Malawi's traffic. The
port is being improved with donor support from Finlands container
facilities are being provided and staff trained, while the rail link with
Malawi is being improved with Canadian, Italian, French, Portuguese and EEC
assistance. Subject to security considerations, the rehabilitation program
is expected to be completed by 1991/2.
(b) Maputo Corridor
1.14    The Maputo port transport system, operated by CFM(Sul), is
considered SADCC's premier alternative to South African routes for overseas
trade. It serves southern Mozambique, Swaziland and southern and western
parts of Zimbabwe, as well as the north-eastern Transvaal (RSA). There are
three rail connections with Maputo port. The link between Zimbabwe and
Maputo that follows the river border (known as the Limpopo line) is 534 kms
long. Althou&h the line is longer than the Beira Corridor, it has a higher
capacity both up and down since it traverses flat, open terrain. Closed to
commercial traffic since 1984, this line is currently being rehabilitated
with assistance from the United Kingdom (U.K.), the EFC, Portugal and
Canada with completion expected in 1990/1.
1.15    The Ressano Garcia line, 88 kms long in Mozambique, links Maputo
with RSA. This route has been completely rehabilitated and currently
carries over 1.5 million tons of cargo per year. Principal commodities
include coal, sugar, citrus and steel from South Africa and Zimbabwe. In
1986, approximately 500,000 tons of Zimbabwe's external trade passed
through Maputo. Zimbabwean traffic destined for Maputo currently passes
via South Africa, transversing the border at Beitbridge and connecting
with the Mozambican system at Ressano Garcia. The third rail link, the
Goba line, connects Maputo port with Swaziland (68 km in Mozambique). The
line is in poor condition and is frequently closed because of security
problems. Nonetheless, the line carried approximately 500,000 tons of
cargo in 1986. The Government of Italy has made a commitment to
reha&ilitate the entire length of the line inside the Mozambique border.
1.16    Maputo port is currently handling approximately 2.5 million tons of
cargo from landlocked countries per year. The theoretical design capacity
of the port is 14.0 million tons per year and it is capable of handling 7.0
million tons in its current condition.
(c) Beira Corridor
1.17    This corridor, operated by CFM(Centro), is made up of railways,
roads and a pipeline that connect Zimbabwe and other interior countries
with the port of Beira. The pipeline, connecting Beira with Mutare (just



- 8 -
inside the Zimbabwe border), currently pumps nearly a million tons of oil
products annually to Zimbabwe, representing 100X of Zimbabwe's total oil
import requirements. The National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) and
Mozambique Railways - Caminhos de Ferro de Mozambique (CFM) - have
completed the upgrading of the rail line between Dondo (28 km from Beira)
and Mutare, Zimbabwe. Theoretical capacity on the line is 2.0 million tons
per year.
1.18    The Beira Corridor System saw a dramatic increase in the level of
traffic in 1987 and 1988. About 40,000 tons per year of Malawi's sugar
goes through Tete by road to be transhipped by rail from Harare to Beira.
The use of the Beira port for Zambian copper increased in 1987 due to a
major shift from the South African port of East London. Zambia now ships
about 60% of its copper exports via Dar es Salaam and 40% (about 80,000
tons per annum) through Beira. In addition, as Beira corridor facilities
improve, Zimbabwe is expected to divert much of its overseas trade to that
port.
(d) CFM,EE
1.19    An important part of the Government's stratSgy is the transfer of
the responsibility for the three main corridors from the Direccao Nacional
de Portos e Caminhos de Ferro (DNPCF), which is a directorate of the
Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC - see Annex 8), to a new
autonomous parastatal, Caminhos de Ferro de Mozambique, Empresa Estatal
(CFM,EE). The draft statutes and operational guidelines, which are
acceptable to IDA, were approved by the Council of Ministers on April 26,
1989, while the financial statements of the new entity are being finalised
with the help of technical assistance provided by the Government of France.
The intention is that the new entity should become financially viable as
soon as possible and in any event not later than 1995, eliminating the need
for Government subsidies. Agreement to this effect was obtained during
negotiations (para 6.01).
F. IDA's Role
1.20    IDA assistance to Mozambique to date has focussed primarily on
supporting the implementation of the country's ERP. In June 1985, a first
IDA Credit of SDR 45.5 million (Rehabilitation Program - Credit 1610-MOZ)
was approved to help meet Mozambique's priority needs in the industrial,
t.ansport and agricultural sectors.  Performance under the Credit has been
satisfactory, with about US$41.5 million disbursed by end-February, 1989.
The Credit has provided the Ministry of Trade (MOT) with an improved
procurement capability, and has allowed enterprises benefitting from the
financing to produce more efficiently through provision of spare parts, raw
materials, and technical assistance at the managerial level. The
Governments of the Kingdom of Norway and Italy provided an additional US$22
million of co-financing with the Credit. A second IDA credit (Credit 1806-
MOZ), of SDR 15.6 million to support the Energy Technical Assistance and
Rehabilitation Project, designed to bring about quickly a substantial
improvement in the supply and distribution of electricity and petroleum
products to the main trade and processing areas, was approved by the
Executive Directors in May, 1987. US$1.9 million of this Credit had been
disbursed as of February 28, 1989. This was followed by a third IDA credit



- 9 -
(Credit 1841-MOZ) of SDR 54.5 million (Second Rehabilitation Project)
approved in August, 1987, in conjunction with an Africa Facility Credit of
SDR 14.5 million and a Swiss Special Joint Financing Grant of SWF 16.9
million. Disbursements totalled US$68.0 million as of February 28, 1989
out of a total of US$110.0 million (including cofinancing). An Education
and Manpower Development Credit of SDR 11.7 million (Credit 1907-MOZ) was
approved in May, 1988, an Urban Rehabilitation Credit of SDR 44 million
(Credit 1949-MOZ) in August, 1988 and a Health and Nutrition Credit of SDR
21 million (Credit 1989-MOZ) in May 1989. As of February 28, 1989 US$1.51
million has been disbursed from Credit 1907 and US$1.85 million from Credit
1949.
1.21    IDA'S role in the transport sector has so far mainly been to help
coordinate donors on the Beira Corridor Program, the largest of
Mozambique's transport rehabilitation programs, through bringing together
economically synergistic components and by doing the overall economic and
financial analysis. Thus when, early in 1986, SADCC presented for
consideration by donors a detailed, 10-year, US$660 million program, IDA
suggested a phased program which would restore the transport capacity of
the Corridor, largely through rehabilitation of facilities and technical
assistance. At a donors meeting in Beira in April 1986, a revised program
spanning a period of five years was presented for donors' review and was
approved by Mozambique and SADCC with some adjustments. The approved
program included rehabilitation of the infrastructure services (roads,
water, sewerage, erosion control, etc) ano housing for the city of Beira.
To make the implementation of the program more manageable and to ease the
housing shortage and improve urban services during construction activities
of the corridor itself, IDA included assistance for rehabilitation of the
cities of Beira and Maputo in the SDR 44 million IDA Credit for Urban
Rehabilitation approved in August 1988 (Report No. 7279-MOZ, July 1, 1988).
IDA worked closely with the European Development Fund (EDF) to draw up the
terms of reference for a manpower development and training study for CFM(C)
which was financed by the EEC and the recommendations of which are
incorporated in the proposed project. The IDA Project Preparation Facility
(PPF) has been used to fund a locomotive study for Mozambique and a
management information system needs assessment for CFM(C), both of which
have served as the basis for components in the proposed project. PPF funds
are also being used to finance a technical assistance and training needs
study for the whole of Mozambique's transport sector. IDA is currently
undertaking a Transport Sector Review for Mozambique with the assistance of
the U.K. Overseas Development Administration (ODA) and is also undertaking
a study of the financial viability of all of the transport corridors in the
SADCC region with funding from the Netherlands, USAID, Denmark and Canada.
II. THE BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR
A. Physical and Institutional Framework
2.01    The Beira Transport Corridor, located in central Mozambique (see
Maps Nos. 20101 and 20102), consists of (i) Beira Port; (ii) the single
track 315 km rail link from Beira to Machipanda on the Zimbabwe border,
midway between Beira and Harare; (iii) a 282 km two-lane highway from Beira
to Machipanda; and (iv) a 300 km oil pipeline from Beira to Mutare, just
across the border in Zimbabwe.



- 10 -
2.02    CFM(C) is responsible for the operation and maintenance of Beira
port and the central rail system which, in addition to the Beira-Machipanda
link, includes the Sena line linking Beira with Malawi. The Sena line has
been closed for a number of years because of the security situation and
only the Beira-Machipanda line is operating regularly. The pipeline is a
joint state-private enterprise, operated by CPMZ (Companhia Pipeline
Mozambique Zimbabwe). The road falls under the responsibility of the
Ministry of Construction and Water. International freight forwarding
companies are well represented in the port and, to encourage private
enterprise, agreement was reached at negotiations that BCA will submit
proposals to IDA by December 31, 1990 for plans to expand private sector
participation in port and railway related activities such as warehousing
and container freight stations (para 6.01).
B. Beira Port
(a) Basic Facilities
2.03    The port is situated on the left bank of the Pungue River at
latitude 190.50 and longitude 340.51 east.  May 3 (IBRD Map No. 21356)
shows the layout of the port.  The first section of the existing wharves
was built immediately after World War I with major extensions undertaken
after 1930. In 1969, a pipeline was constructed to link the port with
Zimbabwe. Currently, facilities for the working of vessels and handling
and storage area amount to 350,000 sq.m. and covered areas to approximately
59,000 sq.m., of which approximately 34,500 sq.m. are used for transit
storage. Specialized facilities include a cold store with a capacity of
1,000 tons for fruits and 500 tons for frozen meat, a coal yard with a
holding capacity of 150,000 sq.m. and a loading capacity at the wharf of
700 tons per hour, seven tallow tanks with a storage capacity of 2,630 tons
and three molasses tanks with a total capacity of 26,000 tons. The
handling rate for tallow and molasses is approximately 120 tons per hour.
Depth alongside is 8 m at Berths 2-5 and 8-9 m at Berths 6-11.
2.04    During the past decade the condition of the port, particularly of
the wharves and loading equipment, has deteriorated. This led to
initiation of a rehabilitation of the port (financed by the Netherlands) in
1982 which included the paving of the operational area, upgrading of the
coal loading facilities to a capacity of 1.2 million tons per annum
(t.p.a.), new cargo handling equipment, improvement to  communications,
lighting and navigation systems and, since 1987, technical assistance in
port operations and training. The rehabilitation program has also provided
a paved storage of 21,000 sq.m. behind Berths 9 and 10 to serve as a
temporary container terminal and enable the working of ro-ro vessels at the
berths. Reconstruction of Berths 2-5 started in January 1988 under EEC
financing.
(b) Navigation
2.05    The port is situated some 20 km from the open sea.  The channel for
shipping currently has an aveiage depth of 6 m. below chart datum; however,
there are some shallow spots due to siltation, with a depth of only 4.60m
below chart datum. There are considerable variations in the frequency of
high waters (over 6 m) and low waters (less than 1 m).  Due to the tidal



- 11 -
range, at the channel depth of 6 m., vessels with a draft of 9.7 m,
corresponding to a fully laden 20,000 dead weight ton (DWT) vessel, can
transit the channel during 602 of the high water. The number of ship days
of delay due to waiting for tide and for daylight were recorded at 200 in
1980.
(c) Organization and Management
2.06    The port is administered by CFM (C) which also has responsibility
for the railway system from Beira to the borders with Zimbabwe and Malawi.
An organization chart of CFM (C) is shown in Annex 8, Chart 3. CFM (C) is
headed by a director-general. Reporting to him are the director in charge
of port operations and maintenance and his counterpart for the railways.
The port and the railways share planning, financial and marketing services
with each having specialist operating and engineering services. Full time
port employees total 2,519; with casuals (part time) numbering 3,317. A
breakdown of the personnel establishment is given in Annex 2.
2.07    The port works three shifts, totalling 24 hours: 0700 to 1500
hours; 1500 to 2300 hours; 2300 to 0700 hours. The organization of labor
for cargo handling operations generally follows conventionally accepted
practice. A gang working at hatch consists of one foreman, one tally man,
one winchman, one forklift driver and, depending on the nature of the
cargo, nine (general cargo) to 1; (bagged cargo) stevedores of whom four
are normally deployed at the wharf and the rest in the hold. At the
shed/storage area receiving cargo is a complementary storage gang made up
of one foreman and 9 to 17 men. Considering the type of cargo that is
being handled at the port and the labor intensive nature of the operation,
labor is not excessive.
(d) Traffic
2.08 Port throughput, after reaching a peak of 3.0 million tons in 1975,
had been steadily declining (see Table 1.3) until recently due mainly to
the loss of transit traffic to South African ports. The trough was reached
in 1986 when the port handled 1.33 million tons of which 0.84 million were
petroleum products (over 902 of which was for Zimbabwe). 1987 witnessed an
increase of 47X to a total of 1.95 million tons of which 1.01 million were
petroleum products. Total traffic increased by a further 13% in 1988 to
2.20 million tons. The total number of containers (TEU's) handled in 1987
were 10,072, up from 4,907 in 1986, an increase of 105%. Of the 10,072
containers handled in 1987, 6,989 were transit traffic (4,997 export and
1,992 import). Container traffic rose by a further 50% in 1988 to 15,279
containers. The port is, therefore, experiencing a traffic increase as a
result of improved management and improved efficiency.
(e) Cargo Handling Equipment
2.09    Cargo handling equipment currently consists of 51 electric quay
cranes, 74 fork lift trucks, 4 heavy duty (lifting capacity 22 tons) fork
lift trucks, 9 shunting tractors, 10 mobile cranes, 10 tug masters and 30
trailers. Equipment availability in 1987 was:



- 12 -
Electric quay cranes           70Z
Forklift trucks                592 - 87%
Heavy duty forklift trucks     61%
Shunting tractors              33Z
Mobile cranes                  40%
Tug masters                    56%
Trailers                       642

(f) Port Operations
2.10    Annex 5 presents a summary of past performance of port operations
and envisaged targets with improvements under the project. After a long
decline, port operations have significantly improved in 1987-1988, partly
due to the very effective technical assistance programs initiated by Port
of Amsterdam Consultants (financed by Netherlands) and Plantrans (financed
by Finland and Sweden) and partly due to better equipment availability.
Handling rates for all categories of cargo increased, with container
handling in particular reaching a peak loadinglunloading rate of 250 tons
equivalent per hour. This is the more important since container ships are
amongst the most costly vessels and without these improvements in handling
times shipowners might be reluctant to call at Beira. However, further
improvements are needed in the handling of non-containerized cargo, where
progress has been limited due to the systematic procedure of direct
unloading: trains are loaded alongside shies, with ships spending much of
their time in port waiting for wagons. The situation has been exacerbated
by the shortage of shunters, the lack of coordination of shunting
operations, the limited use of pallets for bagged commodities and the lack
of bulk unloading/loading facilities for commodities such as corn, sugar
fertilizers, etc. These constraints are being addressed under the project,
together with provision of spares to improve availability of handling
equipment and training for port employees, and are expected to result in
improvements in handling rates as summarised in Annex 5.
(g) Transit Facilitation
2.11    The transit of goods to Zimbabwe via the Beira Corridor is not
affected by customs delays. Customs clearance is unusually fast at Beira
for international transit goods. Facilitation documents were simplified in
1986, and a new unified document (Combined Port and Customs release
document) has come into use. This document, filed in 7 copies, is used for
Customs, the port and the railways. Shipping agencies must attach to it
the bill of lading and manifest, and, in case of breakbulk cargo, invoices
to assess the value of goods. Customs clearance time for import transit
goods are generally several hours to one day, and rarely exceed two days.
For export transit goods, the necessary documents include the bill of
lading and shipping instructions, and in case of breakbulk, the bill of



- 13 -
entry, stamped by the Government of Zimbabwe, to assess the value of the
goods. Customs clearance is in no way a bottleneck at the present time, as
it is on other links to landlocked countries in Africa.
2.12    A specific and important example of Mozambique/Zimbabwe
coordination is the joint preparation by the Mozambican Beira Corridor
Authority (BCA) and the Zimbabwean Machipanda Beira Authority (MBA) of a
transit agreement to expedite operations, prevent problems, and in case of
disagreements, provide for mutually acceptable arbitration. A draft
agreement is currently under discussion between the two governments. It is
a dated covenant that the agreement be finalized, by June 1990 (para 6.01).
C. Beira-Machipanda Railway
(a) Basic Facilities
2.13    The 315 km Beira-Machipanda line is single track with 38 passing
loops.  After the section Beira-Inhamitanda (see Map 2), the route rises
till Gondola (Mozambique) with steep gradients and sharp curves. From
Gondola to Almada the line goes through rather level terrain but from
Almada to the Zimbabwe border the line once again has sharp curves and
steep gradients. From the border to Dondo, the track has been
reconditioned by the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) over the last two
years, including the replacement of defective sleepers with steel sleepers,
the replacement of old 30 kg/m rail by 18 m lengths of fished 40 kglm rail
and rebalasting.
(b) Motive Power
2.14    CFM(C) has 7 mainline diesel locomotives on the Beira-Machipanda
line, of which 3 were operational in December 1988, 4 being out of service
due to accidents and attacks by armed bandits. A further 13 mainline
diesels have been inaccessable at Inhaminga on the Sena line since 1983 due
to bandit activity. These locomotives are considered to be beyond economic
repair. CFM(C) also has 12 garratt steam locomotives which are mainly used
for domestic traffic, but occasionally haul inte alational freight trains.
At present, much of the motive power on CFM(C) is leased from Zimbabwe
Railways (1800 loco-days per year at a cost of Z$4,682 per day or about
US$2,500 equivalent). Shunting operations in Beira port are handled by
only one steam shunter, which is clearly insufficient.
(c) Rolling Stock
2.15    The CFM(C) freight fleet totals 3,237 wagons of which 2,424 are
currently operational (See Table 2.1 below). Most international traffic is
carried in NRZ wagons for which CFM(C) pays a substantial rental. DANIDA
will finance a component of the program for the repair and rehabilitation
of wagons, which was appraised in September, 1988 and is expected to begin
in 1989 and last for approximately three years.

(d) Workshop
2.16     CFM(C) has a steam locomotive workshop in Beira but virtually no
spares and materials. Part of this workshop was converted under a
component financed by USAID and is to be equipped and stocked to undertake
diesel repairs as part of a USAID Regional Rail Systems Support Project.
This project, which is to start in 1989, will provide a total of US$34.5
million in grant aid to Mozambique, mainly to CFM(S). In Beira, US$1.7
million of tools and equipment would be provided for the workshop.
(e) Staffing
2.17     CFM(C) currently employs 3,000 railway staff on the Machipanda-
Beira line out of a total railway staff (including Sena line) of some
5,300. Given the low traffic volume currently being handled this reflects
some overstaffing, but recent studies by CFM(C) indicate that, with the
expected increases in traffic in the near future, there will be no
overstaffing.
(f) Traffic
2.18     In 1987 CFM(C) handled 481,500 tons of freight of which 397,000
tons were transit traffic on the Beira-Machipanda line. This is only 10%
of what it handled a decade earlier, but compares with 368,100 tonnes in
1986 of which 286,100 were transit traffic, an increase in transit traffic
of 39% from 1986 to 1987. Preliminary results for 1988, however, show no
further growth over 1987, largely due to shortage of locomotive power.



- 15 -
D. Beira-Machipanda Road
2.19     The 282 km road is to be rehabilitated with financing from the
African Development Bank (AfDB), the EEC, Sweden and Japan. At present,
traffic on the road is very light partly because of its poor condition
caused by lack of maintenance over the last decade and inadequate original
design of certain sections. When rehabilitated, it will have a carrying
capacity of about one million tons annually.
E. Pipeline Beira-Mutare
2.20     This pipeline carries finished products from the port to Zimbabwe
and transports 100% of Zimbabwe's imported liquid fuel. In 1987 it carried
some 930,000 tons, up from 772,700 in 1986 (preliminary estimate for 1988,
920,000 tons). The pipeline is in good condition and has a capacity of
upward of 1 million tons, enough to cater to Zimbabwe's needs for the
foreseeable future.
F. Training
2.21     Since the mid-1970s, CFM(C) has suffered from an acute shortage of
skilled labor and, most importantly, a lack of qualified and experienced
technical supervisory and management staff. This problem is further
compounded by the country's low levels of education and literacy.
Currently, DNPCF is responsible at the national level for the planning,
implementation, supervision, coordination, and evaluation of all CFM
training activities. DNPCF carries out this responsibility with the
assistance of consultants through the National Railway Training School in
Inhambane and three Regional Training Centers (CFM(S) Maputo, CFM(C) Beira
and CFM(N) Nacala/Nampula. Although considerable training activities have
been carried out by the Inhambane School and the Regional Centers since the
early 1980s, the overall results have been somewhat limited due to a
variety of problems including (i) weak training capacity at national and
regional levels; (ii) lack of a sound national training program which would
clearly delineate DNPCF's and regional centers' responsibilities and
resources (financial, human, and physical) required to carry out these
responsibilities; (iii) low levels of education and literacy of most
trainees; (iv) the odd location of the Inhambane School; 2 (v) shortages of
(a) effective training courses; (b) relevant training equipment and
materials; (c) adequate physical training facilities; (d) experienced
instructors with good knowledge of the language(s) spoken by trainees; (vi)
shortages of trainees because of lack of incentives and other
organizational constraints; and most importantly, (vii) a weak personnel
management system which does not provide the right kind of motivation
through competitive salaries and career development opportunities.
2.22     In collaboration with technical assistance provided by donor
countries and EEC, DNPCF has been taking remedial actions to strengthen and
expand CFM training capacity at both national and regional levels.
2/Inhambane is hundreds of kilometers from any of the main railway systems,
with which it has very poor communications. This makes it difficult to
attract candidates to the school.



-16 -
Consultants financed by EEC have completed on behalf of BCA a comprehensive
organization and manpower development plan for CFM(C). The plan identifies
training needs and the resources required to prepare and implement training
programs for port and railways personnel. Based on the consultants'
recommendations and data collected during appraisal, the project includes
funds for the preparation and impleret4tion of two parallel four-year
programs for the training, retraining, and upgrading of some 4,500 port and
railways personnel.
Technical Education and Vocational Training
2.23     The responsibility for developing policies and programs of
technical vocational education and training rests with the Secretary of
State for Technical and Vocational Training (SETEP). Up to the late
seventies, over two-thirds of the population was illiterate. Considerable
progress has been made since then in school enrollment and adult literacy
schemes. However, the country's educational and literacy levels are still
low. It is now estimated that only about 5% of the school age population
attend secondary school.
2.24       The University Eduardo Mondlane (UEM) in Maputo offers only five
major basic programs, including engineering. The UEM was negatively
affected by post-independence events which caused a sharp decline in
enrollment until 1978. Although enrollment increased in subsequent years,
recent statistics indicate that only a few hundred students graduate per
year, and less than forty from the faculty of engineering. Of the several
institutions responsible for technical/professional training, four in Beira
run by SETEP are expected to make a useful contribution to certain aspects
of CFM(C)'s training progrems, with assistance to be provided under the
project (see Annex 2).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Proaram Oblectives
3.01     The primary objective of the program is the rehabilitation and
upgrading of the Beira Corridor in order to restore its cost efficient
transit functions which are vital to Malawi and Zimbabwe and constitute an
important source of foreign exchange and employment for Mozambique. The
secondary objectives of the program are as follows:
(i)   to help the Government achieve its objective of providing
cheap transport for the agricultural, productive areas along
the Beira Corridor; and
(ii)  to facilitate capacity building by developing skilled, semi-
skilled and managerial local staff to gradually replace the
technical assistance program, and introduce effective
financial management, particularly in the CFM(C).



- 17 -
B. The Beira Corridor Authority
3.02     In December 1985, the Government of Mozambique (GOM) established
the Beira Corridor Authority (BCA) and appointed the Deputy National
Director of Ports and Railways to be the BCA Director. The objective of
BCA is to 'direct, plan, coordinate, mobilize and supervise the entire
process leading to implementation of the rehabilitation of the Corridor's
system of transportation and communications, including projects of a
complementary nature, specifically those for infrastructure for the city of
Beira" (Bulletin of the Republic, Resolution Establishing Beira Corridor
Authority, Series 1, Number 1, January 1, 1986). To strengthen BCA,
Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, in 1986 provided BCA with an advisory
team, stationed in Europe and available on a part time basis. In 1987 this
team, with some overlap, was replaced by a 9-man, full time team of which
eight are presently stationed in Beira. This team, also financed by the
Nordic counties, has considerably strengthened the capacity of the BCA to
coordinate and speed up implementation and freed the BCA Executive Director
to focus on the strategic aspects of the Beira Corridor System and the
liaison with Mozambique's partner countries in SADCC as well as the donor
community providing financing for the rehabilitation. Donor coordination
meetings are held on an "ad hoc" basis as necessary. The performance of
BCA has been fully satisfactory.
C. The Beira Transport Corridor Program
3.03     BCA is undertaking the first phase of a 10-year development
program, with an estimated cost of around US$345 million and with funding
largely lined up from 18 bilateral and multilateral agencies (see Tables
3.1 and 3.2). The program consists of rehabilitation and upgrading of the
port, rail, and road facilities and provision of technical assistance and
training. The overall Beira Transport Corridor program includes four
categories of sub-projects: railway, port, road and general sub-projects,
the last being mainly for the upgrading of the city of Beira, where present
infraotructure and services are seriously deteriorated (the bulk of these
are being addressed under the IDA-assisted Urban Rehabilitation Project,
Cr.19490-MOZ). The criteria on which investments are planned give priority
to rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and manpower development (see
Annex 9). A summary description of each category of sub-projects is given
below (cost estimates shown include contingencies).
3.04     The main port sub-proiects are:
(a)   Dredging the entrance channel to deepen it from the current
depth of 6 meters to 8 meters. This will enable larger
vessels of PANAMAX size, third generation ro-ro vessels and
up to 60,000 DWT product tankers to use the port and will
result in considerable cost savings. The contract for this
component has been awarded and work started in February,
1989 and will be completed by the end of 1990 (cost US$18.9
million, financed by The Netherlands); thereafter,
mairntenance dredging will be necessary to maintain the depth
of the channel. Equipment for maintenance dredging is
proposed for EEC financing (cost US$12 million);



- 18 -
(b)   Multipurpose and container handling terminal, with a
capacity of up to 100,000 containers p,- year including
reconstruction of berths 2-5 and new buildings. The quay
foundations of berths 2-5 (645 meters) had deteriorated to
such an extent during their 60 year life that the structure
might have collapsed at any time; reconstruction was
therefore necessary and started in June, 1988 (cost US$67.5
million financed by EEC 48.0 million ECU, Netherlands 4.7
million Guilders and FINNIDA US$4.3 million);
(c)   New oil terminal to make it possible to handle oil product
tankers of a size up to 60,000 DWT, as against the existinig
20,000 DWT limitation and thus reduce the cost of shipping;
oil products. The final design is underway with call for
tenders expected in March 1989 (cost US$13.9 million,
financed by NORAD);
(d) Reconstruction of the port railways. Beira port was
designed as a railway port, with cargo being loaded and
unloaded directly to and from rail wagons. With the
development of multi-purpose and container terminals and the
handling of ro-ro and container vessels, direct loading and
unloading of rail wagons at berths becomes inefficient.
Hence the port rail network needs to be redesigned.
Detailed design has started, implementation expected to
start in 1989 (cost US$13.1 million financed by Italy);
(e)   Equipment for multi-purpose and container handling terminal.
The first phase of rehabilitating existing equipment
(cranes) is completed. The second phase of providing 4
forklift trucks (two 42 tonnes and two 28 tonnes) plus four
new tugmasters is also complete. This enables the port to
handle 40 ft. containers, an important step in its ability
to compete with RSA ports. A third phase includes new ship
to shore cranes (out to tender) to be implemented in
1989/90 (cost US$18.2 million financed by AfDB) and other
equipment and technical assistance to be financed by
FINNIDA/SIDA (US$24 million) and the Netherlands (US$6
million);
(f)   Tug and pilot boats - procurement of two harbour tugs, two
pilot boats and two work and line boats to provide the port
with modern service vessels and so reduce the turnaround
time of vessels in port. The pilot boats are in service and
the other boats are to be delivered in 1989; (cost US$10.6
million financed by DANIDA); and
(g)   Technical Assistance to Manage the Port, currently being
undertaken by Dutch and Finnish/Swedish experts, needs
supplementing with a training component, proposed for IDA
financing (cost US$5.9 million financed by Netherlands,
Finland and Sweden, additional TA and training are included
in the IDA component and described in paras 3.10 to 3.17).



- 19 -
3.05     The main rail sub-proiects are:
(a)   Rehabilitation of the Beira-Machipanda line.  This work
which consists of resleepering and rebalasting, has been
completed, except for a 25 km stretch between Dondo and
Beira (cost US$9 million, implemented by NRZ and financed by
NORAD, SIDA, Austria, Canada and USAID);
(b)   Track maintenance equipment - tender documents being
prepared (cost US$3.5 million financed by Austria);
(c)   New radio telecommunications and train control systems are
intended to improve communications and train control to
increase efficiency and line utilization (cost US$8.4
million, fin-aeed by Italy);
(d)   Acquisition of locomotives to replace leased Zimbabwean
locomotives and provide additional capacity to cope with
increased traffic and shunting (see paras 3.18-3.25 for
details).   IDA financing is proposed for the shunting
component, while bilateral financing from Canada and untied
financing from Japan are proposed for the main-line diesel
locomotives.
(e)   Manpower development and training.  Technical assistance in
line positions to reinforce CFM(C) with respect to general
management, supervisors and key personnel in technical
departments and to establish training programs for
Mozambican personnel. Programs are already in place for the
port funded by the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden and a
recently completed organization and manpower development
study financed by the EEC has determined the remaining needs
for the port and for the railway which are proposed for
financing by Spain and IDA (see paras 3.10 - 3.17 for
details).
3.06     Road sub-prolects include mainly the upgrading of the road between
Beira and Machipanda (US$27.0 million, EEC, Sweden, AfDB).
3.07     General sub-Prolects, apart from the rehabilitation of the
infrastructure and services and housing provision for the city of Beira,
include the development of a cost-based tariff system (US1.3 million) and a
management information system (US$1.0 million) both of which are proposed
for IDA financing (see para 3.26 for details).
D.         Overall Program Cost and Financing

E. IDA Assisted Program Componen'-s
3.09     Program components included in the IDA-assisted project are:
(i)   technical assistance to run port and railways operations in
the Beira Transport Corridor during the 1989-95 period;
(ii) manpcwer development and training at all levels of CFM(C);
(iii) rehabilitation and acquisition of motive power for main line
and shunting operations;
(iv) technical assistance for the study and implementation of a
railway/port cost accounting system and a management
information system in CFM(C); and
(v)   studies and technical assistance for future investments.
(i)    Technicat Assistance to CFM(C)
3.10     Beira port and the crucial rail line between Beira and Machipanda
are managed by CFM(C) under the general authority of Beira Corridor
Authority (BCA). At present, there is considerable concern over the
technical and managerial effectiveness of CFM(C). The major constraint on
the efficiency of the organization has been identified as being the lack of



- 22 -
managerial and technical, skilled and semi-skilled personnel due to the
abrupt loss of skilled manpower at the time of Mozambique's independence.
The efficient functioning of CFM(C) is crucial to the success of BCA's plan
for the development and expansion of the Beira Corridor transport system.
A study financed by the EEC, the terms of reference of which were agreed
with IDA, has prepared a comprehensive Organization and Manpower
Development Plan for CFM(C), which forms the basis of the TA and training
included in the project. Manpower training targets for CFM(C) were
established during the study and a 2lan of organizational development was
agreed to enable CFM(C) to perform efficiently in the context of both
today's restricted traffic flows and the predicted expansion of traffic
over the next few years.  The study also identifies the technical
assistance required in the short to medium term while Mozambique staff is
being trained. The TA component of the project provides the financing
required to implement the manpower development and training proposed.
Additional financing will be provided by bilateral donors for their ongoing
technical assistance teams in Beira, including container terminal
operations (Finland and Sweden), port operations (Holland) and railway
operations (Spain). Details of the training and technical assistance
programs are shown in Annexes 2 and 3. Agreement was reached during
negotiations on the terms and duration of contracts for the key management
posts for CFM(C) (para 6.01).
3.11     Additional technical assistance needs in the ,ort are quite
limited due to the fact that the very effective TA programs being financed
by the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden cover most areas of port operations.
The effectiveness of these programs, which involve twenty experts over a
four year period up to 1991, is not only due to the experience of the
individuals involved but also to the fact that they work in line management
positions with operational responsibilities. The existing positions cover
port traffic, the container terminal, workshops, general cargo operations,
maintenance, marketing and manpower development. The donors concerned have
indicated their readiness to extend these contracts up to 1995. The
additional positions needed and which IDA would finance are in the general
service areas:
(i)   cost accounting specialist (48 months); and
(ii) procurement expert (48 months)
3.12     Unlike the port, the railway has received only limited technical
assistance in the last few years, from India and the German Democratic
Republic (GDR), and has only now received the first 11 members of a team
from Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Espanoles (RENFE) financed by Spain.
The positions to be filled by Spanish TA (400 man-months) are described in
Annex 3 together with the additional positions to be financed by IDA (a
further 400 man-months). To help provide a unified and motivated' team,
RENFE staff would focus on operational and technical positions, with IDA
funding general manpower development, marketing and accounting positions
for CFM(C) as a whole and railway maintenace positions. Building on the
success of the technical assistance in the port, the positions in the
railway would also be for line management with operational
responsibilities. To ensure the effectiveness of the technical assistance
effort, specific achievement goals will be set and performance monitored
through the Project coordinator (see para 3.13 below).



- 23 -
3.13     A Project Coordinator has been selected who will be responsible
for coordinating and monitoring the effectiveness of the technival
assistance in the railway and training throughout CFM(C). His position
will be funded by UNDP with the Bank as executing agency. The terms of
reference for this position have been agreed with G0M and CFH(C) and are
included in Annex 10.
(ii)   Capacity Building for CFM(C)
3.14     Two parallel programs for the training, retraining and upgrading
of port and railways personnel at all levels will be administered by CFM(C)
with technical assistance. Capacity building is a long-term process which
requires continuing monitoring and sustained investment. Accordingly, the
project would finance the first five years of a long-term manpower
development program (15 year horizon) which would provide training courses
for some 4,500 port (2,500) and railways (2,000) personnel from managers
and middle level technicians to equipment operators, mechanics and
administrative staff. Because of the low level of education and literacy
of most personnel, it is expected that during the first five years
substantial training technical assistance will be required to initiate the
programs and to train Hozambican counterparts who would be gradually
assigned to expatriate personnel. It is also expected that in addition to
relevant technical subjects, many trainees will have to undertake more
general subjects such as English, Portuguese, mathematics and chemistry in
order to strengthen their basic education.
3.15     Financing would be provided under the proposed credit for (a)
strengthening and expanding CFM(C) training capacity and its training
center; (b) providing housing for instructors; (c) purchasing textbooks,
training equipment and materials, audio-visual training aids anl developing
relevant courses; (d) recruiting suitable instructors; (e) training abroad
(fellowships) for selected middle an high level port and railways
management staff as well as training officers and senior Mozambican
instructors; (f) strengthening four technicallvocational schools which will
assist with the training effort; (g) implementation of an incentive scheme
for CFM(C)'s trainees; (h) a transportation sector survey of manpower
requirements and related training needs; and (i) a mid- and end-project
training evaluation, including the preparation of the next phase follow-up
of the proposed training program. Annex 2 and attachments provide details
of the training programs, including their objectives, elements and cost
estimates. In order to carry out additional courses for CFM(C) staff, four
technical/vocational schools in Beira would receive funds under the
proposed credit for additional instructors and training equipment and
materials.
3.16     A training section, with technical assistance, has been
established and its chief appointed to be responsible for the planning,
budgeting, implementation, supervision, and evaluation of all CFM(C)
training activities. The section includes a port and a railways unit, and
adequate staff to carry out its responsibilities including the supervision
of the CFM(C) training center. After an adequate period of training abroad
and in-service, as counterparts to the Chief of the Training Section and
the training managers, CFM(C) training staff would become gradually more
responsible for supervising the implementation of all training activities.
CFM(C) has also established a Training Steering Committee within CFM(C)



- 24 -
whose main responsibility is to provide policy guidelines, determine
priorities, and periodically evaluate the training programs. The project
will provide training technical assistance for a total of 552 man-months to
help CFM(C) manage the execution of all training activities. Because of
the substantial amount of technical assistance and training inputs expected
to be provided by other agencies/donors, a close coordination is essential
among all those involved with training to prevent costly duplication of
efforts. Draft terms of reference for training technical assistance
financed under the project are available in the Project File. Financing
has also been provided under the project for an independent mid and end-
project training evaluation, including the preparation of follow up
training program. A transportation sector survey of manpower and training
needs to guide further actions in the sector on a country-wide basis, is
currently underway, financed out of PPF funds. Because of the nature of
training, the Association would finance 100Z of all local and foreign
costs.
3.17     Remuneration of CFM(C) Workers.  To increase the productivity of
CFM(C) workers, it is proposed that a study be undertaken of means to
improve worker incentives. During negotiations, assurat.ces were obtained
that BCA will undertake such a study using PPF funds and, by December 31,
1990, will prepare a detailed program for the implementation of the study
recommendations, exchange views with the Association and circulate it to
donors for comment.
(iii) Acquisition of Locomotives and Shunters
3.18     In view of a continuing shortage of motive power for mainline and
shunting services, DNPCF commissioned a study in 1988 by RITES of India
financed out of PPF, to determine the needs of locomotives for the whole of
its network and analyse the economics of rehabilitation versus new
purchases. From this study it became apparent that much of the locomotive
fleet was old and in need of replacement or rehabilitation. The current
locomotive position of DNPCF is shown in Table 3.3 below;

3.19     The requirements of locomotives on the Mozambican Railway Systems
were studied on the basis that all three railway corridors (excluding the
Sena Line) will be open for international and domestic traffic from 1991
onwards. Based on 24 hour working of all the three lines and excluding the
future possible requirements of the Sena line, the number of additional
main-line locomotives to be acquired has been estimated up to 1995 as
follows:
1991     -      9
1992     -      4
1993     -      2
1994     -      4
1995     -      6
25
3.20     If however, security conditions permit only 12 hour working in
1991, the number of additional locos to move the traffic demand in 1991
would be 36, as opposed to 9 with 24-hour operations. In so far as the
Beira Corridor is concerned, the number of additional locos required to
compensate for 12 hour working in 1991 is 9. Since the Beira port is
expected to develop the full capacity to meet the full traffic demand in
1991, it is crucial that locomotive capacity will be available to ensure
that materialisation of returns on the large capital investments in the
port is not delayed. It is, therefore, proposed to acquire 15 locomotives
in 1991 itsclf, instead of 9 in 1991, 4 in 1992, and 2 in 1993. When
discounted to 1991, the cost of reasonably insuring against the risk of the
security problem not being fully solved ia 1991, by purchase of the 6
locomotives in advance, works out to 0.711 times the cost of a new
locomotive or US$1.21 million. As against this, the possible loss of
benefit caused by insufficient motive power capacity to move the traffic
forecast would be considerably greater (about US$9.4 million annually).
The acquisition of the 15 locomotives is also a safeguard against any
possible slippages in the ongoing rehabilitation program.
3.21     As regards shunters, the existing steam locos will continue to be
used at outstations, with the acquisition of diesel shunters for the Beira
complex, where 6 are required.
3.22     The proposed USAID-funded Regional Rail Systems Support Project
(para 2.16) covers the needs of rehabilitation and major overhaul arrears
of diesel mainline locomotives, and parts for maintenance for a three year
period. It also provides funds for tools, equipment and facilities, as
well as technical assistance to maintenance workshops. Funds for major
overhauls and rehabilitation works during the project period, (estimated at
US$1.5 million), however, are not covered under the USAID project and are
included in the IDA assisted project.
3.23     A rehabilitation program for the comparatively new diesel shunters
(Romanian) is currently under way, and is expected to be completed in 1990.
Funding of an additional $1.5 million for spares and technical assistance
to complete the rehabilitation program is included in the IDA financing.



- 26 -
3.24     The proposed locomotive allocation policy on the CFM(C) is as
follows:
(i)    Passenger services, service trains, and shunting services
at outstations (other than Beira) are to be met by steam
locomotives, which would not be economical for mainline
freight services.
(ii)   Mainline diesel locomotives will be used to operate freight
services.
(iii)  Shunting services in the Beira complex are to be provided
with diesel shunters.
(iv)   The steam locomotives, which are of vintages ranging from
1946 to 1955, will have to be phased out, in due course, on
an age-cum-condition basis.
3.25     The railways in Nozambique, in contrast to most other Sub-Saharan
African railways have the advantage of a standardized main-line diesel
locomotive fleet. In view of the imperative need to limit the variety of
locomotives to one or two not very dissimilar types, in order to maintain
the benefits of standardization, the acquisition of the new locomotives is
proposed to be done with appropriate bilateral assistance (5 locomotives
with untied Japanese assistance and 10 locomotives with Canadian
assistance). As regards the six shunters, it is proposed to acquire them
out of IDA funds under ICB. These locos would be confined to working on the
Beira Corridor, where, the necessary expertise and inventory would be
developed. The allocation of these locomotives will be as stated in para
3.24 (ii) and (iii) above, which was confirmed at negotiations (para.
6.01).
(iv)   Cost Accounting and Management Information Systems
3.26     CFM(C)'s accounting system, although better than in other DNPCF
branches, is incapable of providing management with the elements required
for day-to-day and long-term management. Not only is there lack of
qualified personnel, but also the system is not geared towards cost
accounting which would provide adequate information on a cost/profit center
basis. Furthermore, CFM(C) does not have a management information system
to facilitate and expedite the accounting functions.   The purpose of this
component is, therefore, to contribute to the strengthening of financial
management of the CFM(C) railways aad Beira Port. The cost estimates
included in Table 3.3 are based on the recommendation of the M.I.S. needs
study financed by the PPF.
(v)    Studies and Technical Assistance for Future Investments
3.27     To assist in the ongoing rehabilitation of the Limpopo line (para
1.14), 100 man-months of IDA funded assistance is proposed for the
management team of the Brigada de Melhoramentos do Sul (BMS), the



- 27 -
development and construction arm of CFM(S). The U.K.ODA-funded study of
the rehabilitation of the Limpopo line3 identified a critical shortage of
management in BMS and recommended expatriate technical assistance to fill
the gap during the rehabilitation period 1989-91. IDA comented on the
study, generally accepting its findings but urging restraint on the size of
the investment program. The IDA-funded technical assistance, terms of
reference for which are available in the Project File, would identify
future technical assistance and training needs after the line becomes
operational in 1991, which might form part of a future IDA-assisted
project. The IDA credit would also fund a review of the technical
assistance needs oi DNPCF as well as the preparation of future projects in
the transport sector.
F. Rationale for IDA Components
3.28     IDA's role in the project has been to assist in ensuring the
viability of the whole investment pr ;ram through (a) analysis of the costs
and benefits of each component and of the overall program; (b) acting as a
catalyst for other investors in the project, as in the case of locomotives;
and (c) as a lender of last resort in the capacity building program to
complement investments made by others. IDA's investments in the project
are thus ones which IDA is uniquely equipped to finance and are directed
towards the self-sufficiency and financial viability of the Beira Corridor
and other elements of the DNPCF within the framework of the ERP.
G. Prolect Cost Estimates
3.29     Total estimated cost of the IDA assisted project is US$73.75
million (see Table 3.4). The costs have been estimated net of taxes.

H. Financing
3.30     In view of the continuing severe domestic resource constraints,
the Government's financial contribution will not exceed local costs of
US$4.25 million or 5.8% of total project cost. Hence, full financing of
foreign costs (US$69.50 million, net of taxes) will be necessary. IDA
funds of US$40 million have been allocated to the project in FY90 and
untied financing from Japan (US$8.0 million) and parallel financing from



- 29 -
Spain (US$3.5 million) and Portugal (US$1.0 million) have been assured.
Parallel cofinancing of US$17.0 million for locomotives is being secured
from CIDA. It is not envisaged that any of the donors will request the
World Bank to administer their funds, either through Trust Fund
arrangements or through other cofinancing arrangements involving review of
withdrawal applications.
I. Implementation
3.31     The IDA-assisted components will be implemented over a period of
six years and be completed by December 31, 1995, with a closing date of
June 30, 1996. DNPCF and its successor CFM,EE through its subsidiary
CFM(C), will be responsible for the implementation of the project.
Conditions of effectiveness would be (a) a signed legal agreement (Beira
Corridor Implementation Agreement) specifying the mutual obligations of all
agencies involved in implemenitation of the project and, (b) a signed
subsidiary loan agreement between the borrower and DNPCF (para 6.01). A
Project Coordinator has been appointed to supervise the implementation of
the Project (see para 3.13).   In addition, expatriate staff will be
employed to assist CFM(C) in implementation. The implementation schedule is
shown in Annex 1. To measure progress in meeting anticipated improvements
in CFM(C) efficiency and productivity, CFM(C) has agreed to a comprehensive
set of operational targets for the project period (Annex 5). These targets
will be reviewed by IDA at annual implementation reviews each September.

3.33     Goods:  Equipment and goods are expected to be financed both under
the proposed credit and by co-financiers. Such equipment and goods,
financed under the proposed credit, would be procured by ICB in accordance
with the Association's Procurement Guidelines. Eligible domestic
manufacturtrs would be afforded a preference of 15 percent or applicable
duty, whichever is lower, under ICB procurement. A margin of 7.52
preference to domestic contractors would also apply. In cases where the
borrower can show to the Association's satisfaction that the items required
are clearly established manufacturers' parts, in which case they may be
obtained directly from the original suppliers through negotiated direct
contracts up to a maximum of US$2.0 million in total. Where small orders
are under US$100,000 each, up to a maximum of US$2.0 million in total for
which international or local shopping through obtaining at least three
price quotations will be applied. Goods estimated at US$25 million and
consultancy services estimated at US$6 million parallel-financed by co-
donors will be procured in accordance with the procedures of the respective
agencies. All documentation for procurement of goods financed by IDA in
excess of the US$100,000 will be subject to IDA :eview prior to issuance of
tenders and award of contracts.
3.34     Technical Assistance:  Technical Assistance and training funded by
IDA will be provided by speciAlist consultant firm(s) who will be appointed
in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines for the use of consultants.
K. Disbursements
3.35     Disbursements from the IDA Credit will be made on the following
basis:
Mi)    100% of foreign expenditures and 70% of local expenditures
for (a) acquisition of shunting locomotives and (:)
materials, equipment, furniture and supplies for provision
of housing for expatriate specialists and instructors;
(ii)   100% of foreign expenditures for vehicles, spare parts,
computers, office equipment, materials and supplies; and
(iii) 100% of the total cost in the case of consultants'
services, training, studies and external audit services.
assistance for transport planning; and (iii) training;
Disbursements would be made against full documentation, except for payments
against contracts of less than US$50,000 for goods and US$20,000 for
consultants services which would be disbursed against certified statements
of expenditure. Supporting documents would be retained by CFM(C), and made
available for review by visiting Bank missions and by auditors.
3.36     To facilitate project implementation, a U.S. Dollar Special
Account would be opened in a commercial bank, and operated and maintained
on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocation for



- 31 -
the Special Account would be US$4.0 million, representing anticipated
eligible expenditures for a period of about four months (excluding
anticipated large payments which would be handled through letters of credit
or direct payment). The Special Account would be replenished on receipt of
properly documented withdrawal applications prepared by the BCA on a
regular monthly basis promptly after receipt and reconciliation of bank
statements from the commercial bank.
3.37     The estimated schedule of disbursements from the IDA Credit based
on the assumption of effectiveness by January 31, 1990, is as follows:

L.  ProJect Monitoring
3.38     DNPCF (and its successor CFM,EE) and CFM(C) will, with the
assistance of the Project Coordinator, submit quarterly progress reports as
per an agreed format covering, inter alia, the following aspects:
(i)    Progress of the project work with cost data;
(ii)   Training and technical assistance;
(iii) DNPCF/CFM(C) financial performance; and
(iv)   CFM(C) performance in meeting the agreed operational
targets.
M. Budget, Accounts, Audit and Evaluation
3.39     DNPCF prepares annual operating and capital budgets before the
beginning of eacn fiscal year which are submitted to the Ministry of
Transport and Communications (MTC) and subsequently to the Ministry of
Finance. DNPCF was assisted by consultants (RITES) in the preparation of
their consolidated financial statements for 1986 and 1987. The accounts
are audited by the Ministry of Finance rather than by external auditors and
it was a pre-condition of the appraisal of this Credit that the
consolidated financial statements audited by the Ministry of Finance be
available. During project implementation, CFM(C) will provide the
Association with audits of the annual financial statements prepared by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association within 6 months of the
completion of each financial year. At che same time, CFM,EE will also



- 32 -
provide audits of its annual consolidated financial statements prepared by
the Government Audit Department The auditors would also review records of
amounts withdrawn on the basis of SOEs and their opinion would include a
separate paragraph covering these withdrawals. No later than six months
after Closing Date (June 30, 1996), DNPCF will provide the Association with
a Completion Report which evaluates the operations, execution, costs and
benefits of the project; the performance of CFM(C) and the Bank Group, and
lessons learned.
N. Environment
3.40     Since most of the IDA assisted components relate to rehabilitation
of existing assets and provision of technical assistance, it is not
considered that they will have an adverse effect on the environment. In
the city of Beira, IDA is already contributing to improvement of the
environment through the Urban Rehabilitation Project, which includes
rehabilitation of the sewerage system, solid waste management and erosion
control measures to return the coastline to its natural habitat. For the
Beira Transport Corridor Program as a whole, BCA has provided assurances at
negotiations that environmental aspects have been taken into account. In
the port, the Program will lessen the risk of accidents and subsequent
pollution through improved navigational aids and deepening of the access
channel. In the railway, the diesel workshop modernization will improve
safety and the rehabilitation and acquisition of locomotives will have a
beneficial effect through the consequential phasing out of atmosphere-
polluting steam locomotives.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Introduction
4.01     The economic evaluation of the Beira Transport Corridor Program is
based on an updated version of the traffic forecasting and allocation
models developed by the Netherlands Economic Institute (NEI) for IDA's
earlier study of the Beira Corridor (para 1.20), and the latest (1988)
Southern Africa Transport and Communications Commission (SATCC) commodity-
wise traffic forecasts by country. This combination provides commodity-
wise traffic flows for the Beira Corridor and competing routes and gives
the best estimates of the project's rate of return.  The NEI methodology
also forms the basis of a wider study being undertaken to review all of the
Southern Africa Transport Corridors.  This study, which is being undertaken
by the Bank under the sponsorship of SATCC with funding from the
Netherlands, USAID, Denmark ana Canada, reviews the financial and economic
viability of all of the transport corridors in the SADCC region with a view
to increasing their effectiveness through enhanced cooperation within the
region. It is expected to be completed by the end of 1989.
B. Traffic Forecast
4.02     The traffic forecast for the Beira corridor for the period 1989 to
2005 is summarised in Table 4.1. It considers future traffic for three
scenarios: a) the entire Beira Corridor program, including the IDA

assisted projects (the project case); b) the Beira corridor program but
without the IDA assisted projects (the without IDA projects case); and c)
without any program (the without all projects case). This last scenario is
hypothetical, since many Beira corridor projects are already under
execution and many others are already financed by bilateral agencies.
However, this scenario represents the base case against which (a) and (b)
will be evaluated and allows, therefore, an assessment of the overall
economic viability of the corridor project with and without the rail
project components which are included in the proposed IDA assisted project.
The traffic forecasts include traffic generated by Mozambique, Zimbabwe,
Malawi and Zambia, by all modes in the corridor, i.e., rail, road and
pipeline.
4.03     In the project case the total volume of traffic through Beira, in
1992, is estimated at 2.36 million MT (metric tonnes), including 0.96
million MT of petroleum oil lubricants (POL). This includes all Zimbabwe's
POL imports plus approximately 50% of the remaining overseas trade from
Zimbabwe (0.8 million MT, the other 50% going through Maputo), and
approximately 120,000 MT of Zambia's forecast copper exports. Overseas
trade of Malawi only starts using Beira again at a significant level after
the Sena line reopens (in this analysis it is assumed that the Sena line
will reopen in 1995). To compare the forecasts in Table 4.1 with the Beira
port statistics it is necessary to convert the latter into MT. The 1987
throughput in Beira was 1.5 million MT (including POL), which are roughly
1.9 million port tons.
4.04     Without the railway project components included in the IDA
assisted project, the total capacity of the railway system linking Beira
with its hinterland is assumed to remain at the present (1938) level, i.e.,
around 400 to 500,000 MT per year. This assumes locomotive power
availability through the present lease arrangements with NRZ or variations
which will guarantee the minimum power required to transport those
tonnages. Without both port and
railway projects (i.e. the without all projects case), no international
rail traffic could be expected, since the quality of service would be so
poor as to divert any international traffic to alternative routes. Also,
the traffic originated in Mozambique's central region would grow less
rapidly, as reasonable inland railway connections are necessary if the
growth rate forecast for Mozambique's export traffic in the project case is
to be attained.
4.05     The traffic forecast has been prepared in four steps starting with
total traffic generation followed by traffic distribution, modal split and
traffic assignment to the several routes and modes. To follow this method
it was necessary to: a) estimate the total external trade of Zimbabwe,
Malawi and Zambia by commodity, which was done on the basis of SATCC
forecasts; b) estimate the total overseas trade of these same countries by
commodity; and c) estimate the total generalized transport costs per
commodity by different routes (Beira, Maputo, Durban, Nacala). The
generalized cost applied in this study includes railway cost, road cost,
handling in ports, time cost of cargo, insurance, pilferage, and
differences in ocean freight costs between the ports of exit. The
allocation of traffic to routes took into account points of origin of the



- 35 -
cargo within the hinterland, total generalized cost and availability of
specific handling equipment in ports, specific agreed transport contracts
and port capacity constraints (Beira, up to 1991). All Zambian traffic,
except part of Zambian copper exports, have been allocated to
the Dar-es-Salasm route. Insofar as national traffic is concerned the
forecasts include a commodity-wise forecast of overseas import and export
traffic from the central region of Mozambique and of the national coastal
shipping traffic (cabotage). Details are given in Annex 6.
4.06    The most important factor in the allocation of traffic between the
competing routes is the generalized cost of transport incurred in using
them. This includes not only inland costs but also the differences in
ocean freight rates between the ports of Beira, Maputo and Durban. Table
4.2 shows the difference in generalized costs between the Beira corridor
and the other routes for containerized cargo. Detailed transport costs are
given in
Annex 6.

Cost level in 1988 includes railway/road, handling in port, time cost,
insurance, pilferage, difference in ocean freight.
4.07    The generalized cost approach produces a traffic allocation
between the Beira and Durban routes which is quite close to the tonnages
transported in 1987 (Table 4.3). Indeed, while direct out-of-pocket costs
through Beira are cheaper than via Durban, the present generalized costs by
the latter are lower and this explains why only 17% of Zimbabwean traffic
(other than POL) goes via Beira while 55% goes via Durban.

4.08    Traffic allocation to the Beira corridor becomes more complicated
when the interdependence between the Beira line and the Limpopo line
(Zimbabwe to Maputo) is taken into account. Given the recent donor support
to the rehabilitation of this line it has been assumed that it will be
fully operational .n 1991, which is a conservative assumption from the
point of view of the Beira corridor. If the Limpopo line is available,
more Zimbabwean traffic will go through Maputo than in the present
situation, since in 1988 the only route from Zimbabwe to Maputo is via the
RSA. Table 4.4 shows the influence of the opening of the Limpopo corridor
on the traffic forecast for the Beira corridor. The Limpopo line, if fully
operational, would attract in 1992 some 230,000 MT (142 of total Zimbabwean
traffic), which otherwise would take the Beira route. Most of the
containerized cargo to/from Zimbabwe will go through Beira, most of the
bulk (especially exports of minerals, steel and sugar) goes through Maputo.

4.09     The impact of the opening of the Limpopo line on the economic rate
of return of the Beira corridor is significant. An important part of the
benefits generated by the development of the Beira corridor consists in the
savings in inland transport costs as compared to the least cost alternative
"without the project". If the least cost alternative is the Limpopo line
instead of the route to Maputo via RSA or to Durban, the inland transport
savings are much lower (see Table 4.2). By developing both routes (Beira
and Limpopo) at the same time, part of the potential benefits of the Beira
corridor are attributed to the Limpopo route. Paras 4.13 - 4.19 below give
the distribution of benefits by line and the economic rate of return of the
program, for each of the scenarios.
4.10     The assumption that the Nacala line opens in 1991, and the Sena
line only in 1995 is also disadvantageous to the Beira corridor, implying
that no Malawi cargo will transit through the port of Beira between 1991
and 1995. From 1995 onwards, however, it can be assumed that the traffic
on the Sena line will be consider3bly higher than on the Nacala line. If
only the inland transport costs were taken into account, the Malawi traffic
would be split approximately 50/50 between Beira and Nacala. However, the
expected level of shipping services in Nacala is substantially lower than
in Beira (no major Conference seriices) causing considerably higher ocean
freight cost and time costs in Nacala for moving on liner vessels to North
West Europe. Allocation of traffic between Beira and Nacala is presented
in Annex 6.
4.11     As mentioned above the present and future level of shipping
services in the ports involved is a decisive factor for the development of
the corridors. At present, although the official tariff for the North
Western Europe conference line vessels is equal for Durban, Maputo and
Beira, the level of service in these ports is quite different; special
tariffs can be negotiated in case of large shipments, such as the tariff
negotiated by the Zimbabwe Tobacco Ass. for containerized tobacco exports
through Durban. Also, "outsiders', i.e. vessels which do not belong to
conferences, charge different tariffs for Beira, Maputo and Durban.
Moreover, eastbound connections (Far East, Australia) and South/North
America connections would, at present, require transhipment (at
considerable extra cost) at Durban, if Beira is used. Discussions with
shipping line managers suggest that when Beira port becomes fully
operational with the expected handling rates and a minimum flow of about
6000 MT or 500 TEUs/week, the major differences in level of service between
Beira and Durban will disappear. The same holds true for Maputo, if the
minimum cargo flows are met. Nacala cannot be expected to reach a
comparable level of shipping services for liner trade, irrespective of the
port facilities available, because the overall level of traffic will remain
rather low and the port lies outside the main shipping routes.
4.12     The distances between Zimbabwe and the port of Beira (Harare-
Beira 605 km; Mutare-Beira 280 km) are such that a significant amount of
road traffic might be expected when rehabilitation of the road between
Machipanda and Beira is completed in the early 1990s. This prompted an
analysis of the modal split in the Beira corridor, to forecast the traffic
which mi&ht be diverted from rail to road. On the basis of generalized
transport costs which include a two-week advantage for road transport, an



- 38 -
empty return for trucks (502 load factor) and a US$10/MT road toll to
reflect infrastructure costs, road traffic appears to be interesting for
only a small proportion of the high value international cargo. This is
partly due to the high cost of fuel in Zimbabwe, which weighs heavily in
the tariff charged for heavy trucks. Another factor in favor of rail is
that existing transport infrastructure in Zimbabwe is strongly based on
transport by rail. Also, the Mozambique government has indicated that, in
the short run (up to 1995), it will continue to regulate international
traffic in the corridor until the railway manpower is developed and the
present operational constraints are removed, allowing   only selected
cargoes to use the road. In the long term, when traffic is deregulated,
road transport may become more attractive for cargoes originating in
Zimbabwe and even in the Lusaka region (Zambia), because the Beira road
route will be cheaper than the present Dar-es-Salaam road route.  Without
the project (i.e. with very poor rail and port service), it is forecast
that the road would carry roughly 70,000 MTlyear of international traffic,
in 1995. In the situation with the project (i.e. with greatly improved
rail and port servi.ce), the volume handled by road will be 40,000 MT/year
of international traffic plus 120,000 MT/year of local traffic. The latter
has average haul distances of 200 km, over which road is cheaper than rail.
To assess the impact of increased efficiency of road transport and eventual
deregulation of traffic on future modal split, a drop of 30% in road
tariffs was tested. The results show that road traffic would, in this case,
increase to 225,000 MT in 1995 and 280,000 MT in 2005. The rail/road modal
split on the Beira Machipanda route (i.e. without the traffic from the Sena
line), changes from 96%:4% to 791s21% in 1995, if the traffic is
deregulated and truck tariffs drop by 30%. These modal shifts do not
affect the overall rate of return of the corridor. However, they affect
the financial rate of return of the railway which, when setting its new
tariff schedule, will need to take account of the effects of eventual
international traffic deregulation on the modal split.
C. Economic Evaluation
4.13     The economic evaluation takes into account  all the costs of the
Beira corridor program (investment, technical assistance, training,
operating and maintenance costs). Details are given in Annex 6. Four
types of benefits have been considered: a) inland transport benefits for
diverted traffic, i.e. using the Beira corridor instead of other
corridors; these benefits are calculated as the difrerence between total
generalized transport costs for Malawi and Zimbabwe overseas trade in the
'without the programu and in the uwith the program" situations; b) waiting
and service time benefits for normal traffic at the port: waiting time
benefits resulting from reduced waiting time and costs in the Port of Beira
for normal cargo, i.e. the total volume of cargo forecast in the "without
the program' situation. The difference in waiting costs per ton between
the "with" and "without" project situation is multiplied by the amount of
"normal' traffic to derive the waiting time benefits. Service time
benefits have been calculated using the NEI port simulation model,
including the queuing model, for the port of Beira; c) waiting and service
benefits for generated traffic; d) freight cost benefits for normal traffic
due to the use of larger vessels or a better level of service
(containerized cargo). No waiting time benefits or service time benefits



- 39 -
are taken into account for diverted traffic, because it is reasonable to
assume that port capacity in Maputo and Nacala is large enough to handle
the additional traffic without longer waiting times than in Beira and
handling rates at the three ports are the same. Costs and benefits are in
November 1988 prices, including physical contingency and using the exchange
rates at that time.
4.14     The Beira corridor program cannot be evaluated in isolation from
other ongoing efforts to open the Limpopo and Nacala lines and, although
somewhat later, the project to reopen the Sena/Moatize line, which links
Malawi to Beira. In the "without project" situation such as it exists
today (and assuming the Beira corridor program had not started), all Malawi
and Zimbabwe traffic would have to use RSA ports (Durban) or Maputo via RSA
railways, at high inland transport cost. Such a base case definition for
the Beira corridor project, would imply large inland transport benefits to
the traffic diverted from Durban and Maputo (via RSA) to Beira. If,
however, the Limpopo line to Maputo opens in 1991, the least cost
alternative to the Beira corridor will then be the Limpopo corridor. The
remaining inland transport benefits of using the Beira corridor instead of
the Limpopo corridor (diversion of traffic from Beira to Maputo) are much
lower than the inland transport benefits of a Durban - Beira traffic
diversion. The same is true for the Nacala-Beira diversion versus the
Durban-Beira diversion for Malawi traffic. In calculating the ERR of the
overall Beira corridor project, only benefits of the Maputo - Beira
diversion and Nacala - Beira diversion have been attributed to the Beira
corridor project. By doing so, in the present project base case, the
majority of the inland transport benefits derived from Zimbabwe and Malawi
overseas traffic are attributed to the Limpopo and Nacala corridors much
earlier (1991 rather than 1995), which makes this evaluation quite
conservative. Table 4.5 quantifies the impact of the base project case
(case 4 in Table 4.5).

- 40 -
4.15     In the present evaluation, comparison is made of case 4 (all
corridors, situation with the project) with case 3 (no Beira corridor, i.e.
situation without project). In this case US$ 13.7 million are the cost
savings attributable to the Beira corridor (11%) and US$106.2 million are
the savings attributable to the Limpopo and Nacala corridors (89%). Table
4.5 also shows that, if case 2 is compared to case 4 no significant
additional benefits would be produced, assuming that the port of Beira
could handle all the traffic without capacity constraints. This, however,
is not the case because Beira would not be able to handle all cargo without
major new investments, whereas Maputo and Nacala can.
4.16     The proposed project has an economic rate of return of 14.1% and a
net present value of US$ 55.3 million at a 10% discount rate.  Annex 6
presents the detailed cashflow calculation. Given that the project was
evaluated in a very conservative fashion by attributing the majority of
inland transport benefits to the Limpopo and Nacala lines, it can be safely
concluded that the project is economically sound. If the opening of the
Limpopo and Nacala lines is assumed for 1993 instead of 1991, the ERR of
the project is 16.7%.  In this case, in 1992, with the alternative lines
closed, the inland transport benefits of the corridor are as much as US$47
million (with the Sena line still closed). The conclusion is, therefore:
1) if the Limpopo ,nd Nacala lines are open to traffic as scheduled (1991),
which is questionable given the security situation, the Beira corridor
project is economically sound with a reasonable and conservatively
estimated ERR for a project of this magnitude. It carries an important
share of Zimbabwe traffic and (after 1995) Malawi overseas traffic; 2) if,
for any reason the Limpopo and/or Nacala lines would remain closed, an
efficiently managed Beira corridor project shows a very good rate of
return, which increases dramatically for each year of postponement of the
opening of the two other corridors. There is also the vital strategic role
in the transportation of goods of Zimbabwe and Malawi which will be able to
decrease their dependency on the RSA and this was not quantified because of
the subjectivities involved.
4.17     A sensitivity  test was performed in order to analyse the
vulnerability of the project to substantially lower traffic volumes than
presently expected (-25% international traffic than in the base case).
This led to an ERR for the overall Beira corridor project of 12.5% instead
of the original 14.1%. Therefore, even under those circumstances the
project remains acceptable.
4.18     In order to evaluate the proposed IDA-assisted components it was
assumed that railway traffic in the corridor would remain at present levels
(400 to 500,000 MTlyear) without these components. This is a somewhat
optimistic assumption because traffic would probably decrease from present
levels if the additional motive power proposed is not available. However,
the assumption is again justified on the grounds of obtaining a
conservative estimate. Comparing the situation "with the IDA-assisted
railway projects" with the situation "without railway projects" produces an
ERR of 34.7% which is quite attractive for a project of this type. This
result also shows how vital for the Beira corridor is the provision of
motive power and technical assistance. A sensitivity analysis was
performed to evaluate the impact of a 25% reduction in international
treffic, to the base case. The ERR decreases from 34.7% to 28.3%.



- 41 -
4.19     The overall effect of a more aggressive road competition may cause
a shift of traffic from rail to road and although the overall ERR for the
corridor will be the same, the ERR of the railway projects will be lower.
To test this scenario the effect of a further decrease of 25% in rail
traffic was evaluated. The ERR obtained was 25Z which is still very
healthy for such a project. Table 4.6 summarizes the results of the
economic evaluation and sensitivity analyses.

V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. CFM(C)
(a) Accounting System
5.01     CFM(C) maintains an accounting system on an accrual basis in
sufficient detail to adequately present the financial operations of the
railway and the port. Revenues earned by each operation are clearly
identified. Working expenses which apply directly to each operation are so
charged with joint or common costs being accumulated separately. The
accounting system is, however, primarily oriented towards the preparation
of the annual accounts rather than the accumulation of financial data for
management purposes on a timely basis. The system is compater-based but
the data processing center is currently not operational. CFM(C) has
retained a team from Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) to
assist in the preparation of financial accounts.



- 42 -
5.02     CFM(C) does not maintain a traffic costing system.  As a result,
there are no clear data on which to Sase a tariff policy. During project
preparation, bCA obtained financing from the EEC for a RailwaylPort Cost
Based Tariff Study, the Terms of Reference of which were agreed with the
Bank. The proposed project will provide funding for the technical
assistance team needed to install the traffic costing system and train
staff.
5.03     At present, CFM(C) has no Management Information System (MIS).
During project preparation a needs study for a management information
system was undertaken financed by PPF. The proposed project would provide
funding for the technical assistance to install the MIS and train staff and
for the necessary hardware/software. The action plan and the timetable to
implement the recommendations of the PPF-financed study were reviewed and
agreed at negotiations (para 6.01).
(b) Past Performance
5.04     The combined Profit and Loss statements for port and railway
operations are summarized in Table 5.1 below and shown in detail in
Annex 7. For FY87 port operations resulted in a net profit while railway
operations just about broke even with a combined profit for the two
operations of US$7.2 millions.

5.05     Prior to 1987, (CFM(C) had made a loss each year, partly due to
the articially low official exchange rate of US$1 = Mt. 40 which prevailed
prior to 1987 and which converted CFM(C)'s revenues, mainly foreign
exchange earnings, into a relatively small amount of Meticais (or
conversely, if the accounts are expressed in U.S. Dollars, inflated the
main item of expenses, wages and salaries, out of proportion); but also due
to the dramatic decline in traffic which occured in the late 70s and early
80s and is only now beginning to recover.



- 43 -
5.06     Port throughput declined from a high of 3.5 million tons in 1964
to 1.33 million tons in 1986 and then increased to 1.95 in 1987. However,
port costs are generally quite variable as 60% of port personnel are
stevedores who are mostly employed only when needed. Tonnage carried by
rail also declined steadily from 5.9 million tons in 1973 to 0.3 million
tons in 1984 but has gradually increased since then to 0.48 million tons in
1987. Unlike the port, the railway's costs remain relatively fixed in the
short run with labor accounting for approximately 662 of the working
expenses.
5.07     CFM(C) does not maintain a traffic costing system so it is not
possible to determine which commodities are carried profitably, or which
commodities contribute the most to the loss. However, using average
figures, and assuming labor costs remain constant, the operating breakeven
point for the Beira-Machipanda line is approximately 500,000 tons, which is
considerably less than the forecast traffic of some 1.15 million tons for
1995.
(c) Financial Forecasts
5.08     The financial projections assume that the IDA component of the
investment plan will be on-lent by the Government to DNPCF/ CFM(C) at a
rate of 7.65% over a period of 30 years including a grace period of 5
years. The projected operating statements for the years 1990-2005 are set
out in Annex 7 . The financial assumptions used in the projections are
shown in the annex.
(d) Tariffs
5.09     On completion of the first phase of the program in 1991, it is
expected that the capacity of the port and railway, handling speeds,
transit times and reliability will improve to such an extent to permit
selective increases in tariffs on the Beira corridor while remaining
competitive with alternative routes. The current cost-based tariff study
will help to determine the precise amount of tariff increases that are
reasonable and it was agreed at negotiations that the first phase of
adjustments would take place not later than December 1991 and would enable
CFM(C) to achieve a 75% working ratio in FY1992, which would be sufficient
to meet debt servicing requirements. In view of the established transport
pattern for Zimbabwean traffic via RSA and the unsure timing within which
this traffic can be attracted back to the Beira Transport Corridor,
improvements in the working ratio in subsequent years will be agreed
between BCA and IDA in the annual project implementation reviews. For the
purposes of financial projections, an average increase of 20% has been
assumed, which is well within the cost differential for the alternative
Durban route (see para 1.04). On this basis the incremental financial rate
of return is 12%.
(e) Foreign Exchange Retention
5.10     Foreign Exchange for CFM-C.  Lack of foreign exchange is a major
handicap for the Beira Corridor operation despite the fact that CFM(C) is
an important net earner of foreign exchange. This is due to the fact that
all foreign exchange is kept by the Bank of Mozambique. CBM(C) needs



- 44 -
foreign exchange to (i) purchase required fuel, spare parts, materials,
replacement tools/small equipment, and (ii) consumption goods for workers
so that for part of their wages they would have access to imported goods.
In fact CFM(C) lacks personnel with the specialized experience to obtain
foreign exchange rapidly from the Bank of Mozambique. To resolve this
problem, a qualified member of CFM(C)'s staff has been appointed to the
position of Procurement/Disbursement Officer to expedite foreign exchange
withdrawals, for which specialised training will be provided during the
period preceding Credit effectiveness (see Annex 10 for terms of
reference).
B. DNPCF
5.11     The financial statements for the three main elements of DNPCF,
consisting of the transport corridors of CFM Norte, Centro and Sul, have
been consolidated with the help of French Government-funded technical
assistance provided by SOFRERAIL and are shown in Annex 7. It is estimated
that DNPCF generated a surplus of some US$7.2 million in 1987, which is
expected to rise substantially in future, as also are debt service
payments. However, there are problems of non-compatibility of accounting
methods between the three railway groups and differences in the basis of
calculating interest expenses. The ongoing French technical assistance
program will help improve the accounting base and advise on the
establishment of CFM,EE (see para 1.19). During negotiations assurances
were obtained that CFM,EE will adopt policies that will lead to its
financial viability, .ncluding achieving a working ratio of 75% in FY 1995,
the financial target in subsequent years to be determined in agreement with
IDA in the light of progress on the Nacala and Maputo Transport Corridors
(para 6.01).

MOZAMBIQUE
BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
The Training Component
I. General
1.       The transport sector is an important part of Mozambique's economy,
especially the ports and railways sub-sectors which until recently provided
important direct links with Malawi, Swaziland and Zimbabwe and indirectly with
Botswana and Zambia. However, since independet.ce in 1975, the country has
suffered from a dramatic decline of inter.xational transit services. The main
reasons include: (a) the steady deterioration of port and rail facilities due
to lack of maintenance and rehabilitation; (b) the departure of most
Portuguese personnel leaving the transportation sector with an acute shortage
of competent personnel; and (c) the lack of an adequate manpower planning and
staff development system.
II. Oblectives
2.       A permanent Training Section has been set up within CFM(C) with the
objective of establishing an institution-wide mechanism for expanded and
continuous training activities. The Section, with consultant assistance, will
be responsible for the preparation, implementation, supervision, and
evaluation of two parallel five-year programs for the training retraining, and
upgrading of some 4,500 CFM(C) port and railways staff at all levels.
III. Institutional Capacity
3.       Consultants financed by EEC have prepared. on behalf of BCA, a
comprehensive Organization and Manpower Development Plan for CFM(C), including
manpower requirements, identification of training needs, and resources
required to prepare and implement training programs for port and railways
personnel. As part of the CFM(C) proposed reorganization and staffing, a
Training Section has been established within CFM(C). The Section, which will
initially be headed by a consultant to be financed under the project, will
include a port and railway unit with appropriate staffing expected to be built
-p gradually. An organizational structure for the new Section is included in
Attachment 1 and was finalized and agreed upon during negotiations.
Responsibility of the Training Section will be to ensure the management and
coordination of all CFM(C) training activities. More specifically the
Training Section will (a) coordinate and monitor the preparation and
implementation of the two training programs; (b) plan and supervise training
courses expected to be carried out by the CFM(C) Training Center; (c)
negotiate and make arrangements with local tecL.nical/professional schools fir
external training; (d) administer training abroad (fellowships); and (e)
evaluate the results of the training programs, and prepare a follow-up on the
proposed training programs. The terms of reference for the Chief of Training
Section are in the Project File. In order to provide policy guidelines,
determine priorities, and periodically evaluate the training programs, a
Training Steering Committee has been established; its key members include the
Executive Director of BCA and the heads of CFM(C) operationt, maintenance,
technical and administrative departments. The chief of the training section
will act as executive secretary of the Committee.

BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
While the strengthening and expansion of the training activities is an
important undertpking, every effort should be made at the same time to improve
CFM(C) instituticnal capacity. Training of a large number of personnel at all
levels may have some influence upon some of the institutional deficiencies.
However, training is not an alternative to other specific remedial measures
needed to improve CFM(C)'s overall institutional capacity and will not, on its
own, provide improved performance.
IV. Training Needs
4.       CFM(C) is severely handicapped by an acute shortage of skilled and
semi-skilled workers and, most importantly, a lack of qualified and
experienced technical, supervisory, and management staff. This problem is
further compounded by the country's low levels of education and literacy, the
.arge number of personnel over the age of 55, and low salary scales. It is
essential, therefore, that while supervisory positions be entrusted initially
to expatriate personnel, the majority of CFM(C) staff should attend seminars
and training courses varying from one week to six months including basic
educational subjects as needed. Since many illiterate staff such as
mechanics, dock workers, trackmen and stevedores perform valuable tasks, they
too would attend short crash and/or reorientation courses by adopting an
appropriate training methodology - audio-visual aids and 'training by doing".
With the forthcomin- introduction of policy, organizational and administrative
changes in port and railways activities, training becomes a critical element
in initially transferring to the staff sufficient skills to perform at an
acceptable level. Training courses would be repeated as often as necessary so
that a high percentage of the staff would be trained or retrained more than
once in the next 10 to iS years. The programs are expected to involve a net
total of about 4,500 CFM(C) personnel - (port 2,500 and railways 2,000) in ten
main areas of activities as detailed in Attachments 2 and 3 of this Annex.
However, since many trainees would attend more than one training course, the
gross number of personnel to be trained would be considerably higher than
4,500.
V. Elements of the Port and Railways Training Programs
!        5.        The twj training programs contain approximately the same elements and
training methodology, but different numbers and categories of instructors and
costing.  Both port and railways will share the CFM(C) Training Center
facilities, training equipment and materials.  The main elements of each
program are:
(a) Civil Works (Housing);
(b) Training Equipment and Materials;
(c) Training Manager, Instructors, National Schools and Regional
Training Institutes;
(d) Transportation (for Instructors and Trainees);
(e) Training Abroad (Fellowships); and
(f) Per Diem

BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
(i) Training Methodology
6.       The training of CFM(C) personnel will be carried out in various
forms. The type of traii,ing and the content of the courses would be defined
through the analysis of the specific requirements of the particular function
and occupational job category within the port and railways, based on the
consultant's study. There will be courses through external training schools 1
as well as specially designed courses for professional staff. Mechanical
personnel would participate in -bpecifically designed training-through-
production courses or "training-by- doing". In addition to some general
theoretical courses (20X) to be conducted at the Center, training of
mechanical personnel (including illiterates) would be carried out in an agreed
area of the port and railways workshops and would focus (80%) on the repair of
broken equipment under the supervision of experienced mechanical instructors,
thus enhancing CFM(C) equipment maintenance capabilities and raising its level
of equipment availability. Training or upgrading of forklift drivers as well
as other mobile equipment would include familiarization with equipment in the
mechanical workshops and practical experience in driving and operating it in a
purpose-built training area in which driving hazards and obstacles encountered
in the work area can be safely simulated. Such training creates confidence in
the trainee, especially when learning to drive the more complex and expensive
equipment, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents or damages in the work
area. CFM(C) would be required to provide adequate spare parts and specific
materials for the training of mechanical personnel throughout the duration of
the program. All contracts with equipment suppliers/manufacturers would
include provision of the services of technicians to train selected equipment
operators and mechanics on operation ano maintenance of new equipment.
Provision has been made in the project for technical assistance staff to (a)
train their counterpart, as they are gradually assigned to them; (b) conduct
short courses or seminars in selected fields; and (c) collaborate with full-
time training managers and instructors on the content of agreed training
courses. The programs also include training abroad (fellowships) for CFM(C)
staff. This would provide opportunity for high and mid-level managers in the
engineering, operations and maintenance fields, training officers and senior
permanent instructors of the Training Section to participate in short-term
study tours/courses in countries such as Brazil, Portugal and Spain and/or
English, French-speaking countries for those staff fluent ir English and/or
French. Because of the low level of education and literacy, it is expected
that in addition to relevant technical subjects, many trainees would also need
to take more general subjects such as Portuguese, English, mathematics and
science in order to strengthen their basic educational backgrcund.
(ii) Training Managers and Instructors
7.       Under existing circumstances, it is expected that during the first
four-to-five years, substantial expatriate staff would be engaged to initiate
the programs and to train Mozambican counterparts, as they are gradually
assigned to them. Accordingly, senior training managers and instructors
fluent in Portuguese would be engaged to assist CFM(C) in the planning and
1/ External to BCA but within Mozambique

impl mentation of a two-phased training programs. Activities related to the
prepa:ation of the programs would be carried out under Phase I and would
include: (a) review of the consultants' recommendations on training targets
and human, financial and physical resources required for the program's
implementation; (b) selection of priority areas for training; (c) definition
of training methodologies and preparation of appropriate training courses; (d)
assessment of permanent staff requirements for the organizational structure of
the new Training Section; (e) determination of specific physical facilities
and training equipment and materials requirements; and (f) development of a
methodology for monitoring the effectiveness of training activities and
evaluating the overall achievements of the training programs. Under Phase II,
the training managers and instructors would assist CFM(C) with the
implementation, supervision and evaluation of the programs.
8.       The expatriate staff will be selected from short-listed firms having
adequate experience in the various disciplines of port and railways
engineering, operation, maintenance, finance and administration as well as in-
training. The two teams will include:

(iii) Training Facilities
9.       The CFM(C) Regional Training Center will be rehabilitated and
refurbished with funds provided by EEC who will also finance pre-fabricated
houses for its technical assistance and instructors and some training
equipment and materials. Financing is also provided under the project for
audio-visual training aids, cut-sections of mechanical components for model
and workshop rooms, tools, manuals, and technical books and publications. In
addition the project would finance 22 low cost unit houses for the port
training manager and instructors (9) and railways training manager and
instructors (13).

VI. Miscellaneous
10.      The project provides financing for an independent evaluation of the
training programs to be conducted at the end of the second year (mid-1992) and
the end -f the programs (mid-1994), including recommendations for further
training activities.
VII. Technical Education and Vocational Training
11.      The responsibility for developing policies and programs of
technical/vocational education and training rests with the Secretariate of
State for Technical and Vocational Training (SETEP). While considerable
progress has been made since the late seventies in school enrollment and adult
literacy, the country's educational and literacy levels are still low.
Currently, it is estimated that about 5% of the school age population attends
secondary school. There are several technical/vocational schools in
Mozambique financed either by the Government or international aid (or both),
most of which require more recurrent funds, additional training equipment and
materials, relevant training courses, and more experienced instructors.
Unfortunately, coordination of training activities between SETEP and
beneficiary agencies is weak. Three schools have been tentatively selected in
Beira to assist with certain aspects of the training programst Instituto
Commercial e Industrial, Escola Industrial 25 de Juhno, and Escola Commercial
"Amilcar Cabral". With a relatively small IDA investment (US$670,000) for
training equipment, materials, and local instructors, the schools could
provide a useful input in certain disciplines not covered by technical
assistance or expatriate instructors.
12.      The University Eduardo Mondlane (UEM) in Maputo offers only five
major basic programs, including engineering. The UEM has been negatively
affected by events of post-independence which caused a sharp decline in
enrollment until 1978.  Although enrollment increased in subsequent years
reaching 1,442 students in 1985, recent statistics indicate that only a few
;        hundred students graduate per year, and less than 40 from the faculty of
engineering.  Currently, out of 450 engineers in Mozambique, 300 are
expatriates and 150 are Mozambican.  In the past two years one university
engineering graduate has been employed by CFM.
VIII.  Cost Estimates
13.      The total cost of the two parallel training programs is estimated at
US$8.7 million equivalent as detailed in Attachiments 4 and 5 of this Annex.

1.1 Traffic Forecasts:
Type of Traffic
1991                 1995
(Tonnes)             (Tonnes)
International:
UP                   341,000 (A)          340,000 (A)
DOWN                 608,000 (A)          727,00) (A)
Domestic:
UP                    96,000               40,000
DOWN                 121,000               50,000
Note:  (A) - Forecast by Netherlands Economic Institute (NEI) (Nov. 1988).
1.2 System of Working:
Block Trains will be run between Beira (BA) and Machipanda (MP) with
change of traction at Inhamitanga (NTA). The section BA-NTA will be worked
with single diesels in closed circuit, and the NTA-MP section will be worked
with double diesels in closed circuit.
1.3 Tractive Capacity:
1500T both on the BA-NTA section with single locomotive and the NTA-MP
sectior' with double locomotives. Limiting capacity will be in the "UP"
direction.
1.4 Loop Capacity: 28 Wagons plus brake-van.
i.5 Seasonal Traffic:
International: cotton, tobacco, coffee and tea, forming 332 of total
traffic, with a peaking factor of 1.7 (seven months movement). Peaking factor
for all international traffic in "DOWN" direction (which is the ruling
direction, i.e. the direction of heavier traffic) - 1 + (0.33 x 0.7) = 1.23.
Domestic: 202 of traffic is seasonal with a peaking factor of 1.5 (8
months movement).
Peaking factor for all domestic traffic = 1 + (0.20 x 0.5) = 1.10.
Tot.l Traffic: Ratio of international to domestic traffic in the ruling
direction is 0.74:0.26.
Overall peaking factor = (0.74 x 1.23) + (0.26 x 1.10) = 1.20.

1.6 Loadability Factors
Cotton, tobacco and tea, constituting about 30Z of down international
traffic--loadability is 12T per container, as against payload capacity of 18S.
Loadability factor to be applied to net carrying capacity of a train would be
(1-0.30 x 6/18) - 0.90.
1.7  Surplus Loop Capacity:
As against 25 fully loaded wagons limited by traction capacity, with the
loadability factor, 28 wagons, limited by loop capacity can be carried on a
train. A factor of 28/25 = 1.12 can be applied to average train loads, under
ideal operating conditions.
1.8 Operational Allowance:
For not being able to run trains with ideal compositions to suit (6) and
(7) above--assumed at 20X.
1.9 Constrained empty movement:
The traffic mix does not call for regular movement of empties in the
heavier 'DOWN" direction to meet the needs of 'UP  traffic, except for
domestic petroleum products, which forms only 3.75Z of down traffic. Hence,
neglected.
1.10 Net Adjustment Factor:
To train load would be 0.90 (from (6)) x 1.12 (from (7)) x 0.80 (from
(8)) = 0.81.
1.11 Average ratio Payload/Gross Load: 1:1.48.
1.12 Average net carrying capacity per train: 1500 x 0.81/1.48 = 821 Tonnes
1.13 Annual throughput per train per day with 330 working days:
821 x 330 = 0.271 x 106 Tonnes.
1.14 No. of trains to be provided for:
-----------Number of Trains Per Day----------

7.3  The requirement of diesel main-line locomotives ftc the three systems is
summarized below:
------1991 ------    ------1991 -----    -------1995------
(12 hr. Working)    (24 hr. Working)       (24 hr. Working)
Southern System            59                    42                   46

100                   73                   88
7.4 The year-wise requirement and the no serviceable is detailed below, for
all three systems together, assuming an approximate linear progression from
1991 to 1995:
1991     1991      1992       1993      1994   1995
(12 Hr.  (24 Hr.
Working) Working)
Requirement:           100        73       77          81        84      88
Serviceable Locos:

(Note: e = Attrition due to scrapping
* = Retrieval of 4 Locos from Nhamitanda)
7.5 With the security conditions settling down, the purchase programme to
suit the above requirements would be:
1991  -   9
1992  -   4
1993  -   2
1994  -   4
1995  -   6

KOZUKBIQUE
BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
7.6 The crucial question is: Will security be improved by 1991, so that
24 hour working can be introduced? The date is crucial because Beira port is
expected to develop the capacity to meet the traffic forecasts by 1991. If
the required locomotive power is not available at that stage, the returns on
the major port investments will have to wait. Acquisition of 15 locomotives
(on the basis of 12 hour working on the Central Line) in the first lot will
ensure that the capacity of the port is adequately utilized, even if the
securitj problem is not fudly solved by 1991.  The possible risk of the
constraint in utilization of port capacity has to be weighed against the
economic penalty as under:
Value of Alternative (a)--phased purchase as per para. 5 above
(discounted to 1991):
1991 Purchases--9 locos Q $9 x C        =  9.000 C  (C = cost/loco)
1992 Purchases--4 locos Q $4 x C/1.l  -  3.636 C  (102 rate of discount)
1993 Purchases--2 locos Q $2 x Cl1.21 =  1.653 C  (10Z rate of discount)
TOTAL        = 14.289 C
Value of aiternative (b) -- first lot purchase of 15 locos
(discounted to 1991):    1991 Purchases   15.000 C
Therefore, the cost of insuring against the risk of the security problem not
being solved by 1991 is 0.711 C or roughly $1.21 million with a probable cost
of $1.7 million per loco. If, on the other hand, provision is made for having
only 12 locos on the Central Line, corresponding to 24 hour working, as
against the requirement of 21 required for 12 hour working (para. 1.16), the
loss of benefit (on the basis of a benefit of $22 million by moving all the
traffic forecast) would be considerably greater--i.e. (9121 x 22) = $9.4
million annually. A favorable security situation would not, de facto, lead to
a redundancy in locos, which could easily be rented to other SADCC countries.
7.7 If action is initiated 'now" to purchase the 15 locos, they are likely
to be in position sometime in 1990. The earliest possible acquisition will be
very productive in supplementing the railways fleet w!;en the rehabilitation
process is underway and the availability target of 752 (expected to be reached
by the end of 1992) has not yet been reached-- (402, 55Z,
65Z,and 70? in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992 respectively).
7.8 Recoumendation: It is, therefore, recommended that 15 main-line locos
be acquired in the first instance, as early as possible.
7.9  Diesel Shunters:  The requirement of diesel shunters is as follows:
Southern Region   -  12
Central Region    -   9
Northern Region   -   8
Total (bare)      -  29
Spare            -  iO
TOTAL       -  39

ANNEX 4
Page 8 of 8
MOZAMBIQUE
BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
The number of diesel shunters in the fleet is 30. It is recommended that 6
diesel shunters be acquired for the Beira Complex and that the shortfall of 4
is met by continuing to use the aged steam locos (1947 and 1955 vintage) until
1994, when they can be replaced by 4 diesels.
7.10 Future Acquisition Program 1992-1995:
(a) If 15 locomotives are acquired now, the projections of future
acquisitions until 1995 for traffic growth would be as follows (from
para. 22.5 above):
1994 - 4
1995 - 6
10 -- This covers needs for traffic growth, as well
==    as to cover scrapping of 5 diesels of 1968-69
vintage in 1994-95.
(b) To cover the steam locomotive scrapping program--the 14 Garratt
steam locomotives are of 1952 vintage, and would have to be planned to
be scrapped between 1992 and 1995. The same is the case with the 8
shunting steam locos (1946, 1950 and 1955 vintages) and 6 simple steam
locos (1947 and 1955 vintages). The requirements in terms of diesel for
replacement would be:
Diesel main-line    -   12 (paras. 17 & 18)
Diesel shunters      -    4 (para. 19)
(c) The following provisional acquisition program is, therefore,
recommended, subject to a mid-term review:
1994    1995
Diesel main-liners       11       11
Diesel shunters           4       --
8.   SENA LINE:
The SENA Line (now closed) has been excluded from consideration in the
discussion above. If and when it is to be opened for traffic, the locomotive
requirements for the line will need to be assessed.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Prolected OperatinR Statements - CFM(C)
1.       CFM(C)'s operating financial statements for the past five years
are shown in Table FA.01. while projections for the period 1988 to 2005 are
presented in Table FA.02. The underlying assumptions b*.hind the
projections are:
(a) Revenues. These are projected for railways in accordance
with the average tariffs by revenue category, namely, number
of travellers and tons carried, distinguished between local
and international traffic, and for port are based on tons
loaded, unloaded, average days of ship stay, container
volumes and bulk liquids in accordance with the traffic
forecasts. After 1990 the tariffs related to commodities
carried (railway and port) are assumed to increase by 202,
which would be justified by the improvements in the quality
of service resulting from the ongoing major investment
program.
(b) Expenses. These are projected under the main headings of
expenses, namely:
-   Materials, which consist mainly of fuel, are assumed to
vary directly in relation to railway and port traffic.
Also included are estimates for locomotive maintenance,
amounting to US$30,000 per locomotive per year, and
dredging costs, amounting to US$4,000,000 per year for
channel maintenance.
-    Wages and salaries are projected in accordance with
forecast numbers of personnel for both railway and port.
After 1990 numbers are assumed constant due to
productivity improvements.
-    General Expenses, are mainly those incurred by the
railway relating to the rent of locomotives and wagons,
for which it is assumed that after 1990, with the
acquisition of locomotives and rehabilitation of wagons,
a 66% reduction of costs will occur.
-    Depreciation projections were based on existing assets
and planned investments on a straight line basis for
railway and port, according to the life of the assets.
-    Interest expenses are projected on the basis of known
interest rates and repayment terms for present and
future loans.

BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
CRITERIA FOR INVESTMENT IN THE BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR
BackRround
When the People's Republic of Mozambique at the end of 1985
decided to revitalize the transport system through the Beira Corridor more
than a decade had elapsed since independence.
The transport infrastructure -- already partly worn out and
outdated in 1975 -- had then further deteriorated, mainly due to the
absence of funds for repair and maintenance and due to lack of skilled
labour.
Because of its location, Beira is a natural main outlet to the sea
for landlocked countries such as Zimbabwe, Malawi and (partly) Zambia and
thus inherently a major foreign exchange earner for the Mozambican economy.
Obiectives
Consequently, the aim of the Government has been to restore the
Beira Corridor taking into consideration:
(i)    the trends in overall transport demand from its hinterland
and its division between different commodities;
(ii)   the development of cargo handling procedures and shipping
modes on the international market; and
(iii) the interaction between the different elements in the
transport chain.
Criteria for Investment
Given the above background and with the above objectives, the
Government has fixed the following criteria for investments in the Beira
Corridor, listed in order of priority
(i)    Rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, of which the
major projects (now under execution) are the following:
(a) rehabilitation of permanent way and track on the
Beira-Machipanda railway;
(b) rehabilitation of locomotives and other rolling stock;
(c)  rehabilitation of the transit highway;
(d) rehabitation of maintenance facilities through
acquisition of new tools and spareparts; and
(e) rehabilitation of port roads, port cranes and other
existing cargo handling equipment. (This latter
rehabilitation project actually started before the
initiation of the development programme).

MOZAMBIQUE                       Annex 9
Page 2 of 2
BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
(ii)   Improvement of skills and quality of workforce; development
of managerial skills.
(a) upgrading of skills and proficiency of the whole staff
through comprehensive manpower training programmes;
(b) Introduction of modern management principles;
(c) improvement in organization to achieve cost
effectiveness, precision, punctuality, quality of
service and operational flexibility.
(iii) New capital investments.
(a)  Investment in new infrastructure or new equipment
either to replace worn out or obsolete material or to
cater for substantial traffic increases, resulting
from the measures taken under (i) and (ii).
Examples: Feconstruction of quays 2-5 and procurement
of new locomotives.
(b) Finally, new capital investments will have to be made
in some areas, where developments in transport
technology so demand. The main area in this respect
is containerization of cargo handling which implies
acquisition of new container handling equipment.
Furthermore, the customers' higher demand for
punctuality and limitation of delays have led to
derived investments in, for instance, dredging to CD
-8 meters of entrance channel, installation of new
radio telecommunications for the railway and modern
rail repair and maintenance equipment.
The general rule of thumb for new capital investments has been an
internal rate of return of not less than 10-112.
The main concern, however, has been to secure an overall
profitability of the Corridor programme as a whole. Some of the projects
in the first phase of the development programme have been retained when
they were considered to contribute to (or to be a major pre-requisite for)
the successful implementation of the programme as a whole, or when the geo-
strategic feature of the investment has been considered highly beneficial
to the regional and strategic environment.
