MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY, LTD.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF JAMAICA
FOR A FOURTH POWER PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Jamaica Public
S-rvice Company,-Ltd., for the equivalent of US$18.0 million is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be guaranteed by Jamaica and would
have a term of 17 years, including four years of grace, with interest at
the standard variable rate.
Background
2.       Jamaica depends for the bulk of its energy needs on costly imports
of oil, which account for nearly 90% of the energy supply. Indigenous
sources (bagasse, fuel wood and hydropower) constitute the remaining 10%.
Peat is available in relativelv significant quantities, but its economic
viability still has to be proven. Energy consumption of the country is
comparatively high (about 12.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in 1985),
primarily because of the requirements of the bauxite/alumina industry which
accounts fo- nearly 30% of the country's energy use. The remaining 70% is
consumed by other industries, the household sector, and transport. The
energy sector is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Mining, Energy
and Tourism (MMET). In the past, energy sector policy and coordination
have been relatively weak.  This is being remedied as part of a World
BanktUNDP Energf Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) under which a
technical assistaL-e program is being formulated to support the Energy
Division within Mr, as well as other energy-related studies and projects
aiming to conserve energy and to enhance indigenous energy use.
3.       The Jamaica Public Service Co., Ltd. (JPS), the Borrower of the
proposed loan, has the exclusive responsibility for the generation,
transmission and distribution of electric power. It was originally
established in 1923 as a private utility, but is now wholly government-
owned and reports to the Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport (MPUT).
JPS owns and operates 528 MW (71%) of the total installed generating
capacity of 739 MW in Jamaica; the remainder is captive generation, mostly
for the bauxite industry. In 1986, about 1.2 million inhabitants or about
52% of the total population, had access to electricity service. While
electricity supply was unreliable and of poor quality in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, it has improved significantly following major changes in JPS'
managerial, institutional, operational and financial capacity and
implementation of a comprehensive rehabilitation of its generating plants.
Financially, JPS is now generating operating surpluses and no longer relies
on government transfers for its operations. Nonetheless, JPS still faces
problems, in particular a shortage of qualified managerial and professional
personnel, high power losses (19%), an outdated tariff structure and
inadequate maintenance. All these problems are being addressed by the
proposed operation.



-2-
Past Bank Lending
4.       The Bank has made three loans to JPS totalling US$72.5 million.
The first loan (No. 454-JM of US$22 million) was made in 1966 when the
company was under private control. It helped finance the foreign exchange
cost of generating plant and associated transmission and distribution
facilities for the greater Kingston area. the project was completed in
1972, substantially within the original schedule. The second loan
(No. 1516-JM of US$20.0 million) was made in 1978 to help finance the
foreign exchange cost of expanding transmission and distribution
facilities, together with technical assistance to improve operating and
maintenance practices. It was completed in 1984, nearly two years behind
schedule. The project has since been functioning satisfactorilv. The
third loan (No. 2188-JM of US$30.5 million) was made in 1982 with the main
objective of improving JPS' efficiency. It helped finance the foreign
exchange costs of rehabilitating steam power plants, construction of
transmission lines and upgrading of the power system, as well as technical
assistance and training. The plant rehabilitation work has been completed
and the other project components are near commissioning. The loan is
expected to be fully disbursed by the end of 1987, about two years behind
schedule.
Proiect Obiectives
5.       The main objective of the proposed project would be to continue
the rehabilitation and institutional strengthening program undertaken under
the second and third power projects. The project would further improve
JPS' management and finances, and promote system efficiency and reliability
by rehabilitating and expanding transmission and distribution facilities
and by enhancing operations and maintenance, thereby making better use of
existing generating capacity.
Project Description
6.       The proposed project, to be carried out over six years, would
include important transmission, substation and distribution works, mostly
to be constructed in Kingston and vicinities as well as in the tourism
areas on the North Coast. The project would also provide consulting
services for studies on the expansion of JPS' power system, construction
supervision and management assistance, and would include training and the
procurement of software packages for JPS' information systems.
7.       The total cost of the proposed proiect, excluding interest during
construction of US$4.7 millon, is estimated at US$29.9 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$18.7 million (632). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement, as well as the disbursement schedule are
given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Jamaica are given in Schedules C and D
respectively. A map showing project locations is also attached. The staff
appraisal report, No. 5900-JM, dated June 22, 1987, is being distributed
separately.

Rationale for Bank Involvement
8.       The Bank's present strategy in Jamaica is to help support the
Government's economic adjustment program and to focus on priority
investments to stimulate growth and exports, and to progressively
ttrengthen the indigenous institutional capacity. The proposed project
aims at improving the efficiency and reliability of the power supply, which
are crucial to the development of the tourism sector and to the
competitiveness of other industries. In addition, it aims at achieving
financial autonomy of JPS and enabling it to make a reasonable contribution
towards future investments out of its internally generated funds. The
proposed project also aims at building upon and com?lementing the recent
institutional improvements in .PS ach'eved in the third power project in
order to provide a smooth transition from external consultants to local
management and expertise. Under the proposed operation, this and other
institutional issues are being addressed (see para 9 below).
Agreed Actions
9.       During negotiations, the following agreements were reached.  As
part of Jamaica's program to maxim- ' the use of indigenous energy
resources: (a) JPS would establish, by June 30, 1988, a policy
satisfactory to the Bank for the purchase by JPS of electricity from other
possible suppliers, such as sugar factories; and (b) the Government would
complete by )ecember 31, 1988, the feasibility studies for the Back Rio
Grande hydro-electric scheme. To implement programs for the strengthening
of JPS manageme t and operations, JPS would: (a) contirue to implement a
recently adopted systematic preventive maintenance program; (b) submit by
May 31, 1988 a loss reduction plan satisfactory to the Bank; (c} continue
with the technical assistance and training programs initiated under the
Third Power Project (Loan No. 2188-JM) and ensure the smooth transfer of
responsibilities to JPS staff of positions currently held by in-line
expatriate personnel; (d) continue with the implementation of JPS Corporate
Information System; and (e) carry out its operations in accordance with a
schedule of performance targets. In order to improve JPS financial
performance, JPS would: (a) submit by August 31, 1987 and implement
promptly thereafter, an action plan, satisfactory to the Bank, to address
the observations of external auditors on JPS' internal control system; (b)
as a condition of effectiveness, implement a new tariff structure as
recommended by a consultants' study and including, inter alia, features to
promote energy conservation; (c) maintain tariffs at a level at least equal
to the long-run marginal cost and sufficient to allow rates of return of 5%
in 1987/88, 6% in 1988189, and 8% thereafter; and (d) keep the level of
accounts receivable for electricity sold to the Government and its agencies
to 60 billing days. In addition, covenants under previous loans which
impose limitations on JPS borrowings and investments outside the proposed
project would be continued under the proposed loan. In order to enable JPS
to recruit and retain high level managers and qualified professionals, the
Government and JPS would implement by end 1987, a management strengthening
program which would bring the corresponding JPS salaries to a level
comparable to those of equivalent Government agencies.

Justification
10.      The proposed project would improve utilization of existing
generating capacity, thereby reducing energy costs, and would add about
30,000 new customers by 1990.  The project benefits would accrue from:  (i)
incremental sales and (ii) fuel savings resulting from the reduction in
transmission and distribution losses, and improved efficiency of JPS
generating plants. The rate of return has been calculated at about 10%.
However, this rate of return does not fully measure the benefits of the
project, particularly those associated with the increase in cystem
reliability that is expected from the implementation of the program.
Risks
11.      The project has no special technical risks.  The main risk to
expeditious execution derives from possible labor problems, which in the
past have caused delays. The proposed implementation schedule takes these
risks into account.
Recommendation
12.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
