Country:                 Jamaica
Proiect.-         ~Fourth Pover Project
Borrower:                Jamgaica Public Services Co. Ltd. (JPS)
Guarantor:               The Government of Jamaica
Amount:                   US$18.0 million equivalent
*    ~Terms:                   Repayment in 17 years, including 4 years of grace,
-with inxterest at the Bank's standard variable
rate.
*  Project Description:      The primary aim of the proposed project is to help
improve JPS' system operating efficiency by
expanding and upgrading transmission lines,
substations and distribution network. The
proposed project has been designed to help JPS to
meet Jamaica's power needs through 1992. It would
include: (i) the construxction of a 138 kV
transmission line between Bellevue and Duncans and
25 l4VA-69 kV substations at Newport Vest and
Spanish Town respectively; (ii) expansion of
existing 138 kcV and 69 kV substations as vell as
main distribution networks; (iii) rehabilitation
and upgrading of 69 kV transmission lines and main
distribution grids; (iv) establishment of a
permanent traiuing center; and (v) training
program and engineering/consultant services for
JPS.
Benefits and Risks:      The proposed project would permit better
utilization of existing-generating capacity;
reduce system los.ses; increase power supply
reliability; connect about 30,000 new consumers by
1990; and strengthen JPS managerial and
engineering capabilities.
The project does not present any special technical
risks. The main r1sk deri-ves to a large extent
from possible labor problems which in the past
have caused delays in project implementation. Use
of contractors with broad experience in carrying
out project works under similar conditions will
help to maintain construction schedules.

2.  THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A.   The Energy Sector
Introduction
2.01     Jamaica is not endowed with substantial indigenous sources of
energy. It depends for the bulk of its energy needs on costly imports of
oil, with serious impact on the country's balance of payments and high
energy costs for its industries. Jamaica's limited sources of indigenous
energy, which include hydropower, bagasse and peat, are not yet fully
developed. The level of energy consumption in the country is, however,
fairly high, in comparison with countries at a similar income level.
Within this general framework, Jamaica has to: (i) develop further its
indigenous energy resources (while depending on Imported oil for most of
its requirements), (ii) improve efficiency in energy use, and (iii)
strengthen the institutional structure in the sector for integrated
planning and effective sector mnagement. The proposed project would offer
features responsive to these requirements in the power sector. lithin the
context of a study undertaken in Jamaica under the UNDPIWorld Bank Energy
Assessment Program (report dated April 1985), the Bank has also been
discussing with the Jamaican authorities policy act2.ons towards these
general objectives, which are embodied in a Bank-managed Energy Sector
Management Assistance Progrsm (ESMAP).
Energy Demand and Supply
2.02     Jamaica's relatively high energy consumption per unit of GDP is
primarily because of the requirements of the bauxitefalumina industry which
accounts for nearly 30% of the country's energy use. Total energy demand
in 1985 was equal to approximately 12.2 million barrels of oil equivalent
and should grow with a resumption of growth of the Jamaican economy
Imported oil represented nearly 90% of the total energy demand. Bagasse,
which is used to generate steam Ln sugar factories, accounted for about 6Z
and the small remainder comprised hydroelectric power (3%) and fuel wood
(1%).
2.03     The cost of imported oil in 1985 amounted to about US$370 million,
equivalent in value to 18% of GDP, 31% of imports, and 55% of foreign
exchange earnings from merchandise exports and non-factor services.
To reduce dependence on petroleum imports, the Government has taken several
initiatives to broaden and develop the country's indigenous sources of
energy. Bilateral (Canada) and multilateral (IDB and IBRD) donors have
supported the search for oil and gas. An exploration program has been in
place since 1955. On-shore drilling has been carried out by international
companies. However, all wells were completed as dry holes.  The Govermment
plans to continue with additional investigative exploration during the
forthcoming years before further capital-intensive exploration drilling is
undertaken. The latter should be carried-out by the private sector alone
or with private sector risk participation.
2.04     Five hydroelectric power plants with an aggregate capacity of 21
MW (about 3% of Jamaica's installed capacity)  currently supply about 6S of



-4-
the total electricity consumed in the country. The hydropower potential,
which may be economically developed during the next 15-20 years, is
estimated at about 90 MW of generating capacity. It would substitute for
petroleum-based power generation (about 1,000,0o0 barrels/year). The most
prominent among the potential hydropower schemes is the Back Rio Grande
(about 30 MW). Under the proposed lending, the Government would be
required to conduct the necessary feasibility studies for this scheme
(para. 3.04).
2.05     Peat is the only indigenous fuel available in Jamaica in
relatively significant quantities. Reconnaissance studies have been
carried out in eight areas of potential peat supply, two of which have
shown promising reserves. These include the Negril area with a preliminary
estimate of about 70 MW power generation potential over 30 years. However,
before development of this scheme, its economic viability has to be proven
through additional field investigation and studies (para. 3.03).
2.06     In 1985, the sugar industry consumed 500,000 tons of baRasse,
together with 200,000 bbl. of fuel oil.. With an energy efficiency program,
sugar factories should be able to satisfy all their energy needs and supply
surplus power to the national grid. Fuel methanol production is not an
economic proposition for Jamaica at present. In 1985, the domestic
consumption of fuel wood was approximately 190,000 tons, of which 90Z was
converted into charcoal. The use of fuel wood by the commercial and
industrial sector is small and little growth in fuel wood demand is
expected. Further efforts are needed to optimize the use of fuelwood and
sugar cane bagasse. A study related to fuelwood inventory and charcoal
production is included in the ESMAP, under the UNDPIWorld Bank Energy
Assessment Program for Jamaica (para. 2.01). An energy specialist will be
engaged under ESMAP to coordinate these studies. During negotiations
agreement was reached with JPS and the Government to establish by June 30,
1988, sector policy (including the corresponding procedures) for the
purchase of electricity from sugar factories and any other suppliers.
2.07     Barring significant discoveries of oil and gas or unforeseen
technological breakthroughs, the country will continue to rely on imported
oil to meet most of its energy requirements during the next two decades.
The UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Program report (para. 2.01), with a
view to alleviating the serious drain on the country's foreign exchange
reserves caused by imports, has underlined, among others, the need for
developing further Jamaica's indigenous sources of energy, improving
efficiency in energy use, and effective energy sector management. To
assist the Government in these goals, ESMAP is providing funds to implement
a program to improve energy utilization.
Institutional Structure
2.08     The present institutional framework of the energy sector (see
Annexes 2.1.1 and 2.1.2) has certain weaknesses, extending in particular to
the policy and coordination functions. In 1977 the Government established
an EnerRy Division within t-he Ministry of Mining, Energy and Tourism (MHET)
to carry out these functions.  However, the Division has been unable to
carry out its role as the lead organizational unit in the energy sector in
a satisfactory manner. This was due to severe shortages of qualified staff



(aggravated by inadequate compensation) and consequent overreliance on a
succession of consultants who have been unable to follow through their
recommendations and to accomplish any substantial institutional
strengthening. The World BankJUNDP Energy Assessment Report recommended
that the Government should take actions to: (i) help the Division to
overcome its organizational weaknesses and assume its designated central
role; and (ii) promote better linkages and coordination of efforts among
all energy-related bodies, whether public or private. In this regard, the
Bank and the Government are preparing a technical assistance program under
ESMAP to support the Division. However, action on salaries fcr
professional, managerial and technical staff in the civil service, which
constitutes a part of the Goverinment's Bank-supported Administration Reform
Program (ARP) (Loan 2507-JM of 1985), will be necessary if such a program
is to succeed in the long run.
2.09     The Petroleum Corpor&tion of Jamaica (PCJ) a wholly owned state
corporation established under the Petroleum Act of 1979, imports petroleum
products and, since 1982, operates Jamaica's only refinery. Other
important functions include petroleum exploration and studies and execution
of various energy-related projects. PCJ has been allowed a margin of
profit in its operations which has made it a financially strong entity.
This factor, coupled with a dynamic management, has resulted in PCJ's
recruiting a body o' well qualified professional staff, making it one of
the most effective organizations in the country. At the Government's
request, PCJ has progressively diversified its functions outside petroleum,
including the implemention of power projects (under contractual arrangement
with JPS). While this arrangement Was justified in the past because of the
institutional weaknesses at JPS, now that substantial institutional
improvements are being achieved (paras. 2.10, 2.21, 2.27 and 3.02), JPS
should gradually exercise its own responsibilities in the implementation of
power projects. The World BankJItNDP Energy Assessment Report of April
1985, recommended action along the foregoing lines. As a first step, the
proposed project would include financing for final design work and
preparation of bidding documents required for a coal-fired generating
plant, which would be directly carried out by iPS (para. 3.13).
2.10     The Jamaica Public Services Co. Ltd.  (JPS) has exclusive
responsibility for the generation, transmission and distribution of
electric energy for public consumption. It reports to the Ministry of
Public Utilities and Transport (MPUT). The company, originally established
in 1923 as a private utility, operated under the control of a foreign
company until the Government acquired controlling interest in it in 1971
and completed acquisition of 99% of the ownership in 1975. Over a period
of several years --especially during 1979-82-- JPS suffered severe
financial losses, labor disputes, and frequent power outages. Under the
Second and Third Power Projects (Loans 1516-3M and 2188-3M) (paras. 2.27
and 2.28), JPS successfully reversed a deteriorating trend in its
operational and maintenance practices through an efficiency improvement
program which has been closely monitored by the Bank (para. 2.14). This
institution building process --which already has had significant results--
would continue under the proposed lending operation and would be carried
forward by increasing participation of JPS in the project planning and
engineering stages. A description of JPS is given in Annex 2.2.

2.11     The MMET (Energy Division and PCJ) and MPUT (JPS) provide data to,
and coordinate their policies and plans with, the Planning Institute of
Jamaica (PIOJ), to ensure proper integration of energy sector planning
within national economic planning. Several other institutions, private and
public, are also involved in the research, development and implementation
of energy projects and studies, especially in research of non-conventional
energy sources, including Scientific Research Council, College of Arts and
Technology, University of West Indies, Bureau of Standards, Sugar Industry
Research Institute and Forestry Department.
B.   The Power Sector
Orftanization and Regulation
2.12     The main institutions concerned with electricity in Jamaica are:
JPS (electric power generation, transmission and distribution); the ,YPUT
(rate regulation and financial supervision); the MMET (energy policy, fuel
pricing, conservation and studies); and PCJ (exploration, development and
marketing of petroleum and other energy sources). The Electricity
Authority holds the Government shares in JPS. Prior to 1975, regulatory
function for the power sector was entrusted to the Public Utilities
Commission, a statutory body. Following its acquisition of majority shares
of JPS the Government transferred responsibility for regulating the sector
to the MPUT. A close relationship exists between the two entities. JPS
provides monthly financial reports to the Advisory and Monitoring Unit of
the Ministry, which is closely involved in financial and investment
planning for JPS. While JPS' licence (as amended in April 1977) vests
authority for the setting of electricity rates in the I4PUT, the actual
procedure has been that JPS files proposals for rate adjustment with the
MPUT which then analyzes them and submits them to the full Cabinet for
approval. This arrangement for rate setting, not uncommon in countries
where the utilities are essentially Government-owned, has been functioning
satisfactorily.
Electricity Supply Systems
2.13     Jamaica has a total installed capacity of 739 MW of which about
74% are steam driven generating plants (551 MW); 13% are gas turbine
generating plants (94 MW); 1OZ are diesel engines (73 KW) and the balance
hydroelectric power stations (21 MW) (see Annex 2.3.1). JPS owns and
operates about 71% of the above power generating capacity (528 MW) (see
Annex 2.3.2).  The balaoce are captive plants operated by: bauxite/alumina
undertakings (168 MW); sugar plants (30 MW) and others (13 MW).  JPS
delivers electricity to the main load centers through a transmission
network comprising about 330 circuit-kilometers of 138 kV lines (financed
under IBRD Loan 2188-JM), about 740 circuit-kilometers of 69 kV lines and
17 substations with an aggregate transformer capacity of about 970 MVA.
Electricity is sold at medium (24 kV, 13.8 kV, 6.9 kV and 4 kV) and low
(440/220/11OV) voltage through a distribution network which includes about
8,000 circuit-kilometers of distribution lines.
2.14     Before 1984, continuity and quality of electricity supply in
Jamaica were less than satisfactory. System outages were common in the
load centers due to the low availability of the thermal plants (both steam

driven and gas turbine generating plant). A comprehensive rehabilitation
program to upgrade the performance of the above plants has now been
completed under Loan 2188-JM.  As result of this program, improved power
plant efficiency has been achieved since 1984. The number, frequency and
duration of outages due to failures of generating equipment have declined
and the system heat rate has improved by about 20Z. There is still a need,
however, for a comprehensive long-term maintenance strategy.  In order to
improve operation and maintenance practices, it is required to implement a
comprehensive maintanance program for all units, paying special attention
to: (a) disciplined preventive maintenance even during periods of less-
than-adequate margins of reserve capacity; and (b) an institutional
mechanism for the timely supply of spare parts. At negotiations agreement
was reached with JPS on: (i) the continuation of a comprehensive yearly
maintenance and spare parts stock program; and (ii) the adequate
Implementation of such program.
2.15     Although JPS' operational efficiency has improved substantially,
systems losses are still high (about 19Z of total net generation during
1986187, of which about 8% are estimated to be non-technical losses) mainly
due to overloaded distribution equ'pment, inappropriate distribution
network maintenance practices, and unauthorized use of electricity. Loan
2188-JM includes financing for some components designed to reduce system
losses (most of which are in final stages of implementation). To achieve
further reduction of power losses, JPS is making efforts to identify and to
disconnect illegal users. The ongoing contract with EBASCO for a tariff
study .(para. 2.24) has been extended to include an assessment of the
problem of losses and to prepare a comprehensive program for loss
reduction. This assessment will be completed by April 1988. In this
regard, during negotiations, JPS agreed to submit not later than May 31,
1988, a loss reduction plan acceptable to the Bank, taking due
consideration of EBASCoWs recommendations. Loss reduction targets will be
monitored during supervision of the proposed loan (para. 3.21 and Annex
3.2.4).
Access to Electricity
2.16     In 1986, about 1,160,000 inhabitants, or about 52% of the total
population of Jamaica, had access to electricity services. This compares
favorably with the electrification rate prevailing in 1976 which amounted
to 39Z. Electricity consumption is mainly concentrated in the metropolitan
areas of Kingston and Montego Bay which respectively represent about 62Z
and 8% of the country's total consumption. Also during 1986, average
electricity consumption per capita amounted to about 695 kWh/year and
installed power generating capacity to about 300 watts per inhabitant.
Jamaica's electricity indicators (per capita installed capacity and
electricity consumption and access to electricity) are in the middle range
of other comparable countries 1
1/ Per capita installed capacity, energy consumption and electrification
rates of other Caribbean countries are respectively: Barbados: 383
watts, 1,329 kWh and 81Z; Costa Rica: 280 watts, 1,200 kWh and 98Z;
Dominican RepuDlic: 220 watts, 650 kWh and 40Z; El Salvador 105 watts,
315 kWh and 60%; Guatemala: 110 watts, 230 kWh and 50Z; and Panama 450
watts, 1,000 kWh and 60Z



2.17     In 1975, about 54% of Jamaica's population lived in rural areas.
Of this total, only 11% were connected to the grid. In order to accelerate
the integration of the rural areas to the distribution grid, the Government
created in 1975 the Rural Electrification Programne Limited (REPL), an
entity separate from JPS, to administer the rural electrification program.
The program consists of distribution extensions from estaDlished
transmission lines, and the provision of loans to assist homeowners in
carrying out house installations. REPL is basically the executing agency
of rural electrification projects for which it receives financing under
soft terms. Upon their completion, the projects are transferred to JPS, at
cost, as well as the corresponding liabilities. This institutional
arrangement has worked well. In 1986, about 19% of the rural popul&tion
were connected to the grid. Coordination between JPS and REPL has been
adequate as the major shareholder of both companies is the Electricity
Authority and they both have the same Chairman.
Electricity Demand
2.18     Electricity sales increased at an average annual rate of about
0.3% from 1976 (1,120 GWh) to 1985 (1,147 GWh) (Annexes 2.4 and 2.4.1).
During the same period, maximum demand (non-coincidental) increased from
239 MW to 252 MW. The stagnation in electricity consumption is a result of
overall economic factors which affected Jamaica over this period: (i)
declining bauxite/alumina exports; (ii) falling tourism activities; (iii)
increasing electricity tariffs as result of rising petroleum prices; and
(iv) unreliable power supply. The structure of electricity sales has not
changed substantially. The greatest variation has been the increase of
losses (subtransmission and distribution) which in 1976 amounted to 192 GWh
or 14.6% of JPS' total net generation and in 1985 increased to 281 GWh or
19.7Z of net generation.
2.19     Electricity sales are expected to increase at an annual average
rate of about 3Z from 1,264 GWh in fiscal year 1986/87 to 1,555 GWh in
1993/94 (Annexes 2.4.1 and 2.4.2).  Maximum demand is expected to increase
from 255 MW in 1986/87 to about 305 MW in 1993/94 at an average annual rate
of about 2.6%. These growth rates are in line with Jamaica's expected GDP
growth during the period and its correlation with electricity consumption
growth. No major variations are expected to take place in the structure of
electricity consumption, except for system losses which, in view of the
program being implemented under Loan 2188-JM and the one proposed in this
project, are expected to decrease to about 15% by 1991/92.
Master Development Plan
2.20     With Bank financing (Loan 2188-JM), JPS commissioned Montreal
Engineering (MONENCO) to prepare a comprehensive planning study for the
integrated development of its electric power system (para. 3.03). The
study iDcluded long-term demand forecasts as well as a least-cost expansion
plan which represented the first step in a continuing planning process that
ought to be strengthened and institutionalized. The sector development
plan will require constant updating and should become the framework for
appraising and selecting additions to JPS' future power supply capacity.

Institution Buildinit
*    ~2.21     JPS had to grapple with serious operational and financial problems
between 1979 and 1982. Following injections of foreign technical and
financial assistance and after Implementation of a 1982 management audit
recomamzndation2,maaemn succeeded in greatly improving the company's
performance. A rehabilitation program for its plants and facilities has
been successfully completed (para. 2.14). In 1983, JPS showed a profit for
the first time in several years; power outages declined and an improvement
was evident in management and in financial operations. In addition to the
least-cost expansion study (para. 2.20), JPS also completvi' a tariff study
based on marginal cost principles (para. 2.24), and initiated a loss
reduction study which is expected to be completed by April 1988 (para.
2.15). A technical efficiency Improvement program, started with the
rehabilitation of existing generation units, continues with the
implementation of Improved operation and maintenance proceduzes and
rehabilitation of the transmission and distribution systems, and will be
completed with the strengthening of JPS' planning and engineering
capabilities.  This technical efficiency Improvement program is being
implemented in parallel with management and staff Improvement programsg,
carried out through management assistance and comprehensive training, all
vith Bank funding under the Third Power Project (Loan 2188-3M).
2.22    Notwithstanding the limp rovements already achieved,, the institution
building efforts should continue in order to: (i) firm up said
improvem2nts; (ii) complete ongoing institutional programs; and (iii)
correct some weaknesses that still esxist. During appraisal of the proposed
project, an institutional analysis of JPS was carried out and the ongoing
institutional programs and some basic institutional objectives were
identified. During negotiaticns, agreement was reached with JPS on an
institution building pliLn with the following actions and objectives:
(a) to ensure the smooth transfer of responsibilities of managerial
positions currently being held by in-line consultants to 31PS'
staff (Annex 2.2 para. 6);
(b) to continue with the implementation of JPS' corporate information
system in accordance with the recoimmendations of consultants
(Annex 2.2 para. 7);
(c) to implement a satisfactory management strengthening program
designed to align JPS salaries for managers and qualified
professionals with those for comparable positions of equivalent
agencies (Annex 2.2 para. 9); and
(d) to address the observations of the external auditors. to JPS'
internal control system (Annex 2.2 pars.. 13).
Electricity, Pricin2t
2.23     The structure of electricity tariffs in Jamaica is outdated and
important changes need to be made (see Annex 2.5).  The high level of
tariffs has prompted its revision, with respect to costs and the
regressiveness of its structure.  The total price paid by customers



- 10 -
includes a base tariff and a fuel clause. The base tariff has been
established on principles set forth 30 years ago which do not take into
consideration marginal cost priuciples. The fuel :lause sets a formula
which allows monthly adjustments according to fuel prices and efficiency
standards. This formula -was established during tihe early 1980s when the
efficiency of the company was low and, at that time, it resulted in a loss
as the fuel clauce revenues were lower than the actual fuel costs. Now
that efficiency has improved, the relationship has changed as the fuel
clause revenues are higher than the fuel costs resulting in an ever
ircreasing profit margin for JPS which has created negative reaction from
consumers.
2.24     To address the above deficiencies under the Third Power Project
(Loan 2188-JM), a tariff study based on marginal cost principles has been
completed by EBASCO (para. 2.15). The study included review of the
structure and level of the base tariff, and of the fuel clause. It also
included features to promote energy conservation.   JPS has initiated the
process to obtain the necessary approval to implement the recommendations
of the study, which are detailed in Annexes 2.5 and 2.5.1. Implementation
of the recommendations of the above study is condition of loan
effectiveness.
Financial Performance
2.25     In the past, besides the Bank, a wide variety of multilateral and
bilateral lending agencies and donors, including UNDP, USAID, Canada,
Scandinavian countries, Germany and Italy have provided financial and
technical assistance to JPS. Substantial tariff increases made in the
early 1980s, together with the efficiency improvement program stated above,
have firmed-up the reversal of the deteriorating trend in JPS' finances
during the late 1970s. Notwithstandir,g such tariff increases, JPS did not
reach the levels of rate of return covenanted under the Third Power Project
(Loan 2188-JM) for 1984 (6.4 vs. 8.0Z), 1985 (5.0 vs. 8.5%) and 1986 (5.7
vs. 8.5%). In 1984 the covenanted level was not reached basically because
of delays in introducing tariff increases, and in 1985 and 1986 because of
the capitalization of a new 2 x 20 NW low speed diesel unit. Nevertheless,
the above has resulted in a greater liquidity for the company because of a
reduced investment program. Reliance on short-term borrowings has been
eliminated and, in general, the level of its current liabilities has been
substantially reduced. In the future, this situation is expected to
continue and JPS will become a significant income tax contributor as a
result of its operations (for details see Annex 2.6, including its
attachments).        -r
Z.26     The collection of accounts receivable from electricity consumers
has improved substantially as the unpaid amount in days of billing, has
been reduced from 91 in 1982 to 74 in 1986/87. Arrears are only
significant for Government accounts, the National Water Commission and the
Airport Authority. JPS has been able, however, to avoid any increases in
the arrears by obtaining payments directly from the entities involved or
through the Ministry of Finance (Annex 2.2). D'xring negotiations,
agreement was reached with the Jasmaican Government to maintain the accounts
receivable for the sale of electricity to Government agencies at a level
not to exceed 60 billing days.

Experience with Bank Lending
2.27     The Bank has made three loans to ZPS for a total of US$72.5
million. The first loan (454-JM of US$22 million, 1966) was made when the
company was under private control. It helped finance the foreign cost of
two generating plants (121 MW) and associated transmission and distribution
facilities for the greater Kingston area. The project was completed in
1972, substantially within the original schedule and cost estimates. The
second loan (1516-JM of US$20.0 million, 1978), helped finance the foreign
cost of a US$36.1 million project for the expansion of the transmission and
distribution systems in urban centers, together with technical assistance
for improvement of operating and maintenance practices. The project, which
was completed in February 1984 (nearly two years behind the appraisal
estimate), has since been functioning satisfactorily. The Project
Completion Report, dated February 17, 1987, noted that, due to adverse
macroeconomic circuui7tances during the project implementation period, JPS
endured technical and financial problems beyond management control.
Tariffs remained static in face of rising costs, maintenance work on
equipment was delayed, and frequent service interruptions were encountered
owing to poor maintenance and labor disputes. Nevertheless, the project
was completed, albeit with changes, cost increases and time overruns. The
Bank supported JPS' efforts to improve efficiency during that difficult
period. The third loan (2188-JM of US$30.5 million, 1982), had as its main
objective the improvement of JPS efficiency (para. 2.14). It helped
finance the foreign currency costs of a US$48.6 million project for the
rehabilitation of steam power plants, construction of transmission lines
and general upgrading of the power system. Technical assistance and
training components were also part of'this project. The plant
rehabilitaticn work has been completed and the other project components are
near commissioning. The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the end
of 1987, abort two years behind the appraisal estimate. The project has
been successful in meeting its objective of efficiency improvement and in
sustaining the positive trend in JPS operations and finances.
2.28     A focus on institution-building has been prominent in all Bank
lending operations in the Jamaican power sector. Training and
strengthening of sector human resources have also received particular
attention. Engagement of in-line consultant services for managerial
positions, under the Third Project, has had significant success. However,
there remain important issues that have to be satisfactorily addressed,
(paras. 2.21 and 2.22). The principal constraint faced by the power sector
remains a lack of qualified professionals and managers to support an
orderly growth of the sector. In view of the important role that the power
sector plays in the economy and the remaining efficiency improvement needs
of JPS, continued Bank participation in the sector is justified.
Bank and Country Goals and Sector Lending Strategy
2.29     Within the framework of its general energy policy (para. 2.01),
the Government has established the following specific objectives for the
power sector:



- 12 -
(a)  to promote an efficient use of electricity through realistic
pricing policies, energy conservation and improvement in sector
operations;
(b)   to enhance JPS' institutional structure and to strengthen its
management and professional capability;
(c)  to improve the efficiency of JPS through rehabilitation programs
and increases in productivity;
(d)   to take realistic measures to recruit and retain well qualified
staff at JPS;
(e)   to transfer gradually to local personnel management positions
currently held by in-line expatriate consultants; and
(f)  to ensure that JPS will have the capability to carry out, directly
or through qualified consultants, all activities related to the
power sector including pre-feasibility and feasibility studies of
future power plants (many of which are now being carried out by
PCJ).
2.30    The Bank's role in the sector is to support the general economic
and energy policies of the Government, and the specific objectives set for
the power sector by:
(a)  assisting the country in obtaining added foreign currency for
financing, on adequate terms, the power sector investment program,
through the Bank's own lending instruments or acting as a catalyst
for other sources of financing;
(b)   increasing the share of goods and services acquired through ICB so
as to make the best possible use of scarce foreign currency
resources;
(c)  helping JPS in its efforts of maintaining an electricity pricing
system based on marginal costs and implementing the corresponding
regulations;
(d)  strengthening the sector's norms and procedures on environmental
matters as related to construction and operation of power
projects; and
(e)   promoting the participation of private investors in sector
activities through incentives for cogeneration.

3. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Background and Obiectives
3.01     Power service was unreliable and inefficient due to frequent power
outages resulting from lack of adequate maintenance and management
practices. In view of slow demand growth, sufficient installed capacity
and low system reliability, JPS' efforts in recent years have focused on
rehabilitation of existing generating units and on improving the overall
operating and managerial efficiency of the Company.
3.02     With the rehabilitation program undertaken as part of the Third
Power Project (Loan 2188-JM), combined with the engagement of in-line
consultants in managerial positions, the quality and efficiency of the
power service has improved since 1984 (para. 2.14). As JPS has been
successful in these efforts, it has Initiated parallel efforts aimed at
strengthening its planning and engineering capabilities in preparation of
future projects. Despite these improvements, there is still a need to
continue such efforts.   With most of the existing generating units
rehabilitated under the Third Power Project, JPS is now focusing on
rehabilitation of transmission and distribution lines. JPS will continue
to retain the services of in-line consultants whose main objectives are to
properly manage JPS and to transfer progressively the necessary know-how to
JPS' upper and middle management. The proposed training program will
intensify the training of JPS staff. The Fourth Power Project is designed
to support these efforts.
Investment Program
3.03     As part of the Third Power Project, JPS contracted MONENCO
(Canadian consultants) to prepare a least-cost generation expansion study
which was completed in September 1985 (para. 2.20). The results and
recommendations included in this study were reviewed by the Bank and taken
into consideration during apprastal of the Fourth Power Project. They are
a suitable basis for future system expansion planning. JPS investment
program, which is based on the least-cost study, includes the commissioning
of the following generating stations: two 22 MW gas turbines, one of which
would be comrmiissioned in 1993 and the other in 1994; a 66 MW coal-fired
unit or other type (peat, depending on outcome of further studies)
including coal harbour and coal handling facilities in 1994. Considering
that the bulk of future power plant additions should be based on coal-fired
units because of limited peat resources, financing is included in the
proposed project for the engineering work of the 66 MW coal-fired power
plant (para. 3.13).
3.04     The investment plan also provides funds to develop several mini-
hydro power plants. Three of these schemes (totalling about 7 MW capacity)
are now being built under the administration of the Petroleum Corporation
of Jamaica (PCJ) and with financing from the Govermnents of Germany, Canada
and Italy. Feasibility studies are underway for other four mini-hydro
schemes with financing of the foregoing governments and IDB. Additionally,
MONENCO has recoumended that a feasibility study for the Back Rio Grande
hydroelectric scheme (about 30 MW) be completed in the near future. Given



- 14 -
the i.mportance of energy substitution (cost-efficient hydro generation for
petroleum), during negotiations the Government agreed to complete, or cause
one of its agencies to complete by December 31, 1988, the feasibility
studies for the above hydroelectric scheme and inform the Benk on the
progress of these studies.
3.05     The investment program for 1987188 - 1993/94, which includes
expansion of generation plants (110 KW) and rehabilitation and expansion of
transmission and distribution facilities, is estimated (in June 1987
prices) at US$417.7 million of which US$296.7 million in foreign currency.
The investments for generation projects correspond to hydroelectric plants
(about US$60 million) and most of them are funded by bi-lateral agencies
and other donors (para. 2.25). Generation investments after 1990/91 (about
US$210 million) mainly correspond to future coal-fired thermal plants to be
constructed starting 1990 and for which financing is to be secured only by
1989. The investments for transmission/distribution programs correspond to
expansion and rehabilitation of JPS' network. The total investment
program, which was reviewed by the Bank and found reasonable, is summarized
below, details are included in Annex 3.1:
Total Cost

a/ In constant June 1987 prices.
Financial Forecast
3.06     The positive financial trend initiated in 1984 is expected to
continue through 1993194 if tariffs are sufficient to produce rates of
return of 5 in 1986/87, 6Z in 1987J88 and 8% in 1988189 and thereafter.
Under such conditions, and assuming that JPS would secure financing for the
external component of its investment program, the internal fund generation
after tax and dividend payments would be sufficient to cover the debt
service and make a contribution to the investment program of about 37%
during the 1987188 - 1993194 period. This share of internal funding is
reasonable considering that 16% of sources would be allocated to
strengthening the sector's working capital, including accumulated fund
surpluses. With satisfactory performance by JPS and generally suitable
investment climate in the country, there are good prospects that foreign
costs of JPS' future investment program will be secured, as in the past,
from multilateral/bilateral lending agencies (para. 2.25). It is also
expected that the liquidity of the sector, and JPS, will continue
increasing until 1990/91 when the accumulated balances will start to be
used for an increasing investment program.



-15 -
3.07     The 8% rate of return target is a little lower than the target
established under Loan 2188-BR (8.5%) but it is adequate as the resulting
average tariff for each year is at least equal or higher than the estimate
LRMC (USc 12.O/kWh), and the internal cash generation is sufficient to make
a substantial contribution to investment and greatly improve the liquidity
of the sector. The rate of return would be about four percentage points
higher if a fuel surcharge, as presently enforced, would be added to the
revenues (or subtracted from the costs). Such fuel surcharge results from
the difference between the actual cost of fuel (presently US$19.23/bbl of
oil) and a floor set up by the Government (US$25Ibbl of oil) for the fuel
clause charged to non-residential consumers.
3.08     The sector will become a contributor to the Government during the
projection period. It is expected to pay about US$25.0 million in income
tax and dividend payments without causing any stress on its finances.
These levels of financial soundness should not, however, prompt reduction
in tariff levels, as the excess liquidity is the result of the efficiency
improvement program initiated in the early 1980s which has permitted the
rehabilitation of all generating capacity and has reduced substantially the
need for new investments, thus making the projection period (1987-88-
1993194) an atypical period of sector expansion. It should be expected
that JPS will make full use of its fund reserves and its capacity for
contracting additional indebtedness, and that after 1993/94 it will most
likely need additional equity contributions as the investment program picks
up its normal pace to meet a growing market and to replace old plants.
Tariffs should also be maintained at appropriate levels so as to achieve a
better allocation of resources, especially scarce energy resources, by
giving the right signals to the consumer. During negotiations, agreement
was reached to take all the necessary actions to maintain electricity
tariffs at a level at least equal to the LRMC and sufficient to allow rates
of return raising from 5% to 8% by 1989/90. The corresponding sector
financing plan is given in detail in Annexes 2.6.1 - 2.6.4 and is
summarized in the following table:

The Proiect
3.09     While the Third Power Project focused on the rehabilitation of the
generating units, the proposed Fourth Power Project focuses on upgradirg
and expanding the transmission lines, substations and distribution network,
and its primary aims are to improve the system's operating efficiency and
to provide &dditional installations to serve new consumers. The project
also includes consulting services for engineering as well as for
continuation of managerial assistance and training. Its components, for
which detailed description is given in Annex 3.2, include:
(a)   Transmission lines
Construction of about 51 circuit-kilometers of a new 138 kV
transmission line between Bellevue and Duncans and rehabilitation
of about 70 circuit-kilometers of existing 69 kV transmission

3.11     The above cost estimates were prepared by the planning and
construction staff of JPS on the basis of designs and bills of materials
and equipment using price levels prevailing in June 1987. These estimates
reflect prices for equipment, materials, installation and construction
contracts of similar works recently Implemented by JPS under Loan 2188-JM.
Foreign and local currency costs exclude duties and taxes as the G^overnment
exempts JPS from these levies. The above estimates were reviewed by the
Bank and found adequate. Physical contingencies were calculated at about
1OZ of the base costs, which is coherent with the nature of the project.
Price contingencies were derived using the following annual escalation
-rates applied to base costs and physical contingencies: 3.0Z for 1987; 1.02
for 1988, 1989 and 1990; and 3.5Z thereafter. Cost estimates corresponding
to consulting services are discussed in detail in para. 3.13.
Project Financing Scheme
3.12     The proposed financing plan is detailed below:
(i)   foreign currency costs which amount to US$18.7 million would be
financed with proceeds of the proposed US$18 million IBRD loan and
the balance of US$0.7 million would be financed by JPS through an
Italian grant;
(ii)   local currency costs which amount to US$11.2 million equivalent
would be financed by JPS; and
(iii)   interest during construction on the Bank loan amounting to US$4.7
million would be financed by JPS.

terms of reference and contractual conditions acceptable to the Bank for
the services described below and they will be contracted following Bank
guidelines.
(i)   Consultant's services for the supervision of the construction of
the 51 circuit-kilometers Bellevue-Duncans 138 kV transmission
line for which a total of 18 staff-month are estimated to be
required. The contract will be of the time-based rate type with
overall ceiling;
(ii)   consulting services for JPS power system expansion studies
including the detailed design and bidding documents for the
proposed coal-fired plant and corresponding coal harbour handling
facilities. It is estimated that about 250 staff-month will be
required. Contractual conditions are to be similar to the ones
mentioned in the above paragraph;
(iii)   consulting cervices for the 1987-1995 Distribution System Master
Plan Study for which a total of 40 staff-month will be utilized
under a contract similar to the ones mentioned above.
(iv)   technical assistance, including managerial, administrative,
financial and technical advice, for which four individual experts
(some of them may have extended their existing contracts with JPS
under Loan 2188-JM financing) will be retained during the period
of four years (1987-1990); and
(v)   supervisory services for engineering works related to the
upgrading of existing 69 kV transmission lines and distribution
facilities to be provided by an individual expert included in the
Technical Assistance Program described in para (iv) above.
Training Program
3.14     JPS proposed training program, to be financed partially with the
proposed Bank Loan, would be--implemented during the period 1987-1991.  The
program takes due consideration of JPS staff overall training needs and the
utility's financial constraints. Details of the contents of the training
program and the corresponding costs are included in Annex 3.2.2. During
negotiations agreement was reached with JPS: (i) on the contents of its
1987-1991 training program; and (ii) by May 31 of each year, JPS will
submit the detailed annual training plan for Bank review.

3.16      Contracts for the supply of equipment and materials required for
the 138 kV and 69 kV transmission lines, substations and distribution
network as well as the constructioD contract for the 138 kV Bellevue-
Duncans transmission line will be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines.
In the evaluation of ICB bids, domestic manufacturers would be accorded a
margin of preference equal to 15Z of the CIF price of imported goods, or
the prevailing level of tariff, whichever is lower.

3.17     Some miscellaneous items required for the extension and upgrading
of JPS' substations (such as control, protection and switching equipment),
where standardization is necessary because compatibility of existing
equipment or they are only obtainable from one manufacturer, will be
purchased directly from the supplier with prior approval by the Bank. The
total cost of these items is estimated to amount to US$500,000. Software
packages required for JPS' Information System (about US$200,000) will also
be purchased directly from appropriate suppliers. Construction contracts
to upgrade the 69 kV transmission lines, substations and distribution
network will be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB) acceptable
to the Bank, because: (i) in the above cases this is considered to be the
most economic and efficient method; and (ii) these works are not large
enough to attract cost efficient foreign competition. Courses and seminars
included in the trainin; program will be contracted directly (para. 3.14),
and consultant services will be retained according to Bank guidelines.
3.18     Jamaican manufacturers and contractors are expected to be awarded
through ICB with contracts for the supply of equipment and materials with a
total cost not exceeding US$2,500,000. They will receive a margin of
preference of 15Z or the applicable import duties (as if JPS were not
exempted from these levies), whichever is lower for bid evaluation
purposes. All of the above procurement arrangements are adequate and in
line with Bank policies.
Project Supervision and Implementation
3.19     The borrower and the executing agency would be JPS.  The proposed
loan would be the Fourth Loan to JPS. The three previous operations were
for a total of US$72.5 million. Except for some delays in carrying out the
First Power Project, JPS has shown capability for implementing projects
like the one proposed as demonstrated during the implementation of the
Third Power Project.
3.20     For the construction of the 138 kV Bellevue-Duncans transmission
line JPS will engage consultants (for supervision of construction) and
contractors (for erection of the line) acceptable to the Bank with broad
experience in similar works. Detailed design and bidding documents for
this line are now being completed by JPS' consultants. Engineering works
related to upgrading the 69 kV transmission lines, substation expansion and
distribution network rehabilitation will be carried out by JPS' staff
assisted as required by an individual expert (para. 3.13). Construction
and installation works for these components as well as for the training
facilities will be contracted among local firms acceptable to the Bank with
experience in this type of works. Engineering, construction and
installation of the different project components would be under the overall
supervision of the corresponding divisions of JPS under coordination of
JPS' Project Director. With the above arrangements, which are
satisfactory, JPS will be able to complete the Bank financed project
adequately as demonstrated in the previous Bank operations with the
Jamaican utility.
3.21     Procurement, manufacturing, installation and construction of the
different works as well as activities of consultant's services are expected
to be carried out during the period December 1987 - June 1992.



- 21 -
The implementation schedule is included in Annex 3.2.3. A -summary follows:
Activit-Y                                   Period
- Issuance of bidding documents               December 1987 - July 1988
- Contract awards                             November 1988 - April 1989
- Delivery of equipment and materials         November 1988 - June 1991
- Commissioning of works                      December 1989 - June 1992
Performance targets have been established to: (i) measure the timely and
efficient execution of the project; and (ii) improve the overall
performance of JPS. Execution of the project will be monitored against
target dates shown in the implementation schedule and upgraded JPS
performance will be monitored through operational, financial and managerial
indicators which are included in Annex 3.2.4. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with JPS on the above performance targets.
Disbursements
3.22    The proposed Bank loan is expected to be distursed over a period
of six years. The disbursement schedule reflects applicable IBRD standard
disbursement profiles which are based on the Bankk's experience in similar
projects in the region and in Jamaica. A Special Account (Revolving Fund)
would be established in a bank acceptsble to the Bank in order to expedite
disbursements. The maximum deposit of approximately US$1,000,000 is
estimated to cover four months of expenditures of Bank funding on the
project. The Account would be replenished by the Bank in accordance with
agreed procedures. To the extent possible, all eligible expenditures would
be paid through the Special Account. Disbursements against small contracts
or purchase orders of US$200,000 equivalent and less will be made against
statement of expenditures (SOE), signed by the Director of Finance of JPS.
The documentation for SOE clains will be held by JPS for audit and will
also be made available for review by Bank missions. All other
disbursements will be made against full documentation. Bank proceeds would
finance:
(a)   100% of foreign expenditures for imported goods, or 100% of the
ex-factory cost for local goods;
(b)   100% of foreign expenditures for scholarships and other training
related expenditures; and
(c)   100% of foreign expenditures for consultants services provided by
firms or individual experts.
The closing date will be June 30, 1993. Details of the
disbursement schedule are included in Annex 3.2.5.
Economic Justification
3.23    The economic analysis was based on the 1987/88-1990191 investment
program for the sector which includes all the investments in generation,
transmission, and distribution facilities necessary to meet electricity
demand. The proposed investment program is based on the Least-Cost



- 22 -
Expansion Study (para. 3.03), a comprehensive long-term planning study
completed in 1985 which is a sound development program for the sector. The
investment program maintains the sequence of generation projects
recommended in the Least-Cost Expansion Study.
3.24     The benefits to consumers associated to the proposed project
cannot be segregated from those corresponding to JPS overall investment
program. In these circumstances, a 'time-slice' of JPS' investment program
covering the period 1987/88-1990/91 was analyxed. This is an atypical
investment period, since investments in generation are planned to be held
at a minimum, with net capacity additions consisting only of mini-hydro
plants under construction by PCJ. The economic benefits to be derived from
the proposed investment program were related to: (i) incremental sales for
the period; and (ii) fuel savings resulting from reduction in transmission
and distribution losses; and (iii) improved efficiency of JPS generating
plants. The incremental sales during the period are projected to result
from the implementation of the program and were valued at the average
tariff for the projection period as a minimum measure of consumer's
willingness to pay. The economic costs of the program include capital
investments in generation, transmission, distribution, and other
investments (specialized vehicles, communication equipment, training and
consulting services), and costs of fuel, operation and maintenance
associated to the capital investments. Costs and fuel savings from
reduction in system losses streams were expressed at border prices at the
1987 rate of exchange, which is deemed to adequately reflect the market
value of foreign exchange in Jamaica. Details of the economic analysis are
included in Annexes 3.3 and 3.3.1.
3.25     The resulting rate of return (the rate equalizing the benefits and
costs streams over the period of analysis) is aLcnt 10, which is the
opportunity cost of capital assumed for Jawsica.  The foregoing revenue
based measure of the economic internal rate of return is more a measure of
the adequacy of tariffs than of the true economic merit of the investment
program which includes the proposed project. In this regard the average
electricity tariff in Jamaica was found to be at an adequate level for
supporting the incremental costs of the program. The rate of return does
not fully measure some of the benefits conferred by the project,
particularly those associated with the increase in system reliability that
is expected to result from the implementation of the program. In this
sense, the calculated rate of return is deemed to be a minimum measure of
the program benefits. As indicated above, however, the 1987188-1990/91
period is atypical since part of its associated benefits are the result of
investments in generation made before 1986. Thus the adequacy of current
tariffs would have to be reassessed in the light of the larger generation
investment programs recommended by the Least Cost Study for implementation
in the 1990s.
Environmental Aspects
3.26     JPS has carried out similar projects with due regard to
environmental protection and would continue to do so in this project.
Transmission line routes will follow established right-of-way with land
clearing and visual impact kept to a minimum. JPS will compensate property
owners as required by the national legislation. Clearing of right-of-way



- 23 -
would be kept to a minimum and natural drainage patterns are not expected
to be affected. Environmental effects related to the coal-fired power
plant would be duly addressed by the consultants to be hired for the plant
final design and bidding documents, for which terms-of-reference would be
reviewed by the Bank.
Prolect Risks
-       3.27     The implementation schedule assumed for the project is reasonable
and takes into account normal engineering and construction procedures and
provisions for usual delays. Timely completion of the project will depend
-;to a large extent upon ability of construction firms to maintain schedules,
especially in view of labor unrests (strikes) which in the past have caused
delays. The proposed schedules used for project implementation take into
consideration these risks and they are based on previous Bank experience
with JPS.
3.28    About 20% of JPS generating capacity consists of units installed
before 1965 whirh are scheduled to be retired from service during the mid
1990s. Given the age of these installations as well as their condition
(which is less than satisfactory as result of poor maintenance practices in
the past), no evidence exists that they will perform adequately until their
retirement date. To minimize the above risk, adequate preventive
maintenance programs will be implemented by JPS (see para. 2.14).
3.29    Delays that may be incurred in the implementation of JPS' overall
investment program, as a result of possible funding shortages, would not
affect the execution and justification of the proposed project. The
project can be implemented even if the rest of the program is not; its
components are independent inas far as they are related to enhancing and
expanding existing transmission and distribution networks. It has a high
degree of certainty in its financing: the proposed Bank loan and internal
sunding, which most likely will be available (para. 3.08). Because of its
characteristics, it would be econospically justifiable as it would produce
significant increases in revenues and reduction in operating costs with
little investment.

4. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
4.01    During loan negotiations, the Government of Jamaica and JPS, as
appropriate, agreed to:
a) establish, by June 30, 1988, a sector policy for the purchase of
electricity from individual suppliers (para.2.06);
b)  continue to implement a program of systematic preveative
maintenance of JPS' power generating plant (para. 2.14);
c)  submit not later than May 31, 1988, a loss reduction plan
acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.15);
d)  submit not later than August 31, 1987, and implement promptly
thereafter, satisfactory plans of action on the following matters
(para. 2.22):
(i)    the corporate information systems;
(ii)    the transfer to JPS staff of the managerial activities
presently being held by consultants; and
(iii)    measures to address the observations of the external
auditors to JPS' internal control system.
e)  implement a management strengthening program designed to align JPS
salaries for managers and qualified professionals with those for
comparable positions of equivalent agencies (para. 2.22);
f) maintain the level of accounts receivable for electricity sold to
the Government and its agencies at no more than 60 billing days
(para. 2.26);
g)  complete or cause one of its agencies to complete by December 31,
1988, the feasibility studies for the Back Rio Grande
hydroelectric scheme and inform the Bank on the progress of the
above studies (para. 3.0/-i:
h) take all the necessary measures to maintain electricity tariffs at
a level at least equal to the long-run marginal cost or sufficient
to allow JPS the following rates of return: 5Z in 1987188, 6Z in
1988189, and 8X in 1989190 and thereafter (para. 3.08);
i)  carry out the 1987-1991 Training Master Program and furnish by May
31 of each year detailed annual training program (para. 3.14); and
j)  carry out JPS operations in line with a set of performance
indicators and submit periodic reports to the Bank showing the
expected targets and the actual figures (para. 3.21).
4.02    The following covenants (referred to those of previous loans) are
ls8o included in the legal documents of the proposed loan:



-25-
a) to submit JPS' audited financial statements to the Bank within six
(vs. four) months of the end of each fiscal year;
b) limitation of short-term borrowings to one-fifth (vs. one-sixth)
of cash operating expenses during the preceding twelve months;
c)  3imitation of long-term borrowing unless gross internal cash
generation exceeds maximum future debt service by a ratio of 1.5
times; and
d) limitation of construction of works additional to those agreed
with the Bank to no more than 3X (vs. 2Z) of gross fixed assets in
operation until the project shall have been completed.
4.03     Condition of effectiveness would be the submission of adequate
svid.nce that the Bcrvawer shall have taken all the actions necessary to
iplement, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, a new electricity tariff
structure based on the recommendations of the tariff study (para. 2.24).
4.04    With the above assurances the project would constitute a suitable
basis for a loan to JPS of US$18.0 million under applicable terms and
conditions for Jamaica.

JAMUICA PUBLIC SERVICES CO. INC.
INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
BackRround and Ownership
1.      The Jamaica Public Service Company Limited (JPS) is the only power
utility in Jamaica, with exclusive responsibility for the generation,
transmission, and distribution of electric energy for public consumption.
The Government of Jamaica is the major shareholder of JPS whose affairs are
governed by a Memorandum and Articles of Association.
2.      Originally established ik May 1923, under the laws of Jammica, the
c-mpany acquired the West India Electric Company which had started
operations in 1898. For decades JPS operated under various licences (as
many as 30 at one time) granted at different times in the fourteen parishes
of the island, under the Electric Lighting Act of May 27, 1890. In June
1966 all these licences were replaced by the All-Island Electric Licence
and in August 1978 a new licence valid for 39 years was granted to the
company. Under its terms, the Minister of Public Utilities has power avd
authority to require observance and performance by the company of its
obligations under the licence and to fix the rates charged by the company.
3.      JPS was formerly owned by private interests, mainly American,
Cnadian and British. At the time the All-Island Licence wa first
granted, the company was operated under the control of Stone & Webster
Corporation through a 19.6% equity ownership and management consultancy
contracts. In 1971 the Jamaican Government through the Electricity
Authority acquired Stone & Webster's controlling interest. Today the
Government through the Electricity Authority and the Accountant General is
the owner of over 99% of the issued ordinary capital, the rest of the
shares being held by about 2,000 private persons.
Orgzanization and Management
4.      The present organization of JPS is adequate for a company with its
characteristics. Efforts are being made to gradually decentralize
adm-nistrative activities which are heavily concentrated at Kingston
headquarters. After several years - especially from 1979 to 1982 - of
severe financial losses and low quality of service, JPS' management abs
taken measures to reverse the deteriorating trend in its operational
efficiency and has substantially imvroved the operational performance of
the company. At the same time, it has initiated efforts to strengthen its
planning and engineering capabilities.
5.      The Board of Directors has overall corporate responsibility for
company affairs.  It has 11 members appointed by the Government which
represent a cross section of interests including industry, comserce,
engineering and finance. The day to day operations of the company are
dealt with by JPS' management h.aded by the Chairman as Chief Ezecutive and



29-
ANNEX 2.2
Page 2 of 4
the Managing Director. Senior executives include seven directors, three
managers and the corporate secretary (see organization chart in Annex
2.2.1).
6.       Under the Third Power Project (Loan 2188-mT), JPS engaged the
services of in-line consultants assigned to managerial positions within a
program of efficiency improvements in the financial and operational areas.
As JPS has been successful in these areas it has initiated parallel efforts
aimed at strengthening its planning and engineering capabilities in
preparation of future generation projects. During negotiations, agreement
was reached to continue this technical assistance program and to ensure the
smooth transfer of managerial positions to JPS' staff.
Corporate Planning and Information Systems
7.       The corporate plans are developed within the framework of a
Statement of Corporate Objectives set forth in 1979 (see Annex 2.2.2), and
are addressed on a five-year basis and on an annual basis through the
budget. The planning process involves staff, mn-agement and the Board of
Directors. Under the Third Power Project, a least-cost expansion study was
prepared as a reference for future construction programs. The Corporate
Information System was developed by Peat, Marwick, as consultants, and
referred basically to technical and financial operations. A program has
been prepared to implement a comprehensive information system during 1986-
1988. During negotiations agreement was reached on an action plan for the
implementation of JPS' Corporate Information System according to the
recommendations of its consultants.
Human Resources and Traininu
8.       Of the 1,740 employees of JPS all but the top ten managers are
affiliated to one of the four national unions. Clerical and technical
personnel belong to the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) affiliated
with the governing Jamaica Labor Party and to the National Workers Union
(NWU) affiliated with the opposition People's National Party (PNP).
Supervisory staff and engineers belong to the Union of Technical and
Supervisory Personnel (UTASP), a national labor r--ion founded at JPS in
1974. The fourth union, the Managers Union, consists of a small number of
JPS staff at the third level of management.
9.       Labor unrest is common in Jamaica and at JPS. Work stoppages,
including electricity cuts, interfere with JPS' ability to supply efficient
service. The basic principles for labor relations are in the hands of the
Government and JPS' top management has little space for negotiations with
its employees. Low salaries as compared with the cost of living are the
main reason for a high turnover of qualified personnel who leave JPS for
other jobs in Jamaican companies, including other public utilities, or
leave the country for better career opportunities abroad. This may hamper
the continuation of the efficiency improvement program initiated under the
Third Power Project. During negotiations, agreement was reached on a
management strengthening program addressed to align JPS salaries for
managers and qualified professionals with those of equivalent agencies such
as the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ) and the Jamaica Telephone Co.
(JTC). Such program is being prepared in cooperation with the Ministry of

Public Service and in the context of the Government's Administrative Reform
Program.
10.      The training program carried out under the Third Power Project
(Loan 2188-JM) included basically overseas training and is being
satisfactorily implemented. The new training program under the Fourth
Power Pro,ject will give major emphasis to local training programs,
including construction of JPS' training center (see para.3.14 and Annex
3.2.2).
Budgeting and Financial Planning
11.      For several years JPS has had in place a revenue and expense
budgeting system which is gradually being improved. A budgetary control
system, completely reconciled with the accounting system, produces monthly
comparisons of actual versus budgetary revenues and expenses. The major
deficiencies in the budgetary system are the tardiness in the presentation
of the budgetary control reports because of delays in the accounting system
and the lack of an adequate medium to long-term capital budget system.
Such deficiencies are being addressed under the Corporate Information
System currently being Implemented by JPS (see para. 7). The system has
been computerized with financial planning progr=ms both for tlhe short and
the long-term. These programs have permitted JPS to overcome serious
deficiencies in its financial planning sy_..em as it now is able to prepare
adequate financial projections.
Accounting and Auditing
12.      The general accounting system of JPS has worked well since its
introduction in December 1981. Hcwever, improvements have been proposed
and form part of the Corporate Information System. A review of the general
ledger system aims at its closer integration with the other systems with
which it interfaces. The most urgent need within the accounting system of
JPS is the documentation of present procedures and, arising from this,
their review and improvement. Past audit reports have highlighted the need
for improved reporting of construction work in progress to enable timely
comparison of costs with approvals, thereby improving cost control. The
accounts payable system has been fully reviewed by _PS' internal audit unit
and consultants are presently reviewing the existing system with a view to
recomnending the changes necessary to ensure integration with the materials
management system and to give improved internal control mechanisms.
13.      JPS has been unable to recruit a qualified professional for the
position of chief internal auditor. The unit is now headed by staff which
is not fully qualified, supported by an auditor and three assistant
auditors. The work of the internal audit unit, and especially its
responsibilities regarding the internal control system, has been greatly
enhanced during the last couple of years. Greater emphasis has been given
to metering activities in view of the high levels of losses (see paras.
2.18, 2.19 of main text and Annex 2.4). However, there is still much to be
done as shown by the observations in the independent auditors report of
1985 regarding JPS' internal control system. Price Waterhouse, a firm of
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, is the external auditor of JPS
and its performance has been satisfactory. In previous years, the



- 31 -
ANNEX 2.2
Page 4 of 4
iAdependent auditors report was submitted with considerable delays,
s6netimes about one year later. These delays were especially due to the
poor accounting system at JPS. As a result of the management assistance
program such delays have been reduced as the 1985 report was submitted in
July. It is expected that in future years said report will be submitted
within five months of the following year. During negotiations, JPS agreed
to continue engaging the services of independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and to submit their report within the next six months after the end of
each fiscal year. Agreement was also reached on an action plan to address
the observations made by the external auditor to JPS' internal control
system.
Billing and Collection
14.      Except for 22 major industrial customers all of JPS billing system
is computerized. Efforts are being made to improve the presentation of the
electricity bill to better Inform the customer about its content. The
collection of accounts receivable from electricity consumers has improved
substantially as the unpaid amount in days of billing has been reduced from
91 in 1982 to 59 in 1986187. Arrears are only significant for Government
accounts, the National Water Co  ission and the Airport Authority.  JPS has
been able, however, to avoid any increases in the arrears by obtaining
payments directly from the entities involved or through the Ministry of
Finance.
Insurance
15.      The company's assets are insured on a replacement cost basis
against most risks common to an electric utility and relevant to the
region, including fire, earthquake, hurricane, machinery breakdown and
boiler explosion. While declaring full value of the properties, the
company has determined the loss limits in order to get the best premium
rates. JPS has established a system of deductibles which takes into
consideration the probability of casualty, based on experience, for each
type of good. In addition to property insurance, the company has in place
insurance coverage for other risks including: consequential loss,
public/products liability, employee personal accident, motor vehicles
(commercial and private), money protection, fidelity guarantee, and
employer's liability. Insurance is placed with several companies, on a
competitive tender basis through insurance brokers.
Operation and Maintenance
16.      With the rehabilitation program under way, the level and
proportion of outages due to generation equipment failures declined and the
system heat rate has improved since 1984. Even with this improvement there
is still a need for a comprehensive long-term maintenance strategy. With
the exception of the newly rehabilitated units at Old Harbour and Hunts
Bay, all thermal units require varying levels of repairs and maintenance.
In order to improve operation and maintenance practices, JPS is
implementing in the short-term an efficient preventive maintenance policy
for all units, paying special attention to: (a) disciplined preventive
maintenance even during perdods of less-than-adequate margins of reserve
capacity; and (b) an institutional mechanism for the timely supply of spare
parts.

HISTORICAL POWER MARKET AND FORECAST
Historical Power Market
1.       Total JPS' electricity sales increased at an average annual rate
oi about 0.3% from 1976 (1,120 GWh) to 1985 (1,147 GWh). During the same
period maximum demand (non-c6incidental) has increased from 239 MW in 1976
to 252 MW in 1985. Annex 2.4.1 illustrate in detail the evolution of JPS'
sales and power generation. A summary for 1976 and 1985 is given in the
table oelow.  The stagnation of electricity consumption in Jamaica during
1976-1985 was mainly due to: (i) declining bauxiteialumina exports; (ii)
falling tourism activities; (iii) increasing electricity tariffs as result
of rising petroleum prices; and (iv) unreliable power supply.

2.       The structure of JPS' electricity sales has not cetnged
substantially between 1976 and 1985. The greatest variation has been the
increase of losses (subtransmission and distribution) which tn 1976
amounted to 192 GWh or 14.6% of JPS' total net generation and in 1985
increased to 281 GWn or 19.7% of net generatton.
Future Power Market
3.       A comprehensive Power Market Survey was carried out in 1984 by
independent consultants (MONENCO) within the framework of a Least Cost
Expansion Study, financed under the Third Power Project. A nationwide
information collection program was undertaken in order to obtain the
historic data and to forecast the system future growth. The methods
applied in forecasting electricity demand were based on judgemental

*appikoaches and on kegression analyses in which economic and d'mographic
factors were taken into consideration. The "Best Estimate' load forecast
prepared by MONENCO in 1984 was reviewed by the Bank mission and adjusted
to the reduced levels cf Jamaica's economic growth projected for the next
decade. As result, the average annual growth rate in electricity
consumption (including system losses) for the next 7 years is now expected
to be in the range of 2.3% which is consistent with the results of the 'Low
Case" forecast of the above studyr
4.  .    JPS' total-electricity sales are expected to increase at an annual
average rate of about 3% from 1,264 GWh in fiscal year 1986187 to 1,555
GWh in 1993194. Maximum demand is expected to increase from 255 MW in
1986187 to about 305 MW in 1993194 at an average annual rate of about
2.6%. No major variations ane exoected to take place in the structure of
electricity consumption, except for system losses which in view of the
program being implemented under Loan 2188-JM and the one proposed in this
project are expected to decrease from 192 of total generation in 1986/87 to
about 15% in 1993194. Details of JPS' forecast are given in Annex 2.4.1.
A summary of this forecast for 1986/87 and 1993l94 is given below:

Energy and Capacity Balances
5.       Power demand is not expected to grow rapidly, thus limiting the
need for new plants to come on stream until 1993. The revised results of
the Least Cost Expansion Study indicate that in 1993 a gas turbine of about
22 MW (in replacement of a retired;gas turbine) and in 1994 a 66 MW steam-
driven generating plant and an additional 2. NW gas turbine should be
installed to meet demand.. JPS will continue to generate about 952 cf its
energy requirements with conventional oil-fired plants through 1993.
System heat rates are expected to improve from about 12,956 BTU/kWh in 1985
tc about 12,280 BTU/kWh in 1989, as result of connecting two 20 MW low
speed diesel units commissioned during 1985 and of the power plant
rehabilitation program recently completed under loan 2188-JM. It is



- 38 -
ANNEX 2.4
Page 3 of 3
expected that the average system heat rate will remain in the range of
12,500 BTU/kWh during the next decade as result of adequate operational and
maintenance procedures now being implemented through loan 2188-JM and
through the proposed training. Power plant performance will be monitored
by the Bank during the execution of the IV Power Project.
6.       In view of the power market requirements, existing power
availability and future power plant capacity to be added in 1993 and 1994,
JPS will be able to meet its power market requirements (energy and
capacity) during the period 1986/87-1993/94 with adequate margins of
reserve as shown in detail in Annex 2.4.2. JPS energy and capacity
balances are adequate.
System Losses
7.       In fiscal year 1986/87, JPS system losses amounted to 296 GWh or
about 19% of total net generation. The largest share of losses continues
to be unauthorized use of electricity through illegal connections. Also
obsolete and overloaded distribution equipment as well as inappropriate
billing procedures have contributed to losses. A program to reduce
technical losses (upgrading of overloaded primary distribution lines and
installation of 15 MVAR of capacitor banks) is in the early stages of
implementation under Loan 2188-JM. To continue to support JPS' efforts to
reduce technical and unaccounted losses, the proposed project includes a
distribution program, which includes the installation of about 33 MVAR of
capacitor banks and the conversion to 24 kV of about 2,200 circuit-
kilometers of 13.8 kV, 6.9 kV and 4.0 kV distribution lines. Through the
implementation of both of the above programs, it is expected that JPS'
system losses will decrease at an annual average rate of about 3.4% to
reach by 1991/92 about 15% of JPS' net generation.
8.       JPS is making efforts to ida-'tify and to disconnect illegal users.
The contract with EBASCO for tariff -.udies has been extended to include an
assessment of the problem of losses and to prepare a comprehensive program
for loss reduction, which is expected to be completed by April 1988. The
results of this study will be reviewed by the Bank. In this regard, JPS
would submit not later than May 31, 1988, a loss reduction plan acceptable
to the Bank, taking due consideration of EBASCO's recommendations. JPS'
.loss reduction targets will be monitored during supervision of the IV Power
Project.

ELECTRICITY PRICING
B-Wkaround
1.      With only minor modifications, the structure of electricity
tariffs in Jamaica is about thirty years old. It consists of five tariff
categories that, dith the exception of street lighting, are of a declining
block pattern. In 1984, electricity tariffs in Jamaica w.re significantly
increased in two steps and, as a result, the average price of electricity
(in US cents/kWh) was 13.7 in 1984 and 11.2 in 1986t87, and is expected to
be 11.8 in 1987188. The high 'evel of electricity prices has raised
conamzers concerns and public inquiries have focussed on the adequacy of
tariff levels to supply costs and on the alleged regressiveness of their
structure.
2.       JPS tariffs have a fuel component adjustable according to fuel
costs to the company in the preceding month. The monthly rate of
adjustment is limited by the 'fuel clausem which sets efficiency standards
to be met by JPS; the company cannot charge its customers for fuel use
above a system heat rate of 13,500 BtulkWh, nor for system losses in excess
of 15%. Unlike the declitnng pattern of JPS' base tariffs the 'fuel
clause" is a flat rate per kWh charged to all customers regardless of
category as well as consumption class (level within category). Since 1973
the 'fuel clause' has taken an increasing share of JPS unit revenues, both
on account of the increase in international fuel prices and of currency
devaluations. It now accounts for about 63% of JPS' revenues par kWh. The
'fuel clause' has also been the subject of recent public inquiries.
Tariff Study
3.      Because of the weaknesses in the existing electricity pricing
scheme, during a Bank supervision mission that visited Jamaica in mid-1984
it was agreed, and later on approved by Bank management, that an
Electricity Tariff Study would be carried out and financed with proceeds of
Loan 2188-3M, out of funds allocated to Financial Planning Studies. In
February 1985, JPS selected EBASCO, a consulting firm acceptable to the
Bank, to carry out the study.  A draft report was issued in April 1986.
Its conclusions and recommendations are summarized in Annex 2.5.1. The
final report ws issued in October 1986.
4.      Besides the urgent need to review the existing tariff strr.cture,
the timing of the study has been particularly appropriate since a Least-
Cost Expansion Program is now available as a result of a study completed in
,1985 by another firm of external consultants (Montreal Engineering Co. -
MONUNCO). The Expan&ion Program has provided the basic information to
evaluate future-supply costs. The relevance of the tariff study is



- 42 -
ANNEX 2.5
Page 2 of 2
particularly important at this time to evaluate tariff policies as current
financial projections for the 1987188-1993/94 period show that JPS will
have cash surpluses because of a modest investment program resulting from
the rehabilitation program carried out under Loan 2188-JM and the slow down
in market growth.
5.       The primary objective of the tariff study was to provide JPS with
a critical evaluation of the structure and level of the base tariff, and of
the fuel clause. It helped design a tariff schedule based on supply costs
and to support JPS' financial planning. Although the study does not
include provisions to analyze electricity prices within the broader
framework of general energy pricing policies, it includes features to
promote energy conservation. Annex 2.5.1 gives a suammary of the tariff
study and Annex 2.5.2 gives the program for the implementation of
recommendations of the tariff study.

TARIFF STUDY
SUMMARY OF ELECTRICITY TARIFF STUDY1
1.       The principal purpose of the Electricity Tariff Study is to
prepare a set of rates to be applied by Jamaica Public Service Company
sales to its different classes of customers. The most important objectives
are:
- Provide JPS with adequate revenues to allow for efficient and
reliable operations.
- Distribute cost among the users in an equitable manner.
- Provide incentives to conserve energy and capital.
- Consider the plight of economically disadvantaged customers.
- Propose simple rates, easy to understand by the customer and to
administer by the Company.
2.       The results of the load research study provided information to
analyze system losses and to determine how each class of customers impact
the system capacity requirements at different levels.  For example, on
average, each kW of residential demand requires only approximately 0.13 kW
of generating capacity, while each kW of power service demand requires 0.51
kW of generating capacity. On the other hand, at the secondary
distribution level the kW of residential demand and the kW of power service
require the same capacity in distribution facilities. -
3.       The cost of service performed by EBASCO was a marginal type study.
The system load forecast was supplied by JPS and reviewed by EBASCO.
Information on the system operation and expenses was supplied by JPS and
complemented with EBASCO's general review of the system operations. EBASCO
reviewed the effect that the slow-speed diesels have in the operations and
particularly in the fuel expenses. The review of the slow speed diesels
determined that a heat rate of 11,800 Btu per kWh was a reasonable value to
be used with the Fuel Clause Adjustment in the short-term.
4.       Information on the financial costs and requirements for the period
covered by the study (1986 through 1991) was supplied by JPS and analyzed
by EBASCO which, in turn, determined the total system revenue requirements
to be allocated among the classes, by the cost of service study.
11 The tariff study was carried out by EBASCO Business Consulting Co.
(April 1986)

5.       The marginal cost of service study was developed for the three
main categories under which is usual to classify costs: marginal demand
related costs, marginal energy related costs and customer related costs.
6.       The following table summarizes the revenue requirements by classes
of customers as determined from the cost analysis, at their present level
and at the level produced by the application of the proposed rates:
Revenues (S Million)             Increase (2)

7.       If the required revenue increases determined from the cost of
service were utilized, the result would be rates that would produce drastic
bill increases to some classes and reductions to others. The increases in
the proposed col-mn limft the class increases ro more acceptable values.
The rates designed with the proposed increases generate class revenues
which are more equitable than those generated by the present rates. The
relative subsidy produced by R20 would be lower than under the present rate
structure.
S.       In the following paragraphs some important features of the
proposed rates are described:
The proposed tariffs incorporate a Foreign Exchange Clause
Adjustment, for the purpose of providing JPS with the additional
(or reduced) cash needed to service the foreign debt when the
value of the J$ deteriorates (improves) in relation to the US$.
The Fuel Clause Adjustment formula is retained, but the heat -rate
has been reduced to 11,800 Btu per kWh to reflect the improved
efficiency introduced by the slow speed diesel units.
The fuel cost incorporated in the base rates has been increased to
J$17.36 per million Btu. The cost of fuel was estimated at a
level of US$19.61 per barrel of heavy fuel oil, on the basis of
2/

data supplied by the Ministry of Mining, Energy, Industry and Tourism.
a.   Residential Rate (R10)
The residential rate (R10) has been simplified by reducing the
nmber of blocks from 6 to 4. The price differential between the
first and the last block has been greatly reduced. Cwustomers with
consumption below 100 kWh per month, with the exception of the
Minimum bill customers, will pay lower bills or only lightly
higher than present bills. C mpared to 1985 bills, proposed bills
will be drastically lower.
A rider, to apply to the Residential Rate, has been designed. The
purpose of the rider is to permit schools and hospitals to be
billed under the Residential Rate with a discount of 15Jc per kWh
applicable to all consumption in excess of 300 kWh.
b.   General Service Rate (R20)
The General Service Rate (R20) has been designed with the same
structure of the present rate, except that the price differential
between the first and the last block has been greatly reduced.
Small users will experience bill decreases.
A minimum bill based on metered demand has been introduced.
Initially, customers with demands in excess of 100 kW (as
estimated by JPS) should have demand meters installed. This will
facilitate the transfers to rate 40.
A power factor penalty has been introduced to be applicable to
large customers (5,000 kWh or more).
C. Power Rate CR40)
A customer charge has been introduced.
The demand price has been increased from J$3.56 per kW to J$9.00
per kW, a 153% increase.
The ratchet has been reduced from 100X to 80X. This will reduce
the impact of the demand charge on customers with seasonal
demands, such as hotels.
The lighting limitation has been eliminated from those customers
with demand of more than 100 kW.
The rate will not be available to new customers whose demands are
less than 100 kW. Nevertheless, customers with less than 100 kW,
being served under this rate prior to 1 April 1986 will be
permitted in the rate until they close their account, move to
other location or discontinue for non-payment.
The power factor has been increased.

ANNEX 2.5.1

d.   Large Power Rate (R50)
A customer charge has been introduced.
Demand charge has been increased from J$3.05 per kVA to J$15.00
per kVA, a 392Z increase.
The ratchet has been reduced from 100X to 85%. Again, it should
reduce the impact of the demand charge of seasonal customers.
The four energy blocks have been reduced to two blocks.
An experimental Time-of-Use rate for rate R50 customers is
proposed. Experiment would be limited to 5 or 6 customers,
initially selected by JPS and to be representative of the class.
Customers on the experimental rate would have lower bills than
standard rate R50 if they shift some demand and energy from peak
period to off-peak period. Peak periods consist of the hours
between 8 a.m. and 11 p.m. of every weekday (Monday through
Friday). All the other hours will be billed as off-peak hours.
e.   Street Lighting
Prices have been incrassed for the High Pressure Sodium Lamps and
the Incandescent Lamps and reduced for the Mercury Vapor and
Mercury-Tungsten Lamp.
Overall revenues from the Street Lighting will not change.
9.       In the design stage, particularly for the residential class,
EBASCO considered a nmber of alternative rates. Most worthy of mention
are the flat or fixed rate and the life-line rate. It was concluded thst,
at the present time, the proposed rate structure would be the most
satisfactory to JPS and its customers.

FINANCES
i.       The efficiency Improvement program carried out under the Third
Fower Project and substantial tariff increases implemented in the early
1980s have firmed-up the reversal of the deteriorating trend of JPS'
finances which are expected to continue lmproving if tariffs are maintained
at least equal to the long-run marginal cost (estimated at 12.0 USc/kWh)
and at a level necessary to produce rates of return of 51 un 1987188, 61 in
1988189, and 81 in 1989190 and thereafter. Notvithstanding the tariff
increases, JPS did not reach the covenanted rates of return for 1984 (6.4
vs. 8.OZ), 1985 (5.0 vs. 8.5Z) and 1986 (5.71 vs. 8.5Z). It is estimated
that in the future sector finances will be on the Improving trend and the
sector will become a significant income tax contributor and increase its
contribution to investment du'rlg 1987189 - 1990191, when the investment
program is rather small, and :cimulate fund surpluses during that period.
However, as the investment program gets in line with the market growth at
the end of the projection period (1992193 -1993194), JPS will have to start
using its accumulated fund reserves.1
Operatinx Results
2.       The efficiency improvement program undertaken by JPS under the
Third Power Project hbas resulted in a substantial decrease of the heat
rate, from about 15,300 BTU/kWh in 1982 to about 12,400 BTUIkWh in 1986187.
Because of this and measures taken to correct the 'fuel clause' the gap
between the fuel revenues and the fuel expense has been constantly
decreasing since 1981. Under the present Ofuel clause the difference has
been reversed and a positive income has resulted since 1985. JPS's
operating income which was negative in 1981-1982 has been positive since
1983, thus indicating a firm reversal of the previous deteriorating trend.
On the basis of the market projections and under the tariff conditions set
forth in para. 1 above, the operating income of JPS would continue in the
upward trend until the end of the projection period 2 . JPS' net Income
became positive only in 1983. Because of previous losses, JPS did not pay
-.11 Annexes 2.6.1 through 2.6.4 give detailed finnncial statements and
financial indicators for the historical period 1981-1986187 and for the
projected period 1987188 - 1993/94.
2/ JPS' assets are revalued every year as follows: the foreign component
is revalued on the basis of the Handy Whitman indices for tIhe South
Atlantic region of the U.S.A. and the local component is revalued on
the basis of the Jamaican consumer price index published by the
Department. of Statistics of the Jamacan Government.

income tax before 1986/87, but from this year on an income tax would be
levied on the company's income.3
Fundins                        I
3.       In 1981-1982 the gross internal funding of JPS was not sufficient
to cover its debt service requirements and, consequently, its net internal
funding was negative. During those two years JPS had to rely heavily on
borrowings for the financing of its investment program, and its working
capital was substantially eroded. In 1983-1986187, the improving
operational results generated sufficient funds to make a positive and
increasing net internal contribution to the funding mix. This trend is
expected to continue until 1989190 when it will be reversed as the
investment program grows and new borrowings, to cover the foreign exchange
component of investment, will start having an increasing share in JPS'
funding mix. The debt service coverage which became greater than 1.0 in
1983 is also in a positive trend and expected to reach a maximum of 2.3
times in 1989/90 and to decrease from then on when the debt service
payments would increase.
Capital Structure
4.       The capital structure of JPS has been strong, as the debtlequity
ratio has moved from 34166 in 1981 to 37163 in 1986187. The capital
structure is expected to remain satisfactory until 1993194 when it vould
reach 48/52. Notwithstanding the good operational results, during each
projection year the expected rate of return would be lower than the
expected average interest rate, resulting in a return on equity (after
income tax) lower than the rate of return (see Annex 2.6.4).
Working Capital
5.       The financial management of JPS has improved substantially its
collection process as accounts receivable have been reduced from about 90
days in 1981 to 59 in 1986187. For the projection period, it has been
assumed that a level of 67 days of accounts receivable would be maintained.
During the 1982-1983 period, the erosion of JPS' working capital resulted
in an increasing delay in the payment period (from 45 d4ys in 1981 to 63 in
1986187). With the new financial conditions the payment period is expected
not to exceed 30 days for fuel and 60 days for other suppliers. JPS has
overcome its past liquidity problems as its current ratio improved from 0.5
times in 1982 to 0.7 in 1986/87. This improvement in liquidity has been
reflected in ending its rel'ance on demand loans and overdrafts and in
acctumzlating cash balances which are expected to increase until 1990/91 and
remain substantial until the end of the projection period (19 1/94).
Plant Replacement
6.       The excess of installed capacity of the JPS system has meant that
3/ The income tax paid by JPS is calculated on the basis of the Jamaican
corporate tax law.  The income tax levied is 33X of taxable income,
i.e. income excluding interest during construction.

the investment program will be relatively modest, and during the first
three years of the projection it will be slightly higher than the annual
depreciation allowance. The accumulated depreciation as a percentage of
gross plant in service Is expected to increase substantially (from 47 2S in
1981 to 59.1Z in 1993194) showing the aging of JPS' installations which
anticipates a need for increased investments after the end of the
projection period at which time JPS' cash balances, or its capacity for
indebtedness, will have to be fully used.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
1.      'While in the Third Power Project the rehabilitation of the
generating units was the major project component, the proposed Fourth Power
Project focuses on the expansion and upgrading of transmission lines,
substations and distribution network, and its primary aim is to improve the
system's operating efficiency. The project also includes consulting
services for engineering as well as for continuation of managerial
assistance and training.
Ob ectives
2.       The main objectives of the project are:
(i) . to increase and improve the utilization of the existing generating
capacity by expanding and upgrading the transmission and
distribution network;
(ii)   to connect about 30,000 new customers by 1990; and to reduce
system losses and improve-pourr supply reliability;
(iii)   to improve managerial and engineering capabilities through
technical assistance and training, as well as through
implementation of adequate staff compensation polices; and
(iv)   to prepare future power projects including detailed design and
bidding documents for new generating units.
Description
3.       The Fourth Power Project would include:
(a)   Transmission lines
(i)   Construction of about 51 circuit-kilometers of a new 138 kV
transmission line between Bellevue and Duncans in order to connect
the load centers on the northern coast where most of Jamaican
tourist facilities are located;

(ii) rehabilitation of about 70 circuit-kilometers of existing 69 kV
transmission lines where large sections are now in a stage of
disrepair resulting from 25 years of use. It includes replacement
of wooden poles, insulators and cables for the line sections
between:
- Tredegar and Bellevue,
- Bellevue and Upper-Lower White River, and

TRAINING COMPONENT
I.  BackRround
1.      The supervision of the Third Power Project and the findings of the
appraisal mission show that:
(a) In order to maintain and improve the system's efficiency now being
achieved through the implementation of the components included in
Loan 2188-JM (rehabilitation of JPS power plants) and the proposed
loan (rehabilitation of transmission and distribution systems)
intensive training and development programs in these areas sbould
be carried out;
(b) JPS suffers from shortage of specialized staff at both the
professional and operaticnal levels;
(c) the high turnover ratio of qualified personnel (about 20Z) must be
substantially reduced as these staff cannot be replaced in the
short time required for normal system operation. The turnover of
professional staff is due to better salaries and career
opportunities offered to them outside the country or Jamaican
companies, especially other public utilities (e.g.
telecommunications, petroleum);
(d) none of the personnel trained abroad under the Third Power Project
has left the company. It is still too early to evaluate such
program as there is a potential risk of them leaving JPS in spite
of binding contracts now being implemented. The company faces
serious staff compensation problem at management, supervisory and
technical levels as compared to other Jamaican public utilities.
This is a basic ceuse for turnover and a constraint for personnel
development programs;
(e) for some years to come the company will continue to depend on
external consultants and training abroad for studies and services
both technical and managerial. Considering the efforts already
made during previous years, the company plans to reduce its
training programs abroad and to increase its local training
programs; and
(f) the operational improvements achieved due to technical assistance
programs carried out by in-line consultants must continue under a
progressive transfer o' responsibilities to local staff which
-requires - the corresponding training for their new work
assignments.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Solution
1.      A review of JPS transmission system was carried out by Montreal
Engineering Company, Ltd. in the context of the Least-Cost Expansion Study
financed by the Bank. The methodology, assumptions, and conclusions of the
study have been found satisfactory to the Bank. The selection of the
proposed configuration for the 138 kV Bellevue-Duncans 1 transmission line
(voltage level, structures, conductor size, span lengths and routing) was
based on economic comparison with other possible configurations.  JPS
selected the alternative with the lowest present worth value (least-cost
solution). Furthermore, Bellevue and Duncans substation designs (power
transformer capacities and lay-outs) have been established to mindmize
investment and operational costs over the facilities useful life, taking
due consideration both to substation load requirements and to applicable
technical standards currently being used by JPS. The selection of the
proposed facilities and their configurations are adequate.
2.       The proposed upgrading of the existing Tredegar-Bellevue,
Bellevue-White River, and Walks Road-Old Harbour 69 kV transmission lines,
as vall as the implementation of the 24 kV distribution program, the
installation of 33 MVAR capacitators, and distribution extensions, have
been designed on the basis of the 1986187-1992/93 load forecast, and the
measures required to reduce system losses. The objectives of these
programs are to supply electricity services to some 30,000 new customers
during the above period and to improve the system's efficiency and quality
of service through rehabilitation and expansion of the existing system.
There were few alternatives for the distribution expansion, other than
considering conductor and transformer sizing. Primary circuits were
opti4ized to minimize total investment and operating costs of the system.
Together with other billing enforcement measures technical loss reductions
are estimated to save the equivalent of 89,000 barrels of imported
petroleum by 1989/90 (39.6 Gwh).
Economic Benefits and Costs
3.       The benefits to consumers associated to the proposed project
cannot be segregated from those corresponding to JPS overall investment
program.  In these circumstances, a time-slice' of JPS' investment program
covering the period 1987/88-1990/91 was analyzed.  This is an atypical
investment period, since investments in generation are planned to be held
at a minimum, with net cap'city additions consisting only of mini-hydro
-             plants under construction by PCJ. A discussion of the implications of the
-  analysis is given below.
11 The proposed transmission line is an expansion of the existing 69 kV
link connecting the major generating plants near Kingston with the
-      -          North coast. Its voltage level at 138 kV is in accordance with future
requirements of load flows Into the Montego BOy area.

ANNEX 3.3
Page 2 of 3
4.       The economic benefits to be derived from the proposed investment
program were related to: (i) incremental sales for the period; and (ii)
fuel savings resulting from reduction in transmission and distribution
losses. The incremental sales during the period are projected to result
from the implementation of the program and were valued at the expected
average tariff for the projection period, as a minimum measure of
consumer's willingness to pay.
5.       The economic costs of the program include capital investments in
generation (including the costs of mini-hydro plants to be commissioned)
transmission, distribution, and other investments (specialized vehicles,
communication equipment, training and consulting services) and costs of
fuel, operation and maintenance associated to the capital investments.
Costs and fuel savings from reduction in system losses streams were
expressed at border prices at the 1987 rate of exchange, which is deemed to
adequately reflect the market value of foreign exchange in Jamaica (Annex
3.3.1).
6.       It is anticipated that by the end of the implementation period,
system losses will have declined from the 19Z to 15% of net generation.
This improvement is expected to result from a combination of technical
improvements in the transmission and distribution system as well as from
the enforcement of procedures designed to reduce unauthorized use of
electricity through illegal connections. The planned reduction in system
losses would be reflected in lower generation requirements to meet the
forecast loads during the period.
7.       Improvements in the efficiency of JPS generating plants resulting
from investments made prior to 1987/88, are expected to reduce fuel
requirements from 12,830 Btu/kWh in 1985 to 12,280 Btu/kWh in 1989/90.
Projected fuel costs are based on net thermal generation requirements at
the projected system loss rates, and on the expected neat rates. Unit fuel
costs are CIF Kingston.
Rate of Return
8.       The resulting rate of return (the rate equalizing the benefits and
costs streams over the period of analysis) is 10% which is equal to the
opportunity cost of capital assumed for Jamaica. '.he foregoing revenue
based measure of the economic internal rate of return is more a measure of
the adequacy of tariffs than of the true economic merit of the investment
program which includes the proposed project. In this regard the average
electricity tariff in Jamaica is expected to be at an adequate level for
supporting the incremental costs of the program.
9.       The above rate of return does not fully measure some of the
benefits conferred by the project, particularly those associated with the
increase in system reliabi'lity that is expected to result from the
implementation of the program. In this sense, the calculated rate of
return is deemed to be a minimum measure of the program benefits. As
Indicated above, however, the investment period is atypical since part of
its associated benefits are the result of investments in generation made
before 1986. Thus the adequacy of current tariffs would have to be

reassessed In the light of the larger generation investment programs
recommended by the Least-Cost Study for bVplementation in the 1990..
10.     Standard tests were performed to check the sensitivity of the rate
of return to changes in key parameters. The results shown below confirm
the robustiousness of the program's worth:
