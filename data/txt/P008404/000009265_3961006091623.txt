MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDJENT
OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA
FOR A EIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.           The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Estonia of (US$12.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The loan would be at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate with a maturity of fifteen years, including a five year grace period. The
Project would help to maintain Estonia's highway network during its transition to a market economy.
Eccnomic Overview
2.           In the past three years since Independence, Estonia, a country of 1.6 million people with
per capita income of US$2,750 in 1992, has made enormous strides in the transformation from a centrally
planned to an independent market oriented economy. Its small economy with few natural resources has
been severely distorted by a half a century of central planning and heavy dependence on the former Soviet
Union (FSU), which accounted for about 90% of its trade. To overcome major structural problems of
the economy, far-reaching econornic reforms have been introduced. After initial and expected difficulties
experienced in 1991 and 1992 which led to high inflation and sharp contraction of real GDP, Estonia's
reform has already begun to show major improvements. The economic decline appears to have been
halted in 1993, and GDP is expected to reach a positive growth rate of about 5-6% in 1994. The annual
inflation rate was substantially curbed to about 36% during 1993, while unemployment was kept below
5% of the labor force. The currency introduced in mid-1992, the kroon, has remained convertible, while
foreign exchange reserves have more than tripled. A major transformation was accomplished in foreign
trade, with an export increase of 30% in 1993, while the share of foreign trade with FSU countries fell
to about 32%. Estonia still faces, however. a difficult reform agenda to complete the transition process
to a sustainable and growing market-based economy. It will be particularly important for the Government
to stimulate the development process by completing the transition in a manner that will make the country
even more attractive to both local and foreign investors.
3.           The Bank's overall objective is to support Estonia's efforts to accelerate structural reforms
and to undertake efficient investments in high priority sectors. This objective will be pursued through
a combination of lending operations, analytical sector work, and aid coordination. It is now appropriate
for the Bank to support Estonia' transport infrastructure, since the economy is at a stage in the transition
process where substantial public investments may be required to overcome the backlog of deferred
maintenance and to reorient the infrastructure sector to meet new demands of production and trade.
Analytical work as well as lending operations would assist the Government in formulating and
implementing a sound public investment program and in coordinating assistance from other sources.
Transport sector infrastructure and privatization will remain priority areas.
Sector Background and Constraints
4.           Estonia's transport infrastructure is basically adequate, with a combination of roads, rail,
airfields, gas pipelines, ports and ferries to Helsinki and Stockholm. After independence in 1991, the
country moved quickly to establish a Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) with
responsibility for transport policy and administration. Its role is to promote efficient transport and set



- 2 -
development objectives and directions for the sector, but to refrain from becoming involved in the day-to-
day operation of transport enterprises.
5.           The Estonian Road Administration (ERA), a separate agency operating under the general
policy guidance of the MTC, is responsible for the 15,000 km national road network. ERA is a
competent organization, with qualified engineers and managers who have made good use of the resouirces
at their disposal. However, ERA's equipment and materials sources had been restricted to Eastern
Europe in the past, and much of its equipment is old and technically obsolete. Also, techniques for
making decisions based on cost effectiveness are not well developed, and the private contracting industry
is just beginning to evolve.
6.           Under the Govemrnent's program to restrict credit expansion in order to slow the rate
of inflation, budget allocations for the maintenance of the public road network have been severely
curtailed. ERA has responded to this reduction by virtually eliminating new construction, converting
gravel to bitumen surfaces, and reducing surface overlays, while maintaining the maximum amount of
surface dressings that the budget would allow. While this strategy has made the best use of available
resources, the reduction in overlays has now reached the point where major deterioration is imminent
on some roads. If allowed to progress, this deterioration would lead to much higher costs of road
rehabilitation and reconstruction in the future.
Goverment and Bank Strategivi
7.           The MTC and ERA are aware of the adverse consequences of operating under continuing
budget constraints, and are seeking external financing in order to expand ERA's program of surface
dressings and overlays until such time as the Government's regular sources of revenue are increased
enough to meet this requirement.
8.           Rationale for Bank involvement. Estonia being a new member, an interim Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed when the first Bank supported Rehabilitation Loan (3522-EE)
was presented in October 1992. This project, aimed at supporting critical infrastructure, strengthening
the private construction industry, and assisting the Government to coordinate assistance from other donors
for highway maintenance, is consistent with the broad strategies outlined in the CAS.
Project Objectives
9.           The project's objectives are to assist ERA to: (i) expand its program of periodic
maintenance during the next two years; (ii}) mprove its efficiency through introduction of cost-benefit
analysis and new research into its maintenance techniques; and (iii) promote the development of a
competitive private industry for both road maintenance and construction.
Project lDescription
10.          A Highway Maintenance Loan of US$12 million, plus US$2 million in grant-financed
technical assistance from Finland, Denmark and Sweden, would help to finance an expanded program
of road maintenance. It would be combined with US$11.0 million of the Government's own financing
to cover a total project cost of US$25.0 million to carry out the following program:



- 3 -
(a)    Periodic Road Maintenance. Surface dressing of about 2700 km and surface overlays of
about 200 km of roads over a two year period. About 70 percent of the overlays,
representing about 32 percent of the cost of this component, would be contracted out on
a competitive basis.
(b)    Technical Services. This component would include: (i) research to determine the most
cost effective materials and pavement structures to be used in the maintenance program;
(ii) training for private road construction industry personnel in contracting procedures,
business administration and project management; (ii) introducing of a Pavement
Management System (PMS) to assure the optimal selection and timing of pavement
treatments; (iv) a study to classify all public and private roads and to determine the most
appropriate institutions, public or private, to be responsible for their maintenance at an
appropriate service level; (v) assistance in developing financing mechanisms for ERA;
(vi) developing of a Road Safety Plan; and (vii) training for ERA personnel ia cost
accounting, cost-benefit analysis and procurement; (viii) assistance in detailed design of
project components and in work supervision.
11.          World Bank financing would be appiied to: (i) the procurement of imported materials
for the pavement treatment program (bitumen, aggregate), (ii) financing for eighty percent of the costs
of civil works contracts for overlays, and (iii) the equipment and supplies needed for the research
program and the PMS. The Finnish National Road Administration has committed one third of the funds
required for the Finnish part of the consultant services and training, and Finland is presently in the
process of securing the required balance. Denmark and Sweden have indicated their agreement in
principle to provide financing on a grant basis for the consultant services and training, and their approval
is expected by the end of April, 1994. Project costs and financing arrangements are summarized in
schedule A. Procurement and disbursement arrangements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of IBRD operations are given in Schedules C and D respectively.
Proiect Implementation
12.          The project would be implemented by ERA. A Project Manager has been appointed to
liaise with Bank staff and the other external financiers supporting the project. He would also be
responsible for assuring that the various ERA offices are familiar with operating procedures and
procurement guidelines applicable to the project. The surface dressing component, along with about 30
percent of the overlay work, would be carried out by ERA's present workforce. ERA would contract
for all materials, including those to be provided to the contractors who would bid competitively for the
remaining overlay work.
13.          In order to begin project implementation during the 1994 construction season, preliminary
work to prepare bidding documents for road maintenance activities has begun, with assistance provided
by Finland. Retroactive financing of up to US$1.2 million (10 percent of the Bank loan) would be
permitted in order to cover the cost of early procurement of stone aggregate and equipment needed for
the research program.
14.          Level of Government Financing for Road Maintenance. It is the Government's stated
intention over the longer run to levy road user charges at a level adequate to maintain the road network.



- 4 -
in 1991 it established a Road Fund and enacted a petrol tax to finance the Fund as a basis of financing
ERA's maintenance activities. However, the rapid inflation during 1992 eroded the real value of the
income to the Road Fund, which only covered seven percent of ERA's budget in 1993. The petrol tax
was raised recently, and is expected to generate 73 percent of ERA's budget in 1994. The Government
olaiis to use the three year project period to generate addition ' internal financing to meet the need for
maintenance thereafter.
15.          Privatization. Prior to the separation from the Soviet Union in 1991, all of ERA's
operations were carried out with irs own personnel. Under the present Government policy to privatize
substantial parts of its operations, four construction units that previously functioned as part of ERA have
been set up as separate operating companies, although one of them has subsequently been liquidated. The
two companies still owned by the Government are expected to be privatized during 1994. The expanded
use of private contractors for road maintenance under the proposed project would provide ERA with
valuable experience in the use of contracted services, in addition to strengthening the incipient private
road construction industry. At the same time, the Road Network Study would provide the basis for ERA
to consider how it should be structured and relate to the private sector in the future.
Environmental Aspects
16.          The periodic maintenance operations included in the project are not expected to generate
any significant environmental problems since work would be done on existing roadways using mainly
imported aggregate. Therefore, this project bas been designated at B level, where a more limited
environmental analysis is appropriate. A limited environmental review was carried out by a consultant
during project preparation, and it confirmed that the work included in the Project would not create any
significant negative environmental impact. ERA plans to install efficient dust filters and emission control
systems for two asphalt plants to be renovated for use in the project to meet the emission standards
established by Estonia's environmental regulations.
Lessons from Previous Bank Lending
17.          Experience with the one previous lending operation to Estonia has been satisfactory.
Loan processing and implementation were handled expeditiously with some assistance from Finland, and
the loan proceeds have been utilized on schedule. The Finnish consultant who assisted the Government
with procurement under the previous loan is now advising ERA on Bank procurement procedures. The
project took into account experience from a Bank study regarding improved road management methods,
contracting of maintenance activities and reallocation of resources to reduce the maintenance backlog.
Benefits and Risks
18.          The principal benefits would be: (i) reduced vehicle operating costs and avoidance of
costly road rehabilitation; (ii) improved efficiency of ERA's maintenance operations; (iii) promotion and
development of a competitive private sector road construction industry, and (iv) improved road safety.
The Economic Rate of Return for the periodic maintenance component, which represents 90 percent of
total project costs, is estimated at 26 percent.
19.          The two major risks to the project are the availability of local financing and possible
delays caused by the inexperience of ERA and the local construction industry with the Bank's
procurement guidelines and the use of competitive biddirg procedures. Regarding the first point, the



Government could face shortfalls in revenues, or unexpectedly high rates of inflation which would reduce
the real budget below planned levels. However, Government economic performance to date provides a
basis for optimism that this is not likely to be the case, and assurances were obtained that all necessary
steps would be taken to maintain ERA's budget at the 1993 levels in real terms.
20.          Regarding competitive bidding procedures, guidance is already being provided to ERA
by Bank procurement specialists so that the bidding process gets off to a good start. Familiarization
sessions will also be organized for local construction industry personnel.
Project Sustainability
21.          The Government should be able to attain its objective of providing an adequate level of
resources through the Road Fund and users fees as the economy expands and the tax base increases. This
would assure the sustainability of periodic maintenance of the highway network. The efficiency
improvements expected from the other project components are likely to have a sustained impact on ERA's
future operations because ERA is a well-established, stable organization that can be expected to absorb
the improved systems into its permanent operating procedures. Also, the experience gained by the private
road construction industry is likely to have a lasting impact if ERA continues to utilize private companies
for carrying out a significant and increasing portion of its highway maintenanee program.
Agred Action
22.          Agreement was reached that during the Project implementation period, the Government
will take all necessary measures to make budgetary resources available to ERA yearly at a level, in real
terms, not less than the budgetary resources that were available to ERA in its 1993 budget year. Also,
agreement was reached that ERA would make available to all potential bidders a list of equipment
available for rent, with such equipment available to all bidders at the same cost and payment terms.
Recommendation
23.          1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
