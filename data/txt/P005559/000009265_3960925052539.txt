PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1975-SYR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second
Education Project in Syria, for which a Loan (No. 1975-SYR) of US$15.6
million was approved and signed on January 13, 1982.   The World Bank
suspended disbursements against all loans to Syria on June 26, 1986. No
disbursements were made by the Bank and the Loan was cancelled effective
June 30, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by a consultant to the Population and Human
Resources Operations Division of Country Department III (EM3).  No field
trip was undertaken and no progress reports were received from the Borrower
since the suspension of disbursements: it is not known, therefore, whether
any of the project institutions are now operational. The PCR is based on a
desk review of material in the Bank's files relating to this project, and
interviews with Bank staff who have been involved in the project.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies for comment in
August 1989. No comments were received.

PROJECT COKPLETION REPORT
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1975-SYR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction:  The project was the second Bank operation in support of Syria's
education/training sector. It was prepared following a Bank identification
mission in March 1979 and a Bank preparation assistance mission in July 1979,
appraised in February 1980, and presented to the Board on 23 April 1981.
Total project cost was estimated at US$48.1 million, with US$15.59 million to
be financed by the Bank loan, US$2.70million by UNDP, and the remainder by the
Government (para. 3.08). The loan, effective on 6 July 1982, was extended
twice, from 31 December 1986 to 30 June 1988. Disbursements against loans to
Syria were suspended on 26 June 1986. No disbursements were made, except for
the accrual of commitment fees, and the loan was cancelled on 30 June 1988.
Objectives and Content of the Project: The project objectives (para. 2.04) were
to assist the Government to alleviate acute shortages of skilled workers and
of technicians. Innovative aspects of the project were support of basic
health services for school children and of an educational materials production
capability. Provisions were made for technical assistance, construction,
equipment, and furniture for educational institutes and training centers for
four ministries: Public Works (MOPW), Higher Education (MOHE), Health
(MOB), and Education (MOE) (para. 2.05).
Implementation Experiene : The State Planning Commission (SPC) coordinated
the Loan.   The staff of the four implementing ministries were competent,
trained by the project in International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures,
stable and strongly committed to the project. Progress reporting became
regular and useful. Construction , financed by the Government, was given a
high priority despite a lack of foreign exchange to import materials (para.
3.05). Equipment lists were drafted under the UNDP-funded TA program, but
drafting of equipment bidding documents was delayed three years because of
some misunderstandings about the ICB process (para. 3.06).   The technical
assistance (TA) program was funded by UNDP, administered by the Bank and
successfully implemented by SODETEG and the British Council (para. 3.07).
Results and impact:  Construction was 80% complete in December 1987.
Equipment implementation, resumed late in 1985, was interrupted when the Bank
had to suspend disbursements to Syria and no equipment could be purchased
under the loan. Implementing ministries made efforts to acquire substitute
equipment to complete the training program. TA was satisfactorily completed
early in February (SODETEG) and July (British Council) 1985, but, through no
fault of the consultants, without equipment.   Out-of-phase implementation of
TA, civil works and equipment has limited project impact, which can only be



- v -
assessed when the status of the project institutions is known (para. 4.01).
The Government determination to complete the civil works program confirms
Syria's commitment to the project's objectives and indicates that its design
as appraised is still timely (para. 4.01).   Sound project design and
competent borrower management should have produced a successful project, but
misunderstanding about the ICB process and the Borrower's financial
difficulties led to equipment procurement delays and loan cancellation (para.
3.10).
World Bank. UNDP and Government Cooperation: Multiplicity of agencies was an
appraisal issue which was alleviated by the efficient role of the SPC as
project coordinating unit, by the UNDP/Bank cooperation in financing and
executing the TA program, by the Bank's close concertation with che four
implementing ministries, and by the stability of the Borrower's management
units.
Findns and Lessons:  (i)  Placing TA under a single executive agency, which
successfully expedited TA implementation for the benefit of four ministries
under the apolitical tutelage of the United Nations' flag, is a replicable
concept (para.3.07); (ii) stability of management staff of four ministries,
which contributed to timely TA implementation and the signing of several
equipment contracts, despite the problems with the ICB procedures, is an
exemple for other borrowers (para. 3.06); (iii) Arabic-speaking Bank staff
should be assigned to missions in Syria to smooth collaboration with Borrower
(para. 3.06); (iv) overseas trainees should have the necessary language
skills (para. 3.01); (v) training of project staff in ICB procurement is
useful, but at least one set of representative bidding documents should be
cleared by the Bank before Board presentation in order to circumvent possible
future deadlocks (para. 3.06); (vi) allowing a Borrower to finance l0OX of
the civil works is a risky strategy because a foreign exchange shortage could
cut off key materials and position civil works out-of-phase on the
implementation schedule (para.3.05); and (vii) decentralized management of
dispersed construction sites should be foreseen (para. 3.05).

SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1975-SYR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Project was the second to assist the Government of Syria in
implementing programs consistent with its development strategy and its
educational/training objectives. It was innovative because it addressed the
health of rural children, as well as training needs in the construction and
agricultural sectors. The Bank had to suspend disbursements to Syria before
the project could be fully implemented, but the Government of Syria
demonstrated its commitment to the project, and has continued its own efforts
to achieve the project's objectives.
1.02      The Bank had agreed to two extensions of the closing date to meet
delays due to difficulties with the ICB process which was eventually
overcome. The last supervision mission to Syria (10/86) had estimated that
the loan could be disbursed by 30 June 1988, the extended closing date. The
suspension of disbursements, however, occurred on 26 June 1986, six months
before the original closing date and two years before the extended closing
date. The TA program, financed by the UNDP with the Bank as executing agency,
was satisfactorily implemented. Civil works, financed by the Government, were
substantially completed, but out-of-phase with TA. No disbursements could be
made on equipment, although several contracts had been signed and cleared by
the Bank before the extended closing date.
1.03     Sound project design, strong Borrower commitment, and competent and
stable project management staff of four ministries should have resulted in a
successful project, but implementation was delayed by equipment procu:ement
difficulties and disbursement was susperied because the Borrower lagged in
paying its debts.
1.04     After a brief description of the project as conceived and as
implemented, the PCR examines the project experience and its probable impact.

tl. THE PROJECT
A. Baekgound
2.01     Bank Strategy and Lending for Education, The First Education Project
financed by the Bank, approved in FY78 for US$20 million (Loan 1480-SYR), had
been designed to:  (a) improve the quality and relevance of education through
improved teacher training facilities and the development of practical
curricula; (b) contribute to the alleviation of skilled manpower shortages
of craftsmen and technicians, improving and diversifying training programs and
introducing new specializations required for the development of Syrian
industry; and (c) assist institution building through the introduction of
school mapping antd the establishment of a mechanism to coordinate
vocational/technical education and training activities.
2.02     Scope of the Second Education Project.  A detailed analysis of the
sector had been provided by a reconnaissance-in-depth report (14 April 1976).
The Second Education Project was formulated after a reconnaissance mission
(06/78) which contributed additional data on health and agriculture to
sectoral knowledge. The objectives of the Second Education Project were:
(a) to assist in meeting the need for trained manpower in the construction,
agriculture and health sectors; (b) to assist in implementing a program of
preventive medicine, and (c) to improve the quality of primary and secondary
educatiun through assisting in the establishment of an educational material
development and production center.
B. Project Status
2.03      The Loan was approved on 23 April 1981 and the Loan Agreement was
signed on 13 January 1982. Disbursements to Syria were suspended (06/86) two
years before the Loan's extended closing date: TA was implemented, but ICB
contracts for the equipment could not be procured under the Loan. The
Government's continued commitment to project objectives, eight years after
negotiations, is demonstrated by its financing and substantial completion of
the project's civil works. It is not known to what extent the Government is
financing equipment for these institutions. The full impact of the project,
which may remain unfinished, is thus unknown.
C. Project Description
2.04     R.oject Objectives.  (i) for the Ministry of Public Works (MOPW):
expand vocational training to meet the severe shortage of craftsmen in the
construction sector and improve opportunities for self-employment; (ii) for
the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE): assist in providing more effective
practically-oriented training of agricultural technicians, with particular
reference to training for such new specializations as food processing, home
economics, and diversified animal and food production and protection; (iii)
for the Ministry of Health (MOH): expand health technician education; and
(iv) for the Ministry of Education (MOE): I - School Health Centers (SHC):
assist in the program of preventive medicine by providing basic health
services for school children, including dental education, nutrition education
and training hygiene ; and II - Educational Materials Development and
Production Center (EMDPC): improve the quality of education through the
provision of an educational materials production center to develop simple
science and handicrafts materials and curriculum-oriented audiovisual software.



2.05     Content of the Project. The project consisted of two parts:  Part A.
Educational Institutes and Centers: the construction, furnishing and
equipping: (1) by MOPW, of two vocational training centers (VTC's), one in
Damascus and one in Aleppo; (2) by MOHE, of additional classrooms, workshops
and laboratories to the three IAI's in Damascus, Aleppo and Lattakia; (3) by
MOH, of two Health Technician Institutes (HTI's), one in Homs and one in
Deirez-Zor; and (4) by MOE, of 55 SHC's, and an EMDPC in Damascus. Part B.
Technical Assistance (TA); Training; Study:   The provision of TA and training
for (1) project implementation and training in the management of education
projects for Project Implementation key staff in MOE, MOH, MOHE, and MOPW; and
(2) a pre-investment study related to the establishment, within MORE, of a
higher institute for administrative science. Specifically, the project was
intended to comprise:

(b)  TA (including training and study):  (i) related to the above project
components, 190 man-months (mm) of specialists' services and 373 mm
of fellowships; (ii) for project management support, 24 mm of
fellowships; (iii) for a pre-investment study for a Higher Institute for
administrative Science,18 mm of specialists' services.
2.06     Project Modifications.   Minor modifications were made since appraisal
to the MOPW component (a speciality was introduced into the training
curriculum) and to the MOH component (midwifery was replaced by physiotherapy,
and emphasis was shifted from curriculum development to training).
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Training and Educational Aspects
3.01     For MOPW:
Implementation: 85 man-months (mm) were provided (8 specialists), against 99
mm as appraised, and 42 mm of fellowships, against 39 mm. Interim equipment
was acquired by MOPW so that all courses were implemented in conformity with
the requirements set in the learning materials being pilot-tested. More than
190 trainees (237 mm) were trained on the basis of new curricula and learning
materials prepared under the project.



-4-
Results: (i) Curricula, based on 125 modules, were completed for 11 trades,
and 902 translated into Arabic : thermics (central heating and air
conditioning), plumbing/sanitation, electrical, metal works (iron and
alum-inum), joinery, masonry, steel fixing, casing fitting, finishing, tiling,
and painting;  (ii)   A core group of Syrian teachers and administrators were
trained (in Syria and France) in modular training design and implementation,
in curriculum development, in instructor training, in visual aids, and in
vocational training system management;   (iii)  Learning materials were
prepared and training courses organized for utilization of these materials
(one audio-visual aids production center and three technical reference
libraries were established); and (iv) Equipment lists were prepared for two
VTC's.
Outcome:   Satisfactory implementation by SODETEG and correct coordination
of TA, of civil works and of (substitute) equipment has created favorable
conditions for achieving this component's objectives. Details were given for
the further development of a modularized vocational training system. The
consultants recommand minimum language skills for trainees.
3.02     For MOHE:
Implementation: 18.5 mm of expertise were provided (5 consultants), against
36 mm as appraised, and 36 mm of fellowships (12 staff), against 36 mm.
Results: (i) Existing syllabi were revised and a program for extension
skills was incorporated into Animal and Production courses, curricula for new
specializations (home economics, nutrition and food processing) were
prepared; (ii) Staff training, in Syria and in the UK, was designed to
upgrade teaching methodology and practical training skills, and covered animal
and plant production, food processing, home economics, and tobacco production;
and (iii) Equipment lists were prepared for three IAI's.
Outcome: Implementation by the British Council was satisfactory, but TA and
civil works could not be coordinated. Equipment was not procured. Lack of
equipment necessary to follow-up training may have prejudiced the outcome.
3.03     For MOH:
Implementation: 5 m of expertise were provided (4 consultants), against
35mm as appraised, and 110 mm of fellowships (18 fellows), against 98 mm.
There were problems in identifying suitable candidates for fellowships, and in
obtaining timely release of prospective candidates, which led to a small
shortfall in training undertaken, and training opportunities in water usage
and equipment maintenance were not taken up.
Results: (1) Modern instructional methodology and new medical techniques
for specializations, such as laboratory technology, physiotherapy, radiology,
and hygiene and sanitation, were introduced, and detailed practical courses in
laboratories, hospitals and other medical institutions were prepared; (ii) A
practical training program was given at the Damascus HTI, covering management,
water usage and treatment, laboratory technology, equipment maintenance, and
technical teaching and practical skills training; (iii) A program was given
in the UK for 18 fellows, which included upgrading of teaching skills,
familiarization in paramedical training systems and training in equipment
maintenance; and (iv) Equipment lists were prepared for two HTI's.



- 5 -
Outcome: Implementation by the British Council was satisfactory, but delays
in equipment procurement justified postponement of part of the TA program
(including equipment commissioning and maintenance) which would have to be
completed to achieve the component's objective. The current, amended,
curriculum will provide a sound basis for teaching at the Institutes.
3.04     And for MOE:
Implementation: I - EMDPC: 10 mm of expertise were providea 4
consultants), against 19 mm as appraised, and of 53 mm of fellowships (16
fellows), against 93 mm; and [I - SHC: 1 mm of expertise was provided (2
consultants), as appraised, and 60 mm of fellowships (13), against 107 mm as
appraised. Four factors contributed to the changes made to the number, length
and type of tLaining undertaken: need for training in English, reduction of
long term professional training in favor of short familiarization training in
School Health practices, emphasis on training for paramedicals rather than for
doctors or dentists, and difficulty in identifying and releasing suitable
personnel.
Results: I - EMDPC: (I) Plans were produced covering organisation,
decision-making, structures, training programs, and products to be made and a
program for further staff development was outlined; (ii) Training in the UK
covered management, educational design, glass and plastics production, video
production, technical skills in photography, graphics, printing, and studio
plus audio engineering and workshop management, and also English; (iii) Two
multi-media kits were produced ("Introduction to Electricity" and "How lungs
work"); (iv) In-country training was conducted in design production testing
and evaluation of aids; and (v) Building plans were reviewed and equipment
lists were prepared. II - SHC: (i) The Consultant on School Health Services,
working closely with his counterpart, the Director of School Health Services,
prepared demographic and medical data, TOR's for the School Health Centers,
specific health program objectives, and outlines for in-service training
programs; (ii) A model computerized School Health Data System was prepared
and staff trained to implement it; (iii) Fellows were trained in the UK,
USA, Canada, and Finland in Health planning and management; and (iv)
Equipment lists were prepared.
Outcome: Although satisfactory, the performance of the British Council is
expected to have a stronger impact on SHC than on EMDPC because of the better
timing of the construction of the former sub-component. I - EMDPC: Buildings
were completed, but not equipped, 18 months after the departure of the
consultants. Returned trainees have worked effectively as a team, but it is
questionable that acquired skills could be retained until the EMDPC is
correctly equipped and becomes operational. The consultants point out that
this component's impact on the quality of education depends not only on the
establishment of the EMDPC, but also on the proper integration of its activity
with the educational system.  II - SHC:   Health data prepared has been
effectively used by MOE, the development of the SHC's have been officially
coordinated with MOH, and MOE has proceeded with a pilot computerization of
statistics for part of Damascus. The Health Planning Officer was involved in
the MOE/MOH coordination process, the Dental Hygienists are teaching at the
Demonstration Training and Research Center in Damascus, trained staff are
working on the model computer project, and the Communicable Diseases doctor is
in charge of some of the SHC programs. The training has contributed to the
build-up of the core of experienced and committed staff working on the



project. United Nations agencies, such as WHO a.xd UNICEF, are assisting the
SHC's. This innovative component is contributing to the development of the
School Health Services because of MOE/MOH commitment, clear objectives and
cooperation with the international agencies. It will have a beneficial impact
on children throughout Syria.
B. PhYsieal Aspects and Procurement
3.05     Shortages of foreign exchange for imported materials financed by the
Borrower and decentralization of management were causes of delays in
construction for two of the four ministries (see Annex I).   Two of the three
MOHE IAI's were completed a year and a half behind schedule. The MOE program
suffered important delays because of site management decentralization: the 55
SHC's, dispersed throughout the country, were two years behind schedule, and
the EMDPC, hampered by lack of imported reinforcing steel, started three years
late, and was unfinished when the loan was closed. Because of the
interruption in equipment procurement none of the construction delays
threatened to be a critical constraint to project implementation, except for
the EMDPC, but the workshops were scheduled for completion in December 1986,
before the expected delivery of equipment. The construction program of MOPW
was on schedule and that of MOH, despite distant sites, was reported completed
ahead of the appraisal schedule (Spring of 1986).   Because of lagging
construction only MOPW was able to deploy its TA on the sites of its
institutions. Construction was 80% complete in December 1987, and the
Borrower continued to finance it after the suspension of disbursements by the
Bank.
3.06     Equipment procurement was up to three years behind schedule.
Equipment lists had been well prepared under TA, and key project staff,
trained in ICB procedures under the UNDP-funded TA program, proved competent
and stable. Typical bidding documents, however, had not been cleared with the
Bank as part of the project preparation process. Misunderstandings concerning
ICB procedures took root at levels beyond the influence of project staff.
Overcoming these obstacles was a sensitive and time-consuming task. Mission
staff reviewed bieding documents, article by article, with the four
implementing ministries. As the normal language of these meetings was Arabic
it would have been expedient to have mission staff trained in Arabic. An
opportunity to break the deadlock finally occurred when the Bank cleared
(10/84) equipment bidding documents prepared for an agriculture project under
a single ministry (LN 2124-SYR). Following the visit of a Bank Senior
Procurement Officer and the intervention of the office of the Prime Minister,
the SPC and the staff of the four implementing ministries worked closely with
a Bank supervision mission (09/85). The result was a set of four bidding
documents, adapted from the agricultural project model, which were immediately
cleared by the Bank. All ministries then proceeded without delay with ICB.
Bid evaluation reports, and eventually contracts, were submitted to the Bank
and cleared in 1987 for an initial amount of US$4.25 (Annex II) on the
assumption that procurement would resume. The last Bank supervision mission to
Syria (October 1986) estimated that the loan could be disbursed by 30 June
1988, the extended closing date, and the project fully implemented by the end
of 1988.   However, no disbursements could be made because loan disbursements
to Syria, suspended in June 1986, were not resumed and the loan was closed two
years later. Had there not been delays in the procurement process,
disbursement on equipment would have been completed before the original
closing date,



3.07     The technical assistance (TA) program funded by UNDP and administered
by the Bank, was completed within the budget and time period foreseen, as
reported by the Bank in its Terminal Report (18 March1986). Fellowship
participants had resumed their work with increased skills, motivation and
morale. Effective TA implementation, however, was hampered where construction
was out of phase and by the lack of project-financed equipment.   It was
agreed by the UNDP Resident Representative and by the Bank during the last
Review (February 1986), at Borrower's request, that savings of US$100,000
could be applied to provide 12mm of fellowships and 7mm of expert services,
mostly for installati-.n, commissioning and maintenance of equipment. A full
assessment of the UNDP TA project impact will be possible only when all
institutions are operational.
C. Project Cost, Financing and Loan Disbursements
3.08     Proiect Cost:  The project was estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$48.1 million, of which US$29.2 million were foreign cost. The loan of US$
15.6 million (32.42 of the total project cost) was to cover the foreign
exchange content of the equipment cost, estimated at 90%.
3.09     Financing:  UNDP was to contribute US$2.7 million (US$ 0.9 million
for fellowships and US$1.8 million for experts) representing the foreign
exchange component of the cost of TA. The balance of the project cost,
including the foreign exchange component of the civil works, was to be
financed by the Borrower. The Government preferred to seek bilateral
assistance for the pre-investment study which was not implemented.
3.10     Loan Disbursements:  US$2.3 million were disbursed on the TA budget
(Annex III). The US$0.4 million shortfall was due in part to the savings
resulting from the rising value of the dollar against the French Franc and the
Pound ^Z*rling (equivalent to US$60,000 for the SODETEG sub-contract and
US$190,000 for the British Council sub-contract). The British Council's final
report recommended follow-on TA (approximately US$100,000, from the amount
saved) as requested by the Government, to be implemented when equipment had
been delivered and new curricula were in place. The amount was retained in the
UNDP 1987 budget but no further action was taken after the Bank suspended
disbursements to Syria. Suspension of the project's loan disbursements
occurred (06/86) six months before the original closing date and two years
before the extended closing date.   By the time the Bank cancelled the loan
(06/88), equipment contracts for an equivalent of US$ 4.2 million had been
cleared by the Bank, but no disbursement could be made on the loan.
Commitment charges accrued between 1982 and 1988 amount to US$758,000, of
which an amount of US$493,000, corresponding to the period 1982-1986, was paid
by the Government of Syria.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
4.01     Project Impact.  In the absence of recent information the project's
impact must be estimated from the status of the project institutions at the
time of the last Bank mission (10/86) and compared to project objectives
(para. 2.02). The Government's commitment to the project's objectives,
however, has been demonstrated by its determination to proceed with the civil
works program it financed out of its own budget. In 1985 MOPW wa- equipping
its VTC training programs with equipment it had acquired. The impact of these
centers will depend on MOPW staff maintaining, as they were trained under the
project, a balance between curricula and manpower needs. Project manpower
objectives should have been met. Effective operation of the five institutes
sponsored by MOH and MOHE is conditional upon the availability of imported
scientific equipment which could not be financed by the Loan . It is,
therefore, doubtful that these institutions have met their appraisal
objectives.   When equipment is delivered to the institutes training courses
will no longer be in memory and in-country training will be necessary.
Incidentally, fostering both tobacco production (MOHE) and radiology training
(MOH) seems an incongruous strategy. The impact of MOE's EMDPC is most
doubtful: its construction was seen by the last supervision mission to be
lagging, with an effort being made to complete in priority the warehouse to
receive equipment which, in the end, was not procured under the Loan.
However, MOE's 55 SHC's were built in December 1985 and should be staffed now
with health technicians trained under the project. This is the most
innovative component of the project and one likely to have a major impact,
even if not fully equipped, because the presence of motivated health
technicians trained under the project should currently be promoting preventive
medecine, including dental and nutrition education, among rural school
children.
4.02     World Bank. UNDP and Government Cooperation in the Project.  Salient
and positive factors were (1) Continued Government support of the project
objectives; (2) Effective role of the SPC as a loan coordinating agency;
(3) Professional competency and stability of the trained key project staff
assigned by the four ministries concerned; and (4) Successful role of the
Bank as executing agency of a UNDP-financed TA program, completed in a timely
fashion by SODETEG and the British Council. The final outcome of the loan
must be a strong disappointment to Syrian managers, Bank operations staff, the
UNDP mission, and the consultants.
4.03     Bank Performance.  The Bank had made a detailed analysis of the
sector and, as early as July 1978, a Project Brief had identified the
p^^ject's contents. The minor modifications and the continued commitment of
the Government for the Project objectives vouch for the soundness of the
project design. Appraisal proceeded satisfactorily and Board approval was on
schedule. However, failure to provide for Bank clearance of typical bidding
documents during preparation proved to be a critical omission.   During
supervision, with three missions annually during the critical years, the Bank
deployed the required professional skills to monitor a project which addressed
several sectors (page v).   Bank supervision staff, working closely with the
SPC and four implementing ministries, eventually opened the way to Bank
clearance of the bidding documents.   Regular reports from the Bank to the
UNDP recorded the successful progress of the TA component.   It should be
noted that the Syrians' courtesy facilitated the work of non-Arabic speaking



- 9 -
Bank staff, but it would be considerate, and more efficient, for the Bank to
assign some Arabic-speaking professionals to future operations in Syria.
4.04     Lessons Learned.   The implementation strategy addressed squarely
the issue of "multiplicity of executing agencies" raised in the Issues Paper
(03/80): the SPC assumed the role of coordinating agency, and the competent
key s'3ff of four ministries received specific training in management and
procurement under the project. Project experience demonstrated that they were
effective in fulfilling their tasks. Project coordination was further
facilitated by both the ability of the Borrower to maintain stable management
teams, and by the decision to place the UNDP-financed technical assistance and
training program under a single executing agency, the World Bank. The success
of this program indicates that the decision was a good one. However,
communication difficulties indicate that Arabic-speaking staff would
facilitate Bank work in Syria and that Syrians bound for overseas training
should have the necessary language competency.
4.05     Misunderstanding of ICB procedures by the Borrower resulted in a
failure to procure. The problem was situated at a level above project staff
and required high management intervention by both the Bank (visit by a Senior
Procurement officer) and by the Government (Office of the Prime Minister)
before the deadlock could be broken. Thereafter, all four ministries were
free to expedite bidding, bid evaluation and contract signing.   This lesson
reaffirms the wisdom of clearing at least one set of representative bidding
documents before Board presentation.
4.06     Another question raised by the Issues Paper was the financing of the
foreign exchange component of civil works. The Government's preference to
assume this responsibility led to major delays in the purchase of imported
construction materials for some components (EMDPC and IAI). Scheduled
equipment deliveries, unfortunately, did not take place, but TA was
out-of-phase with civil works. This lesson points out the risk of potentially
critical delays when a Borrower finances the foreign exchange component of
civil works. The challenge of managing many small and widely dispersed
construction sites (MOE's SHCs) points out, as in other similar projects, the
need to prepare for decentralization of such critical activities and to train
regional managers.
4.07     Looking back to 1979 when the project was being prepared it is
difficult to reassess what Bank and Borrower could have done to insure a safe
outcome for the project - either in content design or in implementation
strategy. Unfortunately, the foresight of the project's designers, the
commitment of the Government, the competence of the key staff of MOPW, MOH,
MOHE, and MOE, the professional contribution of the British Council and
SODETEG had no bearing on the final issue which deprived the project of
equipment, and the fate of the loan was finally sealed by the Borrower's
persistent financial difficulties.
