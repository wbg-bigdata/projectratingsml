I. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Economic Background
1.01      The dual thrust of Syria's current (1976-80) development strategies
emphasize agricultural development and expansion and modernization of the
industrial sector with special emphasis on industries linked to agriculture
and other domestic raw materials. Actual implementation of the plan's finan-
cial expenditures showed only small increases in total outlays in 1977 and
1978 and fell far below the budgeted allocation.  One of the major implementa-
tion bottlenecks has been an acute shortage of managerial and skilled technical
manpower. The sectoral employment structure has significantly changed since
1970.  The agricultural sector, which accounted for 48% of the total employ-
ment in 1970, decreased to 34% in 1978 though it still remains the largest
employer of labor. Syria has a relatively low unemployment rate (below 5%
since 1971), due to the level of industrial growth and also because of the
continuing emigration of Syrian manpower to the more lucrative employment
opportunities in the Persian Gulf countries. The government has been restrict-
ing emigration of certain types of professional and skilled workers to cope
with the shortage of skilled manpower and, at the same time, is emphasizing
the expansion of vocational/technical education and training. The Syrian
labor force is characterized by a relatively low level of education.
In 1976, nearly 56% of the employed manpower in the government and public
sector were in the category of "primary and below primary level." Of these,
nearly 15% were completely "illiterate" and about 28% were just "literate--
able to read and write."
Sector Background
1.02      Education plays a significant role in the economic and social
development of Syria. Progress in the overall development of the education
system has been remarkable, especially over the past decade, as a result of
the effort made by the government and the high level of demand for education.
Participation of the primary, preparatory, and secondary age groups has
increased from 71%, 41% and 21%, respectively, in 1970, to 89%, 63% and 30% in
1979. Female participation rates, as a percentage of total enrollments, at
41%, 44% and 35%, respectively, are among the highest in the Middle East.
Enrollments in the secondary technical schools increased 128% between 1970 and
1978 and now represent 13% of total secondary enrollments. At the same time,
university enrollments increased from 36,800 in 1970 to 85,000 in 1978 (18%
girls), representing 13% of the age group. Governmaent efforts to divert
higher education students into technician training programs has resulted in an
increase in those enrolled in such programs from 7,700 in 1974 to 20,000 in
1978.
1.03      The Ministry of Education (MOE) and Ministry of Higher Education
(MOHE) have the responsibility for formal education and training. The MOE
is responsible for primary, preparatory, general and technical education and
primary teacher training. The MORE presides over the Council of Higher
Education which includes the rectors of the universities and is responsible
for establishing general policy guidelines, ensuring coordination among the



- 2 -
three universities and the Higher Institute of Technology and determining each
year the number of students to be admitted to the different faculties at each
university. A number of other ministries, in particular Agriculture, Culture,
Health, Industry, Labor, Petroleum, Public Works, and Social Affairs, are
active in training related to their special fields.
Sector Strategy
1.04      The government's development strategy in education, as outlined
in the current (1976-80) Development Plan and which is likely to be pursued
in the forthcoming (1981-85) Plan, is directed towards promoting equity,
quality and relevance of education, while pursuing a better adaptation of the
system to the manpower training needs of the economy. Accordingly, the
government's educational strategy emphasizes: (a) universal enrollment of the
6-11 age group by 1986, progressing to a nine-year basic education cycle by
1991; (b) intensification of its literacy campaign to achieve its goal of
reaching all of the estimated 42% of its population considered illiterate by
1991; (c) maintenance of current output of primary teachers while increasing
the proportion of female teachers and upgrading the level of teacher quali-
fication and training; (d) redressing the imbalance between supply and demand
of skilled and semi-skilled manpower by increasing the number of intermediate
industrial institutes, increasing the enrollments in secondary technical
schools to 25% of secondary enrollments by 1991 and expanding vocational
training, while establishing a national entity to coordinate and supervise all
aspects of vocational/technical training; (e) meeting the imbalance in the
supply of agriculture and health technicians by expanding the enrollment
capacity in agriculture and health intermediate institutes while providing the
facilities and equipment to improve the quality of the training; (f) stabiliz-
ing university enrollments at a targetted 120,000 students by 1986 by limiting
the progression of students into general secondary schools and expanding tech-
nical education, and increasing the proportion of students in the faculties of
science, maths and technology; and (g) providing preventive health and dental
services including immunization programs for school children as well as more
systematic health and nutrition education for students, teachers and parents.
Issues and Problems
1.05      The commendable progress towards generalizing primary education
has been accompanied by measures to address problems of quality. A well-
balanced curriculum has recently been introduced. In addition, the develop-
ment of a regional network of primary teacher training institutes (TTIs),
supported under the first project, should ensure that shortages of quali-
fied teachers in disadvantaged areas will be overcome. Furthermore, the
virtual absence of educational materials and equipment, essential to the
successful implementation of the new curriculum and more relevant teacher
training, is being tackled through the establishment of an Educational
Materials Development and Production Center (EMDPC). Despite these measures,
however, quality will continue to be affected adversely by the unsuitability
of the majority of school buildings; over 40% were not built as schools and
about half of all primary schools are rented. The deficiencies are most
severe in the poorest regions where problems also persist in primary school

participation. Participation in primary education in the four most dis-
advantaged regions varies from 66% to 77%, against the national average of
89%. The disparities become more marked when differentiated by sex and
between rural and urban areas. The government has introduced compulsory
primary education in 6 of 14 regions but faces socio-economic as well as
financial problems in extending such provision, particularly to girls, in the
more remote rural areas.  The emphasis placed on increasing the role of women
in teaching (67% of all new trainees in 1978 were women) should help in
overcoming one major obstacle to the participation of girls in rural areas.
Further improvement in quality is dependent, however, on the implementation of
a planned major school building program.  Because of capital constraints only
limited funds have been made available for this purpose and the government is
unwilling to accept external financing for school buildings except on soft
terms. The construction of 50 primary schools in disadvantaged areas was
omitted from the first education project at the request of the government and
is now being financed with bilateral assistance.
1.06      As a result of the government's literacy program initiated in 1972,
and the increased participation in formal schooling, the adult literacy level
has improved from 48% in 1970 to 58% in 1979. Striking disparities exist by
region, with 50-70% literacy in the more developed regions and only 25% in
some remote rural areas. A recent study under the Unesco cooperative program
has identified weaknesses in the current program, in particular, limitations
in scope and duration of training, severe shortages of trained instructors and
lack of suitable support materials; as a result, wastage has been high. In
addition, while a Supreme Literacy Board was established in 1975 to oversee
the program, a coordinated effort to solve the problem as a national issue is
lacking. Recent progress, however, has been encouraging, with enrollments up
from about 12,000 in 1974 to 36,000 in 1978 and wastage down from 64% to 48%.
In view of the estimated target group of about 2,000,000 illiterates, more
concerted efforts will be necessary if the government target date for the
elimination of illiteracy is to be achieved. The above-mentioned study is
expected to provide a basis for the future development of the literacy
program.
1.07      In secondary education, the problems of unsuitable and rented
accommodations--30% of upper secondary school buildings are rented--are
compounded by the absence of needed practical spaces. Schools suffer from
overcrowding, virtually no science laboratories, libraries or practical
working areas and a reduction in hours of instruction to accommodate double
shifts. The planned expansion in practical activities at the lower secondary
level, for which teachers are being trained with support under the first
education project, will have only limited application until such time as
workshops and laboratories are provided. Little effective progress has been
made towards achieving a better balanced secondary school curriculum. Quality
at the secondary level suffers still further from a severe shortage of quali-
fied teachers--only 6% of science teachers and 9% of maths teachers are
qualified to teach those subjects. To meet expansion needs, the government
has had recourse to a large number of part-time teachers or has employed
teachers on overtime. The government has also tried, unsuccessfully, to
attract an adequate supply of teachers by various incentive measures, includ-
ing increased salary, shorter teaching periods and removal of all extracurri-
cular responsibilities from qualified teachers. An additional measure



- 4 -
previously considered but not yet implemented, because of a perceived diffi-
culty in recruiting trainees, was the establishing of a two-year post-secondary
intermediate institute to train maths and science teachers and a cadre of
teachers specifically for the lower secondary level. In view of the serious-
ness of the situation, establishment of such an institute should be given
further consideration.
1.08      At the higher education level, the government has been concerned
at the rapLU growth in enrollments.  One of the adverse effects has been
the expending of an undue proportion of the educational capital budget on
higher education (para. 1.13), despite the urgent need for extensive capital
investment at the lower levels. At the same time, an inordinate burden has
been placed on universities, already constrained by a shortage of suitable
teaching facilities and instructional equipment as well as a critical shortage
of teachers. The measures being taken by the government to divert students
into alternative avenues of education and training should prove helpful over
time in restraining university growth. They are unlikely to provide a suffi-
cient brake, however, unless complemented by limits to growth by faculty, in
particular for those faculties having limited promise for the employment of
their graduates.
1.09      Preliminary results of a study by an ILO expert indicate severe short-
ages of skilled and semi-skilled workers for the construction and industrial
sectors. It has been estimated that a need exists to train 7,000 such workers
annually for the construction industry as against the current output of about
1,400 annually. Training is at present given in nine regional centers of the
Ministry of Public Works (MOPW), housed temporarily in unsuitable buildings.
Quality suffers further from out-of-date training methods and inadequately
trained staff. Immediate plans are to expand output to about 2,500 annually
by 1983 and to improve the quality of training, with a further expansion to
4,400 annually by 1986. The output of skilled workers for the industrial
sector is being increased with support under the first education project and
through bilateral assistance programs but will require further expansion when
more definite needs are determined under the current study.
1.10      The most serious deficiencies in the training of skilled personnel
for the agricultural sector are qualitative rather than quantitative. The
proposed increase in the annual output of agricultural technicians from 400 to
600, with support under the present project, should meet the needs for such
technicians while also introducing required new specializations and improving
the quality of training.  It is essential, however, that the intake into
degree-level programs be controlled. Apart from the projected oversupply of
agronomists, the faculty staffing capability does not exist to provide quality
education or to develop a research capability while coping with the pace of
expansion in enrollments. Most critically, until such time as the present
poor quality and orientation of education and training are appropriately
improved, measures to develop an effective planning and management capability
in the agricultural sector, as well as to develop an effective extension
service, will have limited success. As a corollary, such measures need to
include a far greater degree of decentralization of trained staff, requiring



incentives--housing and supplementary allowances--combined with minimum
service requirements as a condition of location in the main cities, to ensure
adequate staffing, with agronomists and technicians, of regional and field
offices.
1.11      The health sector is characterized by a severe shortage of paramedi-
cal personnel, technicians and nurses, an uneven distribution of medical
facilities, and a curative orientation to health care. The development of
a school health service, for which support is proposed under the present
project, is clearly a major step in the development of preventive medicine.
In addition, the proposed doubling in the output of health technicians to 270
annually in the eastern and central regions would meet almost all of the needs
for health technicians in those regions. The health technician institute
(HTI) in Damascus is also being developed with bilateral assistance to serve
the health technician needs of the southern region. The difficulties of
recruitment into nursing, particularly of women, in view of cultural and
social attitudes towards nursing, may prove to be a further constraint in
meeting staffing needs for nurses in rural areas, and would need to be further
addressed by the government.
1.12      There is still a need to improve management efficiency in the
civil service and in the public enterprises, even though efforts have been
made by the Management and Productivity Center and the Planning Institute
for Economic and Social Development. The goveriment has, therefore, decided
to establish a Higher Institute for Administrative Sciences under the jurisdic-
tion of the MOHE to provide pre-service and in-service training for the bulk
of the civil service staff. The measures being taken to redress what is
clearly a critical problem for Syria can only be partially successful, however,
unless they form part of a comprehensive politically-backed strategy, to
include more effective incentives and career structures, and ministerial
support for necessary reforms.
Educational Finance
1.13      Total public education expenditures (recurrent and capital), as
a percentage of total government expenditures, varied in range from 8.8% to
10.3% during 1974-78, while education expenditures as a percentage of GDP
increased from 3.0% in 1974 to 4.4% in 1978, indicating a modest increase in
the allocation of resources to the education sector despite slower growth in
GDP. Because of rapid growth in university enrollments, higher education
accounted for a very high 67% of the capital budget for education but a more
*       reasonable 27% of recurrent expenditures. While this skewed capital provision
would be expected to reverse itself during the 1980s, future capital alloca-
tions by level have not yet been determined. Based on projected enrollment
increases, recurrent expenditures are estimated to increase at an annual rate
of 9.5% and capital expenditures at an annual rate of 6.0% during 1979-86. On
the above basis, total expenditures on education would represent about 5.5% of
the projected GDP and 10.1% of the government budget in 1986. The government
can be expected to sustain this level of expenditure in view of the high
priority attached to education.

Bank Strategy and Lending for Education
1.14      The Bank's support for education in Syria has been consistent with
the government's educational objectives and priorities. The first Bank-
assisted education project (Loan 1480-SYR approved in FY78 for US$20 million)
was designed to: (a) improve the quality and relevance of education through
improved teacher training facilities and the development of practical curricula;
(b) contribute to the alleviation of skilled manpower shortages of craftsmen
and technicians, improving and diversifying training programs and introducing
new specializations required for the development of Syrian industry; and
(c) assist institution building through the introduction of school mapping and
the establishment of a mechanism to coordinate vocational/technical education
and training activities. Implementation of this project is proceeding
satisfactorily and is expected to be completed as scheduled.
1.15      The proposed second education project (a Bank loan for US$15.6 mil-
lion) would assist the government in meeting shortages of craftsmen for the
construction sector and of technicians, with reference to the needs of the
agricultural and health sectors, while also providing support in the develop-
ment of a system of preventive medicine aimed at school children. The project
would also provide support in improving the quality of education through
arrangements to develop an educational materials production capability.
1.16      Future lending in the education sector will be determined through a
dialogue with the government. Such dialogue will focus on determining approp-
riate Bank assistance in the formal school system at both primary and secondary
levels; nonformal education and training; farmer training and the extension
service; overcoming critical skill shortages in a variety of sectors; and
management and administrative training.
II. THE PROJECT
Introduction
2.01      The proposed project was prepared by the government following a Bank
project identification mission in February/March 1979 and a subsequent Bank
preparation assistance mission in June/July 1979.  The project was appraised
by Messrs. M.H. You (economist, mission leader), J. Crosnier (rural development
specialist), H. Go (architect), D. Petry (technical educator), B. Gagne
(general educator, consultant) and J. Burton (health educator, consultant)
in January/February 1980.
Objectives and Scope
2.02      The proposed project, which would assist the government in implement-
ing programs fully consistent with its educational and health sector develop-
ment strategy (para. 1.04), would have the following main objectives:
(a) expand vocational training to meet the severe shortage of craftsmen for
the construction sector as well as to improve opportunities for self-employment;



- 7 -
(b) assist in providing more effective practically-oriented training of
agricultural technicians, with particular reference to training for such new
specializations as food processing, home economics, and diversified animal and
food production and protection; (c) expand health technician education and
assist in the program of preventive medicine by providing basic health services
for school children, including dental education, nutrition education and train-
ing in hygiene; and (d) improve the quality of education through the provision
of an educational materials production center to develop simple science and
handicrafts materials and curriculum-oriented audiovisual software.
2.03      The project would include the provision of:
(a) construction/extension, equipment and furniture for:

2.04      This project item would address skill shortages in the construction
industry as well as deficiencies in the quality of training. Two purpose-
built and equipped buildings would replace inadequate rented or temporary
buildings at two regional training centers, under the MOPW, in Damascus and
Aleppo. Overall capacity would be increased from 400 to 1,020 and annual
output from full-time courses would amount to about 1,600 (800 from each
center), meeting about 23% of estimated needs.
2.05      Full-time training would vary from 5-9 months, depending on the
specialization, in the electrical, mechanical and construction trades.
Entrance requirements for the full-time training programs would be a minimum
age of 18 and completion of primary education; in addition, admission to
training would be extended, as a matter of policy, to those attaining basic
literacy and numeracy outside the formal education system.  Full-time courses
would have 42 periods per week of which 30 periods would be devoted to
practical training.  Curricula for existing specializations needs to be
updated and curricula for three new specializations (electrical installation,
plumbing and sanitary trades, and heating and air-conditioning) will be
prepared and practical training adapted to the modular form with technical
assistance (para. 2.07). In addition, each center would provide part-time
nonformal late afternoon and evening courses of varying durations for
apprenticeship training, skill upgrading and artisans in-service training
related to construction trades.
2.06      About 50 additional teachers will be required--38 for practical
subjects and the equivalent of 12 full-time teachers for theoretical subjects.
The latter will be recruited from the 750 who graduate annually from the
intermediate technical institutes (two years post-secondary) of the MOPW. The
practical subject teachers will be recruited from among experienced technical
secondary school graduates, those with long practical experience after gradua-
tion from a VTC, and intermediate technical institute graduates. No difficulty
in instructor recruitment is foreseen as these recruitment sources are adequate
and the salary scales and working conditions are quite favorable.
2.07      Ninety-nine man-months of specialists' services (7 experts) would be
provided to: (a) introduce three new training specializations (54 man-months);
(b) plan and introduce an appropriate modular training system and initiate
instructor training programs (20 man-months); (c) update and adapt the exist-
ing courses and instructional materials to a modular-based system (12 man-
months); (d) improve audiovisual systems (12 man-months); and (e) prepare
equipment specifications for international competitive bidding (1 man-month).
In addition, 39 man-months of fellowships would be provided to train 13 staff
in curriculum development, instructor training and audiovisual aids.
Intermediate Agricultural Institutes (IAIs)
2.08      The primary objective of the proposed project would be to meet the
shortage of qualified technicians required by the agricultural extension and
research, agro-industries, regional administration, and farmer association



services currently under expansion. The project would provide additional
classrooms, workshops, laboratories and related equipment, and technical
assistance for improving and expanding training at the three IAIs (grades 13
to 14) of Damascus, Aleppo and Lattakia. The three IAIs placed under the
MOHE would have under the planned expansion a combined enrollment of 1,550, of
which 30% would be women, mainly in home economics (100%) and food technology
(50%), and an annual output of about 600 meeting the estimated annual demand.
No difficulty is anticipated in acquiring applicants for the courses as over
2,000 sLudents applied for about 1,000 available places in 1979.
2.09      The program, uniform in all institutes (except for a tobacco special-
ization in the Lattakia IAI), would include second-year specializations in
crop production (250 students), animal production (150), food technology (150)
and home economics (150). The introduction of the two latter specializations
reflects the growing recognition of the needs in these fields and the participa-
tion of women in the extension and agricultural support services. Training
would extend over two years of study, with theory (40%), practice (45%), and
on-the-job internships (15%). The three institutes would have attached farms
of sufficient size to provide the necessary practical field experience for
students. The sites and sizes of the farms are satisfactory. In addition
to regular programs, in-service training would be provided to former IAI
graduates, particularly the assistant engineers employed in agricultural
projects, extension services and cooperatives, through short-term ad hoc
courses. Each IAI is expected to enroll about 25 trainees in the in-service
training program at any given time. Detailed curricula for existing and new
specializations, satisfactory to the Bank, have been developed and more
detailed equipment lists are being prepared by qualified specialists.
2.10      No difficulty is expected in recruiting the approximately 40 in-
structors required for each new specialization from among the adequate exist-
ing supply of university graduates in agriculture, science and engineering.
However, under the proposed technical assistance, 36 man-months of specialist
services (6 experts) would be provided to help the initial development of new
specializations in food technology and home economics and to improve planning,
extension and nutrition. About 36 man-months of short-term fellowships would
also be provided to upgrade the pedagogical ability of 12 existing teaching
staff, i.e. to use audiovisual aids and liaise theory and practice for each
specialization.
Health Technician Institutes (HTIs)
2.11      To assist in meeting the shortage of health technicians in the
central and eastern regions of the country and to improve the quality of
training, the project would construct, furnish and equip two new HTIs at Homs
and Deir-ez-Zor. They would replace two grossly inadequate and ill-equipped
temporary buildings. Total enrollments of the two HTIs would be increased
from 300 to 600 (50% women) and the anticipated output of 270 would meet
almost all of the estimated demand for health technicians in those regions.
Capacity would be expanded, if required, at a later date.



- 10 -
2.12      Five specializations would be offered, with students equally dis-
tributed in pathology, pharmacology, radiology, physiotherapy and sanitation.
The program of studies, extending over two years post-secondary, would include
hospital and field work and emphasize practical activities (40-60%) in the
above-mentioned subjects. Curricula for the five specializations have been
prepared and would be reviewed by experts to be provided under the project.
More detailed equipment lists are being prepared and should be available by
June 1981 for review by the Bank. Employment for health technicians is
guaranteed by obligatory service in the Ministry of Health (MOH) or other
ministry, for four years following graduation. The MOH is expected to employ
about 65%, the Ministry of Defense 25% and the private sector about 10% of the
graduates.
2.13      Approximately 42 instructors and teachers would be required for full
operation of the two HTIs. They would be recruited from graduates of HTI
courses and from medical and science faculties. The recruitment of full-time
qualified senior staff is expected to be difficult in the short term owing to
the location, uncompetitive salaries and limited career prospects. In the
medium term, as the available supply of doctors increases, this problem is
expected to ease. In the early development stage, the HTIs will supplement
the limited full-time staff by using qualified local medical doctors and other
experienced local health specialists as part-time staff.
2.14      To assist the two HTIs in the detailed development and application
of the specializations, upgrading staff quality and improving management,
the proposed technical assistance component would provide: (a) 35 man-months
for nine experts (5 man-months in five specializations, 18 man-months in water/
sanitation training, 6 man-months in curriculum development, and 6 man-months
in procurement and management); and (b) 98 man-months of fellowships for 26
senior instructors to study abroad (49 man-months for each HTI).
School Health Centers (SHCs)
2.15      The proposed component has as its basic objective the development
of preventive medicine through the provision of: (a) basic health and dental
care for school children; and (b) health and nutrition education to students,
parents and teachers. Towards achieving these objectives, it would help
restructure and expand an ongoing school health program serving about 800,000
children and staffed by 62 physicians, 22 dentists and 110 nurses, under
competent leadership provided by the MOE's Director of the School Health
Department. At present the program is operating through 160 school health
units, in each case using a school classroom without the benefit of health or
dental equipment. Under the project, 55 SHCs would be constructed, furnished
and equipped, each SHC supervising and assisting 4 to 5 health units and
serving between 20,000 to 25,000 children (grades 1 to 12). The 55 SHCs, with
approximately 260 health units under them (including the existing 160), would
thus reach about 1,230,000 children or about 58% of the country's school
children.



- 11 -
2.16      Each SHC would have one or two physicians and one or two nurses;
in addition, one dentist would serve two SHCs. Each health unit would have
one nurse. In all cases except dentistry, which requires a fully equipped
center, the school health staff would carry out the following activities,
either in the  SHC or in the school health unit: (a) examine regularly
children for general health and dental status and record progress; (b) refer
defects of sight and hearing to specialists and advise teachers and parents;
(c) immunize any children requiring it; (d) inspect school hygiene including
food and water and report to the regional education director; and (e) super-
vise the quality of the school feeding program. In addition, the SHC staff
will conduct short courses in health and nutrition in their own local setting
for pupils, teachers, and parents. The school health program will be coor-
dinated with the general public health activities of the MOH's regional
offices but responsibility for its planning, development and operation rests
with the MOE's Department of School Health.
2.17      Locations for the 55 new SHCs have already been selected on the basis
of the current and projected enrollment distribution. A list of standardized
equipment has been prepared. Temporary accommodation in school premises has
been designated and brought into operation from early 1980 onwards (16 SHCs are
already in operation), pending construction of the new centers. The government
has established an evaluation mechanism in the School Health Department, using
key monitoring indicators on the actual health and dental care as well as
health and nutrition education given to pupils, teachers and parents, and the
results of their annual evaluation will be sent to the Bank for information
during the project implementation period and for the two years thereafter.
Based on the successful recruitment to date and the specialized training of
key staff which has already started, no difficulty is anticipated in staffing
the SHCs and health units. To improve the capacity of the SHC staff and the
MOEs School Health Department staff, 107 man-months of fellowships for 15
staff in nursing, health education, health planning, nutrition and dentistry,
would be provided under the proposed technical assistance. One man-month of
specialist services (one expert) would also be provided to assist in the
ongoing reorganization and evaluation of the school health programs.
Educational Materials Development and Production Center (EMDPC)
2.18      This project component has been prepared under the first education
project on the basis of a feasibility study, undertaken with bilateral
assistance. The study identified the need for the Center and recommended the
most appropriate project design, including equipment lists. This component
would comprise construction, furnishing, equipping and technical assistance.
The Center, consisting of two units for projected and non-projected aids,
would: (a) design simple apparatus as well as slides and film strips directly
related to the syllabus and textbooks recently introduced in the primary
schools; (b) produce prototypes of projected and non-projected aids which can
realistically and economically be reproduced in quantity; (c) evaluate the
quality and effectiveness of the prototypes produced by the Center as well as
items commercially available; (d) purchase/assemble raw materials, partly
finished goods, components and specialized items from local and foreign
sources; (e) distribute finished items or kits and replacements when required



- 12 -
by schools; and (f) provide support services in the form of instruction on the
assembly, use and simple maintenance of the aids as well as related hardware
supplied to schools. Prototypes of the projected aids or their components
would be designed and produced in quantity by the Center subject to the
specifications required and cost comparisons with similar items available on
the market.
2.19     In the first phase, the Center would concentrate on the development of
educational materials which are based on the new curriculum for 100 selected
primary schools and 12 primary TTIs in 12 mohafazats, and supply 2,000 kits
(approximately 100 items in each kit) of science and mathematics apparatus
as well as a range of audiovisual aids.   Coverage of the primary level will be
expanded following evaluation of the first phase of operation of the Center. As
the teaching/learning techniques associated with the use of the materials and
aids produced by the Center are a real innovation of vital importance to the
educational system, a program to initiate students in the primary TTIs and
re-train the primary teaching cadre in the new methodology will be introduced in
conjunction with the establishment of the Center. In the subsequent stage, the
Center is also expected to play a significant role in improving the quality of
preparatory and secondary education by providing supportive materials for new
preparatory and secondary curricula being considered.
2.20       The staff required for full operation of the Center would be about
30, including a director, chief of operations for each division (projected and
non-projected aids), 2 scientists, a production manager, 10 specialist tech-
nicians, a writer, a draftsman, a printer and 11 supporting staff. It is
anticipated that about 12 staff would be transferred from the existing Media
Department; no difficulty is anticipated in recruitment of the remaining
staff. The total technical asssistance required is 1 expert for one man-month
to prepare the equipment specifications for ICB, 3 experts for three man-months
each for non-projected aids, and 1 expert for nine man-months for projected
aids to assist in establishing effective production procedures and programs in
the initial months and 14 fellowships for a total of 93 man-months of training
related to specific areas of specialization in the Center. In view of the
importance of close coordination among officials responsible for teacher
training, curriculum development and textbook writing, inspectorate, and
media, the government proposes to establish a policy committee with representa-
tion from the above-mentioned areas to formulate and review on an ongoing
basis the activities of the Center.
Technical Assistance
2.21      Project Related Technical Assistance.  In view of:  (a) the introduc-
tion of new vocational training methodology (para. 2.07) and new specializa-
tions in agricultural (para. 2.10) and health education (para. 2.14) for which
local expertise is not available; and (b) the innovative nature of the SHCs
(para. 2.17) and the EMDPC (para. 2.20), 190 man-months of specialists'
services and 373 man-months of fellowships have been proposed.

2.22      Project Management Support.  To improve project implementation
and management capabilities of key implementation staff in the four ministries
(MOE, MOH, MOHE and MOPW), 24 man-months of fellowships would be provided.
Under the proposed study tour, three key staff (director, engineer/architect,
and procurement officer) from each Ministry would visit selected countries for
two months each to gain insights into the management of education projects
and apply lessons learned elsewhere to the implementation of the project.
2.23      Preinvestment Study.  In addition, the proposed technical assistance
would include 18 man-months of specialists' services for a preinvestment study
related to the proposed Higher Institute of Administrative Sciences (para. 1.12).
The main activities of the Institute under the MOHE are expected to include:
(a) in-service training of public officials; (b) advanced degree programs in
public administration; and (c) research and consultancy services to the public
sector. Three international experts (one each from the above areas for six
months) working closely with local experts would develop proposals for the
training programs and staffing requirements for such an Institute and recommend
the most suitable project design by the end of 1982. The proposals would be
reviewed by the Bank and the government for possible inclusion in a future
project.
2.24      During negotiations, the government requested, and the Bank agreed to
be the executing agency for the technical assistance component that will be
financed by the UNDP.

3.03      Basis of Cost Estimates.  Estimated civil works costs for the pro-
posed project are based on unit prices derived from current contracts and cost
analyses of similar institutions currently being constructed under the first
education project. Furniture and equipment costs are based on current CIF
prices and are adjusted upward to include local transportation and installation.
In line with recent experience, the estimate of technical assistance costs is
based upon: (a) average costs per man-month of about US$8,470 for experts
(consisting of fees and per diem allowances) and about US$2,200 for fellowships,
of which 80% would be foreign costs; and (b) average travel costs to and from
home office or study base abroad of about US$1,100 per individual. Baseline
cost estimates have been adjusted to reflect the prices at negotiations
(February 1981). Project institutions are exempt from import duties and taxes.
3.04      Contingency Allowance.  The project cost includes a contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical additions equal to 10% of the estimated
cost of civil works, furniture and equipment, and 5% of the estimated cost of
technical assistance. The project cost also includes price escalation contin-
gencies calculated for the period beginning at negotiations (February 1981) and
in accordance with an agreed schedule of implementation (Annex 1, Schedule 1).
Annual rates of price increase for various categories of expenditure are
indicated in Annex 1, Table 2.   Prices are expected to increase during the
project implementation period by a total of 30.8% for civil works, 34.8% for



- 16 -
furniture, 34.2% for equipment, 18.5% for technical assistance specialists and
16.9% for fellowships. Accordingly, aggregated price increases are estimated
at about 30.3% of baseline cost plus physical contingencies. Total contingen-
cies are estimated to be about 42.8% of the baseline cost.
3.05      Foreign Exchange Component.  The estimated foreign exchange component
is US$29.2 million equivalent or about 60.8% of the total project cost. The
calculations of the foreign exchange component are based on the assumption
that: (a) all civil works and furniture contracts will be awarded to local
firms; and (b) all equipment will be imported. The resulting foreign exchange
content of each category of expenditure is as follows: (a) civil works, 42%;
(b) furniture, 45%; (c) equipment, 90%; and (d) technical assistance, 80%.
Project Financing
3.06      The proposed loan of US$15.6 million would finance the foreign
exchange costs of equipment, equivalent to 32.4% of the total cost and 53.3%
of the total estimated foreign exchange cost of the project. The government
is currently negotiating with the UNDP to include the technical assistance
component amounting to US$2.7 million, or 9.2% of the estimated foreign
exchange component in the UNDP country program. The government wishes to meet
the costs of civil works and furniture from its own resources. Accordingly,
the local costs of equipment and technical assistance and the total costs for
civil works and furniture, amounting to US$29.8 million, would be financed by
the government. The proposed financing plan is summarized below:

3.07      When fully operational in 1986, the project institutions are estimated
to require LS 41.6 million annually in recurrent costs, corresponding to about
0.2% of the projected public recurrent expenditures on education at that
time. However, as many of the institutions in the project replace existing
ones, the marginal recurrent costs would be about LS 15.4 million or 0.1% of
the total 1986 recurrent costs.
Implementation
3.08      The construction, furnishing and equipping of all schools and the
technical assistance component are scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1986
(Annex 1, Schedule 1). In order to allow sufficient time for submission of
the final withdrawal applications, the Closing Date would be December 31, 1986.
3.09      Administration.  The MOE components would be implemented through an
existing project implementation team, which has been effective in implementing
its components under the first education project, working with the central and
local offices of the School Building Organization (SBO). The MOPW, MOH, and
MOHE have designated existing key staff (a director, an architect/engineer,
a procurement specialist, and an accountant) to be responsible for implementa-
tion of their project components.
3.10      Civil Works.  The central and local building directorates of the MOPW
have the responsibility for the supervision of the physical aspects of the MOPW
project components. It is adequately staffed for the purpose. Designs have
been completed and construction is now underway. The university engineering
departments which are well staffed and experienced in consulting would design
and supervise the physical aspects of the project components of the MOHE and
the MOH. The SBO of the MOE, as in the first project, would have the respon-
sibility for the architectural services for the MOE project components.
Standard construction drawings for the SHCs have already been prepared.
Preliminary drawings for the IAIs, HTIs, and EMDPC, based on educational and
architectural working papers already agreed with the Bank, would be submitted
to the Bank for review and approval by June 1981.
3.11      Sites.  A suitable site for each new project institution has been
acquired and existing institutions have sufficient land to allow for their
expansion. The SHCs will be built adjacent to existing schools with adequate
space on their sites to accommodate the proposed Centers.  All sites have
public utilities (water, electricity and sewerage) readily available. The
cost of land acquisition would be borne by the government and is not included
in the project cost.
3.12      Equipment List.  Equipment lists have been prepared for the VTCs,
EMDPC, and one of the IAIs. More detailed lists for the other components
are being prepared and are expected to be completed by June 1981. Short-term
specialists services would be provided for the preparation of equipment
specifications and bid documents for ICB for the VTCs, HTIs, and EMDPC com-
ponents under the proposed technical assistance.

Procurement
3.13      Civil works and furniture would be procured by the government through
the local construction and furniture manufacturing industries which have the
necessary capabilities. To ensure that agreed design standards are met and to
coordinate procurement of all project elements, the government provided the
following assurances during negotiations: (a) design development drawings,
including laboratory and workshop equipment and furniture layouts, and furni-
ture lists would be acceptable to the Bank; and (b) arrangements for construc-
tion would proceed in accordance with an agreed implementation schedule
under which civil works contracts for the respective project institutions
would have been awarded prior to commencement of bidding for equipment for
that institution.
3.14      Detailed lists and specifications of equipment, to be financed under
the loan, would be presented to the Bank for review and approval prior to
procurement. Equipment (amounting to US$17.4 million including contingencies)
would be grouped to the extent possible in large packages to permit bulk
procurement. Contracts for equipment in excess of US$100,000 would be awarded
on the basis of ICB. Small items or groups of items estimated to cost less
than the above figure, or items of a specialized nature for which ICB would
not be practical and items which must be compatible with other equipment
procured under ICB, would be procured under normal government procedures which
are satisfactory to the Bank and would include, to the extent possible,
quotations from at least three manufacturers or suppliers; these items would
not exceed an aggregate total of US$3.0 million or about 17% of estimated
costs including contingency allowances. In ICB comparisons, local manu-
facturers of equipment would be allowed a margin of preference equal to the
existing rate of customs duties applicable to competing imports or 15% of the
CIF price, whichever is lower. Draft tender and contract documents for
equipment, would, on completion, be forwarded for Bank review and approval;
Bank approval of tender evaluation documents would be required prior to the
award of all contracts for equipment under ICB. Bank reimbursement of all
other contracts would be contingent upon Bank approval of tender evaluation
documents subsequent to contract awards.
Disbursements
3.15      Disbursements (Annex 1, Schedule 3) would be on the basis of:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and
of local expenditures ex-factory for locally manufactured items;
and
(b) 85% of expenditures of imported items procured locally.
These percentages would be adjusted if required to assure continued financing
from the available loan funds of expenditures for each sub-category for the
entire period of implementation.

IV. BENEFITS, RISKS, AND CRITICAL ACTIVITIES
Benefits
4.01      The proposed project would make a valuable contribution towards
expanding and upgrading the quality of training for the construction industry.
The VTCs being supported under the project would meet 23% of estimated annual
needs for craftsmen for the construction sector. Opportunities for such
training would be extended to those attaining basic literacy and numeracy
outside the formal system. For the agricultural sector, technician training
would be expanded to introduce two new specializations, which would increase
the role of women in the extension and agricultural support services and meet
the need for trained personnel in those specializations. The quality of
health care for the less well-off would be expected to show major improvement
with the availability of the necessary output of trained technicians for
health care centers and hospitals in the regions. At the same time, preven-
tive medicine would receive a major impetus through the extensive coverage
of the school health service. Finally, the EMDPC would be expected to play an
important role in improving the quality of education by providing supportive
material for the new curricula, initially at the primary level and subsequently
at the preparatory and secondary levels.
Risks
4.02      Fundamental to the successful implementation of the project is:
(a) the need to appoint the key implementation staff at an early date, and
(b) a government commitment that funds will be allocated and other measures
taken to complete the civil works and furniture procurement in accordance with
an agreed implementation schedule. The key implementation staff were appointed
prior to negotiations while assurances on the latter were given during negotia-
tions.
Critical Activities and Key Implementation Dates
4.03      The critical activities in project implementation and the expected
completion dates are indicated in the following table. Such dates are achiev-
able with the proposed project management arrangements and support, and would
serve as a basis for project implementing and monitoring.
