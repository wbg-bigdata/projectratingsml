SECOND NORTH SUMATRA ESTATES PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a second project for the rehabilitation and
expansion of Government-owned estate groups in Indonesia. An IDA credit of
US$17.0 million is proposed. The estate industry is one of Indonesia's
largest earners of foreign exchange, accounting for some 20% of exports in
terms of value. Since 1940 the industry has suffered severely, as have
most other sectors, from the political instability, corruption and extreme
inflation that have been endemic in Indonesia until recently; and as a
result the contribution of the estates to the economy has declined. In
volumetric terms estates now produce less than 50% of their production in
1938, when they contributed 60% of exports. The fall in production reflects
low productivity as much as a decrease in the area under estates which has
declined by about 25%. The Government which took over in 1966 recognizes
the importance of the estates and in particular their ability to provide
much needed foreign exchange, and is taking measures both to rehabilitate
the estates which it owns, some 606,000 ha, and to create a climate in which
the productivity of some 122,000 ha of foreign owned estates will improve.
ii.       Two Government-owned estate groups in Sumatra, Perusahaan Negara
Perkebunan (PNP) IV and PNP VI, would be rehabilitated and expanded. The
former comprises 18 estates with a total planted area of 29,300 ha of rub-
ber which produced 18,000 tons of rubber in 1969. The latter is a group of
7 estates growing 31,600 ha of oil palms and which in 1969 produced 70,000
tons of palm oil and kernels. The project consists of planting or replant-
ing some 12,000 ha of rubber and 8,000 ha of oil palms; bringing a further
9,800 ha of immature rubber and 7,200 ha of immature oil palms into bear-
ing; rehabilitating more than 19,000 ha of mature rubber, and 28,000 ha of
mature oil palms; and rehabilitating, replacing and expanding processing
facilities, estate transportation, buildings, workshop and agricultural
machinery. The management of the two PNPs would be reorganized and strength-
ened by the employment of advisers and inspectorate services.
iii.      Project costs are estimated at US$31.7 million, of which about
US$17.0 million, or 54% would be the foreign exchange component. Some
US$16.4 million of the proposed IDA credit would be onlent to the two PNPs
together with US$3.0 million of Government funds in the form of loans bear-
ing interest at 12%, the Government's current lending rate to public sector
enterprises. The remainder of the credit would be used by Government to
improve agricultural and research facilities. The balance of project costs
would be met by the PNPs from self-generated funds and by the Government.
All goods to be financed from tne IDA credit would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding.



- ii -
iv.       Most of the rubber and oil palm products produced under the proj-
ect would be exported, although the local demand for palm oil is expected
to increase. At peak production in the early 1980's, net incremental annual
foreign exchange earnings after expenditure on imported goods and services
would reach some US$14.0 million, and incremental reVenues accruing to the
Government (from duties, taxes, and revenues) would reaeh some US$9.0 mil-
lion. The estimated rates of return to the economy from planting and re-
planting rubber and oil palm and carrying out fertilizer investment programs
range from about 12% to 30% at prices projected by the Bank's Economics De-
partment for rubber and oil palm products on world markets.
v.        The project would have similar characteristics to the First North
Sumatra Estates Project which is progressing satisfaetorily.
vi.       The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$17.0 million to
Indonesia.

SECOND NORTH SUMATRA ESTATES PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In June 1969, approval was given for an IDA credit 1/ of US$16.0
million to the Government of Indonesia to help finance the rehabilitation
ana development of two Governiment-owned estate groups in North Sumatra; Per-
usahaan Negara Perkebunan Antan (PNP) V 2/, growing rubber, and PNP VII,
growing oil palm. Fuller details of the First Estates Project are given
in paragraph 2.10.
1.02      The Government of Indonesia applied, in October 1969, for another
IDA credit to finance part of the costs of rehabilitating and developing
two more of the 28 Government-owned estate groups in Indonesia. A Bank
Economic Mission to Indonesia in 1969 supported the priority given by Gov-
ernment to this sector 3/ and in August/September 1969 Mr. Phillips of the
Bank's Resident Staff in Indonesia assisted the Government in preparing a
project for the rehabilitation and development of PNP IV, specializing in
rubber, and PNP VI, specializing in oil palm, both in North Sumatra.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission,
comprising Messrs. Wadsworth, Gold, Harris (FAO) and Bek-Nielson, Leach and
Whiting (Consultants) which visited Indonesia in November/December 1969,
and which was assisted by Mr. Phillips of the Bank's Resident Staff in
Indonesia.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      With its 3,000 islands and a total land surface of 1.9 million
km2, Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago.  Its population is about
118 million and the population growth rate, which is increasing, is at
present 2.4% per annum.
2.02      Indonesia's per capita gross domestic product is about US$80.  The
islands of Java (population, 75 million) and Sumatra (population, 19 million)
are the most important economically, followed by Sulawesi (population 8.5
million) and Kalimantan (population 5 million). The economic development
of the smaller islands is Just starting. Agriculture plays a dominant role

in the Indonesian economy, accounting for nearly h lf of the net domestic
product, employing approximately 70% of the labor force, and contributing
around 75% of merchandise exports. The major export crop is rubber, which
is produced both by estates and smallholders, and which in 1968 accounted
for 27% of exports.
2.03      A war for independence, internal conflicts, nationalization of
most foreign-owned enterprises, corruption, and a severe inflation have
curtailed economic development since World War 11. Agricultural exports
declined in the last decade and food imports increased.
2.04      The present Government took over in 1966 and has already succeeded,
to a large extent, in stabilizing the currency; the rate of ±.flation was
brought down from 85% in 1968 to 9% in 1969. Furthermore, the Government
has given the highest sector priority to agriculture, and particularly to
rice production in view of the major influence that the CU5pp7q of rice has
on internal economic stabilization and the balance of paymen,s of the coun-
try. An IDA credit of US$5.0 million to raise rice production through the
rehabilitation of irrigation works was made in 1969 (Credit No. 127-IND);
the costs of this project have proved to be about three times the estimates
made during appraisal, which was not preceded by a full feasibility study,
on the other hand physical progress is satisfactory and the economic bene-
fits of the project are ample to justify the increased expenditures. After
rice, the Government is giving particular attention to the rehabilitation
of estates, in order to increase foreign exchange earnings. An IDA credit
of US$16.0 million was made in 1969 (Credit No. 155-IND) for the First North
Sumatra Estates Project; progress of this project is described in paras.
2.10 through 2.15.
B. The Estate Industry
2.05      The background of the private and Government-owned estate industry,
which was given in the First North Sumatra Estates Project appraisal report
(Credit No. 155-IND), is detailed in Annex 1.
2.06      Over the last two years Government has taken positive steps to-
wards stabilizing ownership, organization and management in the estate indus-
try. The nationalized, previously Dutch-owned, estates are to remain under
Government ownership and management. Some 90,000 ha of estates have been
returned to their foreign owners -- Goodyear, Uni-Royal (American) and
Harrisons and Crosfield (British) are some of the larger companies involved
-- and are, and will continue to be managed by their owners. One estate
company, SOCFIN (Belgian), has entered into a joint ownership and management
venture with Government for the 30,600 ha of rubber and oil palm which it
previously owned outright.



- 3 -
C. Government-Owned Estate Industry
2.07      In 1969, Government-owned estates comprised a planted area of
605,600 ha including some 224,500 ha of rubber and 80,500 ha of oil palm.
Annex 1 contains further details.
2.08      While there have been improvements during the past three years,
there is a long way to go before pre-war standards can be re-attained and
surpassed. This task would be formidable under any conditions, and while
the economic, fiscal and political climates of Indonesia are improving,
elements remain which constrain progress. Contacts abroad are being in-
creasingly resumed, however, and substantial efforts are being made to up-
grade research and to absorb modern techniques and management know-how.
The Government, however, remains extremely short of cash and the relatively
large investments needed to rehabilitate the industry must, therefore, con-
tinue to come from abroad if the industry is to play its full part in the
economy in the near future. To date, in addition to Credit 155-IND, other
financial assistance received by the Government estate industry has been
an Asian Development Bank credit of US$2.3 million, to rehabilitate some
11,500 ha of oil palms on PNP II, and bi-lateral aid from the Federal Repub-
lic of Germany for the supply of potash fertilizers.
2.09      Each PNP unit has a Board of Directors located on the estates
themselves, though many important powers are reserved to the Minister of
Agriculture; these include appointment of senior staff; approval of budget
estimates and financial statements; approval of main lines of operations;
and powers to give instructions to the Boards concerning the general dis-
charge of their functions. The Minister exercises these powers through
the Directorate General of Estates within the Ministry. These arrangements
were modified at the suggestion of IDA for PNP V and PNP VII, the two units
financed under Credit 155-IND, and at that time it was thought that these
arrangements would serve as a model for a further degree of decentraliza-
tion to be followed by other PNPs at a later date. For the proposed Second
North Sumatra Estates Project a further modification is suggested in the
light of experience gained, see para 5.04. It is anticipated that as both
projects move ahead, they will fully demonstrate the advantages of further
decentralization based on more orthodox commercial principles. The Govern-
ment is committed to placing its estate enterprises on a commercial basis,
and has passed legislation (Government Regulation No. 12 of 1969) enabling
PNP to move a stage further towards commercial autonomy by enabling them,
as appropriate and when commercially viable, to be converted into a differ-
ent type of enterprise - Perseroan Terbatas (PT) (see para 5.07). It is
mandatory for PT to operate under the commercial code of Indonesia.

D.  First North Sumatra Estates Pro4ect
(Credit No. 155-IND)
The Protect
2.10      The project financed by Credit 155-IND is for the renabilitation
and development of estate groups PNP V and PNP VII, growing respectively
rubber and oil palms. Tne project involves planting or replanting 6,550
ha of rubber and 13,670 ha of oil palms; bringing a further 7,070 ha of
immature rubber and 5,750 ha of immature oil palms into bearing, rehabili-
tating 9,660 ha of mature rubber and 23,990 ha of mature oil palms; and
rehabilitating, replacing and expanding processing facilities, estate trans-
portation, buildings, workshops and agricultural machinery. u-ortantly,
the project involves the restructuring of the management of the two groups
and the provision of advisory and inspection services to assist management,
as well as other technical assistance.
Comparison of Forecast and Actual Performance
2.11      The credit was signed in June 1969 but it did not become effective
until December due to legal difficulties. In the meantime, however, the
recruitment of management advisers and inspection services went ahead and
contracts have been signed between PNP V and N.V. Rubber Cultuur Maatschappij
Amsterdam (RCMA), and between PNP VII and Societe Financiere des Caoutchoucs
(SOCFIN) and Harrisons Fleming Advisory Services (HFAS). 1969 plantings and
replantings were as scheduled, and a total of 5,735 ha of rubber and oil
palms were established. The 1970 budgets and planting programs of the two
PNPs were reviewed by IDA in late 1969 and, following some changes, were
agreed with the Government. These provide for similar planting and replant-
ing targets as envisaged at the time of appraisal. There has been no signi-
ficant progress in other physical aspects of the project. It was agreed at
the time of appraisal that the procurement of new and replacement equipment,
and the design and construction of new processing facilities would be pre-
pared with the assistance of the management advisers and Inspection Services.
2.12      Terms of reference have been agreed between the Government and IDA
for the employment of oil palm and rubber plant breeding consultants, and
qualified individuals and agencies have been approached. Terms of reference
have also been agreed for a survey of rubber smallholders in North Sumatra;
for a survey of other Government-owned estates, and for studies of the mar-
keting organization. Qualified consultants are now being contacted fcr the
purpose of carrying out these surveys and studies.
2.13      Insufficient data are available at this stage to compare actual
with forecast costs. In the Second Estates Project, however, higher labor
costs have been used as it appears that these may be increasing more rapidly
than originally forecast. To date, international procurement has been re-
stricted to fertilizers, and no problems have arisen; US$212,000 have been
disbursed for the supply of fertilizers.



- 5 -
2.14      In compliance with terms of the Credit Agreement, new Boards of
Directors have been appointed for PNP V and PNP VII, and a General Manager,
Production Manager, and Commercial Manager have been appointed to each
estate group. All appointments to the Boards, and to management, were made
following consultation with IDA.
2.15      While the project is in a relatively early stage of development,
the rapid progress made by Government and estate managements in the last six
months in implementing the terms of the Credit Agreement, and their adherence
to the project outline contained in the appraisal report justifies consider-
able optimism for the future of the project.
III. THE PROJECT AREA AND PROJECT ENTITIES
General
3.01      The PNP IV and PNP VI groups of estates lie within the province
of North Sumatra (see Map). PNP IV has 18 operational estates with a total
planted area of about 29,300 ha of rubber, and 3 other estates which have
been abandoned completely. PNP VI comprises 7 estates growing 31,600 ha of
oil palms and 570 ha of cocoa. Currently, PNP VI manages and finances the
losses of Karang Inoue estate of the PNP I group of estates located in the
province of Atjeh. Government has agreed that such responsibility will
terminate shortly and during negotiations assurances were obtained from the
Government to this effect; such termination would be a condition of effec-
tiveness of the proposed credit. Annex 1 provides information on all other
PNPs and Annex 2 details of each estate on PNP IV and PNP VI.
3.02      There are about 300,000 ha of estates in the province of North
Sumatra. Government owns about 197,000 ha of these, private Indonesians
some 40,000 ha, a Government/private joint venture 31,000 ha, and various
well-known international companies the remainder. In addition, there are
some 200,000 ha of smallholder rubber, and substantial areas of virgin
jungle.
Climate and Soils
3.03      The mean temperature is 270C, sunshine averages six hours daily
and annual rainfall ranges from 1,700 mm to 3,500 mm, and is well distri-
buted. Soil types vary between PNP IV estates, but all are suitable for
rubber cultivation. The soils of PNP VI estates are ideal for growing oil
palms, but four estates situated on alluvial flats adjacent to the Silau
Tua, Balai, Ular and Barumun rivers are affected by seasonal flooding, some
of which is serious. The estuaries of these rivers have not been dredged
for 30 years, and in this same period the maintenance of outlet drains to
the sea throughout the area has been almost non-existent, see para 4.14.



- 6 -
Location of PNP IV and PNP VI Estates and Communications
3.04      PNP IV.  PNP IV group headquarters are at Gunung Pamela, about
120 km from the provincial capital of Medan (see Map). Of the operating
estates 11, totalling about 23,000 ha are within a radius of 70 km from
Gunung Pamela, and the remaining seven, about 6,000 ha, are located in the
Tapanuli district and lie between 350 and 400 km from headquarters. Metal-
led roads, in poor-to-good condition, lInk PNP IV estates with Miecan, and
the port of Belawan. The production of the Gunung Pamela estates is moved
an average of 130 km (range 86-168 km) to Be7awan by the State railway
System, which connects with all factories. In Tapanuli, however, present
production is sold ex-estate and the buyer is responsible for transportation,
which is by road.
3.05      PNP VI.  Group headquarters of PNP VI are at Pabatu, some 90 km
from Medan, and all but one of the seven estates are within a radius of 100
km from headquarters. The remaining estate, Adjamu, is 326 km away. All
PNP VI estates are served by road, and with the exception of Adjamu, by
railway. Road communications with Adjamu are poor, however, in particular
the Rantau Prapat-Adjamu section, which is impassable in wet weather. Dur-
ing negotiations assurances were obtained from Government that the Rantau
Prapat to Adjamu road and all other roads to be used by project estate trans-
port for the carrying out of the pro4ect, would be improved and maintained
for use by ordinary estate vehicles. The evacuation of produce from Adjamu
presents a considerable problem, and at the moment it must be transported
to Belawan either by road, by sea or by sea to Tandjung Balai and then by
road or rail to Belawan. To overcome the problem provision is made under
the project for a seagoing palm oil barge to ply between Adjamu and Belawan.
3.06      All project imports and exports would be handled through North
Sumatra's sole major port -- Belawan. While the design capacity of Belawan
is adequate to handle existing traffic of about 2,000 ship calls annually,
the port infrastructure and shiD-servicing facilities are in poor condition,
due to unsatisfactory maintenance and repair. Additionally, heavy silting
and some shortfall in maintenance dredging restrict shipping to freighters
of about 15,000 tons, while bulk tankers of higher tonnage would be the most
economic means of exporting palm oil. In general, however, the port can
handle present traffic and its improvement is high on the list of Government
rehabilitation projects. A Dutch consulting firm (NEDECO) has been commis-
sioned to study port improvement requirements, including those needed for
Belawan, and it is anticipated that action will be taken by the Government
to implement recommendations made by the consultants, and that the port
will continue to be able to handle North Sumatra estate production. Both
PNPs have experienced excessive delays in the port and rail handling of their
production and supplies, particularly the turn-around and availability of
rail tankers transporting liquid latex and palm oil from the estates to
Belawan. During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government that
steps would be taken to eliminate delays in handling PNP production and to
effect such improvements as are required to facilitate the export of project
production. A specific assurance on this issue was not obtained when Credit
155-IND was negotiated since it was believed at that time that improvements
would take place more rapidly than has proved to be the case.



- 7 -
3.07      There is no road or rail link between North and South Sumatra,
consequently air services are the only means of rapid transportation between
Medan and Djakarta. Regular commercial air services connect Medan with other
Sumatran towns, Dajakarta on the island of Java, and Penang (Malaysia).
Labor
3.08      The supply of labor in the project area is adequate and is well
able and prepared to work on estates. The majority of estates employ more
labor than required and an expansion in the labor force would not be re-
quired to implement the project. If labor shortages should occur, workers
could be recruited from Java, without much difficulty, as in the past. Due
to severe inflation in the recent past the estates follow the general policy
of paying a large proportion of wages in kind, such as rice, cloth and kero-
sene. The present wage level for estate workers is Rp. 22.50 per day plus
Rp. 137.50 in kind, equivalent to just under US$0.42. This rate is very low
compared with those in other countries with a major estate industry. The
Government is anxious to return to solely monetary wages, but this has not
yet proved possible.
IV. TIIE PROJECT
A. Project Description
4.01      The Project is the rehabilitation and development over the five
years 1970 - 1974 of two groups of Government-owned estates, PNP IV and
PNP VI, and involves:
-    planting or replanting about 12,000 ha of rubber and
8,000 ha of oil palms;
-    bringing to maturity the above areas and about 9,800
ha of immature rubber and 7,200 ha of immature oil palms
planted prior to 1970-
-    rehabilitating 19,400 ha of mature rubber and 28,100
ha of mature oil palms by means of a fertilizer program;
-    rehabilitating about 9,100 ha of mature oil palms,
7,200 ha of immature oil palms and 300 ha of immature
rubber through special programs of weed and disease
control, drainage and selective felling of uneconomic
palms;
-    constructing a test laboratory, one new block rubber
factory, and converting an existing sheet factory to
block rubber production;



-8-
rehabilitating seven existing palm oil mills;
rehabilitating and expanding estate agricultural
equipment, transportation services and buildings;
rehabilitating existing estate roads and bridges;
providing machinery for land clearing, and upkeep
of estate roads and drains;
-    providing technical and management assistance, in-
volving an estate and factory inspection service,
technical and financial advisers and the purchase
of foliar (leaf) analysis services; and
-    rehabilitation and improvement of RISPA after employ-
ment of consultants to submit proposals for reorgani-
zation and a long-term research and development program.
The physical and organizational components of the project would be similar
to those of the First Estates Project, amended as necessary in the light of
experience gained in carrying out the latter.
B. Estate Development
Planting Program
4.02      The PNP IV and PNP VI estate groups have 54,654 ha and 37,479 ha
of cultivable land respectively. Details of these areas, by group, individ-
ual estate, crop, and year of planting, are given in Annexes 2 and 3. Both
estate groups have plantings which are uneconomic to harvest; these would
be replanted, and other suitable land not yet cropped would be planted up
as fast as the capacity of management and labor would permit. The proposed
combined replanting and planting programs for the two groups would be phased

4.03      The 14,600 ha PNP IV program would comprise replanting 9,400 ha
now under rubber of between 25 and 50 years old, and planting up 3,900 ha
of jungle and 1,300 ha of land now occupied by illegal squatters but which
would be recovered through compensating such squatters (see para 4.13).
4.04      The PNP VI program of 8,000 ha would include the replanting of
2,100 ha of old and low yielding oil palms, and the planting with oil palms
of 500 ha in old rubber, 2,300 ha under jungle and 3,100 ha of vacant land
to be recovered from illegal squatters (see para 4.13).
Routine Replanting
4.05      It is standard estate practice to use a 30-year replanting cycle
for oil palms, and a 25-year cycle for rubber. Replanting carried out under
the above programs would clear up the existing backlog of replanting. From
1974 PNP VI would adopt a standard 30-year replanting cycle, and PNP IV a
25-year cycle from 1976.
Planting Material
4.06      Both estate groups would produce their own supplies of high-yield
potential planting material 1/. The only exception would be that for its
1971 plantings PNP VI would have to import about half of its oil palm seed
requirements from Malaysia. Annex 4 gives details of the planting material
available and the plant breeding situation in Indonesia. In the First North
Sumatra Estates Project the Government undertook to implement suitable plant
breeding programs for all Government-owned estates in North Sumatra, and to
appoint oil palm and rubber plant breeding consultants, acceptable to IDA,
to oversee these programs. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from the Government that all material used for project oil palm and rubber
planting programs from 1971 through 1974 would be subject to the recommen-
dation of these plant breeding consultants. These plant breeding consult-
ants are expected to be appointed shortly; and a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed credit would be that the plant breeding consultants had been
appointed and were working in Indonesia.
Fertilizer Investment Program
4.07      Economic fertilizer programs can be determined only by scientific
analysis techniques, such as foliar (leaf) analysis which is described in
Annex 5. Foliar analysis services will not be available locally until
sometime during 1971, and provision is made in the project for obtaining
analysis services from abroad through contracts with suitable research
agencies. PNP VI made appropriate arrangements with a Malaysian agency
in 1969, and PNP IV will make similar arrangements in the latter half of
1970. Consequently, scientifically based fertilizer programs will stsrt
in 1970 in the case of PNP VI and in 1971 in that of PNP IV.
1/   PNP VI would produce oil palm seed from selected mother palms which
would be pollinated artificially with pollen from selected male parents,
and PNP IV would obtain rubber seeds required for rootstocks from seed
gardens, and bud wood from its bud wood nurseries.



- 10 -
4.08      The yields of all Indonesian estates, including those of PNP IV
and PNP VI, are seriously depressed due to the lack for many years of
balanced fertilizer applications. If maximum yield potential is to be
realized mature areas on PNP IV and PNP VI must be properly fertilized as
quickly as possible, although yield responses to the initial applications
would not be significant until the second or third year following such ap-
plications (see Annex 5). The cost of the initial applications is consider-
ed a capital Item and it is proposed to finance them under the project.
Thus fertilizer for application to mature PNP IV rubber would be financed
in 1971 and 1972; and fertilizer for mature PNP VI oil palms in 1970 (some
foliar analysis results are available), 1971 and 1972. Fertilizer for im-
mature areas 1/, which in estate accounting is normally regarded as a capital
item, would be financed throughout the project period.
Special Rehabilitation
4.09      Many of the estates of PNP IV and PNP VI are in arrears with weed-
ing programs, and this backlog of poor maintenance is adversely affecting
rubber and oil palm growth in immature areas and yields in mature areas.
Additionally, PNP VI is in arrears with disease control and drainage pro-
grams and the selective felling of uneconomic oil palms. These programs
would be brought up to date in 1970 and 1971, and this special rehabilita-
tion would be included in the project. After 1971, the areas rehabilitated
in this way would be covered by routine annual maintenance programs.
Buildings
4.10      Cash shortages over many years have resulted in the wholly inade-
quate maintenance of estate buildings, particularly of workers' housing.
On many estates much of the workers' accommodation is sub-standard and should
be replaced. It is proposed to include in the project the cost of rehabili-
tation, maintenance and replacement of estate housing. During the period
1970 through 1974 provision has been made for PNP IV and PNP VI to replace
125 and 850 double housing units respectively, and for each PNP to rehabili-
tate about 50% of the remaining workers' housing units. No additional hous-
ing would be required. General provisions have also been made for replace-
ment and rehabilitation of staff housing, offices and other buildings.
Annual plans for the replacement and rehabilitation of buildings would be
carried out only after the Inspection Services had commented on the proposals
(see para 5.12).
Vehicles and Equipment
4.11      All PNP IV produce is transported from field to processing
factories by road. PNP VI has an estate rail system, and only a small
proportion of road haulage takes place. The number of vehicles, locomo-
1/   The development period from planting or replanting until the trees

- 11 -
tives and rolling stock on both PNPs is substantial, although efficient
utilization is precluded due to age and consequent high repair incidence,
shortage of spares, and poor organization. Other machinery and equipment
used by the estates, and which is generally in a state of disrepair, in-
cludes wheeled and crawler tractors, road upkeep machinery, crop transport
and general vehicles.
4.12      Under the project obsolete and irreparable equipment such as
locomotives, rolling stock, wheeled and crawler tractors, road graders,
trucks and personnel vehicles (buses, cars, jeeps, and motorcycles) would
be replaced; and additional equipment purchased to handle the increased
production expected to be generated by the project. Requirements have
been estimated on the basis of better utilization which would result from
improved management, see Chapter V.
4.13      The PNP IV and PNP VI planting programs include some 4,400 ha
which are at present illegally occupied by squatters; Government regulations
require such squatters to be compensated in accordance with an agreed scale
for crops and housing which may be lost when the land is planted and project
costs include compensation payable during the period 1970 through 1972.
This would not be financed under the IDA credit. During negotiations assur-
ances were obtained from the Government that such squatters would be removed
in time to prevent any disruption of the agreed planting program.
4.14      Four of the PNP VI estates, and particularly Tanah Itam Ulu estate,
are affected by seasonal flooding as river estuaries have not been dredged
and outlet drains to the sea have not been maintained for many years (see
para 3.03). To alleviate the flooding problems Government assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the blocked outlet drain to the sea which
causes severe flooding at Tanah Itam Ulu estate would be rehabilitated not
later than June 30, 1971, and that other major outlet drains to the sea
affecting other PNP estates within the project would be rehabilitated and
properly maintained, see para 4.31.
C. Processing Facilities
PNP IV
4.15      The current PNP rubber crop of about 18,000 tons per annum is pro-
cessed into sheet and crepe rubber 1/ by PNP IV factories and those of Indone-
sian remillers, and into concentrated latex at a plant owned and operated by
the Goodyear Company. The 11 PNP IV plants, which are in a generally satis-
factory condition, comprise five-sheet and crepe rubber plants, four-sheet
rubber plants and two-crepe rubber plants; there are.also two additional
sheet-rubber plants which are only used for sheet drying during peak crop-
I/   The main characteristics of the various types of rubber produced are
described in Annex 6.



- 12 -
ping periods. In order to meet competition from synthetic rubbers, and to
obtain the long-term marketing advantages of block rubber over sheet and
crepe rubber, the project provides for conversion of PNP IV factories to
block rubber manufacture as and when present facilities or arrangements be-
come inadequate to deal with the crop harvested. At least three of the ex-
isting sheet and crepe factories would be held in reserve following the
introduction of block rubber processing facilities.
4.16      PNP IV crops are expected to increase to about 47,000 tons by the
mid 1980's. To provide for the additional crop and conversion of existing
factories when crops exceed present capacity the prbject includes:
-    the construction of a new block rubber factory at
Bandar Betsy;
-    conversion to block rubber of an existing sheet rubber
factory at Bangun;
-    establishment of a rubber testing laboratory at PNP IV
headquarters in 1970; and
-    additional drying facilities at Bandar Negeri and Sarang
Giting.
During the following ten years to 1985 provision has been made for fo'tr m'orb
factories to be converted to block rubber production, the construction of a
new block rubber plant at Hapesong and extension of plant capacity as and
when required. Further details of existing plants and proposed investments
are given in Annex 6.
4.17      After 1970 PNP IV processing should be adequate for all PNP IV
crops and the need for outside processing arrangements would be eliminatff8.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that exist-
ing and any future outside processing arrangements would be subject to the
approval of IDA and the Joint Marketing Office (JMO), see para 6.03.
PNP VI
4.18      The current PNP VI oil palm crop of about 300,000 tons of FFB per
annum is processed in seven mills. The condition of four of the mills is
generally satisfactory but the mills at Tindjowan (built in 1922 and re-
habilitated in 1968), Pulu Radja (built in 1920), and Adjamu (built in
1938) operate inefficiently due to poor layout and lack of equipment. With
the exception of Tindjowan, all mills are operating far below rated capacity.
Quality control checks acceptable internationally are carried out by RISPA
laboratories.



- 13 -
4.19      PNP VI crops are expected to increase to about 690,000 tons FFB by
1979. Additional mill capacity would not be required but rehabilitation and
additional equipment is necessary to enable each mill to operate efficiently
at full rated capacity. The project provides for substantial rehabilitation
and new equipment for the mills at Tindjowan, Pulu Radja and Adja"u, mach-
inery spares, incinerators and conveyors for bunch waste disposal (a product
of such disposal is valuable potash fertilizer), storage facilities, labora-
tory equipment and rehabilitation and improvement of mill workshops. (Annex
7 gives further details of existing mills and proposed investments.)
D. Technical Assistance
4.20      Reference has already been made to technical assistance for rubber
and oil palm plant breeding programs being provided under Credit 155-IND
(paras 2.12 and 4.06). Technical assistance would be provided under the
project to strengthen and up-date the management of both PNP IV and PNP VI
(paras 5.06 thru 5.10).
E. Agricultural Research
4.21      The Research Institute of the Sumatran Planters' Association
(RISPA) was established early in the century (under the name AVROS) to
provide a common research service for the estate sector, and soon developed
world-wide reputation for the quality of its work. RISPA remains the
principal research center for rubber, palm oil and tea, but since the
expropriation of Dutch owned estates has been unable to maintain a satis-
factory service. The main reasons for this have been shortages of funds
and of qualified staff. Consequently, the estate sector is receiving in-
adequate research support, despite the efforts of individual estates to
conduct their own research programs.
4.22      The Government recognizes the importance of RISPA and the devel-
opment of agricultural research for all sectors. In April 1969 a cess was
introduced for all export crops to finance research requirements and to
provide other essential services for the export crops sector. Equipment
for soil and leaf analyses at RISPA is being provided under bilateral aid
and IDA assistance has been made available under the First North Sumatra
Estates credit for periodic visits by foreign plant breeding experts, the
training of Indonesian personnel, and the purchase of equipment.
4.23      An early improvement in the advisory and product testing services
provided by RISPA to the estate sector is considered essential. It is rot
possible to establish in detail RISPA's financial and man-power needs in the
absence of a long-term research and development program for the institute.
The preparation of such a program is long overdue, but when the First Estates
Project was being appraised Government's intentions for the future of RISPA
were insufficiently clear to permit IDA to consider providing financial



- 14 -
assistance other than for the services described above. The situation is
now clear, and RISPA will be operated under Government auspices with appro-
priate representation by the estates on its management body. Funds would
be provided under the project to employ consultants to prepare a research
and development program, and to recommend the organizational and financial
arrangements, such as the level of a research cess, required to support it.
An amount of US$200,000 would be provided from the proposed credit for this
purpose, and an additional US$400,000 for the procurement of any goods and
services shown by the studies to be urgently required and which could not be
financed readily from RISPA resources. It is estimated that Government
counterpart funds equivalent to US$400,000 also would be required. Assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that, to carry out preparation of
the research and development program the Government and RISPA would employ
consultants satisfactory to IDA, on terms and conditions satisfactory to
IDA. Assurances were also obtained from the Government that the consultant's
findings and recommendations would be submitted to IDA to enable agreemeat
to be reached on their implementation.
F. Export Duties, Taxes and Exchange Rates
4.24      Export duties and taxes payable to Government by the PNPs amount
to 15% of the fob proceeds of rubber and palm produce. The rate of export
duty is currently 10% and agricultural and other taxes account for a further
5%. In addition a cess of Rp 1,000 (US$2.65) per ton of production io payable
to the Provincial Government for infrastructure maintenance (see para. 7.03).
All financial projections in this report are expressed in US dollars and
conversions from rupiahs have been made at the rate of US$1 - Rp 378.
G. Cost Estimates
4.25      Total project costs are estimated at US$31.7 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$17.0 million. The following is a summary
of the cost estimates; further details are given in Annex 8.

4.26      Although the severe inflation experienced in Indonesia in recent
years has abated during the last twelve months, previous costs are not yet
a reliable guide for establishing cost projections. Wherever possible,
cost estimates have been calculated on the basis of man-day requirements
which have then been compounded by the daily wage rate assumed. Increases
of 5% in the wage rate were made at the beginning of both 1969 and 1970,
and in the cost projections it has been assumed that wages and salaries
would be increased by 5% per annum (compounded) for a further nine years,
until 1979, and that thereafter the annual increase would be 1% for the
remainder of the project life. Current daily wage rates are less than
50% of those now being paid to estate labor in Malaysia, but the average
Indonesian worker's output is appreciably lower. Productivity improvements
are achievable, as shown by experience in Malaysia where despite increasing
labor costs, costs of production have fallen. Estimates for the rehabilita-
tion and replacement of existing buildings, vehicles and equipment have been
arbitrarily assessed as it was not possible to appraise each item, and to'
forecast the precise life left in many of the items would be difficult. Items
would only be purchased, replaced or rehabilitated as required, and in accord-
ance with annual budgets approved by PNP Boards which would incorporate the
comments of the Inspection Service (see para. 5.12). The Government has
granted duty free privileges to projects financed with foreign aid, and
these arrangements would apply to PNP IV and PNP VI for goods required for
the project. A contingency provision of 10% has been applied to all costs
throughout the life of the project as increases have- only been provided for
wages and salaries.
H.  Proposed Financing, Disbursement and Procurement
4.27      It is proposed to make available and IDA credit of US$17.0 million
equivalent, to cover the estimated foreign exchange costs of the project
estimated at 54% of total project costs; the remaining finance would bev
provided by the PNP themselves from self-generated funds and by the Govern-
ment. A summary of proposed project financing during the period 1970 through
1974 is as follows:

4.28      In addition to the US$1.0 million to be provided for PNP VI by
Government during the period 1970 - 1974, a further US$2.0 million would be
required by PNP IV in 1975 and 1976 for replanting, processing facilities
and renewal of fixed assets, which would increase the total Government
contribution for the two PNP to US$3.0 million. Government funds required
for both PNP IV and PNP VI would be amply covered by export duty and
corporation tax received from the PNP during the period 1970 - 1976 (see
Annex 16).
4.29      The IDA credit be on-lent by the Government to the PNP.  Both
the IDA credit and the direct Government contributions to PNP IV and PNP VI
would be lent under Subsidiary Loan Agreements, which would be similar to
those executed between the Government and the PNP financed under the First
North Sumatra Estates project. The subsidiary loans would bear interest at
12% per annum, the standard Government lending rate for all State enterprises.
The term of the PNP IV subsidiary loan would be 16 years, including a 9 year
grace period; the PNP VI loan would be for 13 years, with a grace period of
five years. The terms of these sub-loans are largely determined by the
capacity of the PNP to meet loan interest and repayments, (see paras. 6.12
through 6.14). During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Govern-
ment that draft Subsidiary Loan Agreements would be submitted to IDA for
approval. Signature of the Subsidiary Loan Agreements would be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
Procurement
4.30      During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government
that goods to be imported under the project, and to be financed by IDA,
would be procured following international competitive bidding procedures,
and that for all contracts in excess of US$50,000 draft tender documents
would be submitted to IDA for approval together with analyses of bids before
contracts are awarded. The Inspection Services would assist the PNP to
prepare bid documents and specifications and to evaluate tenders.
Disbursement
4.31      IDA funds would be disbursed against full CIF documentation for
fertilizers and chemicals amounting to about US$8.5 million, processing and
other machinery amounting to some US$2.8 million and transporation equip-
ment totalling US$3.0 million. Disbursements would be made against foreign
exchange payments for the purchase of foliar analysis and inspection services
and the cash cost of employing technical assistance personnel would be re-
imbursed in full. No disbursements would be made for goods and services for
RISPA until the consultants' recommendations for the RISPA research program
have been discussed and agreed with IDA (see para. 4.23), or for Tanah Itam
Ulu estate until rehabilitation of the outlet drain has been completed (see
para. 4.14). A disbursement schedule is at Annex 9. Should any savings be
made the resultant balance of the IDA credit would be cancelled.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01      Until recently, Government-owned estates have been isolated from
international developments in estate technology and management, and the
introduction of modern crop production and processing techniques and manage-
ment skills is urgently required. The first North Sumatra Estates Project
provided for a restructuring of the Boards of Directors and managements of
the two estate groups involved, as well as for a greater decentralization
of authority, appointment of expatriate management advisers, and employment
of foreign estate companies to make regular inspections of all estates.
These arrangements were agreed by IDA as the existing day to day management
of the estates was regarded as generally satisfactory.
5.02      The revised directorate and management arrangements under the
first North Sumatra Estates Project have only been in operation for a short
period. Generally they appear to be working well, and it is proposed that
similar arrangements should be introduced for PNP IV and PNP VI.
Boards of Directors
5.03      The Boards of Directors for PNP IV and PNP VI would have powers
similar to the Boards of Directors of commercial companies, including full
authority for hiring and dismissing managers and staff and for determining
and implementing all administrative, financial, technical and commercial
policies and programs. Each Board would consist of a Chairman and at least
three other members who would be appointed for an initial period of five
years by the President of Indonesia acting on the reconmendation of the
Minister of Agriculture. In each case the Director General of Estates, or
a senior member of his staff nominated by him, would serve as an ex-officio
member. The Director General is a civil servant responsible to the Minister
of Agriculture for all matters pertaining to the estate industry, as such he
has broad experience of PNP operations. The other members of the Boards
would be Indonesians with experience in estate business and management, bank-
ing, commerce or some related field. The Boards would not be responsible
for day to day management (see para. 5.04). During negotiations assurances
were obtained from the Government that such new boards of Directors for
PNP IV and PNP VI would be established, and that all appointments to the
Boards would be subject to prior consultation with IDA. Establishment of
the two Boards, and the filling of their positions would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed credit.
Day to Day Management
5.04      Day to day management is now in the hands of the three Directors
who make up the existing Boards of Directors of PNP IV and PNP VI. These
are, a First Director, Production Director and Commercial Director. Under
the project these directorships would be abolished, and their management
functions would be exercised respectively by a General Manager, Production
Manager and Commercial Manager appointed by the Minister of Agriculture on
the recommendations of the new Boards of Directors. This would be similar
to the arrangements agreed by IDA for the First North Sumatra Estate Proj-



- 19 -
ect which appear to work well. A change under the second project would be
that the Director of Estates, or his representative, would be an ex-officio
member of the two Boards and would assist them in making managerial appoint-
ments and, additionally, ensure close cooperation between the PNPs and the
Directorate of Estates. Initial appointments to the three key managerial
positions of PNP VI would be almost certainly the three present Directors
but changes are considered desirable for PNP IV. Assurances were obtained
from the Government during negotiations that such managerial appointments
would be made only after prior consultation with IDA, and appointment of
the six managers would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit. Management organization below group level would remain unchanged.
Managers of individual estates would be responsible to the group managers
and the latter would be assisted at Head Office by a Department of Agronomy
and Technology (reporting to the Production Manager) and a Department of
Finance, Commerce and General Affairs (reporting to the Commercial Manager).
Marketing is organized through a Joint Marketing Office (see para. 6.03).
An organization chart for the reorganized PNP IV and PNP VI is shown at
Annex 10.
5.05      Existing Government regulations for the dismissal of employees
preclude the effective operation of incentive payment schemes, which would
improve productivity, but might result in some redundancy. Increased
productivity is essential for the success of the project and assurances
were obtained from the Government that the Boards and Managements of PNP IV
and PNP VI would be fully authorized to hire and dismiss project personnel
as required. Assurances were also obtained from the Government that the
existing wage premium system in use by the PNPs would be improved and,
wherever possible, future wage and salary increases would be linked to
incentive payments systems.
5.06      In order to ensure the strengthening and consolidation of the
management of PNP IV and PNP VI, assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that no changes would be made in the management responsibilities and
structure of the two PNPs without IDA's approval during the disbursement
period of the proposed credit or without prior consultation with IDA there-
after. IDA financing of the PNPs, and the introduction of foreign advisers
and inspectors should lessen interference by the military in the affairs
of these estate groups, which has, and still does occur, particularly in
the case of PNP IV. This assumption is based on the experience in cases
where foreign companies have recovered the management control of their
estates.
5.07      The Government is presently considering a new form of corporate
entity, Purusahaan Perseroan Terbatas (PT), for the operation of PNP estate
groups and other Government-owned enterprises. Only profitable enterpr1ses
would be converted to PT which mandatoriy would operate under the Commer-
cial Code. In such cases share capital of the PT would be issued to the
Government with the Minister of Finance making appointments to a Board of
Management and a Supervisory Board.



- 20 -
Inspection Service
5.08      As in the case of the First Estates Project, PNP IV and PNP VI
managements would be assisted and strengthened by their each employing an
experienced plantation company or companies to provide an Inspection
Service for an initial period of at least five years. The service would
entail at least semi-annual visits of highly experienced estate managers,
accountants, agriculturists and engineers to each individual estate and
factory the purpose of which would be to review the operations of the
preceding six months, to compare performance with Board policy directives
and approved budgets, and to prepare proposals for future operations. The
Inspection Service would also report on general standards of technical and
financial management, and comment on draft annual budgets prior to their
approval by the Board. The service would be directly responsible to the
PNP Board and copies of its reports would be sent to the Minister of Agri-
culture. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government
that an experienced plantation company or companies satisfactory to IDA
would be engaged by PNP IV and PNP VI for an initial period of about five
years to provide inspection services on terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA; these appointments would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed credit. Companies qualified to provide the necessary services
would need to have considerable first-hand experience of the development
and management of rubber and oil palm plantations, including up-to-date
experience of modern field and factory technology and of marketing. The
terms of reference of the inspection service would also provide for the
in-service training of selected Indonesians who would subsequently assume
these duties, as well as for assistance to the PNP in the preparation of
tender documents, and the analysis of bids, for goods and services to be
purchased under the project.
Management Advisers
5.09      PNP IV and PNP VI would each appoint a financial adviser for an
initial period of about two years. The adviser would assist and instruct
his PNP in utilizing the mass of financial data that is now being produced
and collated at all levels, but which is not being used for financial con-
trol, and for making management decisions. The financial system now in
use was introduced by the former Dutch owners of the PNP but detailed
analysis of the material was carried out in the Netherlands; thus while
the material is still being collected PNP financial personnel have inade-
quate experience to make use of it. In addition, the adviser would review
the PNP financial management structure and assist in the revaluation of
assets necessitated by the severe inflation of past and recent years.
5.10      Each PNP would also engage for about a two year period an estate
management specialist to advise the General Manager in all aspects of estate
management, and an agricultural specialist to advise the Production Ma)sger,
and train estate managers and field assistants in modern rubber and oil palm
production practices. Close cooperation between advisers and Inspection



- 21 -
Service personnel would be essential, and for this reason assurances were
obtained from Government during negotiations that the companies providing
the Inspection Services would supply advisers under the same contract.
Accounts and Audit
5.11      Audited accounts of PNP IV and PNP VI for the periods ended Decem-
ber 31, 1968 and 1969 are summarized in Annex 11. Audits are now carried
out by Government auditors, but these arrangements are not considered satis-
factory and thus assurances were obtained from the Government during negotia-
tions that independent auditors satisfactory to IDA, as in the case of the
First Estates Project, would be appointed to audit the accounts of PNP IV
and PNP VI, and that audited accounts would be submitted to IDA within four
months of the close of the financial year.
Annual Budgets
5.12      Annual budgets prepared by PNP IV and PNP VI would incorporate
the comments of the Inspection Services and would be approved by the res-
pective Boards. Approval by IDA of the planting program included in the
annual budget, and of any material changes made subsequently is considered
desirable and during negotiations assurances to this effect were obtained
from the Government. Assurances were also obtained that annual budgets
and any material changes made subsequently, would be submitted to IDA for
comment not later than 30 days prior to their adoption.
VI. PRODUCTION MARKETING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
A. Yields and Production
6.01      Growing conditions for rubber and oil palm in the project are
among the best in the world. Yield projections used for plantings under
the project for the period up to peak production are as follows:
Rubber                      -------------------       Ha------------------------
Year after planting:      7    8       9      10     11       12     13      14/16
Kg of dry rubber         750  1,000  1,200  1,400  1,500  1,600  1,700  1,800/2,000
Oil Palm
Year after planting:           4       5       6       7       8      9
Tons of FFB                    5      14      20     23       26     27
Oil extraction rate (x)       16      18      19      20      22     22



- 22 -
Further details are given in Annex 12 together with the expected decline in
yields after the years of peak production, and incremental yields from exist-
ing mature areas as a result of the fertilizer investment program. The
yields used in project estimates are similar to those obtained in Malaysia
on soils classed as of average suitability for oil palm and rubber, and
under average management efficiency. Climatic conditions of project estates
are similar to Malaysia, soils tend to be superior and under the project,
management should be equivalent.
6.02      Total annual production of PNP IV is estimated to rise from approxi-
mately 18,000 tons of rubber in 1969 to a peak of abut 47,000 tons in 1985.
For PNP VI annual production is estimated to rise from about 56,500 tons of
palm oil and 13,500 tons of palm kernels in 1969 to a peak of nearly 146,000
tons of palm oil and 30,000 tons of palm kernels in 1979. Peak incremental
production amounts to some 29,000 tons of rubber, 89,500 tons of palm oil
and 16,500 tons of kernels.
B. Marketing and Prices
Joint Marketing Office
6.03      The nine PNP's in Atjeh and North Sumatra (PNP's I through IX)
sell all export produce through a Joint Marketing Office (JMO) with head-
quarters in Medan. The JMO is headed by a Managing Director appointed by
the Minister of Agriculture and control is vested in a Joint Board of
Directors in which each of the nine PNP's is represented by its First
Director or General Manager. Separate committees comprising the directors
directly concerned with the marketing of each crop meet every fortnight
and establish the JMO policy for that crop.
6.04      Most of the major rubber buyers are represented directly, or by
agents, in Medan, and much of the dry rubber for export is marketed by JMO
under a local auction system. Buyers of concentrated latex are limited and
sales are usually made under negotiated forward contracts. Palm oil and
palm kernels are sold by a system of continuous worldwide offers and bids
carried out directly between the JMO and purchasers. PNP produce is
exported to East and West Europe, Japan, Pakistan and the USA.
6.05      Except for PNP V and PNP VII, local sales of rubber are made
directly by the PNP's without proper bidding procedures, which is unsatis-
factory. Under the first North Sumatra Estate project (Credit 155-IND) the
Government agreed that all PNP V and PNP VII rubber for local sale would
be handled by the JMO using its standard procedures. Local palm oil sales
are satisfactorily handled by JMO, prices being determined on the basis of
average prices obtained for recent exports, and at present all palm kernels
are exported. During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government
that rubber, palm oil and palm kernels produced by PNP IV and PNP VI would
be marketed by the JMO using its standard procedures.



- 23 -
6.06      In 1960 a jointly-owned selling agency company (Indoham) was
formed in Hamburg between the Government and German commodity trading and
business interests to handle all PNP produce sold in Germany and much of
the PNP production sold elsewhere in Europe. The company maintains con-
tacts with European buyers, submits buyers' offers to JMO for approval,
deals with documentation, payment procedures and claims, and supplies sales
recommendations, marketing advice and information to the JMO. The Board
of Directors consists of one resident Indonesian transferred from JMO, and
a representative of the German shareholders. Indoham receives 1% of the
FOB sales it handles from which is paid total operating costs, including
the salaries and expenses of the directors and a small locally recruited
staff; any profit remaining is paid to the German shareholders. The JMO
has no other overseas agents or representation.
6.07      The JMO needs restructuring to give the PNP's strong and reliable
marketing services. Coordination between the JMO and the individual PNP's
is often weak and greater autonomy and flexibility is required for JMO
operations. The first North Sumatra Estates Project provided technical
assistance for consultants to carry out with JMO's assistance, a market
survey for oil palm and rubber products and to recommend the marketing
methods to be adopted; and consultants to advise the Managing Director on
JMO's internal organization and procedures. The JMO would also retain
marketing consultants to give marketing advice as and when required. Invi-
tations will shortly be circulated to a selected list of consultants. The
consultants finally appointed and the terms and conditions of appointment
must be satisfactory to IDA in accordance with assurances received under
Credit 155-IND.
Market Prospects - Oil Palm Products
6.08      Current production of palm oil in Indonesia is about 175,000 tons
per annum of which more than 80% is exported, the remainder being used by
local soap manufacturers. In addition to an increase in soap consumption
it is expected that demand for palm oil as an edible fat, in substitution
for decreasing coconut oil supplies, will increase considerably as there
are no alternative local sources of edible oil other than palm oil. Assum-
ing a continued population growth of 2.4% per annum, that annual per capita
consumption of edible fats and oils remains at about 4 kg and that coconut
oil cannot supply the increased demand, local sales of palm oil for edible
purposes could increase to some 150,000 tons by 1980 plus approximately
50,000 tons for soap manufacture, a total of 200,000 tons. By 1980 project
production would be approximately 146,000 tons and total Indonesian produc-
tion might be in the region of about 400,000 tons. Under these assumptions
exports would therefore increase from their present level of 150,000 tons
to some 200,000 tons. While this is necessarily a somewhat speculative
projection, it does indicate that oil palm development under this project
is unlikely to significantly affect world trade patterns in the long term.



- 24 -
6.09      Annex 13 examines market prospects for palm oil and kernels on
the world market. Until recently the growth rate in the supply of palm
oil was low compared with other fats and oil amounting to only 1.3% during
the 14 year period to 1967. New plantings, particularly in Malaysia, are
expected to increase the annual growth rate to more than 5% by 1970 and
to raise the share of palm oil production in total fats and oils from
about 3% in 1965/67 to 5% by 1980. Much of the additional world supplies
of palm oil will be exported and absorbed by the international market. Al-
lowing for an expected decline in world market prices for nearly all major
fats and oils, and the need for palm oil to increase its share of total
usage, it is estimated that palm oil prices will fall by the mid-1970's
from the average 1969 price of US$181 cif per ton into a price range of
US$155 - US$165 per ton cif; palm kernels are expected to range between
US$135 - US$138 per ton cif compared with an average price for 1969 of
US$153 per ton cif. For the purpose of making economic and financial
projections in this report cif prices of palm oil are assumed to be
US$160 per ton and for palm kernels US$136 per ton.
Market Prospects - Rubber
6.10      Indonesia exports most of its rubber and will continue to do so
for the foreseeable future. Over the last 20 years annual net exports of
rubber from Indonesia have been fairly constant at nearly 700,000 tons but
during the same period world production has risen by more than 30% and
Indonesia's share has fallen from 41% to 29%.
6.11      The market prospects and price trends for rubber are reviewed
in Annex 14. During the years to 1975 consumption of both natural and
synthetic rubber in non-Centrally Planned countries is estimated to in-
crease at 6.5% per annum compared with a rate of 6% per annum during the
past 20 years. Prices for natural rubber must become more competitive with
prices of synthetic rubber if natural rubber is to retain its share of the
market. Polyisoprene, a synthetic rubber which is highly competitive with
natural rubber, costs about 21 US cents per lb to produce. A technical
breakthrough which would reduce production costs is a possibility which
cannot be ignored, and the projected prices for natural rubber used in
this report allow for some reduction in the production costs of synthetic
rubber. Consequently, it is assumed that the price of natural rubber would
fall from an average price of 26.2 cents per lb in 1969, to an average of
about 20 US cents per lb for 1970 to about 16 US cents per lb by 1975 and
in subsequent years, as shown below:
1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 onwards
US cents per lb cif New York        20    19    19    18    17           16

C. Financial Aspects
PNP IV
6.12      PNP IV would obtain a loan from Government of about US$5.2 million
(of which proceeds of the IDA credit on-lent by Government would be US$3.2
million) during the period 1970 through 1976; this would be adequate to
complete the investment program described in paras. 4.01 and 4.02. There-
after, self-generated funds would be sufficient to meet all operating costs,
planting and other investment requirements and debt service, even if the
present high rates of export duty and corporation tax continue. From 1980
onwards up to US$1.0 million annually would be available for distribution
to Government which would be increased to about US$2.0 million annually
after completion of debt service in 1985.
PNP VI
6.13      PNP VI would require a Government loan of about US$14.2 million
(of which proceeds of the IDA credit on-lent by Government would be US$13.2
million) during the project period 1970 through 1974. Self-generated funds
thereafter would be adequate to cover all operating costs, other invest-
ment requirements and repayment of the Government loan which would commence
in 1975. From 1976 onwards, an average US$2.0 million annually would be
available for distribution to Government and this would increase to approxi-
mately US$4.0 million annually in 1983 when debt service is completed.
6.14      PNP IV and PNP VI projected cash flows, operating statements, and
replanting costs and other capital expenditure after the project is completed
are detailed in Annex 15. The Government onlending terms for PNP IV - 16
years with a 9-year grace period - are softer than those for PNP VI, 13 years,
including a grace period of 5 years. The terms of these sub-loans are largely
determined by the draw-down periods, and the capacity of each PNP to meet
loan interest and repayments. PNP IV requires loan funds from Government
from 1970 through 1976, two years more than PNP VI, due to the replanting
backlog and other project requirements. During the first 10 years of the
project, immature areas of PNP IV would average more than 30% of the total
planted area, compared with only 10% for PNP VI, which restricts self-
generated funds and requires an extension of the Government loan repayment
and grace periods.
6.15      Annual financial rates of return on capital employed cannot be
calculated for the PNPs as the real value of assets employed is not known
due to the heavy inflation experienced in Indonesia in recent years. A
revaluation of assets would be undertaken as part of the project (see para.
5.09). Calculation of the incremental financial rate of return to the
PNPs from the project would have little value since it is not possible to
predict, without wide margins of error, the financial performance of the
two PNPs without the project. The financial rates of return to the Govern-
ment, as the sole owner of the PNPs, from project activities would be
similar to the economic rates of return shown at para. 7.03.



- 26 -
Government
6.16      Annex 16 shows the effect of the PNP IV and PNP VI sub-projects
on the Government's budgetary position and assumes that present rates of
export duty and corporation tax would continue. Import duties and personal
taxation, however, are excluded. Throughout the project life both PNPs
would provide a net source of income to the Government since, despite the
need for direct Government loans totalling US$3.0 million during the period
1970 through 1976, these would be more than offset by tax revenues. The
estimated additional net income accruing to Government, assuming that the
net income expected in 1970 without the project remains constant, would
rise from more than US$1.0 million in 1973 to about US$9 million annually
from 1981 onwards. During the life of the project additional net income
accruing to Government is estimated at about US$175 million.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The principal benefits of the project are:
-    increased net foreign exchange earnings, rising from
a current US$16 million per annum to about US$30 mil-
lion by 1981. Insofar as this latter figure may not
fully represent exports because of increased local
consumption of palm oil, it would represent foreign
exchange savings from import substitution;
-    increased budgetary support to the Government, rising
from a current US$6.0 million per annum to about US$15.0
million by 1981;
-    improved management arrangements for two Govetnment-
owned estate groups;
-    maintenance of job opportunities at adequate wage rates
for some 20,000 workers;
-    improved research support both for the estate industry
and for small farmers growing export crops; and
-    a general improvement in the estate industry which could
help to stimulate new investment and reinvestment by
the private sector.
7.02      The project comprises a number of separate programs which are
distinct in terms of costs and benefits. Consequently, individual econemic
rates of return have been calculated for each of these rather than an
overall rate of return for the project as a whole, or global rates of
return for each of the PNPs. Project benefits accrue both from new invest-
ment and past investment which are considered sunk, such as estate infra-



- 27 -
structure and processing facilities. Sunk costs have not been taken into
account in calculating rates of return, but the costs of rehabilitating,
replacing, and expanding estate infrastructure and processing facilities
have been apportioned to the individual programs in accordance with their
requirements.
7.03      The rates of return below are based on calculations which assume
cif Europe prices of US$160 and US$136 per ton for palm oil and kernels,
respectively and a cif New York price for rubber of 16 US cents per lb in
1975 and subsequent years. The calculations are given in Annex 17; labor
and staff salaries are costed fully, on the assumption that rates would
rise by 5% per annum (compounded) in real terms during the first ten years
of the project, and by 1% (compounded) thereafter; no opportunity cost is
attributed to land since considerable areas of unused jungle are available
for development in the project area; and the economic lives of replantings
and new plantings of oil palms and rubber are assumed to be 30 years and
25 years respectively. Future possible inflation has been assumed to affect
costs and benefits equally and has been ignored; the costs of road and drain-
age works rehabilitation, however, have been taken into account.

(d)  Planting ex-jungle                               29.2%
(e)  Planting ex-squatter land                        30.6%
7.04      The sensitivity of the above rates to variations in produce prices
has been tested, and the results are given in Annex 17. Assuming no change
in cost estimates the cif Europe price for palm oil could drop to US$140 per
ton and the rates of return of the oil palm programs would remain at more
than 12%. In the case of rubber, a fall in the cif New York price to 15 US
cents per lb would reduce the rate of return on new and replanting to about
10%. The effect of a substantial increase in labor costs has also been
tested. An increase of 50% in labor costs above those assumed in report
projections would reduce the rates of return by about 4% both in the case
of oil palm and rubber if such increases were not accompanied by gains in
productivity.
1/   The above rates of return were calculated at an exchange rate of
US$1 - Rp 326, and have not been updated to take account of the change
in the rate in late April to US$1 - Rp 378. It is estimated, however,
that use of the new rate would improve these rates of return by mar-
gins of 1 - 2% in the case of rubber, and about 1% in the case of
oil palm.

BACKGROUIND OF THE PRIVATE AND GOVERNI0T -OIWNED ESTATE INDUWSTRY
The Estate Industry
1.        Before the Second World War, Indonesia had the largest and, in
some respects, the most scientifically advanced estate industry in the
tropics. The productive areas of estates, which were largely European-
owned and managed, then totalled some 1.2 million ha, accounted for about
8% of the country's cultivated area, and produced roughly 60% of total
exports. Since the war the role of estates in the economy has diminished
dramatically; thus, in 1964, estate produce accounted for only 15-20% of
exports. In volumetric terms estate production is now only about one-half
of 1938 levels. The decline has occured through a dissipation of scientific,
technical and managerial knowhow brought about by nearly 30 years of
political, economic and fiscal instability, and in particular by the nation-
alization in 1957 of an all Dutch-owned estates (which now form the Govern-
ment Estate sector) and the mandatory management by Government of other
foreign-owned estates in 1964.
2.        A census carried out in 1966 showed that at that time the estate
sector comprised a planted area of some 854,200 ha, made up of rubber -
531,100 ha (62%); oil palms - 105,800 ha (12%;); sugar - 76,100 ha (9%);
tea - 72,700 ha (8%); and coffee - lt2,700 ha (51). Other estate crops-
are coconut, cocoa and quinine. The accuracy of the above figures is
suspect, since they include private Indonesian-omwned estates, about which
accurate details are difficult to obtain; the figures also exclude tobacco,
which is an important crop.
The Government-owmed Estate Industry
3.        In 1969, Government-owned estates comprised a planted area of
605,600 ha, made up of about 224,500 ha of rubber, 80,500 ha of oil palm,
39,500 ha of tea, 67,300 ha of sugar, 20,400 ha of colfee, 16,hO0 ha of
tobacco, 120,000 ha of pine forest, and lesser areas of cocoa, sisal, manila
hemp, kapok and other crops. Table 1 contains further details.
4.        During their 13-year existence, the Government estates have been
taxed very heavily -- 25% export duties and 6C% corporation taxes were
levied until recently. In addition, the Government kept operating and
capital expenditures to the minimum, and because of lack of funds the estates
fell behind in their replanting and expansion programs; and vehicles, pro-
cessing facilities and houses fell into disrepair. Also the estates were
allocated inadequate foreign exchange for essential purchases of fertilizers
-and chemicls.   Management -- particularly financial and marketing --
was over centralized and seriously affected by the hand-to-mouth financial
existence which was forced upon the estates, and the problem was exacerbatdd

by political appointments to important posts and by frequent reorganizations
and regroupings. lWage and salary levels were fixed by Government and fell,
with the rapid inflation, to levels which provided no incentives to higher
production and lower costs. Corruption became rife and the military abused
their position.
5.        The reorganization and partial decentralization of the Government-
owned estates, which took place in April 1968 and became fully effective in
1969, was an important step towards rehabilitation of the sector. The estates
were previously arranged in five major crop groups, each centrally managed
from Djakarta. Now they are grouped into 28 units known as PFPs (see Table 1)
based on geographical location, crop, and size considerations. Sach PlNTP unit
has a Board of Directors located on the estates themselves, though many
important powers are reserved to the Minister of Agriculture; these include
appointment of senior staff; approval of budget estimates and financial state-
ments; approval of main lines of operations; and powers to give instructions
to the Boards concerning the general discharge of their functions.

Second North Sumatra Estates Prolect
Plant Breeding and Planting Material
A. Plant Breeding
1.        In the first North Sumatra Estates project, credit 155-IND, the
Government agreed to implement plant breeding programs for all Government
owned estates in North Sumatra and to appoint oil palm and rubber plant
breeding consultants acceptable to IDA to monitor such programs. As stated
in the main report the choice of material for project oil palm and rubber
planting programs from 1971 through 1974 would be subject to approval by
the appointed plant breeding consultants. From 1975 onwards planting
material would be chosen by the Boards of PNP IV and PNP VI on the recom-
mendation of the plant breeders at the research centers and the Inspection
Service.
B. Planting Material: Oil Palms
2.        The oil  palm fruit comprises a kernel inside a hard shell,
surrounded by a mass of oily flesh; individual fruits develop in bunches
of approximately 1,200 attached to a fibrous core. A healthy palm produces
about 10 bunches a year and on a mature palm the average bunch weight is
about 18 kilograms; the fruits represent approximately 78% of total bunch
weight. Palm oil is extracted from the flesh and palm kernel oil from the
kernel in separate processes. Plant breeders have aimed at reducing the
proportion of shell in each fruit, which is the only non-oil bearing part,
and have achieved this by crossing thick shelled (Dura) fruit, with fruit
with no shell (Pisifera 1/) to produce a thin shelled fruit (Tenera). High
yielding hybrid material with these characteristics is now generally avail-
able throughout the world, including Indonesia, and technically is known
as D x P. PNP VI has not had adequate supplies of D x P planting material
and in recent years has used D x T (Dura x Tenera) seed which has a higher
proportion of thick shelled fruit resulting in a lower proportion of oil,
than D x P.
3.        The plant breeding program to be implemented under credit 155-IND
(see paragraph 1) will not produce sufficient high grade D x P material for
project plantings until 1972 and consequently:
1/   In theory Pisifera, with no shell, would be ideal planting material,
but in practice, small fruit size, a high sterility rate and a very
small proportion of kernel preclude its use.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
-    the 1970 planting program on PNP VI will be limited to
available supplies of D x P material; and
-    the 1971 program will be planted with local D x P
material and material to be purchased from Malaysia.
Local supplies of high grade planting material would be sufficient to meet
PNP VI requirements thereafter.
C. Planting Material: Rubber
4.        The most common rubber varieties (clones) planted by PNP IV in
recent years are PR 107 and GT1, both classed as Grade One by the Rubber Re-
search Institute of Malaya (RRIM), the acknowledged authority which classes
only four clones as Grade One. PR 107 and GT1 would continue to be the
clones most commonly used for project plantings but the other Grade One
Clones, RRIM 600 and PB 5/51 would also be used. A well known Sumatran
clone, Avros 2037, about which little is known outside Indonesia but which
has done well in Sumatra, is also included in the list of clones approved
for large scale plantings.
5.        There are a number of other potentially good clones available
in Sumatra but information is limited to yield data of doubtful value; and
before a clone can be safely used for large scale plantings, attention must
also be paid to soil conditions and wind damage and leaf disease characteris-
tics. Use of the newer clones of high but improved potential would there-
fore be limited to plots of 20 ha, and the advice of the plant breeders and
Inspection Service would be sought before any decision was taken to proceed
to full scale planting.

Second North Sumatra Estates Project
Foliar Analysis and the Fertilizer Investment Program
for Mature Oil Palms and Rubber
1.        Until a few years ago fertilizer policies for oil palm and rubber
were usually based on the following:
a)   leaf sympetom which indicate the deficiency of
some nutrients;
b)   known nutrient status of different soil types;
c)   fertilizer experiments; and
d)   management experience.
2*        Foliar analysis, in which the nutrient content of the leaf is
determined in the laboratory and compared with established optimum levels,
has become common practice in both rubber and oil palms in recent years as
a means of determining deficiencies of major elements. Foliar analysis
does not, however, provide an immediate and simple determination of the
quantities of fertilizer required. At present, quantitative requirements
of fertilizer can only be determined from fertilizer trials, but foliar
analysis does provide a reasonable guide to the main chemical deficiencies.
As more experience is gained, particularly by comparing fertilizer trial
results with determinations of leaf nutrient status made by foliar analysis
of trees in the trials, foliar analysis can become a most useful aid in
determining fertilizer requirements.
3.        Foliar analysis was used by PNP VI for the first time in 1969,
and PNP lV will make similar arrangements in the latter half of 1970.
Consequently fertilizer applications based on foliar analysis will start
in 1970 for PNP VI and in 1971 for PNP IV. Significant responses from
initial applicatioas of fertilizers are not expected from either oil palm
or rubber until 1973 1/ The effect on oil palm yields will be greater
where the palms are young; in the case of older palms, whose yield capa-
cities are past their peak, the response would be lower. With mature
rubber factors such as tapping policy and the maintenance of bark reserves
are likely to have a gr :tey E&`ect ot yields than fertilizers, but it is
estimated that the effect of a correct fertilizer policy would play a
significant and economic part in the recovery of rubber yields.
1/   Responses to the improved fertilizer program are expected after three
years in the case of oil palms and two years in the case of rubber.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
4.        PNP IV and VI fertilizer policy in recent years has been un-
systematic and inadequate. Visual symptoms of deficiencies in oil palms
are widespread and yields are depressed. Rubber appears to be less badly
affected by the lack of nutrients, but the fertilizers that have been
applied in the past might be depressing yields since the applications were
made on an ad hoc basis and probably were not balanced. Unless a scienti-
fic program of nutrient requirement appraisal is instituted, and corrective
applications made this situation cannot be improved.
5.        In view of the delay in yield response to balanced fertilizer
applications which would start in 1970, and in view of the considerations
in the immediately preceding paragraph the application of fertilizer to
mature rubber areas in 1971 and 1972 and to mature oil palm areas in 1970,
1971 and 1972 would be considered as an investment item under the project.
6.        It is not possible to determine in advance of a detailed ap-
praisal of nutrient requirements the precise quantities or types of
fertilizer required for the investment program or thereafter. The follow-
ing assumptions based on actual results of foliar analysis for oil palm
and recent research and experience in Malaysia for rubber are made for the
purpose of projections in this report:
a)   Rubber - An annual application costing about US$12 per ha
for PNP IV mature rubber, except for the last five years
of productive life (i.e. years 21 through 25) when
fertilizer would no longer be required or applied.
Applications under the two year fertilizer investment
program would be of the same order of magnitude.
b)   Oil Palm - An annual application of about US$35 per ha
should be sufficient for PNP VI mature oil palms under
normal conditions, except for the last five years of
their productive life (i.e. years 26 through 30) when
fertilizer is no longer required. For areas in their
prime, however, where natural nutrient reserves are
badly exhausted, applications under the three year
fertilizer investment program would have to be sub-
stantially higher, at about US$100 per ha in 1970,
US$87 per ha in 1971 and US$70 per ha in 1972.
The quoted costs contain the foreign exchange element only; in the projec-
tions a further 20% has been added for local handling and transport costs.

PNP IV Rubber Processing Facilities
PrinciAl_L pes of Rubber
1.        With the exception of Bandar Betsy Estate all PNP IV crops are
presently being processed into ribbed smoked sheet and crepe rubber in
either PNP IV's own factories or those of remillers. Liquid latex from
Bandar Betsy estate, which has no processing facilities, is being processed
into concentrated liquid latex by a nearby Goodyear factory; the lower grades
from Bandar Betsy are processed into crepe rubber by one of the other PNP
IV factories. Further details of the main types of rubber are set out be-
low:
(a) Concentrated Latex - The latex is preserved in liquid form
by the addition of ammonia, which prevents coagulation, and
is centrifuged until the dry rubber content (DRC) is in-
creased from about 30% to 60%. The quality of concentrated
latex can be fully controlled to conform to technical spe-
cifiestions.
(b) Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) - The latex is coagulated by the
addition of acid. The coagulum is passed through rollers
to remove water and the resulting sheets are smoked dried.
Quality standards can be technically specified and controlled,
but the normal, though less satisfactory, practise is to grade
RSS by visual appearance.
(c) Crepe - Either coagulated latex or scrap can be made into crepe
rubber. The rubber is passed through heavy rollers running at
different speeds which work the rubber into a thin sheet with
a crepe-like texture. The crepe is air dried at a lower tem-
perature than smoked sheet. As with sheet, quality standards
can be technically specified and controlled but grading is
normally done visually. Crepe made from latex is a premium
rubber and usually sells at substantially higher prices than
top grade smoked sheet.
(d)  Block rubbeis - A relatively new process in which either
coagulated latex or scrap grades can be:
-    treated with chemicals to improve and retain the best
properties of natural rubber;
-    dried quickly and cheaply;



ANNEX 6
Page 2
-    highly compacted into small bales for easier handling; and
-    graded only to technical specifications;
all of which improve the competitiveness of natural rubber with synthetic
rubbers.
2.        The long term advantages of block rubber production over con-
ventional rubbers are considerable and the project provides for the con-
version of PNP IV factories to block rubber manufacture as and when present
facilities or arrangements become inadequate to deal with the crop harvested.
Existing facilities and project investments
3.        PNP IV has eleven fully operational factories with a daily total
capacity of nearly 60 tons. These processing facilities, plus the facili-
ties provided by Goodyear and remillers, serve the fifteen estates of PNP
IV. Proposals for the rehabilitation of existing plant, and new factory
and machinery requirements to provide sufficient processing capacity for
PNP IV projected crops are summarized on an area basis as follows:
(a) Gunong Pamela Area:
Each of the four estates in this area (Gunong Pamela, Gunong Para,
Gunong Monaco and Bandar Bedjambu) has smoked sheet processing facilities and
two also have a creping plant. With the exception of Bandar Bedjambu the
factories are well laid out, generally in good condition and able to provide
processing facilities for area crops except cup lump until 1976. The Gunong
Para factory would be converted into a centralized block rubber plant in
1975 at an estimated cost of US$305,000 and would serve all four estates; at
the same time the Bandar Bedjambu factory, which is in poor condition, would
be phased out of production and scrapped. The remaining two factories would
be held in reserve until Gunong Pamela is converted to block rubber product-
ion in 1977, at a cost of US$184,000.
(b) Sarang Giting Area
The four estates in the area (Sarang Giting, Siliau Dunia, Serbad-
jadi and Bandar Negeri) all possess sheet processing facilities but two
factories (Siliau Dunia and Serbadjadi) are used only for sheet drying
during peak cropping periods. Sarnag Giting factory, which also has
creping facilities, and Bandar Negeri factory would be able to provide
processing facilities for area crops until the mid-1970s although the
general condition of their plant is poor. Project costs include US$14,000
in 1970 for improving smoking and drying facilities, and US$185,000 in 1976
for conversion of the Sarang Giting factory to block rubber production at
which time the Bandar Negeri factory would be placed in reserve.
(c) Bangun Area - This area comprises Bangun and Simbolan estates which
are served by a well laid out and equipped sheet and crepe processing plant
at Bangun. The present processing facilities, together with surplus capa-
city available at Gunong Pamela end Bandar Betsy, would be adequate for



ANNEX 6
Page 3
area crops until 1973 when a new block rubber plant estimated at US$204,000
would displace existing sheet production. The creping facilities would be
continued as required or placed in reserve.
(d) Bandar Betsy Estate
There are no processing facilities at this estate; latex is
currently processed into concentrate under a contract with Goodyear and
cup lump is usually processed at Gunong Para. The Goodyear contract, which
can be terminated by either party giving one month's notice, provides latex
processing facilities up to a maximum of 20,000 litres daily. By 1971,
Bandar Betsy crops are expected to be 502 higher than this and the project
provides for the construction of a new block rubber plant in 1970 at an
estimated cost of US$313,000 and a doubling of capacity in 1976 costing
US$132,000.
(e) Hapesong Area
Each of the four estates in this area (Hapesong, Marpinggan, Batang
Toru and Pidjor Koling) have either sheet or crepe processing facilities.
Although all factories and equipment are in generally poor condition the
facilities would be capable of processing area crops until 1976, when a
new block rubber plant would be installed at an estimated cost of US$257,000.
All existing factories would then be closed down.
(f) Quality Control Facilities
The estimates for block rubber plants include the basic laboratory
equipment required for quality control. A central laboratory would be es-
tablished at PNP IV headquarters at an estimated cost of US$35,000 to ensure
that rubber produced by PNP IV factories meets Standard Indonesian Rubber
(SIR) quality standards established byqGovernment. The laboratory staff
would work closely with RISPA, which would normally monitor SIR requirements,
and be licensed to issue SIR certificates in respect of PNP IV production.
(g) Future Processing Requirements
PNP IV total crops are expected to peak at about 47,000 tons in
the late 1980s by which time additional daily capacity of approximately 100
tons would be required. The estimates provide for expenditure of US$132,000
in each of the years 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1982 and US$184,000 in 1985 for
extension and conversion of existing plant as necessary.
(h) Rehabilitation of Existing Plant
During the years 1970 through 1974 essential rehabilitation of plant
in existing PNP IV factories would cost an estimated US$191,000. Thereafter
US$24,000 per annum is provided for machinery upkeep and overseas and locally
manufactured spares.

4.  Outside Processing Arrangements
PNP IV processing facilities would be sufficient for all PNP IV
crops and all outside processing arrangements would cease except when IDA
agrees to their continuation. However, the situation may arise where mar-
keting requirements would make alternative processing arrangements financial-
ly attractive. For this reason the project estimates do not commit PNP IV
to short term heavy capital costs for plant replacement as it may be advan-
tageous to switch part of the crop temporarily to outside factories. The
switch most likely to occur is for latex to be processed outside PNP IV
instead of into smoked sheet in project factories. Any outside processing
arrangements for PNP IV rubber would be subject to tender following consul-
tation and agreement with the JMO and IDA.

PNP IV Oil Palm Processing Facilities
1.        Details of the present status of individual mills and proposals for
their rehabilitation and extension are as follows:
(a) Adolina (commissioned in 1956) - The lay out of the mill is sa-
tisfactory but maintenance standards and management are poor. The rated
capacity of the mill is 24 tons FFB per hour but only one of the two pro-
duction lines is in operation and current throughput is less than 50%. To
enable the factory to achieve maximum capacity when required, the project
provides for adequate spare parts to bring all machinery into efficient
running order; the provision of a water treatment plant; and new palm
kernel drying equipment. Total costs of these improvements are estimated
at $83,000.
(b) Pabatu (commissioned in 1939) - The layout of the mill is good
and standards of maintenance and management are fair. The mill is capable
of a throughput of 36 tons FFB per hour but only one of the two production
lines can be used due to faulty hydraulic pumps and digestors, and current
throughput is less than 50 percent. No increase in capacity will be re-
quired to handle projected crops but to enable the factory to achieve maxi-
mum throughput extra equipment will be required in the kernel recovery plant,
oil purification station, and water treatment plant. Adequate spare parts
for existing machinery are required and also the replacement of two boilers.
The total cost of improvements and spare parts is estimated at $292,000.
(c)  Tanah Itam Ulu (commissioned before 1920 and rehabilitated in 1934)-
Despite the age of this mill, the layout and maintenance and management
standards are good.  The mill is capable of a throughput of 11 tons FFB per
hour which will be sufficient to process projected crops. Current through-
put is nearly 50% below rated capacity. In order to bring the mill up to
optimum capacity, and to provide standby equipment, the project provides
for a new boiler; replacement of alternators, electric motors and switch-
gear to convert the D.C. to A.C. power supply; extra equipment for the
kernel recovery plant; and adequate spare parts to maintain all machinery
in efficient working order. The total cost is estimated to be $147,000.
(d) TindJowan (commissioned in 1922 and rehabilitated in 1968) - The
layout of this factory is unsuitable for efficient operation and must be
re-designed. General management is fair but standards of maintenance are
low. Maximum capacity is 20 tons FFB per hour and current throughput is
near this level. Further extensions to provide sufficient capacity for
future operations cannot be undertaken until the mill layout has been
reorganized and most of the machinery resited. The existing plant can be
used during rehabilitation which would consist of the following:



ANNEX 7
Page 2
- new buildings for the extraction plant and purification
station;
- new cranes for unloading FFB, relocation of sterilizers
and new strippers with automatic feeders;
- new presses and pressing station and relocation of presses
installed in 1968;
- new kernel extraction plant and new oil purification plant;
- new alternators and switchgear for conversion of the DC plant
to AC and a new auxiliary diesel generating set;
- a new boiler and a new water treatment plant; and
- sufficient spare parts to ensure continuous and efficient
running of the mill.
The total estimated cost is $831,000.
(e) Air Batu (commissioned in 1937) - The fruit reception lay out
will need modification but the remainder of the plant is satisfactory. The
standard of maintenance is poor despite good general management. Maximum
capacity is 36 tons FFB per hour but one complete production line is out
of action for want of spare parts and repairs and current throughput is
less than 30% of rated capacity. To handle projected crops and to main-
tain machinery in efficient working order, buildings and equipment must
be extended, and fruit reception area modifications; a water treatment
plant; automatic bunch feeders to the strippers; kernel extraction plant;
sludge recovery plant and spare parts are required. Total cost is estimated
at $183,000.
(f) Pulu Radja (commissioned in 1920 and rehabilitated in 1930) - The
layout of this mill is unnecessarily complex and to increase operating
efficiency it will be redesigned. Management is fair although maintenance
standards are poor. The mill's rated capacity is 20 tons FFB per hour and
current throughput is some 60% of this. To increase efficiency and to cater
for increasing crops it will be necessary to:
-  install   aew crane building to improve fruit handling
eff ici` uy;
- install two new production lines incorporating reconditioned
equipment from the existing factory;
- install a complete new kernel extraction plant;
- install a new oil purification plant;



ANNEX 7
Page 3
- install a new boiler complete with automatic firing gear and
water treatment plant;
- install new electric motors and switchgear to convert from
DC power to AC; and
- provide adequate spare parts to ensure continuous and
efficient running of the mill.
The total estimated cost of the above program is $591,000.
(g) Adjamu (commissioned in 1938) - The layout of the plant does
not permit efficient operation and maintenance standards are low. Maximum
throughput is 12 tons FFB per hour but current capacity usage is less than
40%. A serious defect is the lack of equipment for recovery of kernels.
The kernel extraction rate for 1969 was less than 2%, compared with the
PNP VI average of 4.3%; many unshelled kernels are burnt as fuel   To in-
crease efficiency and to enable the mill to handle projected crops the
project provides for:
- a new boiler and water treatment plant and a diesel
generating set;
- a new oil extraction plant;
- a new kernel recovery plant;
- sufficient spares to maintain the mill in efficient
working order.
Total estimated costs are $452,000.
2.        None of the mills have incinerators and conveyors for bunch
waste disposal and provision is made in the project for one at each mill.
In addition to being the most efficient method of bunch waste disposal the
incinerators would yield about 1,800 tons of muriate of potash annually
from bunch waste, by 1978. The cost of obtaining this quantity of muriate
of potash on the international market is approximately $140,000 in foreign
exchange, compared with an estimated total cost of providing incinerators
and empty bunch conveyors of $235,000.
3.        Total palum oi  btoz,,e capacity on the estates is approximately
24,000 tons, about 40" of production during 1969. Unfortunately, distri-
bution of the storage tanks is such that some estates have surplus storage
capacity while others do not have the capacity to store six weeks produc-
tion which is considered a minimum requirement. The project provides for
an estimated expenditure of p55,000 for the construction of storage tanKs
on the Adolina and Tanah Itam Ulu estates.



ANNEX 7

4.        Provision has been made in the estimates for laboratory facilities
at each mill to control quality standards durlng production. In addition
it is proposed that a central laboratory should be established at PNP VI
headquarters to carry out the more sophisticated tests that are becoming
increasingly necessary for the efficient marketing of palm oil. The es-
timated total cost of these facilities is $49,000. Weighbridges would
also be provided at Adolina Ilir and Tanah Itam Ulu at an estimated total
cost of US$15,000.
5.        All mills have workshops for routine machinery maintenance and
repairs.  The geographical distribution of PNP VI estates is too wide to
warrant the establishment of a mingle central workshop but extra facilities
would be provided at Pabatu, Air Batu and Pulu Radja to enable extensive
repairs and overhauling of tractors and vehicles, electric motors and switch-
gear, FFB cages, trolleys, conveyors and elevators to be undertaken. The
project provides for expenditure of $60,000 during the project period for
the rehabilitation and improvement of workshops.

SECOND NORTH SUMATRA ESTATES PROJECT
MARKET PROSPi3CTS FOR PALI2 OIL AND PALM !MNELS
Palm Oil
1.        Trends in supply and demand for individual fats and oils are far
more difficult to judge than those for the total market, particularly since
most of the major oil products are produced either as joint products or
by-products. Thus, as in the case of soybeans, the production of specific
oils may be deternined, not only by trends in the oils and fats market, but
also by the demand for the joint or related products. Another feature which
also has to be considered in reviewing the market for a particular oil
product is the amount of substitution possible between different fats and
oils. IWithin a broad range, on technical considerations, one oil can be
substituted for another. Currently, the bulk of palm oil is used in the
food industry. Here it meets its strongest competition from soybean, oil,
and fish oil and lard. Fish oils are at a disadvantage compared with palm
oil, owing to the high processing costs involved in making them usable for
this purpose.
2.        Usually, the associated product of the marine and vegetable oils is
a protein-rich cake or meal.  The oil palm, however, compared with some
of its competitors, produces a very low proportion of protein cake to oil
and the cake is the by-product of palm kernel oil, rather than palm oil.
The overall ratio of palm and palm kernel oils to cake is about 9:1.  In
comparison, the soybean produces oil to meal in the ratio of 1:46 in terms
of weight.
3.        Palm oil is produced almost entirely in four developing countries:
Nigeria, democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia and Malaysia.  Table
I indicates the production situation in these and other countri-es in recent
years. Compared with other major fats and oils (Table 2) the growth rate
for world palm oil production has been low, up to recent years amounting to
only 1.3% per annum. The only really significant expansion took place in
IIalaysia. However, in a number of countries, particularly Malaysia, a
considerable further expansion in production is planned for the future. Some
of these plans have already been put into operation. If these developmen"Cs
go according to schedule, total world production will amount to approximately
2.5 million tons between 1975 and 1980. This would represent a growth rate
of slightly more than 5%0 between 1965-67 and 1980, compared with a yearly
rate of increase of 1.3%J between 1954-56 and 1965-67. The share of palm
oil production on total fats and oils production would increase to approxi-
mately 5%, compared with about 3,5 in 1965-67.

4.        Many of the developments are export-oriented and a considerable
share of the additional supplies will have to be absorbed by the international
market. Oil palm exports increased very slowly during the last decade, largely
owing to the slow growth in production rather than marketing difficulties.
Actually, in the period from 1954-56 to 1965-67, palm oil exports declined
slightly (Table 3). It is estimated that by 1975 palm oil exports will amount
to approximately 1.2 million tons, compared with 550,000 tons in 1965-67.
Consequently, the share of palm oil exports on total trade will. probably
increase to 9% in 1975, compared with 5.4% in the earlier period.
5.        The palm oil economy thus faces two major problems in the fut-ure.
Firstly, it will have to face declining world market prices, a phenomenon
that is shared by nearly all major fats and oils. Secondly, it will have
to increase its share as an ingredient in the total usage of fats and oils.
Considering the fact that palm oil does not have all the quality characteristics
enjoyed by some of the other oils (e.g., coconut oil), this could only be
achieved through price declines larger than those expected for some other
oils.
6.        It is in food uses where palm oil will have to increase its market
share. In the past, this was only possible to a certain degree, mainly because
of limitation in availabilities. Among other factors, this apparently prevented
processors from undertaking the necessary research into the technical and
economic difficul-ies which would have to be overcome if palm oil is to be
incorporated as a major ingredient in food products. One major difficulty,
particularly at the relatively high palm oil prices of the past, appears to
have been the disposal at remunerative prices of the inedible portion resulting
from palm oil processing, which would make large-scale processing feasible.
.7.        The Chart (IBRD-h950) indicates that palm oil prices have generally
followed the trend of all fats and oils prices, declining to a low level
in 1962 and experiencing a sharp fall after the high 1965 prices. Of particular
importance is the narrowing of the large price difference between soybean oil
and palm oil which prevailed in the 1950's. Since 1963, prices for both
products have moved closely together, which indicates that their future
fortunes will also be tightly knit.
8.        In the second half of 1968, palm oil prices dropped sharply reaching
a low point of approximately $140 per ton, compared with $222 per Lon in 1967.
The steep decline was caused by large shipments of soybeans and soybean oil
and unusually large exports of sunflower seed and fish oil. This wias a
relatively short term situation and prices recovered towards the end of 1968.
The average for the whole of 1968 was $172 per ton and for the first six months
of 1969, the price averaged nearly $171 per ton. In view of the large
anticipated exports and the technical difficulties mentioned previously, it is
estJl-tad that palm oil prices will fall 1by the mid-1970's into t price r.nge
$15%-165 per ton c.i.f. 3irope.



Page 3
9.          These projections have to be seen in the light of the uncertainties
dhich surround any price forecast and of fats and oils in particular. For
example, if soybean exports under P.L. 480 are reduced or cease altogether
without compensating changes in U.S. production policy, the above price forecast
may prove to be optimistic. On the other hand, if only part of the large
requirements that wrculd be needed to meet the needs of fat deficit develop n-
countries could be turned into effective denand, the forecast may be pessimistic
Palm IKernels
10.         The fruits of the oil palm contain twto separate sources of oil: ti;-,a
fleshy and fibrous mesocarp (pulp) from 'which pam oil is obtained and a nut
kernel in a hard shell from which Ralm kernel is extracted. The pulp of the
fruits deteriorates rapidly after harvest and extraction has to be carried
out in producing areas. Palm kernels, in contrast, deteriorate very slowTly
and their processing into oils is usually performed in large crushing nills, in
the importing industrialized countries. Cnly in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo are pli -,karn.~ls crushAd on (' 1.r,;; sc..l-.  nd that cmintizrls
exports consist almost entirely of oil, rather than kernels.
11.        U.ild palm fruits have a low proportion of pulp and a high proportior
of kernels.  In plantations now in the process of development, how-rever, the
ratio of pulp to kernel is expected to increase.  Thus; the future expansion
in palm oil output vill not be matched by a ccmensurate increase in palm
kernel oil output.
12.         P&ln kernel oil, unlike palm oil, is a lauric oil and as such closei
resembles coconut oil.  These types of oils are regarded in many countries as
a desirable ingredient of margarine and shortening, and for use in confectiona.r.,
and bakery products. Lauric oils also possess special qualities viich make
them an essential constituent up to a certain mainimun in soap manufacture; they
also have a w-ride variety of other industrial uses, such as in the manufacture
of synthetic detergents.
13.         All these factors account for a more inelastic demand greater than
for most other fats and oils.  This becaie very apparent in 1967-68 when prices
of nearly all major fats and oils decreased. Prices of lauric oils, including
palm kemel oil, renained high, mostly because of short supplies, but also
because of the limited degree of substitutability. Presently, there are some
indications that net- ind'ustrial processes will imaIke it possible to produce
synthetically the special conponent of the lauric vcid oils which are the caose
of the inelastic demand.  This, of course, would limit the special role these
oils play in the market.  Houever, so far no definite information is availab}e,
which indicates that industrial manufacture of lauric oils will be undertaken on
a large scale.
l14~.       The price, production and trade situation for palm kernels and p".lm
kernel oil are indicated in the Chart and Table 4. It is assmaed that palm
kernel oil, in line with other fats and oils, will follow a downw-.Lrd trend fcr
the future, and it is estiirAated that a price range of $134-138 per m ton i'or
palm kernels will prevail in the mid-19701s.

MARKET PROSPECTS FOR RATURAL RUBBER
I. INTRODUCTION
1.          Natural rubber (NR) is traditionally one of the major primary com-
modities traded between developed countries and LDC's. Generating average
earnings of approximately one billion U.S. dollars per annum in the period be-
tween 1955 and 1967, it has ranked between fourth and sixth position in impor-
tance in foreign trade among all primary commodities traded.
2.           Concentration is particularly high in the export trade in natural
rubber compared to other commodities. In the postwar period more than 90% of
all exports have been shipped from four countries in Southeast Asia, i.e.,
Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Ceylon. The remainder is exported by a
group of some 15 relatively minor exporting countries, among which the leaders
are Viet-Nam and Liberia. The market share of the major exporter group as a
whole has changed remarkably little in the postwar period. There has, how-
ever, been one rather striking change in market shares within this group in-
volving a declining market share for Indonesia which has been taken over al-
most entirely by Malaysia, with almost no gain by the other two countries.
As a result, as of 1967 nearly 50 percent of all of natural rubber supplies
were exported from Malaysia (Table 1).
3.           Ironically, the countries that benefitted most or suffered least
from this change in market shares also made the most progress in reducing their
dependence on rubber exports. Despite the remarkable increase in its share
of the market, dependence on foreign exchange earnings from natural rubber
exports has been continuously reduced in the case of Malaysia. Earnings
from natural rubber have also declined in importance for Thailand. In Viet-
Nam, Indonesia and Cambodia, on the other hand, dependence on natural rubber
was not reduced to any significant extent in the postwar period (Tables
2 and 3).
Trends and Prospects
4.           Natural rubber is a case of a commodity, whose share in the world
market has dropped in the past as a result of substitution by a synthetic
rubber and whose price is likely to decline in the future. From 1950-52 to
1968 consumption of new rubber (as distinguished from regenerated rubber) in
the non-Communist world rose by an average annual rate of around 6%, but the
consumption of natural rubber increased at the rate of only 2.3%. In this
same period, accordingly, the share of natural rubber in the world market de-
clined from 65% to 35% while that of synthetic rubber increased from 35% to
65%. Initially this relative drop in natural rubber was due at least partly
to the inelastic supply of rubber in the postwar period, but increasingly it
has been attributable to the ability of industry to produce a wide range of



ANNEX 1-
synthetics at qualities and prices that proved attractive as compared twith
natural rubber.
5.          The single most important market for rubber is the transportation
equipment industry. Approximately 50p5 of all newf rubber is utilized in tires
and tire products.  Also, aside from tires, automobiles average more than 100
lb of rubber per car.  Other "non'tire" uses include a uide variety of indus-
trial and consumer goods. Since end products of rubber have a high income
elasticity of demand, future world demand for rubber should a priori depend
to a large extent on the future rate of income grorth and especially of growith
in manufacturing output. This reasoning is supported by correlation analysis
betwyeen world manufacturing output and world rubber consumption which yields
a coefficient (referred to hereafter as elasticity of deiaand) of 1.1 for the
period 1951-1967.
6.          Table 4 presents a view of the probable course of world demand for
new rubber to 1985 based on projections made in the Economics Department. On
the basis of pro ections of GNP and projections of industrial output in the
OECD countries 1  total world consumption outside the centrally planned countries
is expected to grow at just over 6.5,; per annum reaching a level of 8.7 million
long tons per year around 1975. In addition, net imports of natural rubber into
the centrally planned countries are projected to reach 700,000 long tons as of
1975.  Of course, deviations in the gronfth rate of GNP in OECD countries from
the assumed growth rates as projected would have an effect on the above picture,
as wsould, too, a change in the amount of imports into the centrally planned
countries, or a change in the assumed elasticity coefficient of demand 2/.
The implications of a more pessimistic assumption in these determinants can be
quantified by tald.ng as the growsth rate of GUP in CECD countries, the lower limit
indicated above, i.e., 4.3, p.a. (rounded from 4.255), for the period of 1967
to 1975.  The corresponding growth rate of total new rubber consumption of 5.5r'
p.at would then yield an estirate of total new rubber consumption in the world
as of 1975 of about 8.4 million long tons. Estimates of natural rubber imports
into the centrally planned countries range from 600,000 long tons, implying
that any increase in consumption in these countries could be met by expanding
output of their synthetic rubber industry to 850,000 long tons, which would
reflect a technical relationship between tire production and natural rubber
consumption similar to that in the rest of the world. A medium projection of
total nesr rubber consumpticn in the Pree 'Jorld, representing a growth rate of
6.5 y p.a. would result in 8.7 million long tons as of 1975.  Imports into the
centrally planned countries could be assumed at 700,000 long tons as of 1975.
1/ It wras assumed on the basis of available protections by OECDp that G1TP in
all developed countries trould grotT at a range betwreen 4.3 to 4.6 p.a. and
industrial prociuction at a range betwjeen 4.8 and 5.8 p.a.
2/  It should be noted, howiever, that the elasticity coefficient of 1.1 hold
remarkably strong over the last 16 years.

7.          Potential production from already existing rubber plantings is
expected to increase to 3.5 million long tons in the mid-1970's (with further
increases to approximately 4.0 millicn long tons in 1980 and 1985 in the absence
of replantings as of 1969). Since it is expected that the centrally planned
countries would import about 700,000 long tons as of 1975, approximately 2.8
million long tons of natural rubber -ould be left for sale in the free world
market in the 1970's. If output proceeded at capacity level, therefore,
natural rubber would have to retain its share of the grotuth in demand. In
essence, this means that between now and the mid-1970's natural rubber's share
of total rubber demand would have to decline more slowrly than in the period
before 1967. As a consequence it is expected that prices for natural rubber
would have to becor,me more competitive with prices of synthetic rubber.
8.          Hatural rubber prices are likely to decline to about 16 U.S. cents
per pound as of the mid-1970's (see chart). This forecast is based on our
assessment of what will happen to the cost price of synthetic rubber. The
major development foreseen in synthetic rubber is cammercial production of the
highly competitive stereo-regular rubbers (i.e. polyisoprene and poly-butadiene)
besides the more trnditional SBRf, and a decline in the price of raw material
inputs of such rubbers, except for polyisoprene. In assessing the prospective
price for butadiene-based synthetic rubber (SBR and PB) the major development
anticipated is the change in the status of butadiene frcm being a product
primarily produced for synthetic rubber conversion to a by-product of another
major chemical proeuct, ethylene. In the case of polyisoprene, cost reduction
in the raw material input is also foreseen, although as a result of expected
economics of scale rather than a change in status from major product to by-
product. The proJected price of natural rubber is based on the assumption that
the cost/price of PI will serve as a ceiling since protracted movements of
natural rubber above that ceiling would lead to an acceleration of capacity in
polyisoprene.
9.          Over the longer run-and in particular for the peTiod 1975-85 during
which new and replanted rubber would be maturing--it is believed that the price
of natural rubber may either decline somewThat nore, to a level say, of approxi-
mately 12 U.S. cents per pound, c.i.f. New York or stay at 16 U.S. cents per
pound. This prognosis is based on the assumption of further technological pro-
gress in the synthetic rubber industry. In making a longer term forecast for
natural rubber, the key question is the possible further price developments in
polyisoprene, uhich from the standpoint of quality is the synthetic most likely
to make progress at the expense of natural rubber. There are presently research
efforts by the industry to adjust the petro-chemical production stream so as to
derive isoprene, the major raw material inputs, as a by-product.  The history of
success in butadiene-based rubbers suggests that this aim may be achieved. Homw-
ever, the present position is that an approach to such a technical breakthrough
has not yet been found. If a breakthrough were to be achieved, it is conceiva-
ble that the price of polyisoprene would fall belouT 15 U.S. cents per pound,
ccmpared to 21 U.S. cents as of 1968, and both polyisoprene and natural rubber
might be selling at a level in the order of 12 U.S. cents per pound. A situa-
tion such as this is w¢ithin the realm of possibilities sonetime betwreen 1975 and
1985. If isoprene cannot be produced as a by-product, however, prices for
polyisoprene and natural rubber miight continue at the projected 1975 level, in
real terms, for the period 197c5-1995. According to repeated industry staterments
at IRSG meetings, however, efficient producers of natural rubber opereting on
replanted high-yielding acreage should be able to produce rubber profitably at
prices as lo;- as 12 U.S. cents per pound c.i.f. consuming countries.



ANNEX 14

10.         The foregoing implicitly assumes that in the late 1970's and the
1980's all natural rubber produced at the suggested prices wrill be absorbed,
i.e., that price consi-lerations will outweigh any possible additional tech-
nical advantages that synthetic rubber may present to consumers. On the
other hand, if this assumption -iere considered to be too optimistic, the
question would arise whether it wTould be desirable to improve or even main-
tain the existing natural rubber capacity.
11.         To test this proposition, prospective demand for new rubber in the
1980's was compared iith natural rubber output that would materialize from a
global 3I, replanting program in the natural rubber industry (see Table 4). The
production implications of such an ambitious program is shown in line 6 of
Table 4, indicating that the resulting output of natural rubber would in fact
be substantially absorbed even if technical substitution against natural rubber
continued regardless of price. Of course, if low prices for natural rubber,
especially any w7ell below the future cost price of synthetic rubber resulting
from newT plantings wyith high yieldin7 trees were to halt, or even reverse
substitution, then foreseeable supplies of natural rubber might not be sufficient
to meet denand even i-ith an accelerated global rate in replanting.  The probable
magnitude of the deficit is illustrated in line 5 of Table 4. In other words,
the implicit natural rubber shortage seen in the 1950's w.Jould be repeated.
12.         In this case new planting in addition to the program to improve
the cost competitiveness of natural rubber against synthetic rubber by replant-
ing would be required. lioreover, it may be noted that it is far from certain
at this point in time that a replanting rate of 3~, per annum could be achieved
on a global basis. Even if it is achieved, completion of the program would
require between 13 to 29 years. Such a long-term program would be subject to
adjustment if the prospects for rubber change over time. The case for new
planting is further strengthened by the prospects for improvement in the
competitive position of natural rubber through better preparation of the raw
material which wJould proceed alongside a planting program.  Such improvements
involving production of newr formis of crude natural rubber such as "block rubber",
raise the technical standards of natural rubber and make possible a redaction
in the processin- costs of the rubber products manufacturer who is the decisive
factor in deciding the issues of substitution between natural and synthetic
rubbers.

_/ Standard rates of return.
Palm kernels are assumed to remain constant at the projected price of US$
136 per ton CIF Erope as revenue from this source is only about 15% of the
total value of palm produce.
4. The effect of a substantial increase in labor costs has also been tested.
Assuming an increase of 50% in labor costs above the estimated costs included
in the report projections, the rates of return would be reduced by up to 4%
both in the case of oil palm and rubber unless such labor increases were ac-
companied by improved productivity.
5. Details of the assumptions made and calculations of the standard rates
of return for PNP IV and PNP VI are shown in Tables 1 through 4 to this
annex. The rates of return were calculated at an exchange rate of US$1 #
Rp 326, and have not been updated to take account of the change in the
rate which took place in late April to US$1 = Rp 378. It is estimated,
however, that the use of the new rate would improve these rates of return
by margins of 1-2% in the case of rubber, and about 1% in the case of oil
palm.

SECOND NORTH SUMATRA ESTATES PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATES OF RETURN CALCULATIONS - INVESTMENTS IN RUBBER
REPLANTING OR PLANTING RUBBER (100 HA MODEL)
The following assumptions were made for calculating the economic
rates of return from replanting or planting rubber on PNP IV.
(1) Production
Estimated production from new plantings with regular fertilizer
applications (see Annex 12, Table 1).
(2) Benefits
On the basis of US$ 318 per ton equivalent to 16 US cents per
lb cif New York; benefits have also been calculated at prices ranging from
12 US cents to 20 US cents per lb.
(3) Costs
(a) Planting Establishment and Maintenance
First year costs include felling, clearing burning, plant-
ing and general upkeep; the cost of using alternative clearing
methods of planting or replanting is also shown. During the im-
mature period (6 years after planting) manday requirements for
wfeeding, pest and disease control fertilizer application, etc., would
fall from an estimated 156 mandays in the second year after planting
to 61 mandays in the sixth year after planting. From the seventh
year, when the rubber becomes mature, an estimated 36 mandays per
annum would be required for maintenance, plus tractor costs.
(b) Fertilizer
Estimated costs are US$ 8 per ha (year 1), US$ 10 per ha
(year 2), US$ 18 per ha (years 3 through 5) and US$ 12 per ha
thereafter, plus 20% for local handling and transportation costs.
(c) Tapping Costs
Requirements estimated at 1 tapper for 1 ha plus 10%
spares. Annual cost increase reflects assumed rise in labor
rates of 5% (compounded) during first ten years and 1% (compounded)
thereafter.



ANNEX 17
Table 1
Page 2
(d) Processing Charges
Materials US$ 39.50 per ton of dry rubber plus labor
costs equal to US$ 10.72 per ton of dry rubber in 1976 rising
to US$ 15.13 per ton of dry rubber in 1995.
(e)  Capital Outlay for New Plant
Proportionate cost of new 1 ton/hour capacity block
rubber factory and subsequent spares and replacements on basis
of production from 100 ha to estimated total factory throughput.
(f) Selling Charges
At US$ 7.00 per ton of dry rubber covering transport
to port, port handling charges, documentation and JMO expenses.
(g) Inspection Services
US$ 1.50 per ha of total planted area.
(h) Foliar Analysis
Fifty US cents per ha aged between 3 and 20 years.
Ci) Transport to Factory
Seventy-five US cents per ton of dry rubber.
(j) General Overheads
PNP IV total overheads have been allocated on the basis
of total immature area to total planted area until 1977, and
thereafter, pro-rata to total planted area.
(4) Contingencies
W4ith the exception of wages and salaries no increases in costs
have been assumed and a contingency provision of 104 has been added to all
costs (including wages and salaries) during the period 1970-1995.

SECOND NORTH SUMATRA ESTATES PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN CALCULATIONS - INVESTITS IN RUBBER
FERTILIZER INVESTMENT PROGRAM FOR EXISTING PLAMTINGS ON PNP IV
The follawing assumptions were made for calculating the economic
rate of return from the proposed fertilizer investment program for existing
plantations on PNP IV.
(1) Incremental Production
Estimated additional yield response to fertilizer application
(see Annex 12, Table 1) from mature areas between 7 and 20 years old.
(2) Benefits
On the basis of US$ 318 per ton equivalent to 16 US cents per
lb cif New York; benefits have also been calculated at pricesranging from
12 US cents to 20 US cents per lb.
(3) Costs
(a) Fertilizer - Material
US$ 12 per ha, plus 20% for local handling and trans-
portation costs, except for the last five years of productive
life (years 21 through 25);
(b) Fertilizer - Manday Cost
Labor requirements assumed to be 1.5 mandays per ha.
(c) Foliar Analysis
Costed at 50 US cents per ha of mature rubber between
4 and 19 years old.
(d) Processing Charges
Materials US$ 39.50 per ton of dry rubber plus labor
costs equal to US$ 8.00 per ton of dry rubber in 1970 rising
to US$ 1IJ.98 per ton of dry rubber in 1991.



ANNEX 17
Table 2
Page 2
(e) Capital Outlay for NewJ Plant
Provision is made in 1971 for a complete new block
rubber processing factory with 1 ton/hour capacity and spares
and replacements required in the following years. Day to day
maintenance spares are included in processing costs (see 3 (d)
above).
(f) Transport to Factory
Costed at 75 US cents per ton of dry rubber.
(g) Selling Charges
At US$ 7.00 per ton of dry rubber covering transport
to port, port handling charges, documentation and JMO expenses.
(4) Contingencies
With the exception of wages and salaries no increases in costs
have been assumed and a contingency provision of 10% has been added to all
costs (including wages and salaries) during the period 1970-1994).

ECONOGI4IC RATE OF RETURN CALCULATIONS - INVESTMENTS IM OIL PALMS
REPLATEIG OR PLANTING OIL PALMS (100 HA MODEL)
The following assumptions were made for calculating the economic
rate of return from replanting or planting oil palms on PMP VI.
(1) Production
Estimated production from new plantings or replantings
with regular fertilizer applications, improved management
etc. (see Annex 12, Table 2). Palm oil extraction rates
assumed to increase from 16%o in the first year of production
to a maximum of 22% in the fifth year of production (see
paragraph 6.01 of the main report), and kernel extraction
rates to increase from 3% to 4% during the same period.
(2) Revenue
On the basis of US$129 per ton for palm oil and US$102
for palm kernels, equal to CIF Europe prices of US$160 per ton
per ton and US$136 per ton respectively.
(3) Expenditure
(a)  Planting Establishment
Includes manday and machinery requirements for
felling, stacking, burning, lining, holing and
planting, weeding and other upkeep. Variation
in first year costs reflects alternative oper-
ations, e.g. replanting oil palm, planting ex-
squatter land, planting ex-jungle and planting
ex-rubber.
(b) Planting maintenance
Manday and machine requirements for weeding, pests
and diseases, roads, bridges and railways, drains
and application of fertilizer. Manday requirements
are reduced by more than 50% when area becomes
mature in the fourth year after planting.



ANNEX 17
Table, 3
(Page 2)
(c) Fertilizer
Estimated at USW& per ha in planting establishment
year, US$10 per ha in year 2, US$15 per ha in
year 3 and US$35 per ha thereafter, plus 20g for
local handling and transportation costs.
(d) Harvesting and Loading, including Transport to Factory
Labor cost calculated at 1.25 mandays per ton of
FFB, plus US$1.25 per ton of FFB for transport,
excluding depreciation. Total cost rises from
US$1.86 per ton of FFB in 1970 to USt2.h1 in 1999
reflecting assumed labor cost increases (see para.
4.26 of main report).
(e) Processing Charges
Materials US$6.67 per ton of palm oil plus labor
costs of 80 US cents per ton of palm oil in 1970
rising to US$1.52 in 1999.
(f) Selling Charges
To FOB only. Palm oil USt3.50 per ton, palm
kernels US$5.h0 per ton. Includes transport
to port, port handling, documentation and JMO
expenses.
(g) Factory Investment and Spares
Factory investment totalling USt1li,700 represents
arbitrary apportionment of total processing plant
rehabilitation costs from 1970 through 1976 (approx-
imately USt3.0 million) on the basis of estimated
peak FFB production from 100 ha (2,700 tons) to
estimated total FFB production in 1971, (approximately
500,000 tons). Thereafter a sum equal to US*h per
ton oil has been included to cover spares and renewals
of processing plant, workshop equipment, locomotives
and rolling stock, fruit cages etc.
(h) Foliar Analysis
Costed at 50 US cents per ha of mature palms between
3 and 25 years old.
(i) Inspection Service
Assumed to be US$t.50 per ha.



ANNEX 17
Table 3
(page 3)
(j) General Charges
Total general charges apportioned on the basis of
total planted area. Annual increase in cost reflects
salary increments of 5% per annum (compounded)
through 1979 and 1% (compounded) thereafter.
h.       (h)  Contingencies
With the exception of wages and salaries no increases in
costs have been assumed and a contingency provision of 10%
has been added to all costs (including wages and salaries)
during the period 1970-1999.

ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN CAICULATIONS
RTILIZER INVESTMENT PROGRAM FOR EXISTING
PLANTATIONS ON PNP VI
The followiing assumptions were made for calculating the economic
ratesof return from the proposed fertilizer investment program for existing
plantations on PNP VI.
(1) Incremental Production
Estimated additional yield response to fertilizer application
(see Annex 12, Table 2) from mature areas between h - 26 years old totalling
23,335 ha. Palm oil extraction rate 22% except in 1971, kernel extraction
rate approximately b.L%.
(2) Benefits
On the basis of US$ 129 per ton for palm oil and US$ 102 for
palm kernels, equal to cif Europe prices of US$ 160 per ton and US$ 136
per ton respectively.
(3) Costs
(a) Fertilizer - Material
Initial applications US$ 100 per ha in 1970, US.$ 87 per
ha in 1971, US$ 70 per ha in 1972 and US$ 35 per ha thereafter
(see Annex 5) plus 20% for local handling and transportation costs.
(b) Fertilizer - Application
Manday requirements estimated at 2.5 per ha per annum.
Manday costs assumed to increase from b9 US cents per day in 1970
to 85 US cents per day by 1990 (see para 4.26 of the main report).
(c) Foliar Analysis
Costed at 50 US cents per ha of mature palms between
3 and 25 years old.



ANNEX 17
Table 4
Page 2
(d)  Harvesting and Loading, including Transport to Factory
Labor cost calculated at 1.25 mandays per ton of FFB,
plus US$ 1.25 per ton of FFB for transport, excluding depreciation.
Total cost rises from US$ 1.86 per ton of FFB in 1970 to US$ 2.31
per ton FFB in 1990 reflecting assumed labor cost increases
(see para 4.26 of main report).
(e) Processing Charges
Materials Us$ 6.67 per ton of palm oil plus labor cost
of 80 US cents per ton of palm oil in 1970 rising to US$ 1.b0 in
1990.
(f) Selling Charges
To FOB only. Palm oil US$ 3.50 per ton, palm kernels
US$ 5.bO per ton. Includes transport to port, port handling,
documentation and JMO expenses.
(g)  Capital Outlay for Rehabilitation of Processing Facilities
Incremental production from 1971 through 1977 (the peak
year) represents approximately 2CF% of estimated total annual
production during the same period and processing plant rehabilitation
costs from 1971 to 1977 (see Annex 8, Table 2 and Annex 15, Table 6)
have been apportioned on this basis.
(4) Contingencies
With the exception of wages and salaries no increases in costs have
been assumed and a contingency provision of 10% has been added to all costs
(including wages and salaries) during the period 1970 - 1990.
