MEMORANDUM AND RECOMQENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
FOR A POPULATION, HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to Guinea-
Bissau in the amount of SDR 3.4 million (US$4.2 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
and would help to finance a population, health and nutrition project.
2.        Background.  Guinea-Bissau, one of the poorest countries in Sub-
Saharan Africa, has experienced increasing economic difficulties in the
recent past. In 1983, the Government began an ambitious program of econo-
mic stabilization which lost momentum just two years later due to delays in
implementing necessary institutional reforms. By 1985, the Government
deficit had risen to 362 of CGDP and the current account deficit to 302 of
GDP. Among other things, this has led to severe constraints on Guinea-Bis-
sau's capacity to import, resulting in chronic shortages of food, fuel,
spare parts, drugs and other basic items. The Bank has assisted the
Government in the design of a policy reform program Sl support of which IDA
is considering a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAL). The health sector
will benefit from the increased availability of foreign exchange made
possible by the SAL, but the delivery of basic health and family planning
services remains constrained by the followings (a) lack of management
capability within the Ministry of Public Health (MINSAP), coupled with an
inefficient organizational structure; (b) poor technical and financial
planning and weak policy development, exacerbated by the lack of data-based
analysis; (c) lack of adequate financing and shortages of foreign exchange,
caused by a shrinking national discretionary budget, reduced real alloca-
tions to the health sector, and serious macroeconomic Imbalances; and (d)
poor performance and low credibility of the present health system, due in
particular to inadequate financing of non-wage recurrent costs and a
shortage of qualified health care personnel. As a consequence, a high
percentage of Guinea-Bissau's population currently lacks access to basic
health care, contributing to morbidity and mortality figures that are among
the highest in the world.
3.        Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the project are: (a) to
improve the institutional capabilities of MINSAP in planning, management
and finance; and (b) to strengthen the delivery of health and family
planning services, especially at the periphery. To support MINSAP's
institutional development, the project would strengthen organizational and
technical capabilities, would introduce rational financial planning and
effective cost recovery, and would increase the availability of reliable
data for policy and program formulation. Basic health and family planning
services would be strengthened by a program of support for the investment
and recurrent costs of rural health services, and the implementation of an
in-service training program to upgrade skills of health personnel.

4.        Proiect DescriRtion.  The proposed project would address the
objectives listed above by (i) supporting a reorganization of MINSAP,
including the creation of a planning and evaluation unit and the separation
of hospital management from primary health care (PHC); (ii) introducing a
management information system and developing a reliable PHN data base;
(iii) implementing rational financial planning and management procedures,
including the introduction of effective cost recovery measures; (iv)
supporting implementation of a plan to improve drug system management; (v)
developing and implewvnting a model for routine supervision of PHC delivery
throughout the country's eight regions; (vi) rehabilitating and reequipping
some 25 health centers; (vii) providing drugs, vehicles, supplies and other
inputs to rural facilities to enable delivery of a critical minimal level
of PHC; and (viii) instituting a regular program of in-service training to
upgrade skills of health personnel at all levels. The project, to be
executed over three years, provides funds for civil works; vehicles,
furniture, materials and equipment; training and technical assistance; and
essential operating costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$4.4 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$4.1
million (94Z).  A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Guinea-Bissau
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached,
along with Staff Appraisal Report No. 6644-GUB, dated March 27, 1987.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank and Government have
developed a two-part lending program for Guinea-Bissau: (i) a core program
of investment in infrastructure, institutional support, and human resource
development; and (ii) an extended lending program whose size and composi-
tion over the next few years would be adjusted subject to Government action
to implement fundamental policy reforms. There are several justifications
for Bank involvement in the PHN sector. The proposed project, which would
be the Bank's first to focus on the PHN sector in Guinea-Bissau, would
strengthen the core program for human resource development. In addition,
support for the human/social sectors will be of particular importance
during the difficult adjustment period which lies ahead. Finally, the
Government has begun to take important steps to address key sector con-
straints. The Bank is in full agreement with these measures, and support-
ing them at this juncture would lead to long-term improvements in the
management and delivery of PHC in Guinea-Bissau.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the following
actions: (i) submission of the first in an annual series of three-year
comprehensive health sector operational programs, supported by a detailed
financial plan acceptable to the Bank (condition of effectiveness); (ii)
with regard to cost recovery, (a) establishment of a special account in the
National Bank of Guinea-Bissau for receipt of fees collected, and (b)
retention by MINSAP of 100? of these fees; (iii) annual review with the
Bank of the sector operational and financial plan, as well as the develop-
ment and recurrent budget for the following fiscal year, agreement on which



will be necessary before new commitments are entered into; and (iv) approv-
al of a formal national drug policy by March 31, 1988.
7.        Justification.  Benefits from the proposed project would include
strengthened institutional capabilities of MINSAP in management, planning,
policy development, and sector finance, which would enhance MINSAP's
ability to deliver PHN services effectively and efficiently. As institu-
tional reforms take root, the project would support improvements in service
delivery that would enable MINSAP to provide a basic critical level of PHC
especially at the periphery. About 50X of Guinea-Bissau's population would
benefit from the project as a result of improvements in the availability of
PHC.
8.        Risks.  Two risks are: (i) potential implementation diffirulties
due to MINSAP inexperience in executing major structural reforms, espe-
cially cost recovery; and (ii) unavailability of foreign exchange to import
critical input needs of the health sector. The first risk would be mini-
mized through the provision of technical assistance and in-service training
to key implementing departments throughout the project period. Regarding
cost recovery, the risk would be minimized through the detailed study of
appropriate cost recovery measures and implementation approaches during the
project preparation period. The second risk should be alleviated through
structural adjustment measures being undertaken by the Government, which
are expected to ease the internal and external financial imbalances and
improve foreign exchange availability. The Government has also provided
assurances that it will continue to place the highest priority on address-
ing the health sector's needs. Finally, both the Government and MINSAP are
firmly committed to the project, including the implementation of cost
recovery measures and overall improvement in sector financial management.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
