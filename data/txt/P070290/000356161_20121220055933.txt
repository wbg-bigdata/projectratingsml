F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overriding goal of this project is to assist the Nigerian Health authorities in their
efforts to redress the serious deterioration in the delivery of basic health care services
following decades of neglect and to build institutional capacities, paving the way for a
more sustained development of the health care system. More specifically, the project
would: (i) strengthen capacities for system management at the state level and encourage


                                               ii
an environment of broad based consultation; (ii) support improvements in the delivery of
primary health care services with a particular focus on maternal and child health and
reproductive health services; and (iii) assist the Federal Government to strengthen its
policy formulation and further develop a system to monitor the health sector
performance. (In Annex 1 of the PAD, the first sentence expresses the program goals
while the second expresses the PDO. Schedule 2 of the DCA ignores the program goals
and only includes the PDO. This ICR has opted for the DCA version).

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower in: (i) strengthening the capacities
for management of the health system at the State level; (ii) improving the delivery of
primary and secondary health care services with a particular focus on maternal and child
health and reproductive health services in participating States; and (iii) strengthening, at
the Federal level, policy formulation and delivery of secondary health care services with
a particular focus on maternal and child health and reproductive health services, and
further developing a system to monitor the performance of the health sector (amended
DCA of September 22, 2005).

1.   Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      By the late nineties, Nigeria had suffered through decades of political and financial mismanagement,
which had so negatively affected the social sectors that it ranked among the thirteen poorest countries in the
world in terms of the UNDP Human Development Index. Official estimates indicated that the proportion of
households living below the poverty line had risen steeply nationwide from 27% (1980) to close to 66%
(1996). With a GNP per capita estimated at $300 (1998), the average Nigerian was living on less than one
dollar per day.
2.       Health situation and Government response. During the decades of military rule preceding the
project, health outcomes had generally stagnated or deteriorated. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
noted that: (i) maternal mortality rates were significantly higher and rates of decline in infant mortality were
much slower than in other countries of similar income levels; (ii) total fertility and annual population growth
rates had declined between 1982 and 1997 (from 6.9 to 5.3 and from 3.2 to 2.6 respectively) but attributed
the decline to later childbearing rather than to improved access to family planning services; (iii) large
inequalities existed in the coverage of basic services and in health and nutrition outcomes for the poor and
non-poor with only 9% of the poorest women having access to a nurse or midwife at delivery and only 14%
of children from the poorest families fully immunized (compared with 58% of children from the richest
families); and (iv) a disproportionate burden of communicable diseases fell on the poor.
3.       In addition, the PAD estimated that Nigeria spent less than $5.0 per capita of public resources on
health care, considerably less than countries at similar socio-economic levels. Moreover, inefficiencies in
public expenditures (e.g., constitutionally-mandated fiscal transfers from federal to state and local
authorities, personnel costs often crowding out other essential inputs as well) as well as the division of
responsibility for health between the three levels of government which, in the Nigerian context, means that
the federal level has little leverage over the states and the states have little leverage over local governments
have all contributed to persistently poor health outcomes. The perceived decline in the quality of government
health services (deteriorated infrastructure and equipment, lack of drugs, low health staff morale, etc.) had
contributed to a dramatic reduction in the utilization of health services. In contrast, private sector services
had increased, with private expenditures estimated to represent over 70% of total health expenditures in
Nigeria and household out of pocket expenditures accounting for most of these expenditures.
4.      Finally, the PAD argued that Nigeria’s three tiered health system (with service delivery
responsibilities shared among federal, state, and local authorities) suffers from insufficient definition of roles
and responsibilities, varying capacity to manage resources and responsibilities, significant costs 1, and issues
of ownership and accountability.
5.      With the return of civil administration in 1999, the Government initiated a broad-based consultative
process to confirm its commitment to improving health care. The result was a Medium-Term Plan of Action
(2001-04) to address: (i) primary, secondary, and tertiary care; (ii) sexual and reproductive health (including
HIV/AIDS); (iii) disease control; (iv) drug production and management; and (v) sector organization and
management (including development coordination). The PAD noted that: (i) the objectives of the Medium-
Term Plan were generally reasonable but would probably require a ten-year time horizon; (ii) several key
issues affecting health service delivery were beyond the scope of the sector (e.g., public sector management,
fiscal decentralization, and civil service reform); and (iii) Bank support could only begin to address the
medium-term agenda while laying the groundwork for further support.
6.      Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. Consistent with the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) dated May 18, 2000 (Report No. 20309) and the draft CAS of March 23,
2000, the project focused on: (i) strengthening social services to support poverty reduction and community

 Management of health services at the different levels of government account for 26% of total health expenditure in
Nigeria, more than 6 times the total of all donor contributions.

                                                                                                                      2
development by strengthening the technical content and reliability of health services to meet the needs of the
poor and increasing the availability of services in poor communities; (ii) improving governance, efficiency
and productivity in the public sector by strengthening budget management, procurement, information
systems, and system management and promoting local autonomy and community involvement; and (iii)
providing modest support for private sector development by contracting private sector providers to improve
supplies and technical content of services and refining the project based on studies of the private sector.
7.       The project was expected to contribute to the overarching goal of poverty reduction through higher
productivity levels and improvements in health status. More specifically, it emphasized assistance to: (i) the
states in rebuilding a minimum capacity for delivering public services especially for the poor; and (ii) the
federal and state authorities in establishing the conditions for improved governance in the management of
public funds in the health sector through the development of expenditure programs, mechanisms of
accountability, and performance standards.
8.      Bank involvement was justified by its ability to leverage: (i) its knowledge and experience from
other countries in the implementation of similar operations promoting new ways of doing business in the
health sector (e.g., programmatic support, public/private partnerships and health financing option.); (ii) its
technical advantage of working in close collaboration with other networks (e.g., public sector management
and fiscal decentralization); and (iii) its financial contribution which would be important both in relative
terms and in conjunction with other development partners, such as the African Development Bank (AfDB) to
maximize the support provided to participating states.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
9.      With the overall objectives of assisting the Nigerian authorities to: (i) redress the deterioration in the
delivery of basic health care services; (ii) build institutional capacities; and (iii) initiate sustained
development of the health care system, the project had as Project Development Objectives to: (i) strengthen
capacities for system management at the state level and encourage an environment of broad based
consultation; (ii) support improvements in the delivery of primary health care services with a particular focus
on maternal and child health and reproductive health services; and (iii) assist the Federal Government to
strengthen its policy formulation and further develop a system to monitor the health sector performance.
10.     The original key indicators2, as defined in Annex 1 of the PAD, were linked as follows with the
Project Development Objectives (PDOs):
        Component 1: Strengthen capacities for system management at the state level
         Number of states with approved 3-year rolling and annual work plans
         Proportion of states having developed state health accounts
         Number of states with certified/audited financial statements
        Component 2: Improve the delivery of primary health care services
         Increased utilization of primary health care facilities
         Increased proportion of children under one year and under two years fully immunized
         Increased proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel (doctor, nurse, midwife)
        Component 3: Assist the Federal Government in implementing its health sector reform agenda
         Improved situation in the five areas of reform: provision of the basic package of services; legal
           and institutional framework; role of the private sector; financial and fiscal management; and
           human resources
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

  Only two of the indicators (availability and quality of services and births attended by skilled staff) were routinely
tracked by Government and the Bank until 2008 when the Additional Financing was approved.

(FMOH) and the states began discussions with the Bank to review the following issues under the project with
a view to restructure: (i) governance and capacity-building; (ii) program priorities; (iii) project financing
(counterpart requirements, budget categories and allocations); and (iv) monitoring and evaluation
arrangements.3 Changes in the DCA were officially requested in May and approved in September. The
project’s objectives were modified as follows: to assist the Borrower in: (i) strengthening the capacities for
management of the health system at the State level; (ii) improving the delivery of primary and secondary
health care services with a particular focus on maternal and child health and reproductive health services in
participating States; and (iii) strengthening, at the Federal level, policy formulation and delivery of secondary
health care services with a particular focus on maternal and child health and reproductive health services, and
further developing a system to monitor the performance of the health sector.
12.    In 2009, under the Additional Financing (AF), project activities were modified to finance: (i)
improvements in the Schools of Health Technology, Nursing, and Midwifery in 36 States; (ii) development
of primary health care services at community level (refurbishment, equipment, training, drugs and other
medical supplies, immunization, etc.).; and (iii) strengthened M&E systems at Federal and State levels.
13.     The PDOs remained unchanged, but the key performance indicators were modified/added to: (i)
incorporate the lessons of the previous five years of implementation; (ii) better describe the intended results
of the project; and (iii) strengthen the results focus of the monitoring and evaluation system. The additional
KPI are indicated below by component45:
        Component 1: Strengthen capacities for system management at the state level
         Percentage of states routinely linking State health plans with annual budgets
        Component 2: Improve the delivery of primary health care services
         Percentage increase in total out-patient visits in health facilities constructed/rehabilitated/fully
            furnished) under AF
         Percentage of pregnant women attending antenatal clinics
         Immunization rate (for both under-1 year and under-5 years)
1.4 Main Beneficiaries and Benefits
14.      Beneficiaries. The project was intended to benefit primarily poor Nigerians, who are the main users
of public health services. The national focus was expected to have a potentially important impact in terms of
reaching a large number of beneficiaries, particularly in terms of the availability and quality of basic health
services for targeted children and women. In addition to beneficiary populations, other expected beneficiaries
included: (i) the public health sector in general, which would benefit from activities aimed at strengthening
the health sector reform agenda and preparing the groundwork for more sustained development; (ii) State and
LGA health authorities, which would benefit from technical and managerial capacity building interventions;
and (iii) non-public and community entities, which would be expected to play enhanced roles.
15.      Benefits. Health benefits for the poor and especially for women and children comprised increased
access and improved quality of health care services 6 and, in the longer term, reduced mortality and
morbidity. Benefits for the health sector in general were expected to include: (i) improved management of
sector resources (information, planning, and coordination), particularly through plans and budget allocations
agreed on by State Governors and Health Commissioners; (ii) improved governance (ownership, decision-

  These issues are addressed in more detail under Section 2.2 (Project Implementation).

  The ISRs, commencing with Sequence 18, suggest that the Additional Financing Paper created new components but
the Paper does not explicitly say this. See Section 1.6 below.
5
  From 2008 the 3 of the new indicators were tracked by the Government and the Bank along with the 2 from the
original credit already being tracked. The fourth new indicator on immunization was already one of the original credit
indicators being tracked.
6
  A qualitative social assessment during project preparation found that, while lack of physical access to services reduced
utilization in some areas, the poor quality of health services was the principal reason that people were not using these
facilities.

                                                                                                                        4
making, and accountability), through implementation of subsidiary agreements defining the roles and
responsibilities of all parties in the implementation of the project; and (iii) improved performance (as
measured by improved processes, better outcomes, and increased credibility).
1.5 Original Components
16.      Component 1: Strengthen Capacity for System Management (All States, $53.78 million). All
interested States would be eligible to participate in this component up to a total amount of $1.5 million per
state. Sub-components areas comprised activities to support: (i) managerial processes and skills (e.g.,
improved budget management processes, state health accounts, and use of performance reviews); (ii)
technical skill development; (iii) the Health Management Information System (HMIS); (iv) access to
information and communication technology; and (v) research and studies.
17.      Component 2: Strengthen the Delivery of Priority Health Services (Qualifying States, $63.70
million). Selected States would be eligible, in addition to the amounts in Component 1, an average amount of
$3.5 million per state to support their programs, based on their perceived priority goals and objectives, as
reflected in their Project Implementation Plans and approved annually after discussion with the Bank. 7
Emphasis would be placed on improving the delivery of primary health care services and particularly: (i)
IMCI and strengthening immunization services; (ii) safe motherhood interventions, including the Mother-
Baby Package, strengthening of state nursing schools, and improved emergency obstetric care in selected
secondary care facilities; and (iii) communicable disease control, especially tuberculosis control. Though
each state would have its own priorities and needs, selected activities would be expected to: (i) result in
measurable improvements, particularly for the poor; and (ii) be perceived by the population as useful for
meeting their needs.
18.     The project would provide for: (i) rehabilitation and equipment of selected facilities, based on an
inventory and plan; (ii) improved access to water; and (iii) logistical capabilities (i.e. vehicles). The project
would provide funds to enable newly rehabilitated facilities to operate satisfactorily over a given period of
time, while mechanisms are put in place for ensuring sustainability.
19.     Component 3: Strengthen Capacity for key public health systems, functions and processes for
Federal Ministry of Health ($7.92 million). The project would provide assistance to the Federal Ministry of
Health to build capacity within the framework of the Government's Medium-Term Plan. Specifically,
assistance would: (a) strengthen capacity in the areas of health sector reform, systems development, and good
governance; (b) strengthen the health management information system, including both hardware and
software and capacity to assess the health sector performance; (c) support essential national health research
with a focus on health care financing; and (d) ensure project coordination, monitoring, and evaluation.
1.6 Revised Components
20.     The AF Project Paper proposed allocating the additional resources for: (i) rehabilitating the Schools
of Health Technology and Schools of Nursing and Midwifery ($16.53 million); (ii) supporting health
services ($54.06 million); and (iii) strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems and processes at
National and State levels ($9.41 million). Although it is not entirely clear from the Project Paper, the
additional resources seem to have been integrated into the original components.8
1.7 Other significant changes
21.     In addition to the project restructuring in 2005 and the additional financing in 2009, a number of
other important changes were approved during the original credit, including: (i) modification of procurement



7
  It was agreed that for this component, the Bank would finance a maximum of 35% on civil works, 45% on goods and
equipment, with the remainder for technical assistance and training.
8
  The Project Paper states that project was not changed though components were “grouped into 3 subsets to allow for
easier implementation?, but then presents the monitoring framework in terms of two components. The ISRs treat the
changes in the Project Paper as new components.

                                                                                                                      5
procedures, prior review thresholds (April 2005, July 2006); (ii) revision of the disbursement categories,
reallocation of the project proceeds, and changes in the subsidiary credit agreements with the states
(September 2006); and (iii) extension of the closing date from July 1, 2007 to July 1, 2008 (March 2007) and
subsequently to May 31, 20099. Finally, a reallocation of the remaining amounts of the credit was approved
in February 2012.
2.   Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
22.      Project preparation was influenced by the Bank’s efforts to define an appropriate approach for
assisting the country during the re-engagement process. On the one hand, the Interim Poverty Strategy
recognized the Bank’s role as one of “helping the Nigerians to build their capacity to manage their own
resources effectively,? utilizing government services, the private sector, and local communities. On the other
hand, the Bank’s project preparation team had clear ideas about the scope and objectives of a potential health
sector project.
23.      While recognizing the need for continued dialogue on health sector reform, the preparation team’s
more immediate concern in December 1999 was to fast-track the presentation of the project to meet: (i) the
short-term immediate need of continuing funding for those States which had benefited from the recently
closed Health Systems Fund; and (ii) the longer-term need of addressing the dilapidated state of health
services infrastructure which had been ignored over the previous decades of military rule. In the end, the
project was appraised in February 2002, approved by the Board in June 2002, and became effective in May
2003. Over the preparation period the Bank negotiated the technical content, administrative arrangements,
and potential political ramifications of the project design with Government to address immediate needs.
There were clearly political economy issues that had to be dealt with by the Bank in re-engaging the Country
that also manifested in the project preparation and design.
24.     Project preparation. In December 1999, in parallel with the preparation of the ICR for the Health
Systems Fund (HSF), the 16 participating States carried out Phase II Studies to lay the foundation for the
second phase. These 16 states were joined by nearly all of the other 20 States (except Kano State) interested
in participating in the second phase. Two project preparation workshops were conducted (with Bank
assistance) in January and February 2000, and States prepared project papers, which (along with the proposal
of the Federal Ministry of Health) were then consolidated into a proposal for consideration by the Bank.
25.     A Project Concept Note (PCN) was subsequently prepared and reviewed in May 2000. Four key
issues were discussed: (i) the size of the project, and particularly how FMoH had reduced the combined State
and Federal proposals (estimated at more than US$1 billion) to US$275 million (of which the Bank was
expected to finance US$240 million); (ii) the scope of the project, and more specifically, the phasing in of
the States; (iii) the role of the Federal Ministry in coordinating the States in a context where the States were
not interested in having FMoH assume such a responsibility; and (iv) the appropriate arrangements for
monitoring and supervising the project, given the spread of funds and activities over 37 different
implementing agencies (36 State Ministries of Health and one Federal Ministry of Health) and the
impossibility of covering the country with traditional Bank-style supervision missions.
26.     A pre-appraisal mission, comprising donor agencies active in the health sector in Nigeria for
consultative discussions on the Medium-Term Plan of Action and Health Sector Reform, was originally
announced for June 2000 but was subsequently postponed until September.10 In addition to addressing the
PCN review meeting issues, the mission informed the Government of the need for a Sector Policy Letter,



9
  The original and revised closing dates mentioned in the AF memorandum of February 12, 2008 are different from
those indicated in the DCA and the ISRs.
10
   The Federal Ministries of Finance and Health believed that the State Project Implementation Plans were sufficiently
advanced and that the Bank should “shelve? the pre-appraisal mission in favor of an immediate appraisal mission, but
the Bank insisted on a pre-appraisal mission.

                                                                                                                         6
recommended a number of key policy measures, and requested specific timeframes for the implementation of
these measures, considered as pre-requisites for a successful health systems project. The State Project
Implementation Plans (PIP) were reviewed and revisions requested by end January 200111 for appraisal in
February 2001. Correspondence after the pre-appraisal mission highlighted issues of the evolving project,
including: (i) the degree of readiness of the project; (ii) the allocations to and ceilings for the amounts to
individual states; and (iii) and the role of FMoH in coordinating the States.
27.     The February 2001 preparation mission noted the improvements in the State PIPs and concluded that
there was no need for further revisions of the State plans, but the Government had issues with: (i) the extent
of planning (and preparation) missions with consequent delays in approving the project, which had been
expected to be effective in June/July 2000; and (ii) the reduction in the amount of the credit from a two-
phased US$240 million project to a single US$120 million project 12 and in the number of States to
participate in the project. The delays in project approval were due to the challenge of the Bank reaching
agreement with the Government in terms of the scope of the project and what could realistically be achieved
especially given the post military context and the related political economy of the Bank re-engaging with the
Government at the time.
28.      The Decision Meeting (DM) was organized in May 2001, with the Bank confirming its decisions to:
(i) proceed with a project of US$125 million (but prepared to follow up with an additional IDA credit); (ii)
limit the number of States to the 25 which were considered “ready? in terms of procurement and financial
management; and (iii) demonstrate project support for the health reform process without overpromising on
the implementation of reforms. The DM also addressed specific issues related to the flow of funds and
monitoring and evaluation. Appraisal and negotiation of the credit were planned for June 2001 but deferred
by FMoH pending clarifications on the issues raised in February; when the Country Director confirmed no
changes in the Bank's position on these matters, preparation virtually ceased until another pre-appraisal
mission was organized in January 2002. This mission resulted in the final organization of the project
components, and the appraisal mission followed immediately thereafter in February 200213.
29.    Negotiations were conducted in April 2002, the project was approved by the Board on June 6, 2002,
and the DCA was signed on February 25, 2003. AfDB’s Board approved their portion of the project in
September 2002.
30.     Soundness of the background analysis. In view of the expectations of the new civilian leadership, the
project preparation team argued in the PCD memo that detailed economic and sector work (ESW) prior to
sector assistance was “idealistic?. At the PCD review meeting it was agreed that: (i) even if additional ESW
was required, it would be incorporated into the project itself; and (ii) an effective mechanism for dialogue
and coordination would be established between the Government and the other sectoral development partners.
31.     In addition, the PCD memo argued that this follow-on project would benefit sufficiently from the
lessons learned from the previous Health Systems Fund project14 as well as from other countries15. HSDP II


11
   The Bank requested extensive changes including: (i) additional information on health facilities and human resources;
(ii) more participation in the planning and implementation; (iii) clearer indication of how the plans fit into the State-
specific strategic plans; (iv) specific proposals for including the private sector and the communities; (v) discussion of
the long-term sustainability of the project benefits; and (vi) baseline data and targets on appropriate performance
indicators. The Bank concluded that “the need for a paradigm shift from a facility -centered planning to an
intervention-centered planning and for shifting the focus from structures to services is the single most important point
emerging from the mission’s review of the PIPs.?
12
   In its response, the Bank reiterated its March 2001 position that subsequent assistance would be through a separate
IDA credit, not a single credit bifurcated in two tranches, and would be based on the implementation performance of
this first credit.
13
   It should be noted that the challenges experienced during the appraisal phase are not uncommon in federal systems of
government like Nigeria.
14
   Curiously, the PAD does not cite the Imo State Health Project, though that ICR contains a number of interesting
conclusions and pertinent lessons; see Section 6 of this ICR which discusses the lessons learned.

                                                                                                                        7
intended to: (i) keep the project design simple; (ii) focus on results rather than supply-driven inputs; (iii)
expand the involvement and accountability of beneficiaries and stakeholders; (iv) implement effective
supervision strategies; and (v) ensure the availability of counterpart funding for effective implementation.
While the lessons learned were entirely relevant the Bank faced significant challenges in convincing the
Government in reflecting them in the project design.
32.      To support preparation, FMoF submitted a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) request, which was
approved (November 2000) after negotiation with the Bank over the nature, allocation (particularly between
the state and federal levels), and management of the proposed resources. The PPF16 was expected to finance:
(i) studies, seminars and workshops to mobilize relevant stakeholders and build consensus and ownership of
the proposed project; (ii) carry out of training activities to enhance the skills of staff responsible for the
preparation of the Project in the areas of procurement, financial management and health planning; and (c)
establish project implementation units in selected States and acquire essential office equipment, furniture,
and consumable items for these units.
33.      Government commitment. At Federal level, the Government was strongly committed to its vision of
the project, which would be national in its reach, flexible in the scope of eligible expenditures, and
coordinated by the Federal Ministry of Health. At State level, ownership and commitment obviously varied
among the 36 states; however, all but one State Government showed interest in investing in health through:
(i) their willingness to borrow money for these investments; (ii) the active participation of State
representatives (from early 2000 on) in preparing, revising and refining their project proposals; and (iii) the
creation by the States of a "forum" mandated to speed up project approval. The PPF contributed to the
Government’s objectives for mobilizing stakeholders, establishing state-level implementation units, and
training relevant project implementation staff; but it did not achieve the overall objective of contributing to a
smooth transition to the project implementation phase (see Paragraph 50 below).
34.      Assessment of the project design. The PAD’s discussion of the project design considered three
strategic options, four design alternatives, and several practical considerations. From among the strategic
options, it was decided to: (i) emphasize public sector support (while building consensus and capacity to
channel funds through the private sector in the future); (ii) consolidate public sector capacity, excluding new
construction, with the exception of local health facilities in seriously under-served areas and schools of
nursing, midwifery and health technology, if fully justified; and (iii) to focus on the State level who were
expected to provide support to participating LGAs since they have ultimate responsibility for primary health
care.17
35.      Among the design alternatives considered were: (i) adaptable program lending (APL); (ii) a capacity
building only operation; (iii) a limit of six States to benefit from the range of system strengthening
investments (Component 2); and (iv) program support18. Of these, the third was the most contentious and was
not deemed politically acceptable19. With Government’s insistence, the Bank finally agreed to 18 States that
were identified for Component 2 financing based on criteria (financial and procurement capacity; geo-
political representation; current level of indebtedness; and population) which, although not fully satisfactory
to the Bank, were accepted as being sufficiently fair and transparent by both the Forum of States and the
FMOH. In hindsight, the alternate option to the Bank insisting on a more limited project scope was at the risk



15
   The PCN cited India and Brazil as federal states with experiences relevant to the Nigerian context, but these
references were deleted from the PAD.
16
   The PPF in the amount of US$1.6 million had an original closing date of June 30, 2001, which was subsequently
extended to December 31, 2001 and then to June 30, 2002.
17
   The large number (774) and modest management capacities of LGAs made local interventions by the project
potentially unmanageable, and it was felt that strengthened States could provide technical support to participating LGAs
to carry out their work programs.
18
   This was recommended by the Quality Enhancement Review organized to review the proposed operation.
19
   To collectively oppose this option, the States formed a "forum" in late 2001, electing among themselves a secretariat
to argue the case.

                                                                                                                      8
of not engaging in the sector at a time when technical support was clearly required.
36.       Among the practical considerations guiding project design were: (i) the total credit amount available;
(ii) the need to have substantial funds in a state to achieve some progress; and (iii) the limited Bank capacity
for supervision. Since not all 36 states could participate in all the project activities, it was decided that the
project would provide: (i) basic support of a limited nature to all states; and (ii) more extensive program
support to a selected number of states. The Bank identified 18 states, and the AfDB agreed to co-finance
support to an additional 12 states for Component 2. The PAD acknowledged a number of design challenges
including: (i) project coordination and management at federal, state, and LGA levels; (ii) project supervision
by the Bank, AfDB and the federal authorities from the ministries of health and finance; and (iii) financial
management all related to the project scope which the Government insisted on.
37.      Risk assessment and mitigation. Despite the lengthy consideration of alternative designs and
programmatic options, the PAD: (i) identified only two types of risk, political commitment and management
capacity/coordination; and (ii) included very generic (and ultimately inadequate) risk mitigation measures
(e.g., annual reviews, dialogue, technical support and supervision, etc.). Six effectiveness conditions, eight
other conditions (some of which were included as covenants in the DCA), and three disbursement conditions
indicate that there was an awareness of the risks but that they would be addressed during implementation
rather than before.
38.       Quality at Entry. A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was conducted in February 2001, and the
preparation mission makes reference to a panel which identified the need to: (i) strengthen the analytical
underpinnings with a particular focus on clarifying the roles and responsibilities of different tiers of
government and the links between the project and the government's health sector reform program; (ii)
address potential problems related to project size, scope and manageability; and (iii) identify mechanics of
implementation which are agile and efficient. Some of these recommendations were addressed in the PAD.
It is clear that the Bank Team made significant attempts to address these recommendations, but as already
highlighted, significant compromises had to be reached with Government at a time when re-engagement was
critical.
2.2 Implementation
39.      The Credit became effective on May 23, 2003, with delays due: (i) initially to the lack of proper
office accommodation for the National Project Coordination Unit, the deposit of counterpart funds, and the
opening of bank accounts and signatories to the accounts; and (ii) subsequently to finalization of the project
implementation and financial procedures manuals. The AfDB-financed portion of the project became
effective on December 16, 2003.20
40.      As shown in Section G of the Data Sheet, the ISRs rated project performance with respect to the
Development Objectives (DO) as Unsatisfactory during the 18 months following effectiveness, although
Implementation Progress (IP) was considered Satisfactory for much of this period. For the subsequent six
years (May 2005-March 2011), the DO and IP remained MS or S. In October 2011, progress on the DO was
downgraded to MU in line with the QALP assessment (September 2010) that there was insufficient data to
track project achievements. The IP rating was maintained at MS through closing.
41.     Disbursement overview. Under the terms of the original Development Credit Agreement (IDA-
36530 UNI), the Bank was expected to finance US$127.0 million and the Borrower was expected to finance
US$26.2 million equivalent bringing the total project cost to US$153.2 million equivalent. Under the terms
of the Additional Financing (IDA 45220-UNI), the Bank was expected to finance US$90.0 million. Annual
and cumulative disbursements are shown in the following table:




20
  This is the date listed in the AfDB’s Project Completion Report; virtually every other document identifies June 28,
2004 as the effectiveness date.

                                                                                                                        9

42.      In 2004-05, slow disbursement was followed by project restructuring measures as the project sought
to reconcile the original equitable allocation of funds to participating states with the overspending by some
states. From March to September 2005, the Bank and the Nigerian authorities (FMoH, FMoF, and the
participating States) negotiated several disbursement related measures to streamline expenditures and resolve
the overspending issues. To streamline expenditures, it was decided to (i) eliminate the counterpart funding
requirement of 20% since slow release of these funds had slowed implementation progress and disbursement
and allow the credit to fully finance activities; (ii) increase the authorized allocation of the special accounts
and establish two unallocated "pools" of funds (one for FMoH and one for the States), with the State pool to
provide additional funding for states that exhaust their allocated resources; and (iii) replace the existing
disbursement categories with two major categories of expenditures (works, goods, services, and training as
one, and incremental operating expenses as the other).
43.       To resolve the overspending issue, it was decided that: (i) all participating states would revert to
their original credit allocations; (ii) 10% of each state's credit allocation would be deducted to create a pool
of funds 21 ; and (iii) pooled funds would be reallocated from the less performing states to the better
performing states based on the funds disbursed as of December 31, 2005 and on well monitored approved
work plans. 22 This proposal allowed for reimbursing the overruns and continuing to reward the better
performing States23 but raised the issue the potential discrepancy between the allocated and actual amounts
as defined in the Subsidiary Credit Agreements (SCAs) signed between the Federal Government and the
States. To prevent this discrepancy while also maintaining flexibility, the Government was informed of the
need to amend the SCAs retrospectively, that is, to reconcile the allocations after the Closing Date in line
with the actual amounts disbursed to each state.
44.     The modification of credit allocations and expenditures was repeated: (i) in 2008, when it became
clear that certain states had again overspent their allocations, and efforts were required to re-establish the
appropriate expenditures levels prior to allocating the additional financing resources; and (ii) in 2009, when
the Additional Financing specified the unallocated amounts to the states and FMoH.
45.   Implementation overview. Implementation was marked by repeated efforts to strengthen project
management and to expand the scope and increase the flexibility for using project funds.
46.     By September 2004, HSDP II was identified as a problem project due to delays (at both state and
federal levels) attributed to weak implementation capacity and the tardy availability of counterpart funds.
The March 2005 restructuring mission identified several issues, including: (i) political interference (related
mostly to project personnel) in implementation; (ii) weak management and IT capacity; (iii) insufficient
focus on MDG-related activities, particularly vaccination24; and (iv) inadequate flexibility in modifying the
annual work programs. The mission25 proposed several important modifications: (i) inclusion of Kano State
which was the only state not participating in the project; (ii) expansion of the project description to allow
provision of vaccines, activities related to federal medical centers, and support for secondary health care; and



21
   The pool was to be used to offset overruns by states having overspent their restructured allocation and to provide
additional resources for better performing states in terms of faster implementation.
22
   It was also agreed that a mid-term review would be held in August 2006 to establish the disbursement status of the
credit and to determine the final re-allocation of the credit before project closing in December 2007.
23
   Subsequently, fourteen States exceeded their post-restructuring credit allocations to such a degree that the cumulative
overruns exceeded (by US$28.5 million) the unallocated pool previously established to meet the needs of the States.
24
   Vaccines were not initially an eligible expenditure under the credit.
25
   According to the QALP-2, the March 2005 restructuring mission was considered the Mid-Term Review (which was
originally planned for December 2005).

                                                                                                                        10
(iii) funding for FMoH’s MDG program comprising 14 pilot states, irrespective of their performance rating
at the time. The corrective measures and changes were officially approved by the Bank in November 2005
as part of a restructuring.
47.     As part of the restructuring, IDA and AfDB support for Component 2 activities was extended to all
36 states and expanded to include additional civil works and support for both basic PHC services and
secondary and referral services, specifically linked to Maternal and Child Health (MCH). Over time, the
implementing agencies viewed the project as an extremely valuable contribution to state-level activities (as
shown in Annex 2a), but the Bank was increasingly concerned that the visible achievements at the input and
output levels did not constitute project impact. In addition, the restructuring arrangements left many states
unable to access the original project amounts allocated to them and were thus constrained to complete
previously approved work-plan activities. In the project’s last year of implementation, the Bank advised on
the need for Government budget to be made available to pay for all contracts under the project for the
affected states. Many states have already made the arrangements to make outstanding payments while others
were in the process of making outstanding payments at the time of ICRR .
48.     A formal additional financing request was submitted by the Government to the World Bank on
November 1, 2007. The Additional Financing memo justified the need for additional financing with the
following arguments that:
          the financing gap is a result of the growing interest and commitment among the Local Government
           Authorities (LGAs) and communities to achieving the MDGs through the delivery of PHC services
           and is, therefore, outside the control of the recipient or the implementing agencies;
          the additional financing would maximize the achievement of the PDO by facilitating the
           implementation of the minimum health care package at more ward and community levels and by
           increasing the capacity of Federal institutions in the states to deliver on the health MDGs by
           strengthening the health referral systems; and
          despite the 10% counterpart funding being invested by the government, the recipient is unable to
           finance the additional financing needs or to obtain additional funds from other support agencies on
           reasonable terms and in good time.
49.   The Bank agreed to a maximum of US$50 million due to IDA constraints and the competing
demands within the Nigeria portfolio.26 The Additional Financing was approved on September 30, 2008, the
DCA signed on February 5, 2009, and the project became effective on May 29, 2009.
50.      Implementation of the additional financing was characterized by increasing concerns within the
Bank on the likelihood of achieving the PDO and increasing pressure on the Nigerian authorities to justify
the impact of project financing on the beneficiaries. Within the Bank, the QALP of September 2010
criticized both the 2005 restructuring and the 2008-09 additional financing processes for not correctly
addressing either the design or the supervision issues which had become apparent. Although the Task Team
(with support from the Sector and Country Management) contested these conclusions and highlighted the
political context under which the project was operating, the QALP team remained unconvinced. This ICRR
acknowledges that given the political context and political economy at the time, the Bank had to make
compromises with the Government’s position that the M&E systems would be improved if they had
additional resources and time under the project to do so. The other options open to the Bank of either
cancelling the project or refusing to extend the closing date were difficult to make given the Government’s
position. This ICRR also acknowledges that the continuing demands by the Bank to demonstrate impact
were addressed by Government (see below) towards the end of the project when FMoH and the States
commissioned a review of the available data throughout project implementation that helped to demonstrate
key service delivery achievements at project sites in the states and policy achievements at federal and state
levels.



26
     The US$50 million was ultimately increased to US$90 million.

                                                                                                           11
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
51.     M&E design. Each of the preparation missions discussed monitoring and evaluation and agreements
were reached on: (i) consulting firms to be recruited for each of the geographical zones to provide
implementation support, including quarterly monitoring and evaluation; (ii) guidelines and appropriate
standard forms for project monitoring and evaluation reports to be developed; and (iii) joint annual
monitoring of the Project to be conducted by FMOH, FMOF, World Bank, and AfDB. Although the various
missions discussed indicator development and target setting (to be completed prior to appraisal) and baseline
data (to be completed prior to effectiveness), the PAD contains neither a full description of the proposed
M&E arrangements, nor a complete results framework with baseline data and targets.27 This appears to have
been a trade off to reaching an agreement on the substance of the project in order to proceed with the project
approval given the dire sector needs as well as the Government’s pressure to fast track preparation. This is
corroborated in the DCA which stipulates that the Government was expected to finalize the M&E
arrangements in the early phases of implementation (see footnote 27).
52.      Implementation. M&E design commenced after project effectiveness (and initial agreement on the
indicators in Annex 1 of the PAD). In July 2004, a stakeholders meeting on the reform process set up
committees to: (i) assess NHMIS policy; (ii) develop the national minimum data set and minimum set of
indicators; and (iii) design simplified and standardized forms to replace the existing NHMIS forms. These
led to the adoption of revised NHMIS policy with level-specific indicators; standardized health facility
registers; revised data collection formats; and instructional manuals on the facility registers and the data
collection formats. Throughout this process, the ISRs appropriately rated M&E as unsatisfactory in the
absence of actual data to track implementation progress.
53.     In 2006, the revised NHMIS tools were endorsed for use nationwide by the 49th National Council on
Health (NCH) meeting (February)28; a Federal Health Development Coordinating Committee meeting was
held to acquaint members with the products of the reform process (July); and six consulting firms were
engaged, assigned to monitor all states within their geopolitical zone, and trained to conduct quarterly field
assessment of project performance. The Bank supported an assessment of M&E gaps at the project level in
2009 and based on this, states included system strengthening plans in their 2010 work plans. Following this,
the ISR upgraded M&E to MS where it remained until December 2009.
54.      The newly adopted system did not perform as anticipated. However, funding for M&E activities was
not prioritized by Federal and State PIU management and many of these plans could not be implemented. As
mandated, the consultants compiled quarterly performance assessment reports on a State-by-State basis, but
the findings were not subsequently collated to zones and national levels making the assessment of impact at
those levels difficult. Further, most of these reports as well as States and Country Portfolio Performance
Review (CPPR) reports emphasized project processes and outputs instead of outcomes. In February 2008 (in
anticipation of the request for additional financing), the consultants were convened to assess the impact of
the project, but they concluded that the M&E was faulty, instituted too late in the life of the project, and
unable to produce outcome data for effective assessment of the impact at aggregate levels beyond the project
sites themselves.29 While an effort was made to collate the state reports to establish a retrospective view of
the project’s impact at the geographical zone and national levels, the assessment emphasized processes and



27
   The issue of M&E was effectively postponed, as a DCA covenant required that “the Borrower shall cause to be
prepared and furnished to the Association by December 31, 2002: (i) detailed instruments for monitoring and evaluation,
including data collection forms, reporting formats and analytical methodologies for use by the National Project
Coordination Unit, Participating States, and LGAs; (ii) targets and schedules for project inputs, process, output and
outcome indicators; and (iii) terms of reference for the monitoring and supervision consultants.?
28
   The communiqué issued at the conclusion of the meeting identified a number of problems affecting the National
HMIS, including lack of political will, insufficient funding to print the forms, competing forms promoted by the
development partners, etc.

(February 2008), p. 12.

                                                                                                                   12
outputs and the data of uncertain completeness and quality.30
55.      In addition to meeting the financing gaps and consolidating PDO achievements, the Additional
Financing was also justified in part by the argument that M&E remained a “continuing challenge? and
required additional time and resources to strengthen its systems and processes. M&E would focus on a
reduced number of states, and firms were again envisioned to ensure adequate supervision, monitoring and
evaluation. In addition, the Project Paper proposed a revised results monitoring framework, and it was agreed
that the 2008 NDHS would provide baseline data and a 2012 NDHS would be organized to assess project
impact.31
56.     In early 2011, an analysis of National HMIS assets, gaps, and proposed actions raised the same
issues as those raised in 2000-02. In late 2011, as in 2008, FMoH recruited consultants to assist the states
(who also recruited their own consultants) in collecting and collating the information for the end of project
impact assessment, and the report has provided the data that has been reviewed and utilized for the ICR.32
57.      Utilization. The DCA (Schedule 4) called for FMOH to establish a National Project Steering
Committee comprising representatives of all of the implementing agencies to ensure the effective utilization
of the M&E information for policy direction for implementation of the project. Schedule 4 identified the
information to be provided by the PCU to the Project Steering Committee at planned intervals during the
year. Neither the Steering Committee nor the scheduled meetings seem to have been implemented. The
World Bank relied on: (i) its own supervision missions to the States; (ii) joint supervision missions organized
with other stakeholders such as FMOH, FMOF and NPC; (iii) annual review meetings33; and (iv) periodic
CPPR organized by the World Bank to evaluate project performance. There is little indication that the
information available was used to assess the project or to manage change in its implementation.
58.      M&E is rated negligible, based on the Independent Evaluation Group’s (IEG) criteria for assessing
the design (negligible), implementation (modest), and utilization of the data produced by the M&E system
(negligible). As noted in the “Lessons Learned? section of this ICRR, the importance of a results-focus and
approach with detailed M&E systems and measures with accountability at all levels has now been
incorporated in the Governments strategic health plans as well as in the follow-up health project financed by
the Bank. See details in Section 6 of this ICRR.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
59.      Environment. Under the original credit, the PAD determined that the project focus on rehabilitation
(rather than new construction) of health facilities did not raise any significant environmental issues. The
project was therefore considered Category C, although the PAD noted that adherence to WHO guidelines on
waste management would be emphasized in the operational manual and in staff training. 34 Further, as noted
in the PAD, no safeguard policies were triggered.
60.      Based on the results of the original credit and a consideration of the activities identified under the
additional financing, the project was subsequently classified as a Category B (some expected minimal site
specific impacts to the environment and humans), triggering the environmental assessment (OP/BP 4.01)
safeguard to be addressed through the preparation of an Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF). The framework was prepared in August 2008 and disclosed in-country and at the Info shop prior to
effectiveness of the additional financing.
61.      The 2010 QALP criticized: (i) the Project Implementation Manual’s inadequate definition of the


30
   The ICR mission was only able to find 27 out of the 37 state-level reports, and of the 27 many were incomplete.
31
   These Project Paper arrangements are unclear: (i) the source of the data in the results framework could not be
confirmed; (ii) the use of the 2008 DHS was only asserted in the QALP and never actually analyzed; and (iii) there was
no NDHS in 2012 as planned although one is planned to be conducted in 2013 with results expected by 2014.
32
   Two States (Niger and FCT) carried out end-of-project detailed evaluations.
33
   Records of four Annual Review Meetings were found: for 2003 and 2004 and for 2010 and 2011.
34
   A National Waste Management Plan was approved in 2006.

                                                                                                                    13
NPCU’s responsibilities for reporting on environmental compliance; and (ii) the elementary nature of the
ESMF, which was prepared at the federal level and had no state-by-state specificity. Subsequently, in 2011
the National Council on Health: (i) directed proprietors of all health care institutions (public and private) to
comply with the 2007 NCH resolution on the implementation of the National Policy on Injection Safety and
Health Care Waste Management; and (ii) established a technical committee to monitor implementation and
enforce compliance. Project staff also participated in Environment clinics arranged by the Bank with a view
to enhance their safeguards knowledge and skills.
62.       Social: Under the original credit, the PAD highlighted the project’s purpose of facilitating access to
services to groups previously neglected, and stated that improvements in the project would put in place a
monitoring and evaluation system to examine the utilization of public health facilities and the impediments to
access by disadvantaged groups, including demand side factors. In terms of the participatory nature of the
project, the PAD pointed out the need for: (a) involving communities in decision-making; (b) addressing
gender issues in the design of interventions; and (c) raising the quality of public sector health services (e.g.
access to drugs, qualified personnel). Furthermore, the PAD stated that during the life of the project,
community participation would be promoted through the participation of village health committees in the
management and oversight of local health facilities. These recommendations were implemented to varying
degrees by states, however, due to the geographic and supervision complexities of the project it was
challenging for FMOH or the Bank to verify compliance in all project sites.
63.      Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management. The PAD noted that: (i) the existing
federal and state procurement laws and practices were neither efficient nor transparent and contributed to a
general lack of appropriate procurement planning; and (ii) overall weak financial management capacity was
compounded by the dearth of professionally qualified accountants in the public sector. Supervision of
fiduciary arrangements was complicated by: (i) the problems anticipated as a result of past Bank project
experience; (ii) the ongoing national procurement and financial management reforms intended to remedy
these problems and affecting project procedures and practices; and (iii) the sheer number of implementation
units and transactions occurring during project implementation.
64.      Procurement. The assessment of procurement capabilities, conducted during project preparation,
found that most State MOH health procurement units had some prior experience with IDA financed projects
and guidelines. States which had participated in the Health Systems Fund were therefore expected to provide
assistance to those states which had not participated, thereby enhancing efficiency and transparency in the
management of procurement under the project. The project’s overall risk was rated “substantial?.
65.       The assessment proposed common corrective measures including: (i) recruitment of procurement
specialists by Federal and State-level PIUs by credit effectiveness; (ii) preparation by each PIU of a detailed
first year procurement plan as a condition for disbursement; (iii) organization of contract management
workshops soon after effectiveness; and (iv) participation in advanced procurement courses at designated
training institutions by relevant PIU staff. In addition, assurances that recently trained staff would not be
subject to turnover were required. Given previous difficulties encountered (under the HSF I and Essential
Drugs Projects) for the procurement and distribution of pharmaceuticals, it was determined that procurement
would be limited to critical requirements and subject to strict Bank guidelines.
66.       These measures were implemented as were the proposed mitigation measures, including quarterly
ex-post reviews of procurement actions. Throughout project implementation, procurement was consistently
rated satisfactory by the ISRs, though the procurement reviews noted: (i) some weaknesses among the
implementing states in procurement planning, tendering and record management and particularly the and
contract administration; and (ii) in spite of the assurances given by the respective State governments that
staff turnover will be minimal when this was identified as risk areas in the project preparation, there were
still few cases of political interference and project team turnover throughout the life of the project mostly
attributable to natural career progression. The Bank provided support to address weaknesses identified and
the situation improved in a number of states in the later phases of project implementation.

67.      Financial Management. During project preparation, the principal issue was the arrangement for the
                                                                                                             14
flow of funds. The Government’s official position was that each state should have its own special account,
but the Bank was concerned that the proliferation of special accounts (Federal, 36 States, and the Federal
Capital Territory) would become unmanageable. Before eventually acceding to the Government’s position,
the Bank proposed potential compromises at each stage of the preparation process to establish: (i) prior to
appraisal, a federal-level special account to disburse funds into 5 second generation special accounts at the
zonal level for disbursement into state sub-accounts; (ii) at appraisal, 13 special accounts (12 for the grouped
states and one for FMOH); (iii) at negotiations35, 19 Special accounts (Federal and 18 Special accounts to be
shared by the 36 States and the Federal Capital Territory) until a permanent solution could be agreed upon36;
and (iv) prior to DCA signature, state-level Project Financial Management Units (PFMU) authorized to
request a separate special account once an acceptable PFMU had been established.
68.       The Bank concluded that overall financial management risk was substantial, but could be reduced if:
(i) the proposed financial management action plan, comprising almost a dozen actions, was implemented;
and (ii) the conditions for credit effectiveness were met.
69.       During project implementation, the principal FM issue involved inadequate computerized systems
(for budgeting and accounting) at the state level, with the resulting mix of manual and computerized
accounting systems contributing to insufficient internal controls comprising unretired advances, ineligible
expenditures (and over claims), and lack of adequate supporting documentation. In-depth discussions with
the Project Staff revealed that the root cause of unretired advances, over-claims and inadequate
documentation was largely attributable to the use of the Bank’s procedures in travel management under the
project as against Government’s travel management policy37. In order to address the issue the Team worked
with FMoF and Bank’s LOA to allow the use of country systems in this respect. However after a year into its
implementation, the government again opted to revert to the full use of Bank’s procedures. At the time of the
QALP2 review (2010), progress had been made on reducing the amounts of the unretired advances and
ineligible expenditures, but progress on other FM issues was reported as limited and unsatisfactory. The FM
risk rating was modest.
70.       In 2012, prior to closing, the FM supervision report for 20 states reviewed the status of unretired
advances, ineligible expenditures, and insufficient documentation and concluded that the risk rating for 18 of
them was either moderately satisfactory or satisfactory. This finding is consistent with the ISRs which rated
financial management as moderately satisfactory or satisfactory throughout project implementation. In order
to help build the Financial management capacity, the Bank Team introduced a number of capacity building
initiatives namely: three-day Bank sponsored training for Project Accountants, Internal Auditors and the
head of project financial management units; and training sessions were incorporated into yearly financial
management missions to the states. The team’s efforts brought about improvements in the project’s financial
management arrangement despite all the challenges faced in terms of huge geographical spread and security.
Some of the States had security challenges that did not facilitate easy access for follow up visits and actions.
There are no outstanding audit reports.
2.5         Post-completion Operation/Next Phase



35
  At negotiations, the Bank initially proposed state-level special accounts, provided that a Financial Management Unit
be created in the Office of the State Accountant General to process the financial transactions of all World Bank financed
projects in that State, but this proposal was unacceptable to the Government.
36
  Those States implementing Components 1 and 2 would share a Special Account with a State implementing only
Component 1, with the Special Account domiciled in the State Ministry of Health implementing Components 1 and 2
under the Credit.

37 The Bank’s policy requires trip advances to be fully accounted for and documented except for MTV however; on the
contrary this was not required by the government policy.


                                                                                                                      15
71.       The HSDP 2 PAD expected that project sustainability would be determined by: (i) the degree of
ownership of key stakeholders; (ii) the development of implementation capacity; and (iii) the timely
availability of adequate financial resources, including counterpart funds.
72.      With respect to the institutional issues related to ownership by key stakeholders, many states have
learned from the project experience and are planning to take them into account in the post-project phase. As
noted by comments on the ICRR from some states (see Annex 6), these lessons are significant and relevant
for them going forward. In particular, states implementing the follow up results-based financing project,
Nigeria State Health Investment Project (NSHIP), have already taken the lessons into consideration in the
design and pilot phase of the project and early results from these pilots are impressive. It is also worth
noting that most of the states’ project implementation units have been retained by the State ministries of
health which will maintain the capacity developed under the project and the likelihood of their implementing
of lessons learned from HSDP 2.
73.        The HSDP 2 experience has resulted in two positive post completion operations. First, the recently
Board approved (April 2012) NSHIP, a five-year, $170 million credit and grant will build on the lessons
learned from HSDP 2 by: (i) financing and focusing on tangible and measurable results: rather than
financing inputs, health facilities receive funding based on the quantity and quality of services provided; (ii)
establishing robust M&E measures: a clear set of indicators to be monitored has been established, and
achievements are to be independently verified using reviews of health facility registers, visits to patients
homes, regular health facility surveys, and more frequent household surveys38;. (iii) limiting the geographic
scope: initially the new project is being implemented in only three states with substantial amounts of external
technical assistance to facilitate implementation; (iv) fixing clear state allocations: the amount of money
available per state for the RBF is limited and states cannot overspend without restructuring; and (v)
financing operating costs: recognizing the critical problem posed by the lack of operating budgets at the
facility level, performance-based payments are provided directly to the participating facilities.
74.      Second, in addition to the NSHIP, the Government, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the
Bank are implementing work that aims to promote evidence-based decision making on quality and resource
tracking for improved health service delivery in Nigeria. The specific objectives are to: (i) provide robust
evidence on quality of health services over time; (ii) track resource flows from the state government through
line ministries to the service delivery units; and (iii) disseminate the data and create high level of public
awareness. The experience from HSDP 2 and other donor financed health projects have been instrumental in
defining the challenges within the sector and exploring the means to address them.
3.   Assessment of Outcomes
75.    To facilitate the assessment of outcomes, the following discussion is linked to the specific results of
the PDO indicators and Intermediate Outcome indicators in the Section F of the Data Sheet.
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
76.     The overall relevance of the project is rated Substantial based on an assessment of “High?
relevance for the project objectives and a “Modest? relevance for the project design as described in the
following sections.
77.       Relevance of the project objectives. In the broad strategic context, the joint financing of the project
by the World Bank and AfDB served as a basis for the eventual joint partnerships (with DFID, USAID, and
other agencies). Beginning with the Interim Country Assistance Strategy (2002) and continuing with the
Country Partnership Strategy (FY05-FY07 andFY10-FY13), project objectives were aligned with the Bank’s
priorities and anticipated several major orientations by: (i) implementing a health systems approach; (ii)
emphasizing governance and capacity building in the public sector; and (iii) introducing innovations in the


38
  Because payments to states, LGAs, and facilities are linked to performance as measured by these data, there will
almost certainly more attention paid to data. In addition, there is financing for a randomized trial of the effectiveness of
results-based financing.

                                                                                                                          16
financing instruments and modalities for supporting the reform process in general and state and LGA-level
priorities in particular.39
78.       In the sectoral context, the project was consistent with the series of strategic directions adopted by
the Federal Ministry prior to project effectiveness (the Development Policy Letter, the Medium-Term Health
Plan, etc.) and during project implementation (the Health Sector Reform Program, the draft National Health
Bill, the NSHDP, etc.). The QALP judged the project’s concept and strategic approach to be highly relevant,
its three specific DOs clear, and its content appropriate but with insufficient focus on LGAs. The objective
continues to be relevant to date.
79.      Relevance of the project design. Project design was significantly influenced by Government
pressure to: (i) include all 36 States and the FCT in Component 1 and 34 ‘qualifying’ States in Component 2
(including 12 co-financed by the AfDB; (ii) allocate equal amounts to each State (US$1.5 million under
Component 1 and US$3 million to each ‘qualifying State’ under Component 2), irrespective of an individual
State’s needs; and (iii) establish financial management units in each of the participating states. Given the
context of the transition to civilian rule, the dire need to improve service delivery throughout the country, and
the re-engagement of the Bank in the health sector, the design was of moderate relevance. However, the
choice of this design had significant implications for managing project resources at numerous levels. The
design also required more focus to be at the LGA level rather than at the state level for better results (for
Component 2) given the LGA responsibility for PHC service delivery.
80.       In addition, given Nigeria’s fragile operating environment (particularly in the early 2000s following
its return to civilian rule), the substantial operation-specific risks, and the inclusion of over 30 implementing
entities, a more robust institutional analysis, risk assessment and set of mitigation measures were called for
as were more detailed accountability arrangements. There were well-known problems associated with: (i)
institutional relationships (more specifically insufficient leverage between the federal, state, and local
authorities); (ii) potential political pressures (to include activities, change personnel, etc.); and (iii) variable
technical and administrative capacities at the various levels. But since there were no immediate solutions,
they were not adequately factored into the resulting design by the Government and were finally accepted by
the Bank.
81.      Finally, the project design was affected by (i) the scale of planning required, and ((ii) the inadequate
M&E arrangements. The project implementation plans (PIP) prepared early in the preparation process were
an excellent initiative but proved to be time consuming and unwieldy (in the absence of adequate information
technology at state level at the time)40; they were subsequently maintained in various formats by the states
but were difficult to aggregate.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
82.       Overall, this project supported the Government’s efforts at reversing the deterioration in the
delivery of basic health services, building institutional capacities in the sector and providing support for the
development of policies to strengthen the sector. In relation to the project’s specific objectives, state and
federal ministries of health today have better capacity to manage the health system in collaboration with
other partners and stakeholders as seen by the results focus of the current strategic health development plans
for all states and nationally. The project result in terms of primary health care service delivery especially in
the area of MCH intervention interventions has significantly improved in the areas of interventions. The
project has also supported Government’s efforts to strengthen policy formulation as wel l as established an
annual review process to monitor the health sector performance. As laid out in the Data Sheet of this report,
the majority of the project’s outcome and intermediate outcome targets were either completely or partially

   See the Country Progress Strategy Progress Report (FY10-FY13), pp.1-2. The fourth shift mentioned in the CPS, of
focusing on troubled states, was not addressed by HSDP II during implementation.

   In 2000-0, the 38 project implementation plans (PIP) comprised 100+ pages with detailed budget tables, and most
circulated in hard copy, with only limited DHL, mail, and fax services.

                                                                                                                 17
achieved, particularly at the project intervention levels 41 . Sections 2.5 and 6 of this ICRR provide
information on the legacy of this project in terms of improvements in the sector over the life of the project as
well as the approach of the Government in improving the impact of its planning, implementation and
assessment activities in the sector. These new approaches are already being piloted with the Bank support in
the follow up project based on lessons from this project.
83.       The overall efficacy of the project is rated as Substantial: (i) Modest for the first phase (before
restructuring of original credit) of the project; and (ii) Substantial during the last two project phases (after
restructuring of the original credit and during additional financing). These ratings are based on a summary of:
(i) the project's results (as seen in the Data Sheet); (ii) the quantitative and qualitative outputs (as presented in
Annexes 2a and 2b); and (iii) the weighting of results in terms of actual disbursements at restructuring,
additional financing, and closing (as shown at the end of this section). Despite the significant achievements
at the health facility level, the weak M&E arrangements limit attribution of these achievements to changes at
the state or national levels.
84.      Project Development Objective 1: Strengthen capacities for system management at the state
level and encourage an environment of broad based consultation. Among the four outcome indicators
linked to this objective (OI 1-4), two were fully achieved, one partially achieved and no data for one.
        OI 1: The KPI Report noted that as part of the process of adopting the 5-year National Strategic
         Health Development Plan (NSHDP) in 2009, all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)
         with support from the project also approved their 5-year plans between 2009 and 2010.
        OI 3: Although only 23 states confirmed the publication of their annual certified/audited accounts,
         the KPI Report noted that, because state legislatures cannot legally appropriate funds unless audited
         accounts are published publicly yearly, it is presumed that all states have published their annual,
         certified accounts because they have been implementing their annual budget yearly since 2004.
85.      For OI 2 (states having developed state health accounts), the KPI Report noted that 20 states have
conducted such exercises. For OI 4 (states routinely linking state health plans with annual budgets), no
information was available.
86.      At the level of the intermediate objective indicators, the project partially achieved improving
planning and managerial capacities (IOI 1) as measured by the proportion of activities carried out. Based on
34 reporting states, the proportion of planned activities carried out varied from a low of 63% (2008) to a high
of 77% (2009). At state level, 11 states carried out 80% of their planned activities over the duration of the
project, while two states (Benue and Oyo) implemented over 90%. Three states (Enugu, Lagos, and Osun)
implemented less than 50% of their planned activities.
87.    Among the other intermediate objective indicators, three were achieved: establishing MOUs with
the LGAs (IOI 2), upgrading internet communications (IOI 8), and promoting studies (IOI 9).
         IOI 2: Overall, among the 23 reporting states, 308 Local Government Areas (LGAs) signed MOU;
          MOUs were only required by the project for those LGAs where implementation activities took
          place. The number of signed MOU increased by about 30% per year (except for 2008).
         IOI 8: Based on the KPI Report, the number of functioning internet connectivity sites increased
          from 20 in 2004 to 95 in 2011.
         IOI 9: Based on 23 reporting states, the number of studies carried out varied considerably from year
          to year with a low of 5 (2007) and a high of 100 (2011).

  Given that the data were: (i) collected based on poorly defined indicators leading to variations in interpretation and
collection methods from state to state, (ii) involved 37 states, 29 indicators, and nine years of implementation and (iii)
vary in quality and completeness from state to state, it has been a significant challenge to measure achievement at the
aggregate/national level. FMOH sought to establish a performance index for the states, and this might have been an
interesting approach for the project, but the data are incomplete. See FMOH, Semi-Annual HMIS Report (January-June
2009), pp. 33ff.

                                                                                                                       18
88.       In addition, the project did achieve IOI 6, with 92% of LGAs implementing the minimum HMIS
package (based on 28 reporting states); a similar indicator (IOI 18) was not measured at Federal level.
Unfortunately, these combined efforts did not translate into an increased proportion of states producing
satisfactory annual HMIS report (IOI 7). Only five states published an annual HMIS report at least 50% of
the time (FCT, Kogi, Niger, Kebbi, and Edo).
89.    Based on these achievements, the project’s results on this development objective is Modest overall
(Modest during the first two phases and Substantial for the third phase).
90.       Project Development Objective 2: Support improvements in the delivery of primary health
care services with a particular focus on maternal and child health and reproductive health services.
Among the five outcome indicators, the project: (i) achieved its targets for increasing outpatient and inpatient
attendance (OI 5); and (ii) partially achieved its targets for ante-natal consultations (OI 8), skilled birth
attendance (OI 7); and childhood immunization (OI 6). Increases in the TB detection rate were also partially
achieved (OI 9) and an increased number of TB patients under DOTS (IOI 16) was achieved. The data
presented are mostly representative of project site achievements and a few at state aggregate level. In
addition, AFDB rated its achievement outcome for this objective as “Good? based on the increase in
utilization and access to PHC services.
91.      As shown in the following table, the number of outpatient visits (OI 5) increased progressively from
2004 to 2010 before declining in 2011 (where data for the whole year was incomplete at the time of the KPI
Report); the number of inpatient visits (OI 5) fluctuated significantly for reasons which are not explored in
the KPI Report.

Eleven states more than tripled the number of outpatient visits in the project facilities (Benue, Kwara,
Bauchi, Borno, Kaduna, Sokoto, Anambra, Enugu, Delta, Edo, and Ondo). Eleven states more also than
tripled the number of inpatient visits in the project facilities (Benue, Bauchi, Borno, Kaduna, Katsina,
Sokoto, Enugu, Delta, Edo, Ekiti, and Ondo).
92.       As shown in the following table, results for OI 8 (antenatal services in project facilities), OI 7
(skilled birth attendance in all facilities), and OI 6 (immunization/DPT3 for children 0-11 months in project
facilities) also had positive results (though admittedly from very low bases):

Seven states more than tripled the number of ANC visits in the project facilities (Benue, Bauchi, Borno,
Katsina, Enugu, Ekiti, and Ogun). Eleven states more than tripled the number of skilled deliveries in the
project facilities (Kogi, Kwara, Nasawara, Bauchi, Borno, Yobe, Kaduna, Abia, Delta, Edo, and Ondo).
Fourteen states more than tripled the DPT immunization rate for children 0-11 months attending the project
facilities (Benue, Kwara, Nasawara, Bauchi, Borno, Jigawa, Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, Anambra, Enugu, Ekiti,
Ogun and Ondo).
93.       Among the intermediate outcome indicators, the following table shows that on an annual basis,
gains were made on the establishment of functioning cold chains (IOI 13), PHC facilities offering essential
obstetric care (IOI 14 and essential laboratory examinations (IOI 15). Laboratory services offered more than

                                                                                                                        19

94.       The project’s impact on human resources demonstrates that (i) targets for strengthening the health
training institutes (IOI 10-11) were partially achieved; (ii) large numbers of staff were trained in ELSS, LS
and IMCI at benefiting schools (IOI 12) and in DOTS (IOI 5); but (iii) the proportion of staff trained
remained constant (IOI 3 and IOI 4).
95.      A total of twenty states improved one or more key service delivery indicators at project sites over
the duration of the project: Benue, Kogi, Kwara, Nasawara, Bauchi, Borno, Jigawa, Yobe, Kaduna, Katsina,
Kebbi, Sokoto, Anambra, Enugu, Abia, Delta, Edo, Ekiti, Ogun, and Ondo. The fact that many of these states
had improvements in several areas emphasized by the project is a positive indication of the project’s
contribution.
96.      In terms of the achievements of the AfDB support, details of the Project Completion Report by
AfDB can be found in Annex 8 of this ICRR. The AfDB’s stated project objective is to improve delivery of
PHC services by restoring a minimum level of quality in the provision of public sector health services
targeted to the poor. Based on AfDB’s assessment, in the 12 states it supported under this component, 144
PHC facilities and 25 training institutions were rehabilitated while 18763 health workers and 417 tutors were
trained. This support led to (i) increased access to PHC services (25% increase in utilization, 30% increase
in attendance of deliveries by skilled personnel, 40% increase in numbers of women delivering in health
centers, 63% increase in outpatient attendance); (ii) improved learning environment and quality of training at
the health training institutions; and (iii) improved knowledge and skills of tutors resulting in improved
quality of training at the training institutions. Overall, AfDB rated its achievement outcomes as Good
according to its four point rating scale ranging from 1 (poor) to 4 (Very Good).
97.     Overall the project’s investments achieved good results at the level of the health facilities which
were supported. However, given the limited scope of the project with only 2% of PHC facilities nationally
having received project support) it is challenging to assess the project’s impact on national indicators, as
shown below by the various national surveys conducted over the period of project implementation:
                                   Table 6: Comparison of survey results for selected indicators
                                            1999               2003                2005       2006           2007 2008         2010

The results in the table above have generally been maintained except on the full immunization of children
12-23 months where the different surveys indicate genuine progress.
98.       The project’s results on this development objective were Substantial overall (Modest during the
first phase and Substantial in the latter two phases).
99.       Project Development Objective 3: Assist the Federal Government to strengthen its policy
formulation and further develop a system to monitor the health sector performance. The one outcome
indicator linked to this objective (OI 10:Improved situation in the five reform areas) was achieved. Of the
two intermediate outcome indicators: (i) the target for disseminating policies (IOI 17) was achieved and the
target for carrying out performance assessments (IOI 19) was partially achieved.

                                                                                                                                              20
100.      Two areas are worth noting with respect to policy formulation. First, the operations of the National
Council for Health (and to a lesser extent the State Councils for Health), supported in large measure by the
project, proved to be an important source for exchanging ideas, as shown by the following table summarizing
the subjects of the memoranda presented annually:

101.     Second, several states made concerted efforts to pilot certain health service delivery ideas; among
these were:
     the Ondo State Safe Motherhood (Abiye) Program, which sought to register all pregnant women,
        provide each with a free mobile phone and a health team to improve referral and treatment. Within a
        year of implementation, the ANC registration of pregnant women, deliveries attended by skilled
        attendants and immunization rates significantly increased;
     the Jigawa State Gunduma Health System, which has: (i) integrated the primary and secondary
        health systems of 27 LGAs into 9 ‘Gundumas’; and(ii) pooled human resources and funds to
        strengthen the PHC system in the state;
     the Kwara State Public-Private Partnership, which recruited a private medical practitioner from the
        community to run the facility and organized a community-based health insurance scheme for 1500
        enrollees in Lamodi Offa LGA; and
     the Ekiti State Health Data Bank, which sought to: (i) strengthen the collation, storage, analysis, and
        transmission of health service data; and (ii) facilitate the production of timely health management
        information for policy formulation and evidence-based decision making.
Field assessments and evaluations of all of these pilots were conducted, and discussion of next steps is
underway.
102.      The project’s results on this development objective were Substantial overall (Modest during the
first two phases, High during the third phase).
103.     Overall achievement result. Based on the project’s original and revised indicators and the ICR
guidelines (requiring separate outcome ratings weighted in proportion to the actual credit disbursements
made in the periods before and after formal restructurings), the following table assesses the project's overall
efficacy rating as Substantial.42

3.3 Efficiency
104.      Assessment of efficiency of the project outcomes is based on review of (i) Benefit/Cost
ratio/internal rate of return, (ii) allocative efficiency, and (iii) unit cost comparison and indicated in the
following sections.
105.      Benefit/Cost Ratio/Internal Rate of Return: Annex 4 of the PAD predicated project benefits on: (i)
increasing the use of services by improving access (or supply); (ii) changing the behavior of the population
(or demand); and (iii) strengthening the health system’s response to priority diseases. Using DHS data,
efficacy estimates for Nigerian operations, and several assumptions (including a 10% gain in health system
effectiveness based on the adoption of strong management measures)43, the PAD calculated the potential
internal rate of return (IRR) at 27%. The PAD analysis of the distribution impact of the project benefits
indicated that the project would provide important benefits for the poor compared with the general use of
health services and the distribution of income. As demonstrated in this report’s Data Sheet and explained
under assessment of efficacy of outcomes, the project has improved access to services (especially maternal
and child health services), increased the utilization of these services ( as a proxy for changing the project
facilities coverage population), and strengthened the health systems in terms of policy formulation and
results based focus of the strategic health plans. While the IRR could not be calculated, benefits have been
clearly been accrued. In addition, a significant number of the project sites as designed by the project were
located in the rural areas in Nigeria where the lower income quintiles populations largely reside. One could
argue that a key project goal of targeting the poor (particularly the Additional Financing) is an efficiency of
the project outcome.
106.     Allocative Efficiency: Annex 4 of the PAD did not really address the issue of allocations to the
individual states; rather the state allocations (in the PAD, Implementation Manual, etc.) were uniform. Other
considerations for allocating project funds (by LGA, by project component, by budget category, by type of
intervention, etc.), if only to provide guidelines for state planning, do not seem to have ever been considered
largely due to political context and the urgent need for all states to address the deteriorating level of service
delivery. Annex 10 provides an overview of the range of external financing by state and a rough estimate of
the annual amount of that financing.
107.     The mix of works, goods and services acquired is summarized in Annex 2a of this ICR and provide
an indication of their contributions to the project results. The ICR made an attempt to review project
expenditures and compare costs for similar types of works (e.g., boreholes) and goods (e.g., four-wheel drive
vehicles), but the presentations vary dramatically from state to state and which is not surprising given the
variations amongst states in the country in terms of the cost of doing business. Even though allocations
appear arbitrary, they went to priority areas in many states to improve access to and quality of care.


43
  It is worth noting that the economic analysis assumed that the project was sector wide in its focus rather than
emphasizing smaller areas and populations. See the PAD, p. 35.

                                                                                                                    22
108.      Unit Cost Comparison: There was not enough data to do comparison of costs on the project to
alternative costs. Since procurement followed AfDB and IDA rules, it can reasonable be assumed that costs
were reviewed by the competent services, and that an effort was made to ensure acquisitions at least cost and
that unit costs were reasonable. Whether the project could have obtained better value for the money spent is
difficult to assess.
109.     A review of Annex 2a indicates a coherent list of state priorities for health system strengthening
(including managerial capacity, human resource development and training, and HMIS) and health service
delivery interventions. Arguments could be made for other activities, or more emphasis on demand-side
interventions, etc., but the outputs financed by the project were well within the range of reasonable project
investments. In other words, the money was not wasted.
110.     Based on these considerations, the project’s efficiency in achieving the PDO's is rated as Modest
during all three phases of the project.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
111.     Based on considerations of the various ratings criteria and indicators in the preceding sections,
disbursement prior to and after project restructuring, and the guidelines for rating projects, the project is rated
Substantial for relevance, Substantial for efficacy, and Modest for efficiency; and on balance the project is
rated overall as Moderately Unsatisfactory. While the project objectives were relevant to the situation, the
project disbursed and produced outputs and results at the facility level, and many project indicators showed
progress, the project outcome is less than satisfactory because of its diffuse impact on health outcomes on a
national scale.
112.     As noted in the summary of the Project Completion Report (Annex 8), AfDB’s part of the project
was rated Good (3 out of 4), with the achievement of outputs as Very Good (4) and the achievement of
outcomes as Good. The project was rated only Fair (2) on its timeliness, which is the rough equivalent of
efficiency. On balance, the two assessments are in agreement, with the differing overall outcome rating due
to the IEG requirement that efficiency be Substantial in order for a project to be moderately satisfactory or
better.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
113.     During project preparation, an assessment of needs and expectations was conducted in selected
communities in five states confirmed the urgency of: (i) emphasizing the quality of public sector health
services (e.g. access to drugs, qualified personnel) in order to increase the access of poor families
(particularly mothers and children); (ii) addressing gender issues in the design of interventions; and (iii)
involving communities in decision-making. In the end, the project was able to address some of these issues.
114.     Poverty. Since the project covered only slightly more than a third of the LGAs and between 1-2% of
the PHC facilities 44 and since information on the population surrounding the PHC facilities was not
calculated, the project’s impact on increasing access of the poor to health services was necessarily limited.
As shown in the following table, equity indicators for ante-natal services, assisted delivery, and
immunization certainly did not improve for the lowest quintile over the period.




44
  The KPI Report (2012) indicates that 265 LGA’s (of 774) and 27 3 PHC facilities (of some 24,000) were supported by
the project. A review of the annual State reports and AfDB records by the ICR mission suggests that at least 286 LGAs
and 386 PHC facilities benefited from the project.

                                                                                                                  23

115.      The PAD noted that the project would examine (through the monitoring and evaluation system) the
utilization of public health facilities and the impediments to access by disadvantaged groups, including
demand side factors. This was not done and, as presented in Annex 2b, the outputs do not show any special
emphasis on demand-side issues or behavioral change which could have addresses these impediments.
116.      Gender. Gender considerations were featured in the initial CAS (2002) and subsequent CPS (2004,
2009) and were a key element of the NSHDP framework (2010) identifying priority interventions. Although
gender was not a predominant theme of the PAD (mentioned once) and the AF Project Paper (not mentioned
at all), the project focused to a large extent on maternal health.
117.     Social development. Following the priorities of the draft CAS (March 2001), the project intended to
strengthen: (i) governance in the public sector through local facility autonomy and community involvement;
and (ii) private sector development through studies of and contracting with the private sector providers to
improve supplies and refine the technical content of services. The project succeeded more on the latter than
the former.
118.     The PAD stated that: (i) community participation would be promoted through the participation of
village health committees in the management and oversight of local health facilities; and (ii) periodic
beneficiary assessments and consumer satisfaction surveys would be conducted. The project’s contribution to
these activities is not clearly identified, perhaps due in part to the lack of collaboration between the FMoH
and SMoH Planning Departments (coordinating the project) and the National PHC Development Agency
(responsible for community participation).
119.    The project contributed to the development of public-private partnerships in several ways: (i) a
policy was developed (November 2005), which provided the basis for elements of the NSHDP (2010); (ii)
conducting studies; and (iii) financing pilot interventions.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
120.      Major project contributions included sustained support for: (i) the National Health Bill (still under
consideration); and (ii) the annual meetings of the State and National Health Councils. These meetings
provided a forum for participants (who increased from some 400 in 2004 to more than 700 in 2011) to
exchange experiences in a structured setting with decisions and follow up actions duly noted. As indicated
earlier, more than 40% of the memoranda discussed at these meetings addressed the main areas of reform
agreed on initially by the project.
121.      The PAD envisioned the use of MOUs specifying the respective obligations between the states and
the participating LGAs to: (i) ensure the integration and harmonization of interventions; and (ii) mobilize the

                                                                                                            24
ownership and financial buy-in of the host communities. Although the final KPI report noted that 308 MOU
were signed, it was unable to conclude how these may have contributed to institutionalizing LGA support for
the project or for the health system as a whole.
122.      It is also worth noting that many of the state project implementation units established under HSDP
II (usually with seconded staff from other different state ministries) are being maintained because the SMoH
have found their planning and management skills to be effective complements to existing structures.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A
4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High
123.      Technically, the risk to DO is high as a result of the poor formulation of the DO and the weaknesses
of the project design. Further, the insufficient M&E arrangements limit attribution of progress at the health
facility level, and the reduced number of health facilities financed by the project limit attribution of any
changes at the national level.
124.    Institutionally, many of the contributions of the project via the NCH/SCH, the National Plan, the
medium term and annual plans, etc. have reduced the risk. But the vagaries of politics, shifting personnel, the
lack of the DCA to protect certain technical and administrative decisions constitute substantial risks.
Supervision will continue to be an issue.
125.     Financially, the AF was based in part on the sustainability issue, (that is, to avoid a situation where
some project-financed health facilities in Component 2 would remain unfinished or without equipment or
staffing at the May 2009 Closing Date); but three years later, the recurrent costs associated with project
expenditures (staffing, drugs and medicines, training, etc.) remain major challenges. Continuing project
investments in infrastructure and equipment imply obvious recurrent costs, which state budgets are unlikely
to make available for the necessary maintenance if the current system is to be used as a guide. While
counterpart funding was eliminated as an IDA requirement, Nigeria’s federal authorities expected States to
contribute annually to the project as evidence of their commitment to it (the amount of 50 million Naira was
adopted by a number of States); even those States contributing did not do so annually or in the amount
intended.
5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
126.     As noted previously, the preparation phase of the project was carried out during an especially
challenging time for Nigeria and for the Bank’s Country Team. Within this context, preparation was
characterized by: (i) frequent changes in task team leadership (three TTLs over the 3 year preparation
period); (ii) communication challenges with the government (over the amount of the credit, the use of the
PPF, the role of the AfDB, etc.); and (iii) delays in processing the credit which were largely out of the control
of the Bank.
127.     Concerns on the part of the Government were combined with significant questions inside the Bank
on the scope, content, and arrangements for the project. The resulting PAD, which reflected the compromises
agreed to by the two parties, had several weaknesses linked to: (i) the institutional arrangements (especially
for the PHC service delivery component); (ii) the risk mitigation measures; and (iii) the incomplete
monitoring and evaluation arrangements (including an absence of baseline measures and targets). The project
was approved with: (i) six conditions for effectiveness; (ii) three disbursement conditions; and (iii) eight

                                                                                                              25
other conditions that were expected to be included in the project implementation manual to be adopted before
credit effectiveness.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
128.     The Bank made significant efforts to provide implementation support to the project while at the
same time being responsive to Governments requests at the time of project restructuring and Additional
Financing. However, project supervision was handicapped by: (i) HSDP 2’s organization of a federal, and
36 State and FCT projects; and (ii) limited human and financial resources for carrying out the supervision
tasks. Measures envisioned by the DCA (particularly the coordination and oversight measures included in
Schedule 4 of the DCA such as the Project Steering Committee) should have provided additional structures
and processes for supervision, but these did not materialize throughout implementation and increased the
strain on the Bank team to supervise and provide implementation support.
129.     Within this context of supervision challenge and limited staff, actions within the Bank’s purview
were not systematic as: (i) supervision reports were limited to: selected state-level aide memoires; and (ii)
annual review meetings emphasized the activities implementation rather than the results achieved. The
proceedings of the annual review meetings could have been consolidated into an overall report as part of
formal supervision missions. Occasional joint supervision missions were organized, but AfDB’s participation
was irregular also due to staff shortages in-country, and as a result the task team could not sufficiently
address the project's implementation status in the states financed by ADB. Annex 2a (indicating ADB's
contributions in yellow) suggests that complementarity was adequate. The task team’s candor was
demonstrated in the upgrading of the Environmental Assessment from category C to B, when it was assessed
that the project activities could result in adverse environmental impacts as well as the downgrading of the
safeguards performance from ‘satisfactory’ to ‘moderately satisfactory?.
130.      The QALP assessment noted that the ISRs were to be of insufficient quality: “often unclear, focused
mainly on inputs rather than outcomes or impact, with narratives that were either repetitive and/or not
informative?. The panel also noted that “the ISRs' 'satisfactory' ratings for DOs and IP, which regional
management itself questioned at least twice (ISRs #6 and #17), were neither candid nor realistic.? Over the
last two years, however, the quality of the ISRs improved significantly. Similarly, the panel noted that “the
adequacy and timeliness of country and sector management attention to the project was problematic until the
last several years.?
131.     The Bank Team positively responded to the panel’s recommendation by holding three clinics with
project staff at state and federal levels to define indicators, develop an M&E plan, develop data collection
tools and provide hands-on assistance to collect data to demonstrate project achievements. However, the
inadequate design of the indicators, weak coordination by the federal project implementation team, weak
capacity and technical knowledge remained the main limitations to data collection and reporting. Since data
was available in the health facilities’ records, the Bank in 2011 supported the states and federal teams to
recruiting consultants to collect data for use in preparing the completion report.
132.      The Bank has also based some of the programmatic re-orientations of its current health portfolio on
the lessons learned during the implementation of HSDP 2 which are already reflected in the new and ongoing
projects.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
133.     Clearly there were defensible political imperatives to increase the project’s geographic scope and
allocate resources equally across States regardless of their vastly differing needs and capacities which the
Bank was constrained to accept. In hindsight, the Bank should have more critically considered its options in
2002 and 2008 as opportunities to address the project design and scope shortcomings and limit restructuring
the project to a more manageable scope that would have had a broader impact beyond the project sites.


                                                                                                          26
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
134.     Government performance was mixed. On the positive side: the FMoH and SMoH made progress on
health sector reform and the policy framework through the institutionalization of the NHC, the adoption of
the Health Bill, the formulation of a National Health Strategy, and the consideration of a range of policy
memos and operational pilots at state level constitute a wealth of ongoing reflection, analysis, and action. On
the other hand, political concerns (significant political turnover in the states, occasional interference in
project matters by local and state authorities, etc.), key technical issues (continuing emphasis on
infrastructure, the lack of monitoring and evaluation, etc.), and the absence of a cohesive financing strategy
for the health sector reduced the development of the health sector in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
135.      Project reports noted the tremendous variability in implementation capacity with certain States
achieving effectiveness only after lengthy delays and others rapidly overspending their allocations. Though
state level investment in managerial and technical training presumably contributed to progress in planning,
budgeting and coordination, there was limited documentation to demonstrate these improvements. Further,
the project neither demonstrated improvements nor evaluated the link between improved capacity and
results/impact for the beneficiary populations. For instance, the functionality of the health infrastructure
supported by the project was not systematically assessed and surveys of user satisfaction were not conducted.
136.     Despite these weaknesses, the states proved capable of planning and managing the implementation
of a range of activities which they deemed important for the development of the health sector. Viewed
narrowly as a potential precursor to a sector-wide approach (with integrated planning; common, Bank-
influenced fiduciary measures; and a theoretically agreed-upon framework for monitoring and evaluation),
the project offered a pilot of how such an approach might work.
137.      Two recurring management failures diminish this potentially optimistic conclusion: (i) the repeated
over-commitment of allocated funds suggests either that the states lacked the required financial management
capabilities or that they assumed a first come-first served approach; and (ii) the lack of a robust health
management information system (HMIS) at state and federal levels after a decade of support, and despite
repeated efforts and promised improvements, suggests that the states were incapable of implementing the
system. The failure to establish fundamental tools for accountability remains an enormous weakness for the
implementing agencies and the sector as a whole.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
138.      Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory based on two elements. On the one hand,
36 States, the FCT, and the FMoH were able to plan and implement annual work programs over a sustained
period in a difficult environment; while much criticism has been leveled at the criteria for state allocations
and the states’ selection of activities for financing, the Borrower did implement the project as it was designed.
On the other hand, weaknesses in financial management and monitoring and evaluation systems reduced the
project from a tool for sector development to discretionary funds for state health ministries.
6.   Lessons Learned
139.      While project design could have been stronger, project implementation has provided Government
and the Bank with the elements to improve the financing and operation of the health system. The critical
need for a results-focused approach in both strategic planning and project implementation has been included
in the national and state health plans for 2010 to 2015 and in the design and implementation modalities of the
new Bank-financed results-based financing project (the Nigeria State Health Investment Project, NSHIP).

                                                                                                             27
The experience from the Abiye program in Ondo State supported by HSDP 2 is being replicated in a number
of states based on the lessons learnt under this project. In addition, the next Country Assistance Framework
for Nigeria currently being prepared by the Bank and other partners is providing a platform to better organize
the division of labor by partners to more effectively support the Government in achieving its goals in the
health sector. As an example and as part of the lessons from HSDP 2, the Bank and partners jointly
appraised the Government’s Save One Million Lives Program in October 2012 with a results focus in mind
and the need for systems to be strengthened to track achievements.
140.     In addition to lessons already incorporated in the new project and the analytical work envisioned to
shed more light on the health sector challenges, a review of previous ICRs (from the 1990s cohort of projects
funded by the Bank) suggests that the issues associated with financing health in Nigeria are of very long
standing and need to be addressed by all those working with the states. Four lessons are raised below:
141.      First, to adequately address the potential trade-off between a project's technical scope and its
geographical reach, project design must be both simple and adaptable to changes in both the policy and
political environments. Previous project results have shown, though, that simple and flexible designs may
also be: (i) reduced to supply-driven input and outputs (especially in the decentralized and highly politicized
Nigerian context) with little or no mechanism to identify and address demand issues; and (ii) subjected to
pressures to increase spending if disbursement lags. Clearly a balance needs to be reached to ensure that a
simple project design does not lack a results focus.
142.      Decisions taken by the Bank (despite its own reservations) during preparation and especially during
implementation of HSDP II (e.g. to increase the number of participating states, to allow spending on a first
come-first served basis, to eliminate counterpart funding, not to enforce the development of community
participatory mechanisms, etc.) demonstrate how quickly a supply-driven approach can take hold. In view of
this lesson, NSHIP has shifted the strategic focus on results to just three states, emphasized an innovative
design to demonstrate that the Project can improve health outcomes and integration of user feedback
mechanisms through which beneficiaries can provide feedback on the quality of service provision.
143.      Second, while a previous health ICR concluded that it was essential to focus on results, the
another was somewhat more nuanced arguing that a supply approach needs strong capacity to
strategically administer, combine and utilize inputs to achieve results. This could mean fewer states with
fewer inputs provided for a smaller range of activities, with more effort placed on the management of these
inputs toward achieving more specific results. In other words, inputs per se were not necessarily the issue but
rather the inadequate framework (lack of policies, strategic directives, and priority plans) for deploying them
in the right combination and measuring results. In the case of HSDP II, the lack of an overarching framework
to establish priorities, integrate various sources of funding, and monitor the results of the sector as a whole
reduced the effectiveness of the project’s inputs, significant as they were.
144.     The current portfolio of Bank projects in Nigeria supports this lesson either by addressing a single
disease (polio, HIV/AIDS, and Malaria), or by limiting the number of states (NSHIP and Malaria), or some
combination of the two.
145.     Third, rigorous national-level monitoring and evaluation measures with accountability at state
and local levels are crucial for project success. Both Increased accountability with the involvement of
beneficiaries and stakeholders is a key component of successful implementation. But accountability can only
occur when information systems and leadership combine to influence the appropriate decisions and
beneficiaries have the opportunity and capacity to demand improvements in the provision of services. Where
resource allocations are made without a strategic framework and accountable structures, a dangerous
dynamic is created where project activities are justified by the fact that they may fulfill political needs and
become popular without being effective. In the case of HSDP II, the inadequacies of M&E have been noted,
but even if the system had worked, the MOUs with LGAs, signed by the State Ministry of Health, might
have had more success if they had also been signed by the State Ministry of Local Government since LGAs
are accountable to that ministry. The existing National Strategic Health Development Plan and the proposed
National Health Bill are designed to provide the essential elements for an overarching framework for
accountability. At the project level, NSHIP is providing evidence for the importance of accountability.

                                                                                                            28
146.     Finally, technical staff of the State Ministry of Health and the State Ministry of Local
Government should participate in project preparation to engage and sustain commitment for project
ownership and coordination. However, this is particularly difficult in the Nigerian context, where
implementation is complicated by: (i) the three-tier structure of health service organization; and (ii) the high
degree of State-level political considerations in local health systems development; and (iii) citizens have
limited capacity and opportunity to participate. Over the past decade of limited achievements in the health
sector (despite the combined efforts national, state, and local governments as well as more than 20
development partners), what seems clear is that the sector is like a huge ship (costly to run, difficult to
navigate and very slow to turn, but with sufficient momentum to continue in the direction where it is headed)
but with the exception that there is no single captain. There is no quick route to commitment, but the State
and National Councils of Health now represent a valid way forward to establish the direction of the sector.
7.   Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
147.      (a) Borrower/implementing agencies: The Borrower had previously submitted a summary of
the available data as its contribution to the ICR The task team and the Borrower reviewed and agreed on
the results of the indicators reported in the Data Sheet45. Subsequently, comments were received from the
Federal Ministry of Health (detailed comments are in Annex 5) and from several states (Anambra,
Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Ebonyi and Abia (see detailed comments in Annex 6).
148.     Comments of the Federal Ministry of Health. The FMOH took issue with the completeness
of the report (arguing that some of the indicators in Section F of the Data Sheet had been omitted)46 and
with the overall project rating (agreeing with the individual ratings but questioning the weightings and
arguing that the overall rating should be “at least satisfactory?). The Ministry then discussed the key
factors affecting the project evaluation results; these are presented below:
149.    M&E design, implementation and use. The root problem of the overall project rating is the
weak M&E design and implementation. This has led to the paucity of relevant data to assess project
performance objectively and arrive at a correct rating. The evidence is that at the beginning of project
implementation: no targets were set; no baselines were done; no results monitoring framework was
developed; no PDO results-oriented M&E tools were developed and used; annual and other reports
focused on output rather than outcome reporting; and assumption that NHMIS will work properly to
produce credible performance did not hold. The overall project M&E assessment affirms the weak M&E
design and implementation.
150.     Government noted that apart from organizing annual review meetings, FMOH attempted to
ameliorate these shortcomings by: engaging 6 zonal consultants to collect, collate and analyze
performance data in project states of the 6 geopolitical zones in 2007-2008; engaging a Consultant to
independently collect and analyze data from selected state projects; states were trained to complete a
results-monitoring template focusing on KPIs but capturing project pre-commencement data
retrospectively as baselines early this year; and beneficiary assessments was conducted in selected states
this year. Government noted that these efforts came too little and too late to salvage the weak results-
oriented reporting.
151.     Project scope. The second factor that influenced impact assessment results is the sheer scope of
the Project against the quantum of funds available. Credit sums of (US$127m and AF of US$90m total
US$217m) were disbursed over an 8 year period to federal and 37 states to serve a population of over
150m. This translates to about US$ 714,000 per implementing agency per annum. This is further
compounded by the large number of components for which these funds were to be disbursed and poor

 A technical note was prepared at the completion of the ICR mission and is available in the project file.
46
 The indicators referred to by the Government are in the Annex 2 as they additional indicators collected by some states
which are not part of indicators included in the project’s result framework presented in the data sheet.

                                                                                                                    29
counterpart fund release by states. The obvious inference is that the funds were spread too thin to
demonstrate reasonable impact. Government notes that mono-component projects such as HIV&AIDS
(MAP & HPDP), Malaria and Polio stand a better chance of demonstrating impact. Reducing the scope
to fewer states as is planned for NSHIP logically increases the chances of greater project impact.
152.     Project Funds. Preparatory to the closure of the project, there were issues on disbursement and
availability of funds for the Federal and some states beneficiaries to meet up to their obligations to pay
for some goods and services already committed/executed. This was brought to the notice of the Bank.
FMOF also wrote to the Bank for explanation on how the funds were exhausted while Projects still had
balances in their books and outstanding commitments. This issue was not resolved until the closure of
the project47 and this still remain a burden to these states as contractors are requesting for their payments.
FMOH presented a table of expenditures by the states and concluded that :
        The amount allocated and drawn down, as well as balances for the beneficiary States, FCT and
         the FMOH is presented in the table in Annex 5. This shows that for the 22 initial States in the
         additional financing an analysis of the draw-down, based on submissions from the States shows
         that of the approved $80m initially planned to be allocated to these States, a total of $ 78.9m
         (99%) was allocated. Of this allocated credit, $70.13m (89%) was disbursed, leaving an
         expected balance of $8.8m.
        Furthermore, the table shows that for the 7 add-on States a total of $16.6m was allocated to
         them, instead of the $10m in the initial agreement. This shows an over-allocation based on the
         terms of the initial agreement. To compound issues, the States drew down $16.8m, which is
         $160,600 in excess of the allocated amount.
        Although there was an over allocation, and two States over drew their allocations, however, total
         disbursement of USD$86,886,781.75 did not exceed the total amount of USD$90m approved by
         the WB. Looking at the difference between the allocated and disbursed, it is expected that there
         would still be a balance of $3.1m.
        On the other hand, the table also shows us the outstanding commitments for the States. In total,
         of the 16 States that were expecting to have some funds remaining before the close of the
         Project, 10 States had submitted their outstanding commitments which is to the tune of
         USD$4,401,602.40. The outstanding commitment for the Federal HSDP II component is
         USD$821,453.97. However the WB informed the Ministry, that the account was fully disbursed.
         It is not quite clear how this amount was not available.
153.   (b) Co-financing: AfDB’s project completion report is summarized in Annex 8. No AfDB
comments on ICRR by were received by the Bank.
154.     (c) Other partners and stakeholders: Not applicable

  SDR to USD exchange rate differences over the project life account for the differences in allocated amounts at project
onset to actual amounts available to each state and federal at the end of the project. The Bank has transmitted to
Government in November 2012 an official Closing and Cancellation letter prepared by the Bank’s Disbursement Team
which indicates the amounts disbursed by states and federal and the exchange rate differences.

possible to: (i) evaluate (based on the 1999 NDHS results) a modest change in healthy life years that could
plausibly be attributed to the planned improvements in service availability and quality; and (ii) compare these
possible benefits with the cost of the project. Assuming a 10% increase in system effectiveness (increased
use and efficacy for the priority diseases), the analysis: (i) estimates the total annual gain in healthy life years
from the completed project for the population of the 25 project states to be 268,000 and the monetary value
of a healthy year of life at US$300 per capita (the net national product per capita); and (ii) calculates the gain
of healthy years of life in one year from the completed project would be greater than US$ 80 million per year.
    Annex 4 acknowledged the difficulties associated with a 10% increase in effectiveness, particularly in
such a large project covering broad areas and populations, and noted that achievement of a gain this size
would be particularly sensitive to increases in service efficacy and use and require:
    1. a concerted effort covering all facilities and staff in state-wide efforts, and involve considerable
         behavioral change in a large population ;
    2. significant improvements in system management and implementation to be developed under the
         project.
In fact, the project covered only slightly more than a third of the LGAs and between 1-2% of the PHC
facilities48; information on the population surrounding the PHC facilities was not calculated. In addition, as
presented in Annex 2b, the outputs do not show any particular emphasis on behavioral change. Finally, as
shown in the discussion on project efficacy, improvements in system management and implementation under
the project cannot be considered significant. In other words, the key assumption for calculating project
benefits was not met.
      Annex 4 used the project disbursement profile and estimated recurrent costs for the project to analyze
the pattern of costs over time and concluded that: (i) project benefits on health status would be negligible in
the first and second years of the project; (ii) then 10%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% of the completed total in the
third through seventh years from the start of the project; and (iii) 100% thereafter through a ten year time
horizon after project completion. Based on this time stream of benefits and costs, the internal rate of return
(IRR) for the project was calculated to be 27% and the net present value of benefits minus costs (NPV) with
a real discount rate of 10 percent was estimated at US$ 149 million.
      Given the sensitivity of the projections49 and the actual results of the project, it is probably safe to say
that, in retrospect, the project’s costs were underestimated (in comparison with the population which would
have needed to benefit to increase the effectiveness of the project) and the project benefits substantially
overestimated (in comparison with the project’s ability to implement and sustain sound management
practices).


48
   The KPI Report (2012) indicates that 265 LGA’s (of 774) and 273 PHC facilities (of some 24,000) were supported by
the project. A review of the annual State reports and ADB records by the ICR mission suggests that at least 286 LGAs
and 386 PHC facilities benefited from the project.
49
   Annex 4 noted that NPV: (i) falls to 0 with a fall in the gain in overall technical effectiveness to 5%, thereby
illustrating the high sensitivity of the project outcomes to sound management, timely financing, and strong technical
capacity; and (ii) falls from US$ 149 million to US$ 52 million with a reduced immunization program effectiveness
from 10% to 0%, thereby illustrating the importance of maintaining the focus on priority diseases.

                                                                                                                  38
     Annex 4 of the PAD also argued that the distribution impact of the project benefits would provide
important benefits for the poor compared with the general use of health services. Though the following table
presents data from national surveys rather than project facilities, it shows that the poorer population does not
seem to have benefited more than the less poor population.

      Project fiscal impact and sustainability. Annex 4 argued that, though substantial, the fiscal burden of
the project is manageable, assuming: (i) government budget increases in line with the GNP projected by the
Bank’s base scenario (a 2.5% real growth rate); and (ii) stable allocations among Government levels,
functions and line items at the level of the most recent available data. The analysis concluded that: (i) the
project’s initial year cash flow would require a 4% increase in the projected state and local government
budgets; and (ii) on project completion, a sustained annual increase of 4% would be required in state and
local budgets. Since the total amount required constituted 25-50% of local capital budgets, the annex argued
that: (i) clear understanding of these financial implications and strong government commitment were
absolutely necessary, especially at state and local levels; and (ii) given the sizable addition to the volume of
funds normally managed at the local level, additional financial management capacity would be required.
     As shown in the body of the ICR, the fiscal impact of counterpart financing was problematic from the
outset and was eliminated as a requirement in the 2006 project restructuring. While some states contributed
counterpart funding afterwards, particularly after 2009, the total amount was nowhere near the 4% estimated
by the PAD.
     From the perspective of sustainability, the project’s per annum per capita contribution in the 25 States
where it was the sole project funding source was relatively modest: in all but three states, the project
contributed less than US$ 0.50 per capita per year. This was true even for those States whose disbursements
far exceed their allocations.

Annex 5: Federal Government Comments on ICRR
Completeness of Report
First, we wish to call your attention to a missing section of your report under F. ‘Results Framework
Analysis’, a. PDO Indicators. Results from only 1 impact/outcome indicator were recorded. It would seem
that results based on 11 other indicators (2-12) in Component 1 were inadvertently omitted.

Overall Project Rating
In our view, the rating of the Project should at least be ‘satisfactory’. This is predicated on our own
assessment of KPIs, feedback from the states and the Bank’s own assessment (reproduced below):
    a. Relevance of objectives, design and implementation - substantial
    b. Achievement of PDOs:
           a. PDO 1 – modest
           b. PDO 2 – substantial
           c. PDO 3 - substantial
    c. Efficacy – substantial
    d. Efficiency in achieving PDOs – modest (see paragraphs 79-114).

To buttress our argument, we quote paragraph 86 of the report “the majority of the project outcomes and
intermediate outcome targets were either completely or partially achieved?. We shall be happy to be
enlightened on the weighting ascribed to these evaluation criteria to arrive at an assessment of Project
performance as ‘moderately unsatisfactory’.

Ironically, the performance of the ADB component of the same HSDP II project – Component 2 support to
12 states – is ‘Good’ or 3 on a scale of 1-4. Interestingly, the author(s) think that though the two assessments
are basically in agreement, the overall outcome ratings are poles apart! (paragraph 116).

Key factors that affected project evaluation results

    1. M&E design, implementation and use
The root problem of the overall project rating is the weak M&E design and implementation. This has led to
the paucity of relevant data to assess project performance objectively and arrive at a correct rating. The
evidence is that at the beginning of project implementation;

    a.   No targets were set
    b.   No baselines were done
    c.   No results monitoring framework was developed
    d.   No PDO results-oriented M&E tools were developed and used
    e.   Annual and other reports focused on output rather than outcome reporting
    f.   Assumption that NHMIS will work properly to produce credible performance did not hold

These killer factors are well documented in paragraphs 53-58 of the report. The overall project M&E
assessment affirms the weak M&E design and implementation. This is well summarized in paragraph 60 of
your report “M&E is rated negligible based on design (negligible), implementation (modest) and utilization
(negligible).

On our part, apart from organizing annual review meetings, we attempted to ameliorate these shortcomings
by:




                                                                                                             42
     a. Engaging 6 zonal consultants to collect, collate and analyze performance data in project states of the
        6 geopolitical zones in 2007-2008.
     b. Engaging a Consultant to independently collect and analyze data from selected state projects
     c. States were trained to complete a results-monitoring template focusing on KPIs but capturing project
        pre-commencement data retrospectively as baselines early this year.
     d. Beneficiary assessment was conducted in selected states this year

We do note that these efforts came too little and too late to salvage the weak results-oriented reporting

     2. Project scope
The second factor that influenced impact assessment results is the sheer scope of the Project against the
quantum of funds available. Credit sums of (US$127m and AF of US$90m total US$217m) were disbursed
over an 8 year period to federal and 37 states to serve a population of over 150m. This translates to about
US$ 714,000 per implementing agency per annum. This is further compounded by the large number of
components for which these funds were to be disbursed and poor counterpart fund release by states. The
obvious inference is that the funds were spread too thin to demonstrate reasonable impact. It should be noted
that mono-component projects such as HIV&AIDS (MAP & HPDP), Malaria and Polio stand a better chance
of demonstrating impact (paragraph 148). Reducing the scope to fewer states as is planned for NSHIP
logically increases the chances of greater project impact.

     3. Project Funds
Preparatory to the closure of the project, there were issues on disbursement and availability of funds for the
Federal and some states beneficiaries to meet up to their obligations to pay for some goods and services
already committed/executed. This was brought to the notice of the Bank. The Federal Ministry of Finance
also wrote to the Bank for explanation on how the funds were exhausted while Projects still had balances in
their books and outstanding commitments. This issue was not resolved until the closure of the project and
this still remain a burden to these states as contractors are requesting for their payments.

5. The amount allocated and drawn down, as well as balances for the beneficiary States, FCT and the
FMOH is presented in the table above. This shows that for the 22 initial States in the additional financing an
analysis of the draw-down, based on submissions from the States shows that of the approved $80m initially
planned to be allocated to these States, a total of $ 78.9m (99%) was allocated. Of this allocated credit,
$70.13m (89%) was disbursed, leaving an expected balance of $8.8m.

6. Furthermore, the table shows that for the 7 add-on States a total of $16.6m was allocated to them,
instead of the $10m in the initial agreement. This shows an over-allocation based on the terms of the initial
agreement. To compound issues, the States drew down $16.8m, which is $160,600 in excess of the allocated
amount.

7. Although there was an over allocation, and two States over drew their allocations, however, total
disbursement of USD$86,886,781.75 did not exceed the total amount of USD$90m approved by the WB.
Looking at the difference between the allocated and disbursed, it is expected that there would still be a
balance of $3.1m.

8. On the other hand, the table also shows us the outstanding commitments for the States. In total, of the 16
States that were expecting to have some funds remaining before the close of the Project, 10 States had
submitted their outstanding commitments which is to the tune of USD$4,401,602.40. The outstanding
commitment for the Federal HSDP II component is USD$821,453.97. However the WB informed the
Ministry, that the account was fully disbursed. It is not quite clear how this amount was not available

New Bank Project (NSHIP):
We are happy that the lessons learnt from HSDP II have been applied to the new project chiefly limiting the
geographical spread of the US$170m to only 3 states and strengthening the M&E mechanisms. These will
surely translate to a more evidence-based impact on the beneficiaries.

 2. The discrepancy between fund allocation and fund disbursement for the Original Credit was captured in
the report No 44 page 19. This issue of States not receiving the full amount allocated in the AF vis-a-vis
the SCA signed by the states which many states complained of was not mentioned in the report.

 3. Outstanding u Undisbursed Fund and Commitments to Contractors: The issue of commitments to
contractors and outstanding undisbursed fund by the World Bank are still problems being faced by some
states including Anambra State. The problem which is yet to be resolved has been disturbing the state, the
Project, the contractors and the staff.

Cross River State:

The Cross River State Health System Development Project (HSDP)-II wish to acknowledge your mail on the
above subject and the request for the individual state comments/recommendations on the draft ICR report.
We therefore wish to particularly use this opportunity to express our appreciation to the FMoH, FMoF and
the World Bank for granting the project the opportunity of contributing to the writing of the final ICR report.
This in a way has demonstrated your goodwill, fairness and equity in assessing the projects overall
performance.

We also appreciate the good works of the ICR primary author: Peter Bachrach and the TTL: F. Ayodeji
Akala for their diligence and concise approach of writing this report.

CRSHSHP-II Comments/Reactions of the ICR Report:

   i.    Overall ICR Report Rating.

The CRSHSDP-II particularly rate the hereby current ICR report as being very correct, accurate, concise and
a true reflection and representative of all the events and activities that took place country-wide during the
approximately nine (09) years of the HSDP-II life cycle considering the various indicators considered in the
evaluation of the projects performance. We are delighted with the general structure and manner the key
challenges to the project’s successes and inefficiencies have been precisely highlighted and possible
solutions to these issues proffered by the report to pave way for more effective implementation of future
projects.

  ii.    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The lessons learnt during the project preparatory, design and entry phase of HSDP-II are quite commendable

                                                                                                            45
as contained in the draft report. Bearing this in mind, the CRSHSDP-II wish to request the relevant project
implementing agent/partners to take particular notice of following with respect to the country wide
preparation and implementation of the approved Nigerian State Health Investment Project (NSHIP):

     To start as soon as possible the needed wide consultations and commencement of the necessary
      mechanisms of putting in place future project documents e.g. PCN, MOUs and setting of state
      commitment requirements etc needed for the effectiveness of the NSHIP or any other project(s).
      in future, should there be any need for co-financing by other partners or stakeholders implementing
      similar projects, the affected partners should be limited to implementation of specific project
      components/ objectives in all the states of the federation and FCT to enable equal opportunities of
      evaluation the partners with similar indicators or IEG requirements.

CRSHSDP-II Project Specific Constrain/Challenge.

The Cross River State HSDP-II wish to once again place on record the serious constrain it experienced
during the implementation phases of the HSDP-II and Additional Finance (AF). This was mainly the issue of
non-allocation of funds in the AF phase of the project because the state which was initially one of the seven
states in the awaiting list (for funds allocation) was the only state that paid the commitment fee of five
million Naira (N5,000,000.00) and submitted several affirmative letters to the FMoF but was dropped in
favor of Kano state which was not in the original list.

Recommendation: This action which was envisaged to have been contrived at the high policy making level
was considered an act of political marginalization and therefore a bitter lesson hereby recommended to be
noted and documented for prevention in future program implementations.

Abia State:

The ICR is a fair account of the HSDP II. It raised issues that need special attention in future project
preparations especially obtaining proper baseline data prior to the commencement of the project for easy
assessment.

Annex 2a: Descriptive Summary of Project Output under HIV/AIDS & TB omitted the training conducted by
Abia State for General Health Workers and Doctors on TB-DOTS Management.

The assessment given to the project as moderately unsatisfactorily may be correct technically based on the
Bank Bench mark set out for the project, but looking at the project as per impact on the Nigeria Health Sector
it can be assessed very successful because of the impact on virtually every aspect of the Health Sector at the
three levels of Government (Federal, State and Local Government).




                                                                                                           49
Annex 7: Executive Summary of Borrower's Completion Report (Report on Data Collation on Key
Performance Indicators: National Level prepared by Consultants Contracted by FMOH)

The Second Health Systems Development Project (HSDP II), approved in June 2002 and effective in
February 2003, was designed to assist the Nigerian health authorities address the serious deterioration in the
quality of basic health care services. The additional financing for HSDP II was approved on September 30,
2008 and also became effective shortly afterwards. This piece of work was commissioned to collate federal
and state level data on key performance indicators assess project success. The assignment was carried out
using a using a combination of methods: literature review, finalization of data collection tools, training
workshop for states data management teams, data quality assessment and case studies. Collated data were
synthesized to obtain a summary of national aggregates of KPIs. A trend analysis was carried out on findings.

Unlike financial management and procurement which had adequate systems built in, the M&E system was
inadequate. Gaps were observed in several states’ results - an average of 24 states reported data on key
performance indicator. Data for almost all the KPIs showed incomplete reporting for 2011 as most states
were only able to collate data for only three quarters of that year at the time of this exercise.

In several of the indicators reported, the data suffered from inexplicable, sharp undulations. Indeed, the
independent DQA conducted in 5 states and past reviews of the M&E system by the Bank confirmed data
management challenges such as inadequate data recording and reporting tools, weak capacity of M&E and
HMIS officers who handled data especially at the peripheral level and poor supervision of data officers.

The use of strategic plans by all states as the basis of developing annual plans is a remarkable landmark in
health planning. All states have started implementing their strategic health development plans as their annual
plans are derived from them. The challenge remains adequate budget allocation and performance to drive the
plans.

Achieving the health system goals of equity and accessibility necessitate the prioritization and allocation of
resources across competing ends to obtain the best possible health outcomes. Ten states reported the
construction of SHA through the DCT by 2011. However, the incorporation of sub National Health Account
(NHA) of 17 states into the Federal Ministry of Health NHA at the end of 2005 has been reported in
literature.

Full disclosure, transparency and accountability for resources and results are essential to demonstrate the
stewardship role of government. The fact that only 23 states confirmed the publication of their certified,
audited accounts yearly confirms this as a classical case of under-reporting as the law stipulates that funds
cannot be appropriated for states by the legislature unless their audited accounts are published publicly.

The PHC system is perceived to be weak as it is unable to provide basic, cost-effective services for the
prevention and management of common health problems especially at the community level. The HSDP II
intervention in the states comprised the renovation of existing health care facilities, construction and
equipping of new ones. Other areas of project intervention at the PHC include the provision of basic essential
service packages and technical training of health workers with the hope that service utilization in the
facilities would improve. Though the project financial envelope is large at over US$200m, the spread is
rather thin – 273 PHC facilities out of an estimated 24,000; 265 LGAs out of 774 in 36 states and the FCT,
however, the performance suggests a growth in service utilization.

Immunization is one of the most cost-effective and equitable health interventions and a major strategy to
achieve MDG Goal no 4 – the reduction of child morbidity and mortality. The indication from data presented
is that Nigeria shows moderate progress on this indicator. This is corroborated by NDHS and NICS reports
published during the life of the project.


                                                                                                                50
Improving maternal health and reducing maternal mortality have been a challenge in Nigeria. This has been
partly attributed to the poor utilization of public health facilities, lack of essential obstetric care equipment
and inadequate skills of health workers. The project’s response is multi-pronged – improving access to PHC
care to ensure pregnant women receive ante-natal care and that births are assisted by skilled health workers
who can provide life-saving emergency obstetric care interventions if the mothers experience serious
complications. Training of health workers in EOC and LSS complemented this. Results from 3 indicators
presented: increased number of births attended by skilled health personnel (doctors, nurses and midwives);
increased number of women attending antenatal clinics and increased attendance at Family Planning Clinic
in project facilities revealed some increase in all the indicators with considerable increases over baseline
figures. Findings are validated by NDHS and WHO statistics.

The publication and use of policy, plan and strategy documents by federal HSDP II has contributed
significantly to improvement in the regulatory and oversight functions and processes of the FMOH. Although
attempts have been made to support States to adapt these policies and standards, available evidence indicates
that too few states have adapted these policies to suit their local environment. Though the project invested in
the formulation of the National Health Bill, it is yet to transform into legislation. Several policy documents
were published the FMOH, issues remained with printing and dissemination to states on one hand and
adaptation by the states on the other hand.

Perhaps the project’s greatest contribution to sector reform is in the development of the NHSDP and states
SHDP and the monitoring framework - considered to be landmark documents for health planning and
coordination in the country. Nigeria now has a single action framework incorporating the plans of all
government levels, development partners and other stakeholders; basis for the alignment and coordination of
health interventions; and one agreed M&E system. The overall responsibility for coordination of the project
rested firmly with the National Project Coordinating Unit (NPCU) while project monitoring and evaluation
was shared between it and the states.

Limited availability of trained health professionals represents a significant barrier to healthcare access. The
HSDP II in recognition of this gap invested heavily in health personnel development in the areas of
management and technical skills by providing funds for the training of different cadres of health care
personnel in the states. The project recorded good results in the three priority service delivery KPIs selected
– LSS (6,390 midwives) and IMCI (4,790) using IDA funds and contributed to DOTS (8,464) in
collaboration with other partners.

A number of interventions were selected from states projects to showcase ‘best practices’. These are The
Gunduma Health System (Jigawa state) and HSDP II impact evaluation (FCT) which presented innovations
in health system development while Lamodi Offa community health insurance scheme – a PPP initiative
(Kwara state) and Abiye maternity project (Ondo state) highlighted lessons learnt in service delivery.
Strategies of implementation common to these interventions include choice of a ‘quick win’ that can provide
visible results, is inexpensive and contributes directly to PDOs; a technically sound thinking process to
inform design, involvement of beneficiary communities and stakeholders and an embedded M&E system to
track progress towards objectives.

Conclusion and recommendations

Decision-makers are looking to Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) as a strategic function to provide
evidence on the performance of government policies, programs and projects in a changing world
characterized by increasingly dwindling resources. As the demand for greater accountability and improved
stewardship increase, there is an attendant need for enhanced results-based monitoring and evaluation of
projects to ensure value for money. This is as a result of pressure on both the donors and beneficiaries
(government and people) to demonstrate that the results of development spending are cost-effective.


                                                                                                               51
The key recommendation arising from this report is that future projects should incorporate a robust M&E
system that effectively assesses progress of implementation over time and evaluates the impact of the project
at the end. Opportunity abounds in keying in into the SHDP at federal or state level which already defined
targets and indicators in their implementation framework. Other recommendations are:

    1. To improve on the design of the project with a view to ensuring that there are benchmarks and
       defined targets for which project results can be measured at the end of the project
    2. Given the large size and spread of the project, appropriate mechanisms should be designed by the
       NPCU and implemented to assure effective M&E. The frequency of joint missions by the NPCU,
       FMOF and the Bank should be higher for projects of similar nature and size
    3. There is need to improve the quality of data by ensuring the identification of key measurable
       performance indicators and support for the integration and conduct of routine data quality assessment
    4. Future projects should invest significantly in strengthening the NHMIS to be able to show results and
       strengthen country structures through which it must work
    5. The capacity of managers of future Bank supported health projects in Results Based Monitoring (and
       Finance) should be enhanced.
    6. Annual Review Meeting presentations should shift from activity-based reporting to results reporting.

Annex 8: Co-financing Partners and Other Partners/Stakeholders : AfDB Project Completion Report
     The African Development Bank’s Project Completion Report for the Health Systems Development
Project (Health IV)(P-NG-IBO-006) in the amount of UA34.74 million became effective on December 16,
2003 (original effectiveness date November 1, 2002) and closed on December 31, 2010 (original closing date
December 31, 2008). US32.5 million (93.4%) was disbursed and UA2.3 million was cancelled. A four-point
scale was used to rate the project, using the following criteria:
     4    Very Good. Fully achieved with no shortcomings
     3    Good. Mostly achieved despite a few shortcomings
     2    Fair/Partially achieved. Shortcomings and achievements are roughly balanced
     1    Poor.Very limited achievement with extensive shortcomings
The overall project outcome was rated as 3, with the achievement of outputs (4), the achievement of
outcomes (3), and timeliness (2). Overall Bank performance was rated as 3, with design and readiness (3)
and supervision (3). Overall Borrower performance was rated as 3, with design and readiness (3) and
implementation (3).
     At project appraisal, the Nigeria health system was characterised by unacceptably high infant (112),
under5 (187) and maternal mortality rates arising from the many years of neglect. Less than 30% of Nigeria
population had access to quality primary health care (PHC) services and only 9% of the poorest women have
access to a trained health worker at delivery and over 87% continue to deliver at home. The overall project
concept emerged from a series of discussions with the SMOHs, the FMOH and development partners about
the need to restore a minimum level of the country's basic health service delivery, and from discussions
between the Bank and the World Bank on closer collaboration between the two institutions in increasing the
coverage of quality PHC in Nigeria. To this end, the Government of Nigeria identified a Medium Term Plan
of Action for Health Sector Reform (2000-2005) along the lines of a sector investment programme as an
overall umbrella programme with set of priority projects aimed directly at improving the health status of the
population.
     This project, the fourth Bank operation in the sector in Nigeria aims at enhancing Bank’s previous
assistance taking into account lessons from past projects. It is part of a concerted effort to provide assistance
to Nigeria's poverty reduction efforts and the attainment of the MDGs such as child mortality reduction,
maternal health improvements and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other endemic diseases. No ongoing
Bank project directly complement this project but activities of the WB, UNICEF, UNFPA USAID, DFID
and some other development partners do.
        Sector goal: The attainment of a good standard of health by all Nigerians in order to promote a
         healthy and productive life.
        Objectives: Improved delivery of Primary Health Care services by restoring a minimum level of
         quality in the provision of public sector health services targeted to the poor .
The project components were as follows:
        Improved Access to Primary Health Care (PHC) Services: This has to do with infractructural
         upliftment of Primary Health Care (PHC) facilities by way of rehabilitations/ upgrading/
         reconstructions of existing facilities. This is aimed at increasing physical accessibility of health care
         to the poor (particularly children and women) who mostly live in the rural areas where most of the
         PHCs are cited.
        Support To PHC Activities (Improved Quality of PHC Serivices): This involves the procurement of
         relevant basic medical equipment, consumables and materials e.g. drugs, hospital furniture etc.
         Availability of these will improves the quality of services provided at the facilities which in turn will
         boost the confidence of the end-users thereby encouraging patronage.
        Support to Health Training Institutions: Pre-service training institutions for PHC workers (nurses,
         midwives, laboratory technologists/ technicians, community health extension workers etc) are the


                                                                                                               53
             targets. Infrastructural and equipment upliftment/improvements as well as training and retraining of
             staff is intended under this component. Improving the skills of the tutors and providing required
             training tools and materials help in improving the quality of training and therefore the graduates who
             later serve in the PHC centres.
     The project objectives were considered relevant (4: in line with the government's medium term plan of
action for Health Sector Reform 2000-05); achievable (3: based on lessons learned from previous Bank
projects in the sector); and consistent with the Bank’s country and corporate priorities (4). The project’s log
frame was judged to be logical (4: high degree of linkage between the proposed project activities and the
expected outputs and outcomes), measurable (3: including means of verification stated in clear and simple
terms), and thorough (3: stating key risks and assumptions, although the poor political will of local
government authorities was however not then envisaged.). The project’s outputs and outcomes are presented
in the tables below:

Lessons learned include the following
    Bank
    Role of Field Office in Project Management: The field office (NGFO) greatly assisted the project in
      meeting the set objectives. NGFO's involvement and later takeover of the project management
      helped in strengthening PIU capacity & effectiveness, responding early to project issues and
      ensuring better supervision/monitoring. With the recruitment of the Social Sector, Procurement and
      Disbursement Specialists at NGFO, disbursement rate moved from 11% in 2006 to 65% in 2008 and
      to 93% when the Social Sector Specialist became the task manager. The project before this which
      was totally managed from HQ ended 4years afetr initial closure date compared to this which has
      2years slippage even though this was more complex in terms of spread, scope and number of
      rehabilitations involved.
    Project Task Managers should be members but not lead of PCRs teams to allow for more objective
      assessment. Their involvment is to ensure institutional memory.
    Greater attention should be paid to project launch workshops to ensure that PIU members are
      properly trained on all aspects of the project implementation
    Bank and Government
    Use of Generator Sets: In some States the generators procured to provide energy to the facilities were
      not in use due to lack of funds to purchase fuel and maintenance. Going forward, future projects may
      benefit from alternative low maintenance cost energy sources e.g. solar to power certain key areas of
      health facilities like water borehole pumping machines, wards and theatre lightings. The government
      should plan appropriately for recurrent expenditure to cater for investments by the Bank
    To avoid delays in effectiveness of future projects, certain procurement and financial activities e.g.
      building designs, bidding documents, opening of bank account should commence before board
      approval or loan signature.
