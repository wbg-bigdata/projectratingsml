MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA
FOR A FORESTRY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Albania for SDR 5.5 million, the equivalent of US$8.0 million, on standard IDA
terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a project for forestry.
2.    Country/Sector Background. With a GNP per capita of US$360 (in 1994), Albania is by far the
poorest country in Europe and an IDA-only country.  Its population of 3.1 million (1993) is
predominantly rural. Agriculture employs 60% of the population and contributes over 50% te the GNP,
half of which comes from livestock activities. Agricultural land is now completely privatized. Albania
has one million ha of State-owned forests and 0.4 million ha of State-owned pastures, together taking up
about half Albania's total land area. In spite of this vast natural resource base, the contribution of forests
and pastures to the country's economy has remained negligible. Public revenues from forests and
pastures do not even cover the administrative costs.
3.    During Albania's transition from a centrally planned economy to market economic conditions
major structural adjustments involving agriculture, enterprises and banking, and the provision of
Government services have been completed or are under way. Reforms of economic policies have led to
widespread liberalization of pricing, external trade and domestic marketing, making Albania one of the
most open economies of the countries in transition. Agricultural land and related assets that had been
nationalized under the communist regime are now practically privatized again.
4.    Forestry is a sector in Albania that so far has not benefited from the above structural changes and
that has been rather negatively affected by the transition. While harvesting and processing activities now
take place through privatized or newly formed enterprises, forest management and investment are still
bound into an old-fashioned State bureaucracy. Forest management and protection have been particularly
affected by the sudden end of the former command and control approach. Uncontrolled harvesting has
developed; continuing administered trade, pricing and marketing procedures generate inefficiencies and
distortions; and fiscal austerity has reduced the budget for the forest administration to the point where
it can only cover the payment of salaries and a few operational costs. A large backlog has developed for
investments in updating forest management plans, reforesting harvested but not replanted forest areas,
maintenance and protection of forests, rehabilitation of forest roads, replacement of worn-out transport
and equipment, upgrading of offices, and introducing more efficient market and incentive-oriented
procedures.
5.    Albania's forests and pastures are administered by the Directorate General of Forests and Pastures
(DGFP) in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF). The sector continues to be oriented toward
meeting domestic requirements that during the transition phase were drastically reduced. Criteria of
economic efficiency are only slowly taking hold in forest and pasture management. New legislation for
forests and pastures has opened possibilities for involving communes in their administration and use. The
potential exists to restore, improve and expand the sector's productive capacities and make it not only
self-financing, but a net contributor to the Government budget. In addition the sector can play important
roles for rural employment, industrial development, and for generating environmental benefits.
6.    Sector Strategy. Albania's draft Constitution reconfirms State ownership over forest and pasture
land that has historically always been a national asset. The basic legal and policy framework for
economic and sustainable development of the sector is in place. While the country lacks an explicit
statement of the principles of its forest and pasture policy that specify long-term goals and operational



- 2 -
directions, the legislative changes and the actions already taken, as well as the Government's involvement
in the design of the proposed project indicate the Government's intentions to develop the sector in three
major thrusts: (i) develop the sector's economic potential on a sustainable basis; (ii) ensure that sound
environmental and nature conservation criteria are applied in this process; and (iii) reduce Government
involvement in the sector through divestiture of enterprises and functions, transfer of user rights, and
institutional reforms.
7.     Project Objectives. The project would have three principal objectives: (i) restore degraded State-
owned forest and pasture areas and promote their sustainable use; (ii) promote conservation of natural
forest ecosystems; and (iii) take the initial steps in the transition of the forestry/pasture sector to a market
economy, separating commercial from regulatory functions and establishing mechanisms for self-financing
of the commercial activities.
8.     Project Description. The project, estimated to cost US$21.6 million, would support institutional
reforms of Albania's forest and pasture administration and forest policy reforms aimed at competitive
marketing, pricing and external trade of forest products It would also provide resources for investment
and related incremental operating costs in the following five main components:  (i) institutional
development of the forest/pasture administration including related training, education and research and
the establishment of a project environmental management unit (26% of total cost); (ii) improved
management of State forests (45%); (iii) rehabilitation of forest roads (14%); (iv) management of
communal forest and pasture areas (13%); and (v) management of protected areas (2%). The project
would be cofinanced by the Government of Italy with a soft loan of $8.5 million and a technical
assistance grant of $2.5 million, latter to be administered by FAO, as well as by the Government of
Switzerland with a technical assistance grant of $0.45 million.
9.     Project Implementation.  Project preparation and start-up activities are being supported by a
Project Preparation Advance ($0.6 million) for the provision of emergency transport equipment to
improve control of forest harvesting, implement a pilot project for communal forest and pasture
management and finance consultants for the refinement of project design, training and project
management. The project would support the transformation of DGFP into a financially and managerially
autonomous "Forest Corporation" that would be responsible for commercial operations of State forests
and pastures, once the forestry sector had become financially viable through improved forest management,
competitive marketing, and liberalization of external trade. Policy, regulatory and service functions
would be relocated to a new forest and pasture department in the Ministry of Agriculture. Furthermore,
a Project Environmental Management Unit would be created, independent from the main implementing
agencies and project general management, to promote and monitor environmental soundness of all project
operations. Until the Forest Corporation is established, the DGFP would remain the major project
implementing agency and beneficiary, along with the Forest and Pasture Research Institute, the Forest
Technician School, and the communes participating in the communal forest and pasture management
component.
10.   To ensure focus, efficiency and accountability in a situation with major institutional reforms
evolving under the project, temporary management mechanisms would be established which include a
high-level Project Steering Committee chaired by the Minister of Agriculture, and a Project Management
Unit (PMU) reporting to that Steering Committee.  PMU  would be responsible for preparing,
coordinating and monitoring implementation of all project-supported work programs under contracts or
agreements with the implementing agencies, implementing or coordinating procurement actions, securing
project funding and making payments, keeping project accounts and reporting on project progress.



- 3 -
11.   Project Sustainability. The project would create new institutions and procedures which will allo%
more efficient management of the State forest and pasture resources while ensuring compliance with
sound environmental standards. In the last years, the forestry/pasture sector has been a drain on the
Government's budget. The policy reforms, institutional strengthening and initial investments supported
under the project are expected to turn the situation around and generate increased revenues from DGFP's
operations. A conservative estimate, based on timber and fuelwood income alone, indicates that the
forestry sector's overall balance of total public income and expenditures could turn positive during year
three of the project and could allow self-financing of a Forest Corporation from 1999 onwards. Treasury
net income from forestry (the Corporation's forest royalties and taxes less continued budgetary support
for the new Forest and Pasture Department) will sharply increase once the Corporation is operating on
the basis of its own revenues without further budgetary support, except project investments. In the longer
term, potential annual gross proceeds of about $20 million could be expected from timber sales alone.
30-50% of this would accrue to Treasury from the Corporation's payments of royalties, dividends and
profit taxes, making the forestry sector a major net contributor to the Government's budget, even if taking
into account future budget expenditures for non-commercial activities of the new forest and pasture
department and payments of interest/service charges and principal on the Italian soft loan and the IDA
credit for the project.
12.   Lessons Learned from  Previous IDA Involvement.  The proposed project would be .he
Association's first operation in Albania's forestry and pasture sector. Nevertheless, the experiences from
ongoing IDA supported operations in related sectors have been built into the design of the forestry
project. These include: the willingness of the Albanian Government to tackle difficult policy and
institutional reforms as demonstrated under the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Program that supported
the transition to a market economy and the reduction of the role of the Government in that sector; the
successful involvement of local communities in improving their situation and resource base as is
happening under the Rural Development projects--the principle of this participatory approach is being
applied under the forestry project's communal forest and pasture management component; and the need
to use temporary project management mechanisms and technical assistance to effect change until line
institutions have been reformed and their capacity strengthened to assume their new roles. Government
commitment to sustainable and conservation-oriented forestry, which is required under the Bank's Forest
Sector Policy, has been shown by Government endorsement of the findings and recommendations of the
Ecological Survey of Selected High Forests of Albania, of a full Environmental Assessment for the
project and the adoption of an Action Plan to reduce illegal forest harvesting. Details of future actions
and the monitoring arrangements are incorporated into the project's environmental mitigation and
monitoring plan that was agreed during negotiations of the proposed credit. They also provide for furthier
policy, legal, institutional development of the sector to ensure conservation and sustainable forest use and
promote active participation of local people and the private sector. The project also includes specific
environmental management arrangements and a component to strengthen and further develop managemnent
of protected areas.
13.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is linked to the development priorities
formulated in the Country Assistance Strategy which was discussed by the Board on September 9, 1993.
The CAS emphasizes infrastructure development and selected projects for poverty alleviation. The
proposed forestry project would make a major contribution toward effecting change in the forestry/pasture
sector at the national level, in particular introducing principles of use of natural resources that are both
sustainable and market-oriented, and redefining the public and private roles. The serious lack of domestic
fiscal resources affecting all sectors in Albania, will require substantial foreign assistance, both financial
and technical. IDA is in a position to help fill this gap and mobilize further external assistance (Italy,
Switzerland). In parallel, USAID has started a private forestry development program that provides policy



- 4 -
advice, supports forestry on private farms, and fosters communal forest and pasture management, the
latter is similar to the IDA project component.
14.   Agreements Reached. Agreements were reached at negotiations on the following: (i) a phased
approach for project implementation and on the criteria for the establishment of the future Forest
Corporation at the mid-term of the project; (ii) the terms of reference of a Project Environmental
Management Unit (PEMU) in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, and its establishment no later than
January 1, 1997; (iii) the submission to IDA of a draft decision or law to establish the Revenue Account
by July 15, 1996; (iv) the adoption of improved marketing and pricing procedures for timber and
fuelwood, their introduction no later than July 1, 1996, and maintenance of such marketing and pricing
procedures, acceptable to IDA; (v) the procurement arrangements as described in the SAR; (vi) the
environmental mitigation and monitoring plan to be implemented under the project; (vii) the terms of
reference and the qualification and experience of the Project Director (PMU) and of the head of the
Project Environmental Management Unit (PEMU) would be acceptable to IDA; (viii) the Project
Management Unit (PMU) will not disburse for communal investments unless the transfer of land to the
commune had been effective and the "Agreement-Contract" between DGFP and the participating
commune had been signed in each case; (ix) only expenditures included in the approved work plan and
budget, acceptable to IDA, would be eligible for funding from project resources, and quarterly updates
and revisions of the project work plan and budget would be acceptable to IDA; (x) the terms of reference
and the qualifications and experience of the following TA assignments would be acceptable to IDA: (1)
the full-time advisor to the Project Director, (2) the scientific or forest management institution that would
provide back-stopping to PEMU, and (3) the forestry policy specialist who would coordinate the
preparation of the forest and pasture sector strategy; and (xi) the auditing and reporting requirements as
described in the SAR.
15.   Furthermore, the Government agreed to comply with the following Dated Covenants: (i) the
exchange of views on the adequacy of DGFP's control over forest harvesting no later than during the
mid-term project progress review; (ii) the draft work program and budget would be submitted to IDA no
later than October 15 of each year; (iii) the annual exchange of views with IDA, prior to the finalization
of the budget, on the investment program funded under the local Revenue Account; (iv) the sector
strategy review documents would be prepared by June 30, 1997; public workshops/seminars would be
held, and a study and recommendations be prepared by June 30, 1998; proposals for amending the
forestry law and the draft law on the protection of nature and biological diversity would be reviewed with
IDA no later than April 30, 1999; and the agreed proposal and draft law would be submitted to
Parliament no later than June 30, 1999; and (v) the carrying out of a mid-term project progress review
before December 31, 1998.
16.   A Condition of effectiveness of the credit would be the effectiveness of the three cofinancing
sources: the Italian Government loan; the Italian Government grant and the FAO technical assistance
project; and the Swiss grant.
17.   Conditions or disburserment of the credit would be: (i) for the preparation of management plans
for State forests: the adoption of regulations for new-style forest management planning methodology,
acceptable to IDA; and (ii) for communal forest works investments under the communal forest and
pasture management component (excluding works financed under the pilot project with PPF funding): the
approval by Government of the regulation, acceptable to IDA, for the transfer of State forest and pasture
land to communes.
18.   Environmental Aspeds.  The project as a forestry operation has been assigned to the
Environmental "A" category, in line with the Bank's Forestry Policy. Based on the findings and



- 5 -
recommendations of the Ecological Survey, the originally proposed construction of new forest access
roads to open up new areas for timber harvesting was eliminated from the project, and harvesting
operations were limited to areas with existing access that do not classify as present or future protected
areas. A full Environmental Assessment (EA) was carried out in parallel with project appraisal. Public
hearings were held in October 1995, and the EA report was endorsed by the Government on January 17,
1996. The English summary of the EA report and the matrices on environmental issues and the
mitigation and monitoring plan has been submitted to the Board on February 29, 1996. All major
additional findings and recommendations of the Ecological Survey and the EA have been incorporated
in the project design and funding: (i) the addition of a protected areas management component, including
the development of a management plan for one existing national park; (ii) the establishment and operation
of a Project Environmental Management Unit separate from project implementing agencies and the project
management unit; the environmental unit inter alia would be responsible for managing the implementation
of the mitigating measures; (iii) the expansion of skill development in environmental matters through
training, provision of expert advice and twinning with a suitable counterpart agency abroad for all
agencies in Albania concerned with forest ecosystems; and (iv) the use of a forest and pasture sector
strategy review to involve local specialists and public participation and improve the environment for
multiple-use and sustainable forestry.
19.    Program Objective Categores. The project is a targeted intervention to promote environmentally
sustainable development of forests and pastures.
20.    Participatory Approach. The project emphasizes participation by interested or affected private
parties through: (i) the project environmental assessment process to which NGOs have significantly
contributed; (ii) the development of "new-style" forest management planning and implementation
methodology which will consider local populations' interests; (iii) public awareness campaigns to enlist
support of local populations for reduction of illegal logging and protection of "protected areas"; (iv) the
explicit community participation approach used under the communal forest and pasture management
component; and (v) the implementation and public discussion of a long-term strategy for forest and
pasture development.
21.   Project Benefits. In relation to the principal project objectives the project's activities are expected
to generate the following benefits: (i) economic production benefits from restoring degraded forest and
pastures; (ii) direct and indirect environmental benefits from preventing losses from soil erosion, and
enhancing biodiversity and ecosystems protection and preservation of protected areas; and
(iii) institutional and policy improvements that are expected to lead to higher degrees of efficiency and
sustainability of use of a public renewable resource, with provisions to safeguard stakeholder interests
and the creation of positive externalities through continued, but more focused public sector involvement.
Key indicators for progress would be: control of illegal harvesting operations; application of new-style
forest management methodology that would be geared to multiple and sustainable forest use; achievement
of the sector's financial viability which in turn will depend on competitive marketing and trade
liberalization; and creation of an autonomous Forest Corporation to deal with commercial, efficient
exploitation of the resource.
22.    Risks. Project risks regarding technical aspects of forest management, road rehabilitation and
communal forest and pasture management are considered low. Albania possesses the basic expertise to
deal with technical aspects of forest use. The main risks of the project relate to uncertainties about the
implementation of the institutional and policy reforms. Critical elements are, first, the State must regain
control over forest management and exploitation. To this end, the project focuses on the implementation
of a monitorable action plan to reduce illegal logging and the early strengthening of the administrative
capacity through the provision of physical inputs and staff reorientation and training. Second is the need



- 6 -
to achieve financial viability and sustainability within the sector.  To this end, market-oriented
procedures, both in domestic marketing and external trade, would be introduced to help overcome the
current under-use and under-valuation of the forest resource. Third is the need to improve the technical
and economic efficiency of forest and pasture operations. To this end, the project would support the
separation of commercial forest and pasture operations as the responsibility of a financially autonomous
enterprise from the regulatory and policy activities that would remain part of the Government
administration. The risk to achieve the policy and institutional goals is mitigated by allowing a relative
long adjustment and reform period of up to three years. This period would be used to build capacity for
dealing with the issues, achieve consensus within Albania about the longer term arrangements for use of
the forest and pasture resources, and refine concepts and planning for the policy, legal and institutional
actions. This process would be helped by a proposed high-level seminar in year two to review strategies
proposed for the development of the sector, and the mid-term review of the Project. Latter would be
used to assess progress made in resolving the above critical aspects and, depending on the outcome and
achievements, to confirm or adjust the design and scope of project activities, in particular, the more
heavy forest and road rehabilitation investments planned for the second half of the project.
23.    Recommendaton.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
