INTRODUCTION
1.    The World Bank (WB) is considering funancing a Forestry Project in Albania to support
policy changes and to provide required investments to overcome the development constraints of the
* .        forestry sector, to facilitate the transition from a centrally-planned to market economic conditions and
to promote the sustainable management of the forest areas.
2.    In compliance with the Bank's environmental requirements, the proposed project was
classified in Environmental Category 'A' and therefore a full Environmental Assesment (AE) was
conducted from June to September 1995.
3.    This EA Report was prepared by a team of consultants recruited by FAO/CP at the request
of the World Bank. The Mission Leader was Mr. P. Brylski, Ecologist and Biodiversity
Conservation Specialist Other international consultants were Mrs. M.T. Cirelli, Legislation
Specialist, Mr. H. Buys, Forest Harvesting and Roads Specialist, Mr. P.R. Stevens, Participative
Management Specialist and Mr. A.K. Jones, Institutions SpecialisL Various local consultants joined
the mission in Albania to work with the international tearn during the three field periods in June, July
and September. One stakeholder review workshop was organized in September 1995 to ensure the
agreemnent of local people and the Government with the main findings of the study.
4.    This main report and summary was prepared by Mr. Brylski and is based on findings and
working papers of the other mission members. FAO coordinated mission work and provided
logistical support.

SUMMARY
THE FOREMSY PROJECT
1.    'he Albania forestry project would support a number of programs and activities designed to
strengthen the management of Albanian fxrests and proteced areas. The project would also promote
reforms of marketing procedures and of pricing and trading policies for forest products, and assist
in policy formulation. Specific activities to be financed under the proiject include:
i)    Capacity-building of the DGFP (the agency responsible for the msnagement of state
forests), including taining, education and research;
ii)   dividing the DGFP into a Forest Corporation responsible for the management of state
forests and pastres and a new forestry department that would be responsible for
policy, regulatory and service functions;
ih)   new forest managerent plans would be developed for about 160,000 ha of high
forests that would address social and ecological functions of forests as well as wood
products;
.:)   350 Ikm of existing forest roads in 70 forest management units would be rehabilimted
and maintained;
v)    participatory silvo-pastoral management of forests and pastures would be undertaken
in 30 communes; and
vI)   strengthening of a new protected areas management unit in DGFP/FPD through the
provision of equipment and transport, staff training, and preparation of a management
plan for Lura National Park.
LEGAL AND INsrUrmoNAL ISSUES
2.    The laws on Forestry and the Forest Police Service generally provide an adequate legal basis
for sustainable forestry. Inprovements are needed for the protection of threatened and endangered
species and for management of protected areas. These are included in an existing draft Law on the
Protection of Nature and Biological Diversity. In the absence of mitigation, this would potentially
result in the loss of Albanian biological and geetic diversity in the long-term. To assist in
mitigating this, the DGFP, FPRI, and the MAF will participate in reviewing and revising the draft
law, and support it's submission for Parliamentary action by late-1997. Although adoption of this
law and its implenentation in the course of the project will have a beneficial environmental impact,
this cannot be guaranteed, and the impact remains potentially significant.
3.    The forestry project will strengthen the institutions responsible for forestry and environmental
mnanagement. A principal concern is that commercial goals be balnced with regulatory/policy goals,
and that the new departments work together in providing environmental protection for, and
sustinable uses of, forest resources. This concern has been mitigated in the following ways: z0 GOA

acceptance of the recommendations on protected areas from the ecological survey (Habili et al, 1995)
and the mitigations of this environmental assessment; it) continued examination of the issues of
protected areas within the contexts of the Forest and Pasture Sector Strategy and the Biodiversity
Strategy to identify ndditional forests that merit status as protected areas, and further define the roles
of production and protection forests in Albania; Hi) creation of a Project Environmental Management
Unit to oversee environmental issues during project implementation, including voting power on the
steering conmitte that decides expenditures and work plans for the forestry project; iv) professional
development and taining in updating the forest management plans and conducting environmental
analyses of these plans, including regional and site-specific biodiversity planning; v) development of
an effective public involvement effort for Albanian forestry, including public meetings for the Forest
Council, consensus-building steps during development of the Forest and Pasture Sector Strategy, and
public involvement in the preparation and environmental review of the forest management plans; and
In) strengthening of protected areas management in 5 districts and preparation of a management plan
for an expanded Lura National Park. The enviromnmental irnpacts of this and other institutional
strengthening components of the project is beneficial.
4.    An exceptional insfitutional problem is the inadequate enforcement of laws against illegal
harvesting, which is having significant environmental and economic impacts. Approval of an action
plan to prevent illegal harvesting is a requirement of project negotiations, and strengthening of the
DGFP under the projcct will provide the resources needed to implement the plan.
5.    The acrrent export ban on most forest products prevents Albania from realizing the full
revenue from its forest resources. From an environmental perspective, the export ban contributes
to forest protection by preventing or controlling the economic incentives for intensified illegal
harvesting. Removal of all or parts of the export ban could exacerbate existing probiems of illegal
harvesting and its envrmental impacts. The mitigation for this inpact is that liberalization of
timber exports would occur gradually, no earlier than mid-term review of the 5-year project, and
would be tied to demonsuation, by an independent analysis, of the success of the action plan to
prevent il'egal harvesting.
COMMUNAL FORESFRY
6.    The pilot commnunal ibrestry projects will inrduce new tools for identifying and solving
problems in commnunal resource management, including a simple GIS system for examining patterns
of communal resources and teaching villagers how to manage them. Improved management is
expected to increase yields of wood and domestic animal production from communal forest and
pasture lands. These pilot projects will also have beneficial environmnental impacts through reduced
erosion, restoration of degraded ecosystems, and imnproved operation of rural irrigation systems. The
magnitude of beneficial economnic and environml impacts of the communal forestry component
will depend on villager participation in integrated natural resource management, particularly in
grazing nanagement of pastus.

FoREST MANAGEMENT' PLANNING
7.    The Forest and Pasture Sector Strategy will define Albania's concept of sustainable forestry
and pastre management, and include standards and methods to optimize recreation, tourism,
biodiversity conservation, and the management and conservation of Albania's old growth forests.
8.    Updating of forest management plans for 160,000 hectares of high forest is a central project
component that will require cooperative efforts by an interdisciplinary team of foresters, biologists.
public involvement specialists, and others. The plans are to be developed according to the guidelines
on forest management planning and public involvement in forest resource management, the impact
of which will be beneficial.
FoREsT THINNG, HARvEsTiNG, AND RoAD REHAB[LrrATION
9.    Forest harvesting operations are rot funded under the project Nonetheless, forest harvesting
will continue. An estimated 1.68 million m3 of timber is expected to be harvested over the five years
of the project, partly from the 70 forest units covered by project-related field activities. To ensure
consistency with the project objectives, no harvesting will occur in areas without access roads (which
contain most of the Albanian old growth beech forest), forest management plans will be updated as
soon as is feasible, and EIAs will be conducted for forest management plans, forest harvesting plans,
and road rehabilitation activities.
10.   Based on 1992 data, Albania was practicing sustainable forestry from the standpoint of wood
harvesting. At that time, the annual allowable cut (AAC) for Albania's 1,031,000 ha of forest land
was esfimated at 1,520,000 nil: 747,000 ne of timber and 773,000 mn of fuelwood. Under the
previous government, the annual harvest was more than twice the AAC.  Since the fall of
communism, the annual cutting level has reportedly fallen to only 200,000 mn. DGFP!FPRI
estimates are that legal and illegal harvesting in 1994 totaled 379,000 nil (24.9% of AAC),
comprised of 142,000 re of timber (37.4%) and 237,000 n3 (62.6%) of fuelwood. These figures
are well below the AAC, just 19% for timber and 31% for fuelwood. Provided these figures are
good estimates of both legal and illegal harvesting, the AAC was not exceeded in 1994. The
intensity of illegal harvesting is considered to be high in 1995, but reliable estimates of the volumes
involved are not available.
11.   The project can be expected to improve economic utilization of Albanian high forests by
increasing tree growth and harvest levels through intensive management, and provide an increased
and stable supply of wood to the wood industries and construction sectors of the Albanian economy.
12.   Mitigation for potentially adverse impacts of forestry operations in the long term rests on
development and implementation of sector objectives (e.g., from the Forest and Pasture Sector
Strtegy), establishment of an environcrntal review process that mitigates significant adverse impacts
and identifies and improves management of forest units appropriate for harvesting operations, and
adherence to forest management planning and partic ratory management guidelines.
13.   Harvesting operations are not funded under the project, but are expected to continue during
project implementation. These operations would have potentially significant impacts on sensitive

wildlife species. The following nitigations are expected to reduce the potential impacts on
biodiversity to a less than significant level:
r)    The old growth forests of Albania are found largely in the forest units without access
roads (Habili et al, 1995), and these areas have been excluded from road building and
timber harvesting activities during project implementation.
u)    Harvesting plans developed for other forests of Albania will incorporate a moratorium
on snag removal until standards for the conservation of this habitat are established.
Standards for snag retention and maintenance of heterogeneous mix of forest, shrub,
and herbaceous vegetation are to be developed and included in the updated forest
management plans.
ii)    Foreign technical assistance for park planning will include professional development
and training for site-specific and regional biodiversity analyses and planning.
iv)    The PEMU, FPRI, DGFP, MNS, and IBR, will identify forest units with current
forest management plans (less than 10 years old) where forest harvesting is unlikely
to have significant impacts to biodiversity. The resulting forest units will be
candidates for forest harvesting prior to updating of the forest management plans
during years 1 and 2 of the project EIAs will be prepared for proposed harvesting
operations. For the remaining forest units, forest harvesting shall not be implemented
prior to updating of their forest management plans.
v)    Floral and faunal surveys by qualified Albanian specialists will be included in the
updated forest management plans, and as part of the ELAs on forest harvesting
operions and forest management plans.
PROTECTED AREAS
14.   The reconunendations on new-protected areas from the Ecological Survey (Habili et al,
1995), which were based on the need to represent the diversity of its forest ecosystems, were
recently approved by the GOA as a condition of negotiation for the forestry loan. The establishment
of these new protected areas can be expected to occur in parallel with the five-year forestry project
The forestry project provides funding for protected areas management within five districts (Diber,
Llogara, Valbona, Bredhi i Drenoves, and Kune Vaini). The reconunendations on protected areas
within these districts found either in the ecological survey or developed during the Biodiversity
Strategy will be implemented under the project.
15.   The Drotected area network for forest ecosystems, based on these recommendations, will be
sufficient wift regard to total area and representation of Albanian forest ecosystems. However, like
other small European countries, the individual protected areas are relively small (less than 10,000
ha). As a result, long-term conservation of large vertebrates such as wolf, bear, and chamois will
require intensive forest and wildlife management, the methods for which will be addressed in the
Biodiversity Staegy and the Forest and Pasture Sector Straegy.

16.   The capacity for management of protected areas will be improved in five high priority
districts through the provision of equipment and training, and through preparation of a plan for the
expansion and management of Lura National Park. TMis project component will have a beneficial
environmental imnpact. The capacity for protected areas management will be improved through
training and the provision of equipment, the immediate impact of which will be greater protection
in these areas from illegal activities. The long-term environmental benefits will include improved
conservation of biological resources ffiroughout Albania through the application of park planning
techniques to protected areas outside of those addressed by the forestry project

Changes in laws                   The changes In laws are needed to create a more efficient forest management system  No mitigation
with both forest production and conservation objectives. Under the project, specific  needed
objectives and methods of sustainable and multiple use forestry will be Incorporated into
a revised Law on Forests following completion of the Forest and Pasture Sector
Strategy. The changes will have a positive environmental impact on forest resources If
the project Is Implemented as proposed.
Inadequate enforcement of existing   llegal logging operations are done without any environmental protection measures, such  1, 2
laws and regulations on forest    as measures for slope and soil protection in rugged terrain, adherence to annual
protection, particularly for the  allowable cut standards, and avoidance of sensitive babitats. Existing Impacts of illegal
prevention of Illegal and          harvesting on increased erosion, sedimentation of onsite streams and downstream rivers,
unmanaged harvesting,             and localized but Intensive disturbances to protected areas is significant. The action
plan to prevent and monitor illegal harvesting to be implemented under the project will
have a beneficial environmental impact.
Impact of trade liberalization    Trade liberalization would stimulate overbarvesting by exacerbating the existing problem  2, 3
of Illegal harvesting, which would prevent the positive environmental betiefits of the
project from being realized. Overharvesting of the forests would have significant
Impacts on forest resources, including conversion of forest to shrub habitats as a result
overwhelmed silvicultural management, increased soil erosion and attendant degradation
of water quality, and direct impacts to blodiversity. Under the project, liberalization of
timber exports would occur gmdually, no earlier than mid-term review, and would be
tied to the prevention of illegal harvesting.
Legal basis for envirnmental      The legal basis for undertaking ElAs Is the 1993 Law on Environmental Protection,  No mitigation
impact analyses (ElAs)             which requires ElAs for activities that may have a significant impact on the         needed
environment, Including forestry operations. Apart from clarifications to the Law on
Environmental Protection or the guidelines for EIA preparation (to be assisted by the
forestry project), no additional laws or changes In laws are needed.

(1995-2001), partly from the 70 forest units covered by project-related field activities.
These operations would have potentially significant impacts to sensitive plant and
wildlife species. To ensure consistency with the project objectives, no harvesting will
occur In areas without access roads (which contain most of Albanian old growth beech
forest), forest management plans will be updated as smon as Is feasible, and ElAs will be
conducted for forest management plans, forest harvesting plans, and road rehabilitation
activities. Mitigation will also require development of habitat management guidelines for
snags and habitat heterogeneity and their Incorporation into the forost management plans
(mitigation #9).

species, Including if necessary the removal of forest stands or forest units from forest
operations, and evaluate the consistency of the plans with sustainable forestry policies.
Environmental assessments and if necessary, ElAs, will be conducted for road
rehabilitation and forest harvesting operations. The impact of these studies will be
positive If their recommendations are Implemented.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Desciptiom of Albinia
Albania is located on the western part of the Balkan peninsula (Figure 1) between 39 38' and 42 39'
latitude and between 19 16' and 21 4' longitude, and covers 28,750 kn2. Administratively, the
country is divided into 12 prefectures, 36 districts, 315 communes, and 2900 villages. In 1993, the
population was 3.011 million people, with 37 percent living in urban areas and 63 percent in rural
areas. There is a gradual movement of the population from rural to urban areas, and by the tum of
the century, the population is expected to be evenly divided (50 percent) between rural and urban
areas.
Albania comprises three main ecological zones: the coastal plains (northern and southern), the hilly
transition sub-mountainous zone, and the mountainous zone. Forests cover 36 percent of the
country. The climatic and soil conditions are favorable for forest growth. The annual precipitation
varies from about 800 mm/year in the hills and coastal plains to over 2,000 mm/year in the
mountains. There is a dry period in the summer in the mediterranean part of the country.

Overview of the proposed forestry project
For the past 3 to 4 years, Albania has been transforming from a centralized economy to a free
market economy. Within this frmework, the Albanian government has prepared a forestry project,
the subject of this environmental assessment. The main objective of the forestry project is to
improve sustainable use of the forests.
The economic hardships of the transition have impacted the forest sector in the following ways: 1)
the operating budget for the DGFP and FPRI have not been sufficient to control or maintain the
resources to adequately manage state forests, and 2) low levels of household incomes have resulted
in increased reliance on fuelwood for energy needs, and on livestock for increased revenues. This
has resulted in heavy harvesting and grazing pressure on the forests, particularly near populated areas
and dramatically increased due to lack of control of illegal activities and to inability of the foresty
sector to meet the consumption needs of the people.
The project would support institutional reforms towards transforming DGFP into a legally and
financially autonomous 'Forest Corporation' that would be responsible for the managemnent of State
forests and pastures, and towards creating a new forest departnent within the Ministry of Agriculture
to take over policy, regulatory and service functions from DGFP. The project would also promote
reforms of the marketing procedures and of pricing and trading policies for forest products, and
assist in policy formulation and environmental monitoring. The project would provide resources for
investments in the following components:
Reorganimz.on and Strenwthenin!of DGFP through (I) decentralizing its management structure, (2)
developing skills for improved bidding, contracting, marketing, and financial management, and (3)
establishing a local 'Revenue Account' for locally financed investments. After preparation of the
legal and financial framework, and assessment of the policy and economic environment during the
mid-term review of the project, it is expected that DGFP could be transforned into an autonomous
Forest Corporation during year three of the project, while the responsibility for policy, regulatory
and service functions would be transferred to a new Forest and Pasture Department in MAF.
SwRoii for Training. Education and Research in Foresa and Pasrures In-service training for
forestry and pasture staff at senior and mid-levels would be done through project-financed service
contracts with the Forest Faculty at the Agricultral University of Tirana. In addition, provision
would be made for other local and foreign training. Education for forestry technicians would also
be supported by funding courses, equipment, and training of trainers at the Forest Technician School.
The Forestry and Pasture Research Institute would be strengthened through upgrading of its facilities
and foreign training of its staff.
e-a Maw           A temporary Project Managernent Unit (PMU) would be responsible to plan,
coordinate, manage and monitor all project activities in accordance with work programs and '-udgets
approved by a Project Steering Committee chaired by the Minister of Agriculture.
e4criai Assmsane would be provided froEm two grant sources: (1) the Government of Switzerland
($0.45 million total cost) to support the project components for communal forest and pasture and for
protected areas. This TA would be implemented by PMU; and (2) the Government of Italy under
a FAO-GCP project ($2.5 million total cost) to support project management and all other project

components. The FAO-GCP technical assistance project would include a sub-component ($0.2
million) to support environmental monitoring of forestry by the PEMU, which would, in addition
tD the provision of a foreign expert, finance a local counterpart, on-the-job training and related
equipment, tansport, office and operating funds.
lmnroved State Forest ManW areme  involves: (i) strengthening of forest field management and
conservation services; (ii) development of improved forest management plans for 160,000 ha; (iii)
reforestation of 1,000 ha in areas of clay soils with steep slopes; and (iv) pre-commercial thinning
on 29,000 ha. Figure 1 shows the districts and forest units where field activities under the project
would be focused.
Forest Roads Rehabilitation involves the rehabilitation and maintenance of about 350 km of existing
forest roads in 55 forest management units in 16 districts.
The Communal Forest and Pasture Mana emevw component would support nanagement of forests
and pastures in 30 communes, involving: (i) the development, under a participatory approach, of
improved forest and pasture management and investment plans for areas of State forests and pastures
that have been tansferred to communes; and (ii) funding of selected communal investment projects
in restoration of degraded areas and pasture improvement, planting of fodder and fuel wood trees,
and fencing for protection and rehabilitaion of highly degraded coppice and shrub forests; and Ciii)
establishment of a data base on communally managed forests and pastures.
Ihe Prorecred Areas       of the project indudes capacity building and a pilot management plan
for Lura National Park. Under the capacity building subcomponent, vehicles, radios, and other
equipment needed to increase staff efficiency will be purchased for five districts, and technical
assistance and traiming of staff from Truana and the five districts will occur. The pilot management
plan for Lura National Park will involve development of a management plan to expand the park,
environmental education, receation and tourism promotion, and hiring of several staff to provide
additional protection.
Project Need, Objectives, and Statey
The problems in the foresty sector are as follows: 1) unsustainable level of wood harvesting due to
high fuelwood consumption and high level of illegal harvesting; 2) resource degradation due partly
to concentrated wood harvesting in accessible areas and to conflicting land uses such as livestock
grazing; 3) underutilized potential for revenue generation due to inefficient organizational,
infrastructural, market, processing, and financial arrangement; and 4) ill-adapted human resource
base, for adequt implementation of policies and programmes, due to the past economnic history and
inadequate faciiities for education, training, and research.
The proposed project would have the following objectives: i) restore degraded State-owned forest
and pasture areas and promot their sustainable use; i) promote conservation of nature in forests;
and ;ii) take the initial steps in the transition of the forestry/pastur sector to a market economy,
separating comnmercial from regulatory functions and establishing mechanisms for self-financing of
the commercial activities.

Without intensified forest management, substantial adverse cnvironmental, social, and economic
consequences for the Albanian forestry sector are expected. Given the budgetary constraints of the
country, there is a need for external financial assistance to improve forest management now.
Identification of the lead agency and responsible agencies
The Law on Envirommental Protection (No. 7664 of January 21, 1993) requires environmental impact
assessmernts (EIAs) of activities that mnay have a significant impact on the environment. This
environmental assessment of the forestry project is the first such document prepared in Albania. At
the time of this report, the roles of the CEP and the MAF in the environmental review of forestry
projects is not fmnalized.
A provisional arrangement for the environmental review of forestry projects is that the DGFP will
prepare the EA and contract with other Albanian specialists (e.g., biologists) as appropriate. Based
on this provisional arrangement, and on creation of the Project Environmental Management Unit
within thc MAF to provide environmental oversight for the project, the lead agency is the MAF.
The CEP will review the EA for completeness and prepare questions, comments, and additional
recommendations on the EA to be finalized by the DGFP.
Purpose of the Environmental Assessment
In accordance with Bank standards (World Bank, 1991), the purpose of this environmental
assessment is to improve decision-making and to ensure that the project components are
environmentally sound and sustainable. This environmental assessment is a sectral EA, used for
the design of sector investment programs. Where possible, it also addresses the impacts and
mitigations of specific projec components. The EA was prepared to improve the forestry project
by preventing, minimzing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse impacts.
This environmental assessment was prepared by the FAO Investment Center in collaboration with
specialists from the Albanian Forest and Pasture Research Institute (FPRI), General Forestry and
Pasture Directorate (DGFP), Insfitute for Biological Research (IBR), Museum of Natural Sciences
(MNS), and University of Tirana Faculty of Natural Sciences.
The FAO Investment Center team was comprised of specialists in laws and institutions, forest roads,
harvesting and mamagement, biodiversity, and participatory management. A list of preparers is found
in chapter 16. Each of the participants conducted their work in rwana, with one or more field trips
to forest units and comnmnes where activities will be implemented under the project.
Ubanian Forests
The forest fund is comprised of 1,165,000 ha and 81,624,000 mn of standing volume, and plays an
important role in environmental protection at the local and regional levels. The structure of the
forest fund is a follows:
a.    High forestarea:  515,000, 64,127,000 mn of which conifers comprise 117,000 ha and
18,277,000 ni3 and broadleaves comprise 398,000 ha and 45,850,000 in.
Agwania Foresry EnWronnenaa Msssmem

b.    Coppice: 340,000 ha and 10,439,000 m'.
c.    Garrigue and maquis scrub: 310,000 ha and 7,058,000 W3.
88 percent of these forests comprising 904,900 ha and 72,055,000 mW are considered 'productive',
while the remaining forests 12 percent are 'non-productive', although have protective and social
functions.
Although Albania contains extnsive areas covered by vegetation (Figure 2), the number of
undisturbed areas is relatively small. Currntly, there are six existing National Parks that were
established by decree in 1966. The recently completed Ecological Survey of Selected High Forests
of Albania (Habili et al, 1995) recommends the establishment of a number of new protected areas,
including 3 Strict Naure Reserves totaling 9,500 ha and 4 National Parks totaling 15,200 ha.
The ecological conditions in Albania provide for a rich flora comprised of about 3200 species, of
which from 10 to 12 percent are forest trees and shrubs. The forest vegetation, like the flora of the
country generally, is represented by two grups: 1) broadleaf species and conifer species of the sub-
arctic type at higher elevations and 2) Mediterranean conifers (Pinus pinea and Pinus hatapensis),
as well as moditerranean maquis, comprised of numerous species (e.g., Arbwus wzdeo and Eica
arborea), and shrub species such and Myrnus commwus, Philyrea, and others. There are four
phytoclimatic zones in the forest areas: Mediterranean shrubs, oak-woodland, beech forest,
Mediterranean fir, and mountain pine. These are discussed more fully in the Biological Resources
section of this report
Sinple beech forests are the dominant forest type in the study area. Mixed stands comprise less than
10 percent of the total volume. Ecological, landscape, recreation, and economnic values are especially
high in mixed stands of conifers and broadleaves. In the upper part of the beech zone, it niixes with
nountain pir s (Pinus heiidreichi and P. peuce) and at the lower altitudes, it mixes with maple, ash,
fir, and oaks (e.g., Qrs pereae and Q. pubescens). Such mixed forests are richer in forest
structure and aesthetics than simpk beech forests.

2.0 PROJECT DESCRIION
2.1 Project History
In 1992 and 1993, two missions and two pre-preparation missions from FAO/CP visited Albania to
work with the government of Albania (GOA) to prepare what was then referred to as the proposed
Forestry Development ProjecL The final mission to finalize the report was conducted in September,
1993, at which timne the project was renamed the Integrated Forest Management Project to reflect
the intersectoral aspects related to the forestry sector, including pastoral, wildland, social, and
environmental aspects hat would be addressed by the project.
The proposed forestry project was approved in principle by Albania (Decision No. 570 of Council
of Ministers dated November 29, 1994) and is listed as one of the priority projects to be fmanced
by IDA in 1996 (Decision No. 599 of Council of Ministers dated December 20, 1994). The project
has several changes since project pre-appraisal in March, 1995, the most important of which are:
Wikands Con;ponenr The wildlands component recommended in the FAO (1994) report was
frst removed, then later substiuted with a smaller Protected Areas Management component
The Protected Areas Management component will strengthen the capacity of the DGFP staff
responsible for managing wildlands, through the provision of technical assistance, trnsport
and communications equipment, staff training. A protected areas pilot project would also be
undertaken for Lura National Park, for the purpose of training and preparation of a
managtement plan.
Forest Products Trade Liberalization: Export bans for logs, poles, sawn wood and fuel wood
would be maintined, but considered for liberalization later in project implementation.
Liberalization (including elimination of quotas and licenses) would be maintained for exports
of all other forest products including charcoal.
Forest and Pasture Sector Straregy Formulation: Increased emphasis is placed on preparation
of a Forest and Pasture Sector Strategy, to be prepared early in the project This study will
help to focus the project on the central issues of sustinability, participatory management, and
environmnental management of Albanian forestry. The PMU will coordinate preparation of
this study and Biodiversity Strategy, which will be prepared in parallel with the forestry
project.
Prevemion of ilegal harvesing: Over the last several years, the problem of illegal harvesting
of timber has increased. Insofar as these activities are economically and environ-mentally
damaging, their prevention has become an important objective of the project
Adion of a Project Environmel Maragemwnt Unt:   A  Project Environmental
Management Unit (PEMU) was added to the project during the Environmental Assessment.
The PEMU would be responsible for coordinating all environmental aspects of the project,
and would provide specific inputs on general planning (i.e., the forest and pasture strategy
and the biodiversity strategy) and specific planning (i.e., forest managemem plans and
environmnental assessments) activities under the project. The PEMU would be responsible

page 21



for preparation of the EIAs on the forest management plans, coordinating with CEP, DGFP,
FPRI, and with specialists from the MNS and FNS, and for implementing the project's
Mitigation and Monitoring Plan. 'he PEMU will be located within the Ministry of
Agricultre's Agricultural Program Office (APO).
2.2 Project Components amd Costs
Total project costs are estimated at $21.6 million. Costs are expected to be financed as follows: (i)
IDA credit: $8 million; (ii) Loan of the Govermnent of Italy: $8.5 million; (iii) Technical Assistance
Grant from the Government of Italy: $2.5 million (iv) Technical Assistance Grant from the
Government of Switzerland: $0.50 million; and (iv) S2.1 million from the Government of Albania.
The Technical Assistance Grant would be administered by FAO and used to finance technical
assistance requirements of the entire project.
lhe project would support institutional reforms of DGFP towards establishing a legally and
financially autonomous 'Forest Corporation" that would be responsible for the management of State
forests and pastures, and towards strengthening a new forest department witiin the Ministry of
Agriculture tD take over policy, regulatory and service functions from DGFP. The project would
also promote reforms of the marketing procedures and of pricing and trading policies for forest
products, and assist in policy formulation. The project would provide resources for investments in
the following five components: (i) instittional development of the forest/pe administration
including related tramining, education and research; (Hi) improved State forest management
(Hii) rehabilitation of forest roads; (iv) management of conununal forest and pasture areas; and (v)
managenent of protected areas.
2.2.1 Institutional Devdopment ($2.5 million)
There are three sub-components under the component of institutional development: (i) reorganization
and strngthening of DGFP, CiH) support for trainin, education and research in forestry and pastures,
and Ciii) project management by a temporary Project Management Unit (PMU).
Under the Reorganization and Strengthening of DGFP, there are a number of general actions
prposed:
*     decentralization of the management structure;
*     develop skills for improved bidding, contracting, marketing, and financial
management;
*     establish a local 'Revenue Account" for locally (Albanian) fianced investments;
*     establish a bmad-based Forest Council;
*     transform DGFP into an autonomous Forest Corporation;
*     transfer responsibility for policy, regulatory and service functions to a new Forest
and Pasture Department in MAF;
*     Implement miscellaneous studiez.
Under each of these general actions, more specific actions are envisaged.  Thus, under
decentralization of the management structure, the specific actions would be:

*     setup technical units at the Prefect level, including engineering and marketing
services;
*     support to Headquarter and Prefect office operations through office,
communications, and transport equipment supplies and related operating
funds;

22.2 Improved State Forst Management and Updating of Forest Management Plans ($8.1
million)
New forest management plans (FMPs) would be developed for about 160,000 ha of High Forests
over the project duration, bringing about 40% of these forests under the new-style FMPs, while
about 25% would still be under existing but still valid plans. The new FMPs would be developed
for 15 year periods in about 50 Forest Economies. The project would fund the fieldwork for forest
inventories, collection of ecological dat social surveys and geodetic mapping, the scientific and
planning work, and the necessaly supervision and control. GIS hardware and software would be
inroduced and training given.
The new guidelines for FMP preparation would: (i) take fully into account the non-wood economic
aspects as well as the social and ecological functions of forests; and (ii) detail the exact procedures
in FMP preparation with the participation of interested parties. Each 'new-style' FMP would
include the following:
(a)   general information about the management unit including ecological, social, economic and
administrative aspects;
Albania Forestry Environment Assesmem
page 25



(b)   information specific to past management of the unit including management regulations under
the previous FMP, actual interventions that took place under the latter with a focus on forest
regeneration and maintenance, assessment of past harvesting for each compartnent of the
unit, and overall evaluation of recent evolution of forest stands;
(c)   description of the present status of the management unit including a study of forest stands and
wildlife, and an assessment of existing forest infrastructures;
(e)   planned quantitative output including harvesting of wood (annual allowable cut), grazing,
hunting, collection of other non-wood products, and recreational and environmental services;
(f)   plnned activities including (i) regulations, organization, and schedule for wood harvesting,
grazing and hunting; fii) natural regeneration and reforstation program; Ciii) young and
nmre stands maintenance; fiv) forest protection measures; and (v) planned economic and
social infrastructures;
2.2.3 Forest Roads Rehabilitation ($ 2.4 milgion)
Under this component, about 350 kIn of existing forest roads in 70 forest management units in 14
districts would be rehabiltated and maintained.
2.2.4 Communal Forest and Pasture Management ($ 2.3 mllion)
The objective of the component is to rehabilitate and increase the productivity of silvo-pastoral areas
close to villages and communities in order to meet the fuel wood requirements of the local population
and the fodder requirements of their livestock. Related objectives of the component are to contnrbute
to the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems in these areas, rural landscape, and regional
biodiversity.
The component would initiate participatory silvo-pastoral management of forests and pastes
t-ansferred to 30 communes, or 10% of the 250 communes that have significant forest and pastoral
resources on their territory, involving: (i) the development, under a participatory approach, of
improved forest and pasture management and investment plans for areas of State forests and pasus
that have been transferred tD conununes; and (it) funding of selected communal investment projects
in reforestation of degraded areas and pastre improvement, planting of fodder and fuel wood trees,
and fencing for protection and rehabilitaion of highly degraded coppice and shrub forests; and (iii)
establishment of a data base on communally managed forests and pastures.
The component is of an experimental nature. Project activities in each of the 30 communes would
be identified and implemented based on the results of the pilot operation initiated in 1994.
For the implementation of the component, the project would establish a 'Commnunal Unit' (CU)
under the DGFP that would include one coordinator, one assistant, one secretary, and 3 inspectors.
The technical staff in each of the 30 comr.nmes would be strengthened with one forest technician who
would serve as a communal forester. The component would also support establishment of a data
base on communal forest and pasture management by introducing a small Geographic Information
System (GIS) and a spatial data base and a marketing study for the sale of non-timber forest

products, including aromatic and medicinal plants, and game bird production to increase hunting
potential in communal forests.
2.25 Protected Areas Management ($ OA milion)
lhe protected areas component will involve strengthening of a new protected areas management unit
in DGFP/FPD through the provision of equipment and transport, staff training, preparation of a
management plan for Lura National Park. Under the project, five priority districts would be selected
for technical assistance, provision of transport and communications equipment, staff training, and
preparation of management plans for biodiversity protection. Under the project, a protected areas
pilot project would also be undertaken for Lura National Park, for the purpose of training and
preparation of a management plan.

3.0 LAws
3.1 EX[9MG CONDmoNs
A number of laws and regulations are directly or indirectly related to the management of forest
resources, and potentially play roles in the implementation of the forestry project. In this section,
the legal framework for forestry, natural resources, and the er.vironment in Albania are discussed.
Forestry and Grazing
The law on Forestry and the Forest Police Service (# 7223, 13 October, 1992) is the principal law
on forests. Art. 2 of the law includes in the definijon of forest estate 'forested lands" and "lands
with forest flora (both respectively defined in art. 3). State, Communal and Private forests are all
expressly considered part of the estate. Communal forests, a category newly intmoduced by the law,
are on State land, but handed over for the "common use' of one or several villages or communes.
Agreements between forest authorities and local authorities may be entered into for their
management. Private forests are forests found or planted on private land (art. 4).
The law also covers the following:
The law specifically covers admission and exclusion of lands into and out of the forest estate
(arts. 2 and 7), requiring authorizations by specified authurities.
Various prohibitions are found in the law, including art. 9 on occupation and use of forest
land without authorization, art. 26 on falsification of hammer marks, art. 34 on extraction
of some species or parts of plants, arts. 47 and 48 on damaging of forest installations and
signs.
The law defines the fimctions of district forest enterprises to include management,
propagation and scientific treatment of commercial trees and brushwood, medicinal plants in
State and Communal forests. Trees of particular importance within outside of the forest estate
are also to be managed by the forest administration, pursuant to regulations which should be
issued (art 11).
Management planning is referred to in art. 15: 'production and inventory plans' must be
prepared for both State and Communal (but not Private) forests. There are also other
important references to management in other parts of the law. In particular, art. 23 requires
the detrmination of an annual allowable cut based on criteria of sustainability.
Protection of watersheds is dealt with by requiring afforestation and closing of areas to
logging and grazing, where necessary. Although not stat, this is presumably the
responsibility of the forestry administration (art. 18).
Responsibility for management of fisheries in mountain water bodies is expressly given to
the foresty administration (art. 20).
Afbania Foresny Envrornmemal Aszessmem
page 28



"Forest national parks" and natural reserves may be declared by the Council of Ministers;
ascientific reserves', 'natural monuments', "landscapes' and 'protected industrial woods'
may be declared by the Directorate. The Directorate may issue regulations on protected areas
(art. 12). Entry fees may be established.
Gathering of minor forest produce, and of leaves for fodder in the forest estate, always
requires a permit (aru. 33 and 35).
A Forest Police Service has been created pursuant to the law. The service is part of the
forestry administration, but officers have military status and can bear arms (arts. 54 to 60).
The service is still being organized.
Protction against fires is dealt with in art. 43, which prohibits lighting of fires that could
endanger the forest or acting in a way that could create the risk of fires. There is an
obligation to report the breaking of fires and to participate in extinguishing them (art. 44).
Concerning forest harvesting, regulations on exploitation of high forests, coppice, shrubs and
conditions of cutfing and improvement (No. 1, of 11 January, 1993) have been issued by the DGFP.
These prescnbe that exploitation is governed by management plans and also prescribe management
techniques applicable to logging. Under the regulations, requests for fuelwood are resolved by the
local forest engineer in cooperation with communes, and approval is subject to availability (reg. 12).
Fines for violation of prohibitions are applied 'when the action does not constitute a violation of the
forest law'.
A revised version of these regulations has been prepared and is expected to be adopted in the near-
future. The new text would regulate auctions for the sale of standing wood, narking of trees,
construction of forest roads, various phases of forest harvesting, transportation of forest produce,
and include necessary forms. 'Contracts for forest exploitation have a maximum duration of one
year, with some possibilities for extension. lhe logging permit (which may relate to more than one
parcel of forest) is issued in conjunction with documents that specify the status of each parcel
covered by the permit (volume of wood which may be cut etc.). Loggers have a right to cut only
marked trees or dead trees, and must deposit wood in ^pecified areas, from which removal must be
authorized by a specific pass. Reports on progress in the works must be submitted every fifteen days,
and statistical information must also be supplied as required. Where a person is authorized to log
more than one parcel, works must be completed on each parcel before logging another.
Decision No. 82, of 26 February, 1993, on *tariffs k i the forest sector, issued by the Council of
Ministers, includes sale tariffs of nanding wood, which vary depending on classes of fertility of soil
and accessibility of land by road. Where roads are not kl existence, tariffs are decreased on the basis
of the amounts per cubic meter invested by the logger on infrastructure. The same decision includes
tables of tariffs charged for minor fbrest produce, for access or activities in protected areas, and for
compensation for damages caused in the forest estate.
On the Forest Service, two bodies of regulations have been issued by the Minister. These are
Regulations 576 and 581, of 8 February, 1993, respectively on responsibilities and conditions of
admission into the service.
Alaruia Forestry Ewironmwmal Assmnem
page 29



Guidelines on auctions of standing wood (No. 7 of 25 July, 1993, as modified by Guidelines of S
June, 1995) are also in place. Auctions of lots which, pursuant to management plans, may be iogged,
are arranged by the DGFP yearly. After lots are awarded, trees are marked by the forestry
administration before logging. Those awarded lots may proceed with logging after payment of the
tariffs. Where the purchaser undertakes to build roads, specific contracts for periods longer than a
year may be granted.
-         Instructions of 17 Februay, 1993 by the Minister of Agriculture and Food and the Minister of
Economy and Finance include specific prohibitions and obligations of citizens, the Forest Service and
local authorities for protection against forest fires and pests.
Regulations No. 5, of 10 October, 1994, issued jointly by the Minister of Agriculture and Food and
the Minister of Local Government, provide on logging for domestic uses. They allow the possibility
for the head of each village to indicate the yearly local needs for firewood and construction materials.
The head of the communal administration then submnits the request to the Forest Service, which
assigns specified coupes which may be logged for these purposes.
Concerning import and export of forest produce, Decision No. 135, of 29 March, 1994, as modified
by Decision No. 16, of 9 January, 1995 regulates the import and export of all forest products. The
export of wood products (except firewood and coal) requires authorization by the Ministry of
Industry, Trade and Transport. However, the Ministry rarely issues such an authorization. Since
July, 1995, these quantitative restrictions were replaced by an export ban on logs, poles, sawn wood
and fuel wood. The export of all other forest products including charcoal are unrestricted.
Environment
The Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) was created in 1991 as the primary agency
responsible for the coordination of governrental action in environmental matters. The Commnittee
is currently part of the Ministry of Health and Environmental Protection.
The main legal instrument for the protection of the environment is Albania's Law on Fnvironmental
Protwction (No. 7664 of January 21, 1993). This law is especially relevant in dealing with forestry
because it requires "environmental licenses" to be issued by environmnental authorities for listed
activities (forestry among them) which have an impact on the environment. With regard to forestry,
Articles 17 and 18 (6) states:
Article 17
*Natural and legal persons who engage in economnic and social activities that may have an
impact on the environment shall be obliged to apply for a license from the designated
competent authorities under this law.
Article 18
'Ucenses shall be provided for the following economic and social activities:
Alaia Forerny Envirnet Aswsmea
page 30



6.    Exploitation of forests that are of common interest; creation of forested areas;
hunting, taking into account species, seasons, means and admissible levels of
hunting."
Such a provision can create difficulties as they charge the CEP with responsibility for authorizing
any forest exploitation, even the planting of trees. A restrictive interpretation of these articles would
be advisable. For example, the CEP could be consulted in issuing forest licenses of particular
significance (i.e. for large areas, or in particularly sensitive areas, etc.)
Art. 18 has been interpreted literally thus far: loggers must obtain licenses from the forestry
authorities and the environmental authorities. Enterprises also have to apply to the CEP to obtain,
upon payment of a fee, recognition as an authorized logging enterprise, and not for single operations.
The forestry administration is expected to submit plans to the CEP for approval.
The implementation of intrnational environmental agreements to which Albania becomes a party and
compliance with 'generally accepted norms and principles" of international environmental law, even
if included in agreements to which Albania is not a party, is an obligation (art. 6). Transit of
hazardous wastes through Albania is allowed only if provided for under an international agreement
(art. 5). The law also calls for the adoption of more specific rules on water, air, soil, nature and
landscape protection (art 4).
The law also empowers environmental authorities to suspend or interrupt activities which have caused
environmental pollution or damage, and impose specific mitigation measures (art. 31).
The law deals with policy and instiutional issues, vesting the Minister of Health and Environmental
Protection with powers to formulate and implement the enviromnental policy of Albania through CEP
(art. 37). Further responsibilities of the Ministry include definition of an environmental strategy,
adoption of environmental standards, preparation of an annual report on the ste of the environment
and distribution of funds for research. CEP is responsible for implementing the law, supervising the
implemenmation of enrironnl legislation by other ministries, local authorities and other
institutions, monitoring pollution levels and on the basis of data obtained proposing adequate
measures (art. 40).
An inspectorate of environmnental protection is created and reports to CEP (art. 41). Communal,
Municipal and District Councils are responsible for adopting and publishing environmnental protection
programs, supplying environmental information and generally controlling envirommental matters (art.
42).
Regulations on regional environmental agencies were issued in 1994 pursuant to the 1993 Law on
Environmental Protection. lbe agencies are based in prefectures. Their functions include
cooperation for the implementation of legislation for the protection of the environment, collection
of information related to the enviromment, setting of fmes pursuant to the law, control over the
management of protectd areas within their respective jurisdictions, organization of environmental
impact assessments of projects which, pursuant to the Environmental Protection Law, qualify as
"investments of local character", and supervision of environmental inspectors. Ihe duties of the
chiefs of the agencies are listed separately frm those of the environmental inspectors.
Abania Form-ay E,vironera Assessmen

The environmental protection law requires environmental impact assessments (EIA) of any activities
which may have a significant impact on the enviromnent. These assessments are undertaken at the
requ st of environmental authorities or local authorities (specifically CEP, the Regional
EnvL inmrtl Agencies, Conmnunal, Municipal or District Councils). The experts or institutions that
will ptrfornn the ElAs will be assigned by the above-mentioned authorities in each case and they will
be compensated according to rules established by the Mirister of Health and Environment Protection.
A fonn of public participation in the process is provided for. The necessity to carly out ElAs would
be additional to the need to obtain a license.
Draft regulations on Environmnental Impact Assessment (EIA) are being prepared. Pursuant to a
summary draft of the regulations which has been examined, projects subject to EIA are those listed
in the European Conmmunity Directive on ElAs (both Annex I and II, if the latter pose a significant
threat to the enviromnent) and projects located in specified protected zones. A preliminary report,
whose minimum contents are indicated, has to be subnitted by the applicant to a review commission
appointed by the Committee for Envirortnental Protection. On the basis of this report, the 'Lead
Agency (in most cases likely to be the CEP) makes a decision as to whether a full EIA is required.
In case it is, the Lead Agency undertakes a scoping exercise to determine the contents of the EIA
to be carried out and appoints a tm of experts, which must be independent of the developer, to
carry out the ELA. Public involvement is prescribed in each of these phases. The final EIA report
is prepared by the team of experts in consultation with the Lead Agency and must reflect conunents
received from the public. The process leads to a recommendation of approval or rejection of the
project.
A draft law on the establishment of an environmental fund has been prepared. Tbe fund would be
created 'at the Committee of Environmental Protection and Preservation'. The Directing Board of
the National Environmental Fund", headed by the Minister of Health and Environmental Protection,
is made up of specialists of departments or instituions dealing with the environment, as specified
(art 7). The income of the Fund (art 3) should consist mainly of periodical payments by specified
industries which may by their activity damage the environment; taxes on 'polluting' products
(vehicles, coal, gasoline, etc.); fees collected for the issue of environmental licenses, fines collected
for environmental violations, State subsidies, donations.
Pursuant to the law on environmal protection, the fees for the issue of forest licenses should be
included, although the proposed law on the establishment of the fund does not mention forest licenses
expressly. On the contrary, fees collected by the forestry and fishery departments for the issue of
hunting and fishing licenses are expressly mentioned as contributions to the fund. It will be irnportant
to clarify this point before the law is adopted, especially considering that fte forest sector is expected
to soon have its own financing fund, the revenue account.
The environmental fund should finance (art. 5), among other things, an environmental quality
monitoring system and odter research work, educational activities, persons whose activities relate
to environmental protection, environmental nongovernmental organizations, offices of the Regional
Environmental Agencies, and the restoration of ecologically degraded areas.

Laud Ownership and Privaszation
The principal law on land is law No. 7501, of 19 July, 1991. The law envisages three categories of
land: (a) agriculuwral lands. (b) forests, pastures and meadows, and (c) all other land. Land
legislation has undergone numerous changes since 1991. As described below, the forest legislation
recognizes 'private forests' as a separate category from State-owned ones, but sometimes hie
distinction between regimes which should apply to either category is not clear.
There is a current legal trend toward greater private ownership of land. A recent amendment to the
Forest Law (May 1995) provides for private ownership but in cases of restitution, not wholesale
privatization. The new Pasture Law makes similar provision. Whereas this trend is encouraging
from a free market standpoint, it does raise environmental concerns whether forests under private
ownership will receive adequate environmental protection.' Therefore the govermnent may wish to
introduce regulatory steps to follow the legislation that insure environmental protection for private
forests in cases where conservation or biodiversity are at issue. However, privatized lands are
largely agriculural. The total area of private forests is small (approxixnately 100,000 ha or 10
percent of Albania's forests).
New poliuies on the possibility for foreigners to become land-owners in Albania are being considered
by the government. A draft law being prepared by the Ministry of Construction and Tourism would
allow purchase of private or State lands by foreigners. Local authorities would be involved in the
process of determining the price for sales of State lands witiin their area of jurisdiction, as well as
for authorizing sales among private parties. There will be an obligation to preserve the economic
destination of land bought as specified in the sale contracL Violtions would be punished by fines
equal to five times the price paid.
Protected Areas and Biodiversity
Basic provisions on national parks and other types of protected areas are included in the forest
legislation. Although this is not stated in the legislation, the creation of protected areas now takes
place in consultation with the CEP. Decision No. 577, of 6 February, 1993, made under the Forest
Law, defines five categories of protected areas based on the international classification promoted by
IUCN, i.e., Scientific Reserves, National Parks, Natural Monuments, Natural Reserves and Protected
Forestry Areas.
The 1992 Forestry Law, together with subsidiary legislation, is currently the main legal basis for
protected area managemen. In 1994 a Wild Fauna and Hunting Protection Law (No. 7875 on
23.11.1994) was passed which contains environmental provisions for wildlife not contained in the
Forest Law. It provides for the preparation of wildlife management plans and constitutes the existing
framework for faunal protection.
Such cocerns may be offset by the relatively small scale of privatization that is occurring (i.e., only
cases of stitt_in, not unrestricted privatization).

Wildlife
The DGFP. and FPRI are responsible for wildlife management. An increase in hunting by nationals
and foreigners followed the political changes of 1991. Hunting was widely authorized in 1992,
leading to a moratorium in 1993, which was lifted in 1994.
Law No. 7875, of 23 November, 1994 pmvides for the preparation of wildlife management plans,
based on scientific criteria, on which the yearly hunting plan should be based. The plan is to be
adopted by the forestry administration, considering the opinion of the hunters' and sport fishermen's
association. Traditional and sport fishing in areas which have been declared as hunting reserves is
managed thrugh agreements wi the directorate of fisheries.
The law encourages foreign investments in the field of eco-tourism, raising of animals for hunting,
and building of related infrastructures. Categories of hunting areas (or areas where hunting is
limited) are envisaged: repopulation areas, hunting reserves, and wildlife reserves. Hunting is
allowed, subject to the legislation, in all areas where it is not expressly prohibited ("free hunting
areas"). Appropriate provision is made for distinguishing private lands from public ones in
managing classified hunting areas.
Proposed lgislahon
A draft 'Albanian Law on the Protection of Nature and Biological Diversity" was reviewed in the
course of the environmental assessment. This draft law would introduce significant innovations in
the institutional framework for the management of protected areas. The draft envisages five
"degrees" of protection which may be applied to a territory (art. 6). The "first degree" of protection
applies to the whole territory of Albania, whik the others apply respectively to the various categories
of protected areas (second degree in protected landscape areas; third degree in national parks; fourth
degree in habitat and species management areas/managed nature reserves; fifth degree in strict nature
reserves). For each 'degree', a list of activities is given which are subject to an authorization by the
Nature and Biodiversity Protection Authority. A list is also given of activities which are completely
prohibited under each category. The level of intended protection increases from one degree to
another.
Five categories of protected areas are proposed: protected landscape areas, national parks, habitat
and species management areas/managed nature reserves, natural monuments, and strict nature
reserves. For each category a defiition is given. A buffer zone may be created around each area
as necessary.
The procedure leading to the proclamation of a protected area is spelled out in art. 17. The public
may raise objections, which must be adequately addressed by the responsible authority, before the
proclamation is made. Public involvement is also expressly encouraged in any activity which
auffiorities undertake in relation to the protection of nature and biodiversity (art 36). In particular,
an obligation is placed on all sectors of the administrion to inform environmental associations of
activities which affect nature and landscape protection interests. The associations then have a right
to participate in the relevant administative proceedings.

The draft identifies the categories of protected areas and describes each detailing which activities will
or will not be permitted in these areas. It provides for the establishment of 'Nature and Biodiversity
Authorities', principally the Committee for Environment Protection or a new, separate Ministry of
Envirotment. The draft includes provisions for institutional arrangements that should be clarified.
The other major issue from an institutional standpoint is the draft law's objective to shift the primary
responsibility for the management of protected areas from the forest authorities to the environment
authorities. Both of these issues should be resolved before the adoption of this proposed law.
The draft law also includes steps for proclaining a new protected area. Presently, the Council of
Ministers and the DGFP are the only government bodies legally empowered to declare an area a
protected area but in cases where this has been done, all are forest areas and the interest has been
exclusively to create hunting reserves. Pursuant to Article 12 of the law, DGFP passed a regulation
in 1993 providing further details for the identification and selection of Protected Areas; for IUCN
Category 1 areas the decision must be made by the Council of Ministers; for other categories DGFP
is empowered to decide. In practice other areas that are not forest but do have nature conservation
or biodiversity values have not been recognized as protected areas.
Specific provisions deal with protected trees, animals, paleontological findings and minerals (arts.
21-28). These provisions often have similar contents to those included in other existing legislation
(for example the laws on forests, protected plants, wildlife). The main purpose for their inclusion
in this law would be to ensure direct control of the environmental authority over these matters.
One objective of the new law on the protection of nature and biodiversity is to shift the primary
responsibility for the management of protected areas in the country from the forestry auithorities to
the enviromental authorities. This institutional issue is inportant, and is expected to receive special
consideration by the Albanian ministers. It is recommended that some agreement on this issue is
sought before any further progress is made towards the adoption of this proposed law.
32 LMPACT ANALYSIS AND MmGATIoN MEAsules
lTe legal structure for forestry and environmental protction in Albania is generally adequate. The
changes in laws under the project are needed to create a more efficient forest management system
with both forest production and conservation objectives. Under the project, specific objectives and
methods of sustainable and multiple use forestry will be incorporated into a revised Law on Forests
following completion of the Forest and Pasture Sector Strategy. The changes will have a positive
environmnental impact on forest resources if the project is implemented as proposed.
Issue 1:      a nge     laws
The institutional development component of the project would introduce several legal and/or
administrative changes during project implementation. Enabling legislation or ministerial action will
be needed for transfonning the DGFP into a Forest Corporation and creating a new Forest and
Pasure Department under the MAF. Two additional actions, the formation of a Steering Committee
for the PMU and the establishment of a Forest Council, may also require legislation or a ministerial
decree or by a decision of the Council of Ministers. 'he objectives of these entities are to strengthen
the financial basis of government forest instiutions, to promulgate appropriate forest and protected

areas policies, and to improve forest management. The legal changes are designed to better enable
institutions to achieve those objectives. Therefore the impact of these legal changes will potentially
benefit and enhance the sector's objectives of sustainable foresty and protected areas management.
The changes in laws would have no imnpact on the physical and biological resources of Albanian high
forests. The legal basis for sustainable and multiple use management of Albanian forests and the
conservation of physical and biological resources currently exists in Albania, and would not be
lessened by the proposed legal changes. The purpose of the change in laws is to facilitate the
creation and operation of a more efficient system of forest management in Albania with both forest
production and conservation objectives. The institutional changes are needed to improve forest
management in Albania, and are addressed in Issue 6.
Mitigation Measure: No mitigation measures are needed. The specific objectives and
methods of sustainable and multiple use forestry will be a central component of the Forest
and Pasure Sector Strategy.
Issue 2:    Inadequate enforcement of exsting laws and regulations on forest protection,
particularly for the prevention of illegal and unmanaged harvesting.
Between 1971 and 1980, the legal harvest of all wood (roundwood, fuelwood, and sawlogs) averaged
4.7 million m3 from Albanian forests. Between 1981 and 1993, this figure declined to about 2.1
million mn3 of wood annually as an indirect result of the country's political and economic reforms.
In the same time period, illegal harvesting has increased, and totaled an estimated 0.8 million n3 in
1991, and 0.9 million m3 in 1992.
Data are incomplete on the extent and damages of illegal logging activities, however, the available
evidence indicates that such activities are increasing, and include both illegal harvesting of
roundwood and sawlogs by unauthorized individuals and companies, and unmanaged fuelwood
harvesting in the vicinity of villages. Field observations in 1995 indicate that an increasing share
of illegal cutting is being used as industrial timber.
Recent adoption of new regulations (No. 5 of 10 October, 1994) grants villages parcels for
harvesting fuelwood, following approval of the local authorities. Implementation of this regulation
has proven difficult, apparently because local administrations may be unable to or uninterested in
cooperating with forestry officials to regulate illegal logging and its environmental damage.
Although accurate estimates of illegal harvesting are not available, the problem is apparendy
widespread. The inability of the GOA to prevent illegal harvesting appears to be the result of lack
of patrolling and enforcement in the field compounded by the absence of an effective judicial remedy.
First, the forest police and engineers have been unsuccessful at detecting and preventing the majority
of illegal operations. The principal reason for this has been a dramatic decline in the number of staff
employed in the forests and district offices, and the fact that foresters commonly work two or more
jobs to supplement their low government salaries. Second, even when violators are identified and
proseuted, the fines are small, they typically go unpaid, and the GOA weakly pursues the collection
of the modest fins.
Albania Foremsy Environeal Assmw
page 36



The environmental impact of illegal harvesting is significant. Illegal logging operations are done
without any environmental protection measures, including measures for slope and soil protection in
rugged terrain, adherence to annual allowable cut standards, and avoidance of sensitive habitats such
as riparian stands and streameourses. Illegal logging operations have also been observed within
existing protected areas where such harvesting is forbidden by law. The impacts of increased
erosion, sedimentation of onsite and downsteam water courses, and localized but intensive
disturbances to protected areas is significant.
A body of fiscal police with specific responsibilities for enforcement in the field of finances and
taxation has been created. Among other things, it will be in charge of collecting fines. Presidential
Decree No. 939, of 11 November, 1994, which modifies the law on administrative contraventions
(Law No. 7697, of 7 April, 1993), specifies and improves the procedures for confiscation of
property for the case of unpaid fines. Tbe recently adopted Code of Criminal Procedure (Law No.
7905, of 21 March, 1995 grants the status of 'judiciary police' to members of the forest Service (art
32). This implies (pursuant to arL 30) that their functions include investigating violations and
preventing their consequences. However, they do not have powers of arrest because this is given for
more serious offenses only (for which a minimum of 5 years of imprisonment is imposed, while the
longest penalty is one year for forest offenses).
The following measures may facilitate enforcement of existing laws:
*     Grant wider powers of seizure to enforcement officers. Seizure of property used in
committing offenses can be a useful deterrent in a situation in which people rarely
pay fnes voluntarily. It would also be useful if forest guards were given powers to
arrest people who have been caught while comnmtting an offence and refuse to give
their name or give a name which is believed to be false. The latter measure,
however, could have a linited effect given the insufficient availability of vehicles.
Facilitate the involvement of local communities in the management of forests and
pastures. If people are consulted and agree on measures to be taken they are more
likely to cooperate for the prosecution of violatrs.
*     Amend relevant laws or regulations to include interest charges on unpaid fines. At
present this is not envisaged with respect to any fines due under the legislafion of
Albania.
*     Encourage coordination of enforcement officers who have similar functions, either
by law or administive action. For example, environmental inspectors should be
appropriately tained and be vested with specific powers to enforce forestry and
wildlife laws and regulations.
The DGFP is currently preparing a work pLan for preventing illegal harvesting. The major elements
of this plan currently include the coordination by DGFP staff with local police, dismissal of forest
guards or engineers shown to aid or abet individuals engaged in illegal harvesting activities, passage
of laws permitting collection of fines and confiscation of illegal goods, the use of road blocks, and
public education and campaign efforts. It is also necessary that GOA foresters reduce the volumes
of wood harvested legally such that the total amount of legal and illegal harvest is less than or equal
Albania Fornny Environnal A    _ment
page 37



to the annual allowable cuL Acceptance of the DGFP's action plan to control illegal logging is a
condition of negotiation for the forestry loan.
The project would assist in implementation of the action plan by providing vehicles and
communications equipment to DGFP to build its capacity to improve policing of forests and control
timber transport at road check points and at sawmills.
Mitgation Measure:
2.1  Tle DGFP shall prepare and implement an action plan that details the steps tc be
taken in preventing illegal harvesting. The action plan shall define the indicators and
methods to be used to monitor its effectiveness and shall be approved by the Bank
prior to loan negotiations.
2.2   The PMU shall contract with a third part consultant suitable to the Bank to monitor
the progress and success of the illegal harvesting plan.
Issue 3:    Trde Ilbrlization
There is currently an export ban on logs, poles, sawn wood and fuel wood in Albania. From an
economic perspective, this ban prevents Albania from realizing the revenue and benefit potential from
its forest resources.
The export ban contributes to environmental protection of Albanian forests by preventing or
controlling the economic incentives for intensified illegal harvesting. Removal of all or parts of the
export ban would exacerbate existing problems of illegal harvesting and its environmental impacts.
The overharvesting that would potentially result would have far-ranging impacts and significant
impacts on forest resources, including conversion of forest to shrub habitats as a result overwhelmed
silvicultural management, increased soil erosion and attendant degradation of water quality, direct
imnpacts to biodiversity, including loss of habitat for forest wildlife and impacts to thatened and
endangered species. An accelerated pace of harvesting would alsD prevnt the positive environmental
benefits of the project from being realized.
At the sanie tuie, liberalization of trade is considered imnportant becse it will allow prices of wood
and wood products to rise to international levels, thereby increasing the revenue from forests and
permiting better forest managemenL An increase in forestry revenues would have a potentially
beneficial imnpact by increasing the funds available for all of the DGFP's responsibilities, including
proected areas management, environmental monitoring and protection, and wildlife management.
Lifting of the ban on exporting-timber products is to be tied to the successful implementation of the
action plan to prevent ilegal harvestnng.
Mitigation Measures:
3.1   Trade liberalization for the export of timber and timber products shall not occur
either prior the mid-term review of the project or to the Bank's acceptance of
Aani Foresty Envromneal Asessmenf
page 38



successful results of the plan to prevent illegal harvesting and approval of the first
updated forest management plans.
Issue 4:     Legal basis for environmental impact analyses (EIAs)
The legal basis for undertaking ElAs in Albania is the 1993 Law on Environmental Protection, which
requires ELAs for activities that may have a significant impact on the environment, including forestry
operations. Preparation of an EIA can be requested by the environmental or local authorities (CEP,
the Regional Environmental Agencies, Communal, Municipal or District Councils). With the
exception of several clarifications that are needed for its implementation, the legal basis for EIA
preparation are sufficient These clarifications, which are expected to occur prior to project
negotiation, are:
i)   the relation between the environmental authority and the authority primarily
responsible for the approval of a project subject to EIA. For example, either the law
or the guidelines should say whether the authorizing authority could be the rLead
Agency  in conducting the EIA, whether both the authorizing authority and the
environmental authority may require the preliminary report which may lead to the
EIA.
i)    whether Article 13 of the Law on Environmental Protecion precludes DGFP and
FPRI staff from participating in the preparation of ElAs of the forest management
plans and other forstry projects.
Environmental reviews will be undertaken for four activities under the forestry project: the forest
management plans and road rehabilitation, thinning, and harvesting operations. The CEP is
preparing guidelines for ElAs, and will receive, with the PEMU and other appropriate agencies,
atchnical assistance in environmental review under the project.
Midpgtion Measures: No mitigation measures are needed
Issue 5:    Adequacy of legal provions for native flora and fauna, threatened and
endangered species and protected areas and their management
Existing Albanian laws contain provisions for the protection of forests, fauna, and medicinal plants.
While these laws provide some level of nature protection, they are deficient in protection for
threatened and endangered species and in the management of protected areas. To correct this
deficiency in Albanian law, a draft Law on the Protecion of Nature and Biological Diversity was
prepared by Albanian NGOs in consultation with the CEP to improve the legal protection generally
for nature and biodiversity, and specifically for native flora and fauna and thrateed and endangered
species. The draft Law on the Protection of Nature and Biological Diversity would also introduce
significant innovations in the instituonal framework for the managemeat of protected areas. The
CEP is expected to submit the draft law for govemment review by mid-1997. It is not known what
revisions will be necessary, and therefore what time schedule can be expected for action by the
government. With respect to the forestry project, the CEP and DGFP are expected to coope-ate in
AIbania Fore*  Envronmnaul Assw=m
page 39



reviewing the draft law, making revisions, and submitting the revised draft for review and action by
the Council of Ministers.
The current lack of sufficient legal protection of sensitive species and provisions for management of
protected areas culd be expected to lead to the loss of Albanian biological and genetic diversity in
the long-term. Although threatened and endangered plants and animals are approximately equally
distributed in the forest and non-forest habitats of Albania, existing threats to biodiversity are greater
in the wetland and marine habitats of the Albanian lowlands than in the more remote high forests.
Consequently, the lack of adequate protection and management of these species and their ecosystems,
would impact non-forest species more than forest species, and in particular would contribute to the
degradation of fresh water and marine ecosystems in the populated lowlands along the Adriatic Sea.
Mitigation Measure:
5.1   The PEMU, CEP and DGFP shall work together to revise the draft Law on the
Protecion of Nature and Biological Diversity and submit it for discussion by the
Council of Ministers at the earliest feasible date. Where appropriate, the Law on
Nature Protection and Biological Diversity shall specify its primacy over narts of
existing laws (e.g., within die Forest Law) that are redundant or contradictory.
Revisions to the law shall incorporate recommendations developed during discussions
on the Forest and Pastre Sector Study and on the Biodiversity Strategy, which.will
be conducted in 1996 and 1997. Government action on the draft Law shall occur
before year 3 of the project
3.3 SIGNICANCE OF IMPAcrs AFTR IMPwMEAnoN OF MrnFGAnoN MEAsuREs
The Albanian laws on Forestry and Environmnental Protection generally provide an adequate legal
basis for the sustainable management of Albanian forests, with the exception discussed in Issue 5
above. The proposed project would contnbute to the strengthening of these laws through revisions
and clarifications to subordinant regulations, and would therefore have a potentially beneficial
inpact. There are three legal issues with potentially significant environmental impacts under the
project:
1.   Improvements are needed in Albanian law for the specific protection for threatened
and endangered species and for management of protected areas. Prior to and during
preparation of the forestry project, a draft Law on the Protection of Nature and
Biological Diversity was prepared by Albanian NGOs in consultation with the CEP
to improve the legal protection for biodiversity. In the absence of mitigation, this
would potentially result in the loss of Albanian biological and genetic diversity in the
long-term. To assist in mitigating this, the DGFP, FPRI, and the MAF will
paticipate in reviewing and revising the law, and support it's submission for
Parliamentary action by late-1997.  Although adoption of this law and its
implementation in the course of the project will have a beneficial environmental
impact, this cannot be guaranteed, and the impact remains potentially significant
2.    The impacts of illegal harvesting are significant and include increased erosion,
sedimentation of onsite streams and downstream rivers, and localized but intensive
Albania 5orwsny En'Wromental A=ssee
page 40



disturbances to protected areas. The mitigation measures requiring Bank approval
of an action plan for preventing illegal harvesting, and moniwring of its results by
an independent third-party will have a beneficial environmental imnpact.
3.    The elimination of export bans for timber products that is called for under the project
could be expected to stimulate overharvesting by exacerbating the existing problem
of illegal harvesting. Overharvesting of the forests would have significant impacts
on forest resources, including conversion of forest to shrub habitats as a resuk
overwhelmed silvicultural management, increased soil erosion and attendant
degradation of water quality, and direct impacts to biodiversity. The mitigation for
this impact is to delay trade liberalization of forest products until mid-term review of
the project, or until the Bank's acceptance of successful results of the action plan for
preventing illegal harvesting and approval of the first updated management plans.
Satisfactory results in these project activities would indicate the government's
commitment to planning and implementation of sustainable forestry goals, and is
considered to mitigate the potential impacts to a less than significant level.

4.0 INSIITWONS
4.1 EXLSIING CONDITIONS
Govermmental Organizations
There are a number of forestry and environmental protection institutions in Albania in both the public
and private sectors. Ministries that have responsibility for forestry and environment include the
Ministries of Agriculture and Food, Health, Education, Industries, and Finance.2 The private
institutions include private logging enterprises and non-govermmental organizations (NGOs) most of
which have an environmental orientation.
A. Forestry and Environmental Protection Policies and Their Implementation
1.    Present and Past Policies
From the aid 1980s to the early 1990s, the government adopted forest policies to (i) reduce felling
to a level that is compatible with sustainable forestry; (ii) redirect harvesting from low yielding
forests to over maure stands; (iii) increase forest plantations, especially for coniferous species; and
'iv) reduce waste and inefficiency in logging and wood processing through improved technology.
The underlying law (Law No. 6607 of 1968, modified in 1983 and 1990) was designed for the
operation of a centrally planned system of forest management.
Authorizations were required for any forest-related activity (i.e. logging, trade of wood, grazing and
construction works). Allis policy was limited to the production aspect of forestry and did not address
forest ownership and user rights, the role of the State in forestry activities, and public involvement.
2.    Current Legislationi
The Law 'for forestry and forest police service' (No. 7643 of October 13, 1992) replaced the former
law's emphasis on production with greater importance accorded to environmnental issues and market-
oriented, yet sustinable, forest management. Article I of the law states:
-The objective of this law is the administration, the protection and teatnent of forests in
order to protect the environment and the production of wooden and other forest products."
TIis objective is further elaborated with provisions addressing protection, the environment and
sustainable yields:
'a) The protection on the whole of the forest estate for its economic function, its special
properties on the environment preservation, on the water reserves and atmospheric
purification, to mainaining the soil fertility, to landscape aspects, to agrotourism and
infrastructures;" and
2se Commission of Science and Technology and the Academy of Science also have links to foretry
sector insfitutions (se Figurm 3).
Adbania Forestry Enwronmemal Asssment
page 42



'b) the timber cutting control, in order to be equal to the sustainable yield, designed by the
relevant management projects.'
From the standpoint of the Environmental Assessment, therefore, the law clearly provides that
forestry development is to be undertaken in ways that protect the environment and that forest
harvesting is to be done in ways that ensure sustainability. Article 23 states:
"he amount of wooden material harvested every year by state-owned and conrmunal forest
is defined due to the technical sustainable potential limited by the management projects/or
inventory projects, safeguarding the land protection, improvemnent of climatic elements,
strengthening of natural ecosystems and their production continuity. Ihe cutting of the
standing timber can be done only by the special resolution of the Council of Ministers. The
private forest exploitation must not threaten the land protection and climatic elements
balance.-
The preceding article of the law, Article 22, clearly addresses the issue of forest protection:
*lhe forest fund area is divided into protective and productive forests. It is permitted the
extraction of the productive forest according to this law and other provisions. It is not
permitted the extraction (exploitation) of protective forest according to the designations issued
before by the General Directorate, Forestry, except the cases of precaution and sanitary
operations (thinning). The Forest Service Organs are responsible overall for forest property,
administration and management, also for forest national parks and every other territory which
can be published (designated) as such one."
The forestry law defines the country's forest estate (referred to as 'the forest fund') as comprising
three components; state, communal and private forests. The law states that the management of state
forests remains the responsibility of the government's forestry directorate yet i does not go into
detail outlining how management will be carried out. Communal forests represent a new category
which are planned to be managed by communes under government lease arrangements.3 The third
category, private forests are those found on private land; the law, however, does not outline
provisions for private forest management
Various subsidiary regulations to the forestry law have been issued. These include regulations for
the exploitation of forests, for seting stumpage and other forest fees, guidelines for auctions of
standing wood, instructions for protection against forest fires, a regulation on the selection and
establishment of protet  areas, and a regulation for the recreational use of forests.
B.    Insfitutions' Functions and Responsibilities
1.    Central Level
3Some have argued that the forst law should be chnged to allow for communal ownshiip of
communal forest. Otherwise long-term sustinability of these forests can not be assured.

Minitry of Agriculture and Food (MAF)
The MAF has primary responsibility for forestry in Albania, which is exercised through the
Directorate General of Forests and Pastures, the executive body that carries out the government's
forestry policies and operations (identified as the Department of Forest and Pasture in Figure 3).
The MAF also includes the Directorate of Science and Qualification, with responsibility for
agricultural schools and research institutes, among them the Forest and Pasture Research Institue
(FPRI).
Directorate General of Forests and Pastres (DGFP)
The Directorate is responsible for the production and protection of Albania's forest and pasture
resources.4 (see Figure 4)
The Directorate is headed by i General Director and comprises ten sections, with the following titles
and functions:
The Foreien Relations and Personnel Training Section manages the Directorate's relationship
with foreign donors and administering the staffmg and training of forestry personnel.
The Forest Police Service Section, created with the 1992 Forest Law, is responsible for
issuing fuies and enforcing sanctions intended to protect the forests and pastures. Its work
takes place primarily at local levels. TIhus the section's role is mainly to provide support to
as well as supervision of the District-level Forest Police staff. The head serves as the Vice
General Director.5
The Silviculture Section provides support to district staff for silvicultural practices and
protection against pests and fiurs. Thie section also clears annual requests from the forest
district directories for harvesting quotas against the forest management plans.
The Pastures Section was aligned with the DGF (Directorate General of Forests) in 1993 and
supervises 18 Pasture Enterprises owned by the State. These enterprizes are to become self-
fiuancing. Under the recently approved Pasture Law, the section will supervise and monitor
state, communal 2nd private pastures. The new law is expected to facilitate a rapid transition
to a market economy. Under the new law, the District Enterprises will be abolished after
July 1995. Twelve are presently bankrupt; they are no longer able to collect rent from
farmers using state pastures.
4The Pasturs were dd  on 6.12.1993.
51he main job is head of section. VWhen the Diretor General is absent, the Vice Genral Diretor
serves as acting DG.

The Fauna Section is responsible for all game and nongarne fauna (with primiary emphasis
on the former) and administers hunting regulations such as seasons, species to be hunted, and
quotas. It also collaborates with other fauna specialists who are responsible for protecting
endangered species through bans on hunting as well as provisions for their restoration. The
Fauna section is also responsible for DGFP's managem-nt of the network of protected areas,
in consultation with the CEP. These areas are all located within the forest fund' and their
protection is ensured by guards under the supervision of the forest district directorates.
Presently there are a total of 53 Inspectors vith protected area management responsibilities
for a total of 56,420 ha distributed over 15 districts.
The Forest Extraction Section was responsible for 36 Forest Logging Enterprises, prior to
the on-going privatization that began in December, 1994. Only a few Logging Enterprises
remain. When they are gone, this section will no longer have operational responsibility for
these enterprises.
The Economics and Privatization Section is responsible for assisting in the preparation of
section budgets and finalizing them with the Ministry of Fmance. This section also oversees
the process of privatizing the Stae Logging Enterprises.
The Control Secon is a temporary section created from the Economics and Privatization
Section (EPS) to address the economic difficulties brought about by the transition. The
section, headed also by the EPS head, is made up of four financial specialists who monitor
current financial arrangements in an effort to bring about order and accountability. It is
anticipated that by the time the Forestry Project begins after January, 1996, this section will
have become part of EPS once again.
The Eriect Manag = Unit (PMU) was created to support the Forestry Project funded by
the World Bank. During project preparation, the unit will carry out a communal silvo-
pastoral pilot project, undertake DGFP institutional reform, and procure vehicles and
equipment During the project's implementation the PMU will be responsible for managing
and coordinating all project related activities. (further details are discussed below).
A Project Environmental Management Unit (PEMU) was added to the project during the
Environmental Assessment. The PEMU would be responsible for coordinating all
environmental aspects of the project, and would provide specific inputs on general planning
(i.e., the forest and pasture strategy and the biodiversity strategy) and specific planning (i.e.,
forest management plans and environmental assessments) activities under the project The
PEMU would be responsible for preparation of the ElAs on the forest management plans,
coordinating with CEP, DGFP, FPRI, and with specialists from the MNS and FNS, and for
implementing the project's Mitigation and Monitoring Plan. The PEMU will be located
within the Ministry of Agriculture's Agricultural Program Office (APO).
Forest and Pasture Reseah Institute (FPRI)
The FPRI was established in 1992 to serve the research needs for forest and pasture management.
The Institte currently has five sections:

ti)     Forestry and Genetics, five staff
(ii)    Management, Inventory. Harvesting, and Pastures, seven staff
(iii)    Protection (Pests, Fires), three staff
(iv)    Oil-bearing and Medicinal Plants, two staff
(v)     Administration, Finance and Support, seven staff
These staff are primarily professional staff except for those in the Administration section. The
Institute has lost between 30-50% of its positions over the last three years. Three of the sections
have explicit environmental responsibilities yet the staff have no fonnal training in environmental
research issues.
The FPRI recently prepared two projects in erosion control and an action plan for agriculture,
forestry and pastures. These were submitted as proposals in early 1995 to the CEP for their
technical and financial review. The CEP then submits such proposals to the Academy of Science
for its technical review. The Institute is awaiting responscs to their proposals.
The FPRI also supports the Committee for Science and Technology along with other specialized
institutes in the preparation of national policy. The FPRI has prepared guidelines for forestry
research that are to be included in the complete program of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food.
The FPRI prepares forest management plans. The DGFP reviews, approves and implements the
plans.
TIhe FPRI oversees the operation of experimental research stations; three are in operation (Tirana,
Korce, Lura) and one is phaned (Shkodra). The sections prepare research methodologies for the
stations according to research programs that are approved by a Scientific Council.' The stations
collect data that they forward to the sections, which prepare the reports. More important reports are
forwarded to the Council which consider thena for approval and funding.
FPRI is administratively responsible to MAF's Directorate of Science and Qualification which
supports 18 minist  resarch institutes - FPRI is the only one in forestry.7  The Directorate
presently covers 60% of FPRI's costs, mostly salaries and some project activity. Efforts are
underway to restucture the agricultural (and other technical/scientific) research institutes. One
scenario would locate them under the Conmuite for Science and Technology. The purpose is to
avoid present overlaps in responsibilities and to insure that the research needs of a spectrum of
scientific and technical fields is adequately covered. Government support for these institutes is
limited, and ty are encouraged to seek financial support from other sources, both private and
foreign.
'The Dirctor of the FPI is Chaim  and the Head of FPRI's Mamagement Section is Sc.retay.
Other membes come from the Forest Faculty, DGFP and other relad institutions.
7The dCtrat is rsponsible for te saffof all post-gduate institutions in agriculture; the Ministry
of Education is responsible for all others (i.e. gduate and under institutions).

Ministry of Health and Environmental Protection
Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP)
The 1991 Environment Law created the CEP as a central agency under the Ministry of Health and
Environnental Protection. The CEP implements governmnent environmental policies (Article 37,
Environmental Law, 1991), and is charged with policy implementation, coordination, monitoring.
funding, public awareness and environmental information storage and dissemination.
In 1993, the CEP was enlarged and given a broader structure. It is comprised of three directorates
0C) Natural Resource Proection and Soil Rehabilitation, (ii) Air and Water Quality, Hazardous
Wastes, and (iii) Economy and National Environmental Legislation.
Forestry falls under the first directorate; the current head of the directorate (acting) is a forester by
professioc. It is the responsibility of the directorate to observe and monitor government activities in
its functional areas of responsibility and to register objections when practices run counter to the
interests of the environment. The head of the directorate also serves on at least two commissions
which have environmental concerns. One chooses projects for forest exploitation by private firms.
This 10 member commission is headed by the Vice Director General of DGFP and its secretary is
head of the Forest Exploitation Section of DGFP. Others members are drawn from the Forest
Faculty of the Agricultural University and of FPRI. The CEP member is intended to represenit the
interests of the environment leading to a balanced outcome that benefits both the forest sector and
the environment.
In June 1994, the CEP was strengthened with the establishment of 12 Environmental Regional
Agencies (ERA) at the Prefecture level. These agencies or offices are comprised of two to three
specialists, in most cases a chief and two assistants. They are supposed to have technical credentials
in environmental management. However, few have such training or experience, which is not
surprising, considering Albania's lack of experience in enviromental matters.
ERA staff functions include the implementation of the environmental law at the local level, the
collection of environmental data on water, soil, and air pollution and reporting to CEP quarterly,
and the assessment of project implementation of environmnentally sensitive projects.
Efforts have been undertaken to have the ERA's represented on the regional boards of the Council
of Territorial AdjustmenL Some of these efforts have been successful but others have been resisted.
The Council is one of the most powerful bodies in Albania chaired by the Prime Minister. It decides
all issues of present and futur land use and hence plays a key role in the country's overall
development. At the local level where developers - not conservationists - have a strong voice and
broad representation on the regional boards, the CEP if represented is usually outvoted. If it is not
represented on the Board it has no chance of influencing the outcome of voting.
The activities of these boards represent instances where Albania's environmental law is openly
challenged. The CEP has two options of recourse: 1) seeking legal action (although this course may
not be successful in Albania's present judicial circumstances), and 2) to obtain public opiion and
to raise the issue in the media and to try and pressure the Government to pursue a conservation
approach.

An Inspectorate of Environental Protection is organized and reports to the CEP. In any case the
CEP's legal counsel position is presently vacant and the Conmmittee is having a difficult time filling
it. According to the law, it consists of a chief inspector and other inspectors located in regional
branches.  Its purpose is to monitor compliance with regulations and enforce environmnental
sanctions. This function is apparently performed in two ways presently. One, the heads of CEP's
directorates act as inspectors as part of the performance of their duties. Second, the ERAs posted
at the Prefects carry out an inspector role as part of their responsibilities.
Institute for Biological Research (IBR)
The IBR began as the Center of Biological Research in 1978. In 1990, the Institute was established
and today it has four departments with a total of 35 staff, including a Director, Vice Director, and
16 professional and 17 technical staff. The specializations represented in the staff are as follows:
0X)     Ecology and Flora, (6 professional fPI staff, 4 technicians [MJ);
Cli)    Physiology and Microbiology, (3 P, 6 T);
iii)    Genetics, (4 P, 4 T); and
(iv)    Biochemistry and Biophysics (3 P, 3 T).
The IBR is prinarily a research institute, and support sore teaching. The Director of the Institute
is also the principal contact in Albania for the International Union for the Conservation of Naure
(IUCN). The Institute was involved with the Ecological Survey (Habili et al, 1995), the first such
collaborative activity the Institute participated which direcly involved the forestry sector. Other
activities the Istituft has undertaken that relate directly to forestry include a three volume study on
Albania flora, a Redbook of threatened species, and ecological studies. The Institute also receives
state fimding to undertake in vitro cultures of forest nursery plants and seedlings.
Non-govmnmental Organizations (NGOs)
Environmental NGOs
According to a 1994 law dtat provides the legal framework for the establishment and operation of
NGOS, new NGOs register at the local court in the jurisdiction where they will operate. FDr rwane-
based NGOs, it is the local municipal Court of Tirane.
Since 1991-1992 a number of NGOs with an environmental orientation have been formed in Albania.
The most active environmental NGOs are the Society for the Protection and Preservation of the
Natural Environment in Albania (PPNEA) and the Albanian Society for the Protection of Birds and
Mammals (ASPBM).
The PPNEA was established in June 1991 with CEP approval; it was the first environmental NGO
established in Albania and is presently the largest one with over 400 members. It has a chairman,
a council of 15 elected at the general meeting, an Executive Committee of 4 persons, and a
membership body. Its members are specialists in such fields as geography, soil, ecology, forestry,
zoology etc. It is headquartered in Tirana with five branches (Viora, Elbasan, Shkoder, Gjirokastra
and Peshkopia). In 1994 ihe organization opened an office in Tirana with necessary equipment
including computers, an archive and an environmental library. It maintains links with a number of
international environmental interest groups or NGOs.
Albania Foresty Envromneal Assessmem
page 50



According to information provided by the organization, PPNEA is an autonomous NGO with its own
operating methods, legal structure and funding base; it is politically independent and has its own
statute.
Its primaly objecive has been to create public awareness of Albania's environment through such
media as TV, films, publications, seminars and conferences, and a newsletter, 'We and the
Environmentm. A number of these public information projects have received foreign donor support
(EU, German, Dutch).
The Society plans to develop its program in research and training as well as in public information.
It is presently a partner with ASBPM in a grant activity to promote NGO participation in developing
a biodiversity strategy for Albania. Ihe grant is from the Regional Environment Center, Budapest,
a multi-lateral lendii; agency supported by the EU and USAID among otiers. The Society has also
been in contact with USAID about its proposed forestry project.
ASBPM was established in 1992 and currently has 35 members including both specialists and non-
specialists interested in nature conservation. Its objectives include (i) influencing the government
to take seriously the issues and conditions that effect the habitats of birds and mammals, (ii) support
of government authorities in the preparation of protection legislation aimed at endangered species,
and (iii) promotion of public awareness, especially among young people, of the need to protect birds
and mammals.
Two branches of the society exist in sensitive bird areas such as the Lagoon Legha Divajika which
is included in the Rainsar Convention. It also maintns some intenational links such as with the
Italian Society for Bird Protection.
The Society has a constuion, members pay a yearly membership fee (150 Lek), and meetings are
held every dutee months or so., The Society has an Execative Council that manages the day to day
affairs of the Society.
Other environment NGOS include Forest Progress, The Albanian Ecological Club, the National
Organization of Decorative Flora and Fauna, the Association of the Albanian Biologists, the
Association of Albanian Foresters, the Didactic and Scientific Assodation of Albanian Speleologists
(Cave Experts), the Independent Forum of the Albanian Womnen, and the Albanian Hygienists
Association. There is also the Albanian Association of Enviromental Doctors, Young Ecologists,
Youth Group 'Pearl' (affiliated with PPNEA), Environment and Development Association, and
Chemists' Association.$
Support for Environmental NGOs
A branch office of the Regional Environment Center (REC) headquartred in Budapest, Hungary
supports fte development of environmental oriented NGOs in Albania, and to date has issued over
20 grants to local NGOs in such areas as environmental education, institution building, and
'For more details, see A. Collaj, L. Gjiknuri, P. Qiiazi, ad L. Ktsha, The Environmenal Situation
in Albania and thc StRv of Noo-Governmental Or-anizations. (rane: PPNEA, 1994), pp. 14 ff.

equipment. These are small grants not exceeding 3,000 ECU a year. The REC plans to open a
training center next year in Tirane.
Hunting Society
First established in 1950, the Hunting Society has the right to grant hunting licenses. It works in
cooperation with the DGFP, which supervises its activities. The Society organizes hunters and trains
them regarding the laws of the country. Its purpose is to strengthen the hunting economy but in
concert with, and not at the expense of, forestry and other interests.
The membership fee for belonging to the Society is 100 Lek. The Govermment also collects a tax of
1,000 L.ek from each member each year. There are currently 10,000 registered members. Other
tariffs are imposed by the Fuiance Ministry for animals killed etc. The Society keeps the
membership fees plus 5% of the tax; the balance goes to the Government.
The Society would like members to have to make just one payment a year and that taxes should be
used for measures that will benefit hunting (viz. investnents in hunting reserves, fauna protection
and the introduction of new species for hunting).
D)uring recent years many guns have entered Albania which have not been registered, resulting in
uncontrolled hunting and poaching in certain parts of the country. The Society follows strict rules -
- simple ownership of a gun is not sufficient to gain membership. The recent law on wildlife and
hunting gives the Hunting Society responsibility for gun registration.
The Hunting Society has a national council of about 40 members, 36 representatives of each district
and four others. The operating rules of the council are currently undergoing revision. There are
society branches in each of the districts each of which have a council and a governing board. The
council is composed of from 9 to 11 members who are elected by the society members in each
district according to set criteria. The council elects the board comprised of a chairman, a vice
chairman and a secretary. The first two positions are voluntary and the third is paid.
4.2 IMPcCr ANALYS AND MIGATnoN MEASuREs
Issue 6:  Transformation of the DGFP into a Forest Corporation and a Forest and Pastre
Department and reated administratie changes
The project would result in several substanial institutional changes, including transforming the DGFP
into a Forest Corporation, creation of a Forest Council and a Project Environmental Management
Unit (PEMU), and decentralization of the forest administration. The DGFP will be separated into
a Forest Corporation responsible for commercial forestry and a new Forest and Pasture Department
responsible for non-commercial forestry functions such as policy, regulations, prograun monitoring
and evaluation, environmental monitoring, and public services such as extension, communal
programs and protected areas management.
A principal concern over creation of the Forest Corporation is that its comnmercial aims must be
balanced with the regulatory/policy aims of the Forest and Pasture Department, and that these groups
Albania Foresry Envirnnzwal Assmer
page 52



work together in providing environmental protection for and sustainable and multiple uses of forest
resources. lhis concern has been mitigated by the following elements designed into the project or
expected from its planned activities:
i)      Requiring GOA acceptance of the recommendations on protected areas from the
ecological survey (Habili et al, 1995) and the mitigations of this environmental
assessment;
il)     continued examination of the issues of protected areas within the contexts of the Forest
and Pasture Sector Strategy and the Biodiversity Strategy to identify additional forests
that merit status as protected areas and further define the roles of production and
protection forests in Albania;
iii)    creation of a Project Environmental Management Unit to oversee environmental issues
during project implementation, including voting power on the steering committee that
decides project expenditures and work plans;
iv)     professional developn .nt and training of staff from the DGFP, FPRI, PEMU, and CEP
in updating the forest management plans and conducting environmental analyses of these
plans and individual forestry staff;
v)      preparation and inplementation of updated forest management plans that encompass
timber and non-timber forest values; and
uI)     development of public involvement in Albanian forestry, including public meetings for
the Forest Council, consensus-building steps during development of the Forest and
Pasture Sector Strategy, and public involvement in preparation and environmental review
of the forest management plans.
The Forest Council will be a policy and advisory body that determines the uses of the revenue
account resources and advises the government on forestry policy and operations of the fuitre Forest
Corporation. It is expected to provide leadership in the evolving forestry sector; its composition will
be decided by the Council of Ministers. The Ministry of Agriculture has recommended that it
include representatives of the following: Economic Development Department, the Ministries of
Agriculture and Food, Health and Environmental Protection, Finance, Internal Affairs, Labor, and
Industry, the General Forestry Directorate, Forestry and Pasture Research Institute, Forestry faculty,
private companies, one or more NGOs (not currently defined), and local authorities.
Because the members of the Forest Council are mostly representatives of various ministries, its
creation and operation will politicize the forest managemnent process in Albania, which could be
expected to diversify the demands on Albanian forests. The environmental impact of this change is
uncertain, but is likely to be beneficial. This composition will also expand the debate within
government on the use and protection of Albanian forests, and may strengthen sector objectives of
diversifying the economic use of forests to include tourism and recreation. The Forest Council will
rely on the revised law on Forests for its mandate, which will emphasize multiple use and sustinabk
forest management.

A steering conunittee will be formed to approve the forestry project work plans and budgets. The
committee will be chaired by the MAF, with voting advisors composed of the Directors of the DGFP
and the APO and the head of the PMU. In the course of the environmental review, the need for a
PEMU was identified. Creation of the PEMU and its designation as a voting member of the steering
commnittee are recommendations of this environmental assessment that were incorporated into the
project during the final stages of its planning. This mitigation is intended to give the individuals
responsible for environmental oversight of the project active roles in its management decisions.
Mitigation Mesures:
6.1     At least two working neetings of the Forest Ccuncil shall be open to the public each
year to develop public awareness in Albanian forestry and provide a fonum for public
involvement in forest policy.
6.2    'De head of the PEMU sh;ll be a voting member of the steering comniittee.
Issue 7:  Creation and operation or the revenue account
The DGFP is drafting the law that would permit establishmerit of the revenue account (it may also
be called the Forest Development Fund). Creation and operation of the revenue account is not
explicitly part of the forestry project, but is an integral part of the transformation of the forestry
institutions in Albania that would occur under the project The proposed law on the creation of the
account aims to ensure 'the sustainable development of forests and pastures and investments on
forests and pastures (preanble). The account is established for a fixed duration of five years, witf
'admnimstrative, techuucal and financial autonomy, under the supervision of the General Directorate
of Forests and Pastures (ar. 1). The account should in particular ensure fnncial support to the
Directorae by making inves-nents on (art. 2) forest works (nurseries, reforestation, thinnings ...)
and improvement of pastures; managemnt of watersheds to prevent erosion; building and
improvement of forest roads; prevention of and efforts against pests and fires; construction of
buildings in forests and pastures; research; and purchase of equipment (transportion,
communication equipment, etc.).
The account's income consists of some of the revenues of the General Directorate (in the
progressively increasing percentages (from 50 to 70% over the five years), and any contributions
from private institutions. Use of the account is to be directed by a Forestry Council and an Executive
Committee. The forner body approves the annual budget and projects to be carried out and
generally controls the utilization of account. Ihe Council is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture
and Food. The Executive Committee's functions include proposing investment projects and
executing decisions made by the Council. It is chaired by the Director of Forestry (art. 8). Auditing
is carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Fnance, with external auditing by
independent experts (art 9). The law would enter into force on January 1, 1996 (art. 11).
Creation and operation of the revenue account is expected to increase the operating budget of the
DGFP (and its successor, the Forest Corporation). with direct increases in forestry investment. The
investments have not been defined, but would be virtually any forestry-related activity, including
services, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure. The revenue account may be used to intensify
timber production, develop recreation, tourism, or hunting opportnities, each of which could have

either adverse or beneficial environmental affects. The revenue account can be a source of funds
to develop and implement sector objectives of sustainable and multiple use management, including
improved management of protected areas.
Mitigation for potentially adverse impacts rests on development and implementation of sector
objectives (from the Forest and Pasture Sector Strategy), establishment of an envirommental review
process that results in avoidance of impacts to environmentally sensitive areas and improved
managemnent of forest units appropriate for harvesting operations, adherence to forest management
planning guidelines, and involverent of the public as recommended in the participatory management
guidelines.
Mitigation Measures: No mitigation needed.
Issue 8:   Institutional capacity for management of protected areas
The management of protected areas in Albania is limited as a result of inadequate training and
nunibers of staff, a lack of budgetary resources, and the lack of an overall strategy for biological
conservation. The DGFP employs approxnimately 53 full-time and 15 part-time staff for managing
national parks, hunting reserves, and other protected areas. Support from other institutions is also
limited: the CEP has a single staff member responsible for natural resources management. The
principal function of these staff, which are trained as foresters, has been to protect the areas against
fire and illegal activities. Such protection is necessary, but it is also necessary to manage protected
areas as ecosystems, based on an understanding of the species and communities inside and outside
the protected area, and with explicit management goals. To date, no management plans have been
prepared for protected areas in AXbaria.
The protected areas component of the forestry project includes capacity building and a pilot
management plan for Lura National Park. Under the capacity building subcomponent, vehicles,
radios, and other equipment needed to increase staff efficiency will be purchased for five districts,
and technical assistance and training of staff from Tirana and the five districts will occur. The pilot
management plan for Lura National Park will involve development of a management plan to expand
the park, environmental education, recreation and tourism promotion, and hiring of several staff to
provide additional protection. In the fiture, similar management plans could be prepared for one
protected area in each of the four other districts covered by the project. Whether project funds from
the protected areas component would be available for preparing additional management plans will
be evaluated in year 2 or 3 of the project
The increase in capacity for protected areas management is environmentally beneficial: it provides
needed professional development and training for protected area management, and increases the staff
for protected areas in five districts and expands their capabilities with additional vehicles and
infrastructural improvements. The protected areas within the districts covered under the project will
receive increased protection against illegal harvesting.
Mitigation Measures: No mitigation is needed.

Issue 9: Need for improved capacity for forestry environmental management and increased
environmental taining for forestry staff
Internationally accepted safeguards are incorporated into the forest management plans, including
prohibition of logging on slopes exceeding 45 degrees. 100 meter setbacks from streamcourses, and
silvicultural practices shown to be effective in stand regeneration. The MAF lacks the capacity for
broader environmental management  Specifically, the MAF lacks the training and capacity for
conducting environmental assessments of its policies and operations, especially with respect to
conducting site-specific and regional impact analysts on biodiversity.
To assist in redressing these institutional shortcomings, the forestry project will create and fund an
environmental unit and technical assistance for environmental training. A Project Environmental
Management Unit (PEMU), added to the project during the Environmental Assessment, would
provide specific inputs on general planning (i.e., the forest and pasture strategy and the biodiversity
strategy) and specific planning (i.e., forest management plans and environmental assessmnents)
activities under the project. The PEMU would be responsible for preparation of the ELAs on the
forest management plans, coordinating with CEP, DGFP, FPRI, and with specialists from the MNS
and FNS, and for implementing the project's Mitigation and Monitoring Plan.
Environmental training under the project will include in-service and fui 4ign training for forestry
staff, and upgrading the equipment and facilities of education and research institutions. Iirider
taining for DGFP staff, in-service training is planned at the Agricultural Uriiversity's Forest Faculty
for DGFP staff at the district and lower levels in forestry environmental issues. In-service training
for staff of the Forestry Technician School at Shkodra will also involve training in environmental
forestry. Foreign training tours for DGFP and FPRI staff will include some coverage of
environmentl issues and concerns including modern concepts and practices of protected areas
management and biodiversity conservation.
Professional development and training in biodiversity analysis and planning is needed for staff of the
DGFP, FPRI, and the PEMU and specialists from the MNS and IBR that participate in dhe project
The goal of this training will be to develop approaches to site-specific biological surveys, techniques
in mitigation for impacts to biodiversity, basic conservation biology, regional analyses of
biodiversity, and forest wildlife habitat management. Ibis training should be conducted through the
park planning technical assistance component of the project.
The environmental unit and training will have an envirojunental beneficial impact.  The
environmental unit was conceived and designed to establish more complete environmental
management responsibilities within the MAF than currently exist. In addition to these mnitigations
that have been incorporated into project design, an additional mitigation is recommnended to address
the need for professional development and training on biodiversity issues.
Mitigation Measures:
9.1     Foreign technical assistance from IUCN or another qualified contractor shali be obtained
to provide professional development and training for site-specific and regional
biodiversity analyses and planning to appropriate staff of the DGFP, FPRI, to the
PEMU, and to specialists from the MNS and IBR.

Issue 10: Preparation of a Forest and Pasture Sector Strategy
A Forest and Pasture Sector Strategy is to be prepared in years I and 2 of the project. Its main
purpose will be to formulate a strategy for optiniizing the sustainable and environmentally sound use
of state forests, and peparing an action plan for achieving this goal. The strategy will evaluate the
effectiveness of existing forest products, institutions, and policies, identify the goals and objectives
of forestry, and chart the course of action over a 10 to 20 year future to achieve these goals. The
specific content and scope of the strategy is to be developed early in the project A principal
objective of the stategy will be to develop concepts of sustainable forestry tailored to Albainia and
the resources of Albanian forests.
Development of a long-tern vision for the Albanian forestry sector is intended to have beneficial
environmental impacts, through its affect on upgrading forest management prar# -s, strengthening
non-consumptive forest uses (e.g., recreation and tourism), refuning the roles of production and
protection functions of Albanian forests, modemizing existing environmental management activities,
and expanding the role of the pt-blic in forestry decision-making.
Mitigation Measure: 'he Forest and Pasture Sector Strategy will plan for the sustainable and
environmentally sound use of stae forests and according to recommendations on participatory
management. No additional mitigation is needed.
Issue 11: Istitutional capacity to conduct ElAs
Albanians have limited experience with the preparation of ELAs, and there is no such experience
within the MAF. Under the project, technical assistance is needed to support the preparation of EIAs
under the projecL lhis technical assistance should include, but not be limited to, professional
development and training for the PEMU and CEP to strengthen their capacity for preparing EIAs
and for monitoring environment  aspects of the foresty sector.
There is a need for cooperation and coordination between in environmental monitoring tasks and
preparation of EIAs and forest management plans. Successful environmental training and monitoring
and for the preparation of forest management plans and ElAs will require cooperation and
coordination between the PEMU, DGFP, FPRI, and various specialists. The PEMU formed under
the project will be responsible for coordinating environmental training for the project.
M_iigatio Measure:
11.1    The PEMU shall be responsible for tne preparation of EIAs for forest management
plans, harvesting plans, and road rehabilitation activities. The EIAs are to be approved
by the CEP. The roles and responsibilities for environmental assessment of forestry
projects shall be established by the PEMU in year I of the prqJect, and shall include the

and FNS to jointly receive technical assistance in the preparation of forest management
plans, EIAs, and other environmental training under the project.
4.3 SIGNICANCE OF IMAcrs AFTER IMPLEMENTAnON OF MIGATION MEASURES
The institutional changes called for under the project provide an opportunity for strengthening the
institutions responsible for forest management, for which there is an urgent need. The risk exists
that the institutional changes will drive economic development at the expense of environmental
protection and management. The project is designed, however, to blend technical assistance in
forestry and environmental protection, broadening of the forestry mandate through preparation of the
Forest and Pasture Sector Strateg y and updated forest management plans, and developing a process
of public involvement in forestry decision-making. These project components mitigate the potential
impacts of institutional change to a less than significant level.
Increasing the capacity for managing protected areas will have a beneficial environmental impact by
improving patrolling and management of protected areas in 5 districts. Preparation of a managemnent
plan for Lura National Park will have a beneficial impact on the management of the park and may
serve as a starting point for the preparation of other protected areas after the project
Professional development and training in forest management, planning, environmental impact
analysis, and bioregional planning will support preparation of EIAs for forest management plans and
specific forese interventions and the collection of baseline data needed to establish long-term
environmental monitoring programs. The environmental impact of this component is also beneficial.

5.0 FoREST MANAGEMENT PLANS
5.1 EXISING CONDITONS
lhe preparation of updated forest management plans (FMPs) is a central component of the forestry
project. The existing FMPs are largely out of date: FMPs for only 72 forest units out of 360 are
10 years old or less. Under the project, forest management plans (FMPs) will be updated for 57
forest units covering about 160,000 ha of high forests. The project would fund the fieldwork for
forest inventories, collection of ecological data, social surveys and geodetic mapping, the scientific
and planning work, and supervision and quality control.
The project will improve the capacity of the FPRI and DGCFP to prepare and to implement 'new-
stylem FMPs. For the high forest, about 40,000 ha of planning used to be done for management
units at the sector level (averaging about 3,000 ha) every year, which allowed some 400,000 ha to
be covered over a 10-year period. FMPs were based on a 10% inventory of the planning unit. For
coppice and shrub forests, a nation-wide inventory at 5% sampling intensity was done every tenth
year, most recently in 1985. The existing guidelines for the preparation of FMPs emphasize forest
management for wood production, and FMPs are valid for 10 years.
The currently-valid FMPs were prepared before the recent laws and regulations came into effecL
'These include Law No. 7664 of 21 January 1993 on Enviromnental Protection (Article 18, parts 6
and 7) which requires licenses for various fbnms of forest exploitation. Article 31 allows the
competent authorities to suspend operations which have caused environmental damage or pollution,
and to impose specific mitigation measures. Law 7623 (Article 15) of 13 October 1992 requires
aproduction and inventory plans' for both State and Communal Forests, to be produced using skills
available from scientific institutions. Article 23 requires the determination of an annual allowable
cut based on criteria of sustainability. The Law appears to contain general agreement that forest
mlsanagement plans should not be considered purely from a harvesting perspective, but also as plans
for the nmnagement of th,e whole ecosystem.
5.3 IMACr ANALYSIS AND MMGAION MEASCRES
Issue 12: Technical requirements for updating forest management plans and the participation
of appropriate stakeholders
The forest management plans are seen as a critical project component that will require cooperative
efforts by an interdisciplinary team of forest engineers, biologists, public involvementspecialists, and
others.
The completeness and implementability of a FMP depends upon the quality of the data collected
during its preparation. It is essential to have accurate timber volume and growth estimates for
calculation of the annual allowable cus, and the conservation of threatened and endangered flora and
fauna must be based on adequate information about these characteristics of the forest management
unit.
To balance the environmental costs and values of the updated FMPs, all appropriate stakeholders
should be included in the process. The stakeholders include the technical specialists in flora and
fauna from the scientific agencies; the environmental agencies within the Albanian government
Albania Forufy .nwram2mal Assem
page 59



(particularly the CEP); environmental organizations; and local populations, local forestry engineers
and other interested persons who reside and work in the vicinity of forest units.
Updating the forest management plans (FMPs) according to the guidelines in Appendix 2 will have
a beneficial environmnental impact. Development of the guidelines is expected to occur in year 1 of
the project. Annexes 1-3 contain recommendations on forest management planning and public
involvement in resource management that should be followed.
Mitigation Measures:
12.1    Forest management plans shall be updated according to standards and methods
acceptable to the Bank (draft guidelines are found in Annex I) and shall include results
of floral and faunal inventories and recommendations on mitigations for their protection
prepared by biologists from the IBR and MNS.
Issue 13: Need for ELAs for forest management plans and other forestry activities
This Environmental Assessment is a sector level assessment that addresses the broad issues of the
project. Sone activities that are funded under the project (e.g., road rehabilitation and preparation
of forest management plans) will require project-specific environrental review. Forest harvesting
activities will also require preparation of ELAs even though these activities are not funded under the
project EIAs should be carried out for the forest management plans, and for road rehabilitation and
dImrbr harvesting activities for the following rea-ons:
i)      Floral and faunal field studies are incomplete in many of the forest units where these
activities may occur. These field studies will be conducted during updating of forest
management plans and during environmental review of project activities. The ecological
survey provided a list of sensitive plants and animals of the high forest that require
special protection and management. ElAs will be carried out for the forest management
plans to further define the mitigations necessary for these species, including if necessary
the removal of forest stands or forest units from forest operations;
il)    the preparation of forest management plans and forestry operations with potentially
significant environmental impacts require involvement of the public, both to educate
them and to address their concerns; and
uI)    the consistency of the updated forest manaement pls with multiple use and sustined
forestry policies promulgated by the project must be evaluated.
The project provides technical assistance to improve the capacity of the participating agencies to
undertake environml review of forestry projects. This will include the PEMU, CEP, FPRI, and
itmerested specialists from the Institute of Biological Research, the Museum of Natural Sciences, and
the Faculty of Natural Sciences.

Mitigatio Measures:
13.1    The PEMU shall work with the CEP and foreign technical experts to prepare guidelines
for the preparation of ElAs, including procedures for determining whether an EIA is
necessary, and its scope, depending on the proposed forest operation.
5.3 SIGNECANCE OF IMAcTs AFrER IMENrMETAMON OF MMGATnON MEASURES
The procedures for forest management planning provide a basis for imnproved environmental
management of stat-owned high forests. Updating the forest management plans in accordance with
the recommuendations and mitigation measures of the environmental assessment will have a beneficial
environmental impact. Mitigation for potentially adverse impacts of forestry operations in the long
term rests on development and implementation of sector objectives (e.g., from the Forest and Pastre
Sector Strategy), establishment of an environmental review process that mitigates significant adverse
impacts and ddherence to forest management planning and participatory management guidelines.

6.0 ROAD REHBILITATION
6.1 ExLSmG CoNDmoNs
The current road network of about 2,000 km of forest roads was established over many years to meet
the harvesting and silvicultural demands of the high forests. The existing road network was
constructd to undertake first phase thinnings in beech and pine forests. The roads have become
degraded due to the lack of maintenance over the last 10 years and longer. In some areas, road
conditions have deteriorated to the extent that phase II silvicultural thinnings for regeneration are
hampered or interrupted. lhe state of some roads has also exacerbated the effects of low road
densities on the enviromnent and the economic efficiency of harvesting.
Between 50 and 80 Ikm of roads would be rehabilitated each project year from year 2, for a total of
350 Ian. The objective of this component is to facilitate completion of second phase and third phase
felling in selected areas, which is a priority for forcst management in that it (i) will allow
completion of the natural regeneration processes on large areas of beech and pine forests; and (ii)
improve wood extraction where it is most cost-effective in accessible and previously-exploited areas.
Rehabilitation of the roads as proposed will make it possible to complete the natural regeneration
over about 5,500 ha of beech and 7,000 ha of pine, and to advance the regeneration process over
another 5,000 ha of beech. An estimated 1.68 million m3 of timber will be extracted over 5 years;
about 830,000 m3 of this is expected to be harvested from 53 forest units covered under the project
An estimated 1.5 million m3 of fuelwood is expected to be harvested from Albanian forests over five
years. The project would fund the design and implementation of the rehabilitation work, and later
the maintenance of the rehabilitated roads. The work would only be carried out within forest units
which have updated FMPs, and would comply with recent legislation on environmnental impact
assessment relating to forest road work. The design of road rehabilitation would be the responsibility
of the Technical Units at the Prefecture level, and would be done by the Technical Units or by
contracted private firms under their supervision.
6.2 IMIAcr ANALYSIS AND MmGATION MEASURES
Issue 14:  Need for establishing road rehabilitation standards and environmental impact
assessments (ElAs) of road rehabilitation activities in individual forest units
The rehabilitation of about 350 km of roads is expected to consist of small-scale operations confined
to regrading, filling of potholes, and correction of drainage problems responsible for erosion of road
surfaces. The specific activities will be defuied when the DGFP completes a survey of Category V
and VI forest roads in 70 forest units. The PEMU, working with the DGFP, FPRI, CEP, and other
appmpriate groups should review the road rehabilitation activities planned for each forest unit, and
evaluate whether an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is needed.
The exact iocaiions, proixdiaies, and costs o''this component will be determined when the DGFP
complets a survey of the state of Category V and VI forest roads. The direct impacts of road
rehabilitation could have adverse environmental impacts, depending on the magnitude of the
operations. If rehabilitation consists of small-scale operations, as proposed, the adverse impacts
would be small. The forest harvesting activities that cruld be indirectly supported as a result of road

rehabilitation would also have potentially adverse environmental impacts. It is not known where
harvesting will occur, but it will not occur in roadless areas that contain old growth stands studied
in the ecological survey.
In order to minimize direct environmental impacts on downstream water quality, road rehabilitation
activities should implemented in accordance with international standards (e.g., FAO, 1995). With
appropriate engineering standards, the rehabilitation of existing roads may offer important
opportunities to correct environmentally damaging road designs and stream crossings. Attention
should be paid to the proper design of culverts and other drainage structures, maintaining road
surfaces, roadside ditches, road cross drainage and stream crossings in accordance 'with best
management practices, and closing secondary roads where they will not be needed for some years.
The PEMU should assemble existing information from FAO and other appropriate organizations on
environmental considerations in roadway design and rehabilitation, and incorporate these best
management practices into the technical specifications for the request for bids for road rehabilitation
activities under the project.
Mitigation Measures:
14.1    The DGFP shall develop, with the assistance of the PEMU, best management practices
for minimizing environmental impacts from road rehabilitation, which are to. be
incorporated into technical specifications for the request for bids for road rehabilitation
contracts.
14.2    The PEMU shall be responsible for the preparation of ElAs for forest management
plans, harvesting plans, and road rehabilitation activities. The ElAs are to be approved
by the CEP. The roles and responsibilities for enviromental assessment of forestry
projects shall be established by the PEMU in year 1 of the project, and shall include the
participation of the CEP, MNS, and IBR.
14.3    The PEMU shall periodically inspect road rehabilitation projects during or immediately
after operations to ensure that the recommended mitigations have been followed, and
subamit a brief report to the CEP.
6.3 SIGNFICANCE OF IA     AFER ImPLEmENTAnoN OF MiTGATnoN MEAsuREs
The environmental impacts of the proposed road rehabilitation are potentially adverse.  If
rehabilitation consists of sniall-scale operations, as proposed, the adverse impacts would be less than
significanL The specific activities will be defuied when the DGFP completes its road survey. Given
this uncertainq, the PEMU, working with the DGFP, FPRI, CEP, and other appropriate groups will
review the road rehabilitation activities planned for each forest unit, and evaluate whether an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is needed.

7.0 FORESF THINNNG
7.1 ExiNaG CoNDmoNs
The lack of funds for thinning, management supervision and road rehabilitation have prevented or
delayed the required silvicultural operations for pre-comrnercial thinning in about The project would
support pre-commercial thinnings in 22,000 ha of young pine stands and 7,000 ha of young beech
stands. 10-15% of stems (which are all smallwood) will be cut from very dense stands.
The thinning regimes developed for Albanian forests are as follows:
Beech stands developing from natural regeneration -
Phase I   at about age 10-15 years, when there could be 6,000-10,000 stems per ha, remove 10-
15% of the stems. This could require 25 man-days work per ha.
Phbase    at about age 20-25 years (i.e. about 6 years later), remove another 10-15% of stems.
Phases m and further Phases:
after approximately every 6 years, remnove another 10-15% of stems. Therefore, there
could be as many as S or even 10 thinnings of this type.
7.2 IMPAcT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MFAsuREs
impact 15:  Soil erosion and damage to remaining trees in thinned stands
The project w..  . upport pre-comnercial thinnings in about 25,000 ha of 15-20 year old stands.
The stands are dense and young and only 10-15% of stms (all smallwood) will be cut There would
be no measurable increase in soil erosion as a result of stand thinning: thinning will be done by neld
crews using hand and power tools and the remaining trees would a.equately protect the soil.
Damage to remaining stems will depend on the methods employed, and would not be expected to
have ecological consequences. The primary beneficial impact is the improved condition and rate of
growth of the residual stand, in that competition between trees is reduced, growth is concentraed
in the best trees, better retmns are obtained from later thinnings, and rotation ages should be
reduced.
No adverse enviromnental impacts are expected to occur as a result of forest thinning activities.
Opening of the dense beech and pine stands would enhance habitat quality for pant and animal
species and the wages paid for labor will have beneficial social effects.

8.0 FoREsr HARVESrnMG
8.1 ExMmNG CONDMONS
Field inspections during preparation of Lie environmental assessment indicate that many forest
harvesting operations in Albania are having adverse environmental impacts.  The most
environmentally damaging operations may have been illegal harvesting operations. Excessive
wastage of timber was observed in some areas, in the forms of volume cut but not extracted from
the forest, degradation of sawlog quality by splitting and bruising, cutting sawlogs (especially the
valuable buttlog) into short billets and splitting them for fuelwood, logs left in hollows and streams,
poor felling tedmiques which produce splits and high stumps, and other forms of site degradation
including damage to the residual stand by poor felling techniques.
3.2 IMPACr ANALYSIS AND MmIGAToN MEAsuREs
Impact 16:   1.68 million m  of timber are expected to be harvested from high forests in the
nurse of project implementation
Forest harvesting operations are not funded under the project. The forest harvesting activities that
could be indirectly supported as a result of road rehabilitation could have adverse environmental
impacts. The estimated 1.68 million m3 that would be harvested over the five years of the project
(1995-2001), partly from the 70 forest units covered by project-related field activities, is less than
the annual allowable cut for Albanian forests. It is not known where harvesting will occur, but it
will not occur in madless areas that contain old growth stands studied in the ecological survey.
Many forest harvesting operations in Albania are havin_ adverse environmental impacts. The most
environmentally damaging may have been illegal harvesting operations. In addition to the
environmental impacts, there are economic losses from illegal logging.
In the course of the project, an estimated 1.68 million cubic meters of wood will be removed from
Albanian high forests. Currently, there is no information on the distribution of harvesting activities
or on the volumes that would be removed from individual districts or forest units. Consequently,
it is difficult to evaluate the impacts of these harvesting activities. They will depend on current
forest practices, and on the effectiveness and speed of implementation of the forestry project
Three potentially significant impacts of timber harvesting activities are related to soils and
biodiversity.
1.        Forest harvesting activiies will have a potentially adverse impact through increased
compaction and erosion. Soil is a basic, largely nonrenewable resource whose
conservation is necessary for sustined yields of all forest resources. Soil erosion has
been recognized as one of the major impacts of land degradation in Albania.
Management activities can affect soils through compaction, displacement, disruption of
nutrient cycles, and increased erosion and sedimentation. Timber harvesting activities
on steep lands, and the difficulty of reestablishing forest cover on these slopes, has been
one of many factors contributing to soil erosion (Zdruli, 1995).
Abania Formsby Envronmea Assmem
page 66



The problem soils in Albanian high forests fall into three categories: soils that lack the cohesion
provided by clays or certain silts and prone to surface erosion; soils high in silt and clay and
prone to mass wasting; thin soils with high rock content with poorly developed surface litter and
generally inappropriate for timber harvesting.  In the forest units where intensive forest
management is currenly pracised, erosion is low because harvesting is prohibited on steep slopes.
These regulations are to be evaluated and incorporated into the updated forest management plans
at the same or greater level of protection afforded under the existing FMPs.
2.        The management of lands for timber production has the potential to reduce the habitat
found within certain seral stages (e.g., old growth) or to create an imbalane- of habitats
that would be detrimental to some species. The concern is heightened for some species
with specific and narrow habitat requiremnents such as for snags, old growth forest, etc.).
Tbe old growth forests of Albania are found largely in the forest units without access
roads that are described in detail in the ecological survey (Habili et al, 1995). No forest
operations will occur in these forest units in the course of the project This issue is
firther addressed in chapter 10 of this environmental assessment.
3.        The managen-ent of high forests for timber production would potentially result in the
conversion of forests from hardwood to conifer stands because of their higher economnic
value. The conversion of hardwood to conifer forests would have a significant impact
on biological resources. Hardwoods provide vegetation diversity, wildlife habitat, and
aesthetic variety. In the past, such conversion has not been pronounced but has resulted
in the diminishment of some hardwood forests.
Mitigation for potentially adverse impacts of forestry operations in the long term rests on
development and implemetation of sector objectives (e.g., from the Forest and Pasture Sector
Strategy), establishment of an environmental review process that mitigates significant adverse impacts
and identifies and inproves managernent of forest units appropriate for harvesting operations, and
adherence to forest management planning and participatory management guidelines. The institutional
-hange will have no environmental impact in itself.
Mitigation Measures:
16.1    The PEMU, FPRI, DGFP, MNS, and IBR, shall identify forest units with current forest
management plans (less than 10 years old) where forest harvesting is unlikely to have
significant impacts to biodiversity, either within the forest unit or within the region. The
resulting forest unts will be candidates for forest harvesting prior to updating of the
forest management plans during years 1 and 2 of the project. ElAs will be prepared for
proposed harvesting operations. For the remainig forest units, forest harvesting shall
not be implemented prior to updating of the forest management plan.
Impact 17:  Improved economic utilization of forest resources and supplies of forest products
to the Albanian economy
The project can be expected to improve economic utilization of Albanian high forests by increasing
tree growth and harvest levels through intensive management, and to provide an increased and stable

supply of wood to the wood industries and constuction sectors of the Albanian economy. Other
beneficial impacts include provision of wood for building and fuel, and improved access for hunting
and recreation.
Mitigation Measure: No mitigation measures are needed
83 SIGNIF1CANCE OF IMACTs AFE  IMPLEMNTATON OF MTGATION MEASURES
Forest harvesting activities are not supportea by the project, but on-going harvesting that is
conducted during the course of the project could have adverse environmental impacts. It is not
known where harvesting will occur, but it will not occur in roadless areas that contain old growth
stands studied in the ecological survey.
The focus of the forestry project is to strengthen institutional and technical skills in forest
management; it does not support any specific harvesting operations. The estimated 1.68 million m3
that wDuld be harvested over the five years of the project is less than the annual allowable cut for
Albanian forests. Under the project, the PEMU and CEP will work with DGFP to detrmine
whether individual forest harvesting projects will require ElAs, and provide appropriate mitigation
for adverse impacts.

9.0 COMMUNAL FouEsr AND PAsruRE MANAGEMENT
9.1 EXiSCNG CONDMTIONS
In Albania, villagers are curreny able to own small and large rnminants which are being grazed on
the open-access communal and state lands to generate supplementary income above that which they
can get from their small arable plots. The result has been a large increase in the numbers of animals
grazed on communal pasture lands, some high quality pasture lands have been converted to arable
uses, and the condition of the remaining pastures, especially near villages, has deteriorated from
overgrazing.
Between 1990 and 1992, a national inventory identified about 200,000 ha of high forest, coppice and
shrub on the plains, hills and mountains whose management could be entrusted to the Communes.
Due to climatic and soil conditions, and inadequate management, the productivity of these areas for
fodder and fuelwood is low. The deficit of fodder has been estimated at over 300 million Feed Units
per year. Estimated annual production of fuelwood (some of which comes from the local village
coppice and shrub areas) is 1.5 million cubic meters, against an estimated annual demand of about
3.3 million cubic meters.
The conditions in the Tregan Commune illustrate some of the challenges: 900 households are
allocated 1.5 cubic meters of fuelwood per year, totalling about 1,300 cubic meters, which is to be
obtained from an area of about 300 ha on which the annual production would not exceed 900 cubic
meters. The balance of fuelwood demand would be acquired from other sources. Other non-wood
forest products, such as aromatic and medicinal plants, edible mushrooms, other food plans and
forest fruits, and resins and revenues from hunting and tourism, have some potential but currently
are also generally degraded. The degradation of vegetation has exacerbated soil erosion and mass
wastage, which further degrades their productive potential. These impacts are especially evident on
substrates such as mudstones.
Reversing these trends could be addressed by large-scale government efforts in soil conservation and
revegetation, but the likelihood of obtaining funding for such efforts is low. In any case, it is much
more reasonable to approach the problem from its causes rather than its symptoms. The causes are
based on the villagers' need for disposable cash, which they satisfy by increasing the numbers of
animals, fed in part by the free fodder in state forests. The approach to '>e problem could be partly
technical Cimprovement of pasture and fuelwood productivity) but must mainly depend upon changing
the attitudes of the villagers to the management of their local resources so that they understand the
rudiments of maintaining the balance of sustainability of the resources. At present they are not fully
aware of the implications for them of resource degradation. Only when they have a personal and
identifiable stake in the state of the resources will they fully appreciate their dependence upon them.
Even if they are aware of resource degradation, and appreciate their dependence, they are probably
unable to avoid continuing degradation of the resources given their poverty.
The legal basis for the involvement of the State in pasture management near villages iss Law On the
Pastures and Meadows (No. 7917 dated 13 April 1995). Pasures and meadows are defined as all
lands covered by grass or shrubs which are not part of the forest estate nor are agricultural lands.
They may be "Ste        pastures" (to be managed by the DGFP), 'pastures given for general use'
(to be managed by local authorities) and 'private pastures' (on private land). Individuals can obtain
Albania Foresny Enwironmwnua Awsscmwz
page 69



the rights to graze animals under 'contrac=s of up to 10 years with State pasture enterprises or local
authorities. 'Me major innovation of the Law is the decentralization of management of some pastures
to local authorities. The pastures remain under their full control, and permissive usufruct rights are
granted. Under these conditions, the involvement of the local populations will remain low.
Unpopular measures imposed by the authorities (such as reduction in animal numbers, closure of
some areas, imposition of grazing fees) will be respected only if understood and agreed to by the
concerned villagers. Understanding and agreement will be gained only if the villagers are (i)
involved in the processes of planning resource management, and (ii) fully agree upon the proposed
measures because they believe they will personally gain some benefits from them. There are some
traditional systems of pasture management which could serve as the basis for such types of
understandings. The technical measures by which pasture and shrub productivity can be improved
are necessary but not sufficient, because any gains will not be sustained unless the managemnent
problems which led to the original degradation are corrected.
Because villagers are involved in various forms of grazing, agriculture and forestry, the difficult task
is to provide for integrated managemen, and avoiding conflicting uses of the same iand. The current
law does not prescribe methods for achieving this through participatory involvement of villagers.
Also, without full involvement of villagers, and unless they are consulted and agree on measures to
be taken, they are unlikely to cooperate in the prosecution of violators and the imposition and
collection of fines for infractions of the law is unlikely. The best solutions to the problems of
uillegal- grazing, and forest harvesting for roundwood and fuelwood, lie in the general alleviation
of poverty and the probable consequent increase in respect for the law.
The communal forest and pasture management component involves implementation of a pilot project
in three selected communes in Central Albania; development of improved manag_ment and
investment plans for areas of State forests and pastures that would be transferred to communes;
funding of selected commrunal investment projects (up to $40,000 each) in restoration of degraded
areas and pasture improvement, planting of fodder and fuel wood trees, and fencing for protection
and rehabilitation of highly degraded coppice and shrub forests; and establishment of a data base on
conununally managed forests and pastures, and preparation of studies on the production and
marketing potential for non-timber forest products.
The issues in ObotDm-upu management of pastures, coppice forests and high forests are discussed
in the chapter on Participatory Management, and are briefly re-stated here as follows:
*       Can the villagers appreciate the base causes of their problems, and thus become willing
to participate in working towards some solutions?
*       What benefits will individual villagers believe they will gain from such involvement?
*       What practical and sustainable technical solutions within the village social contexts are
available to what technical problems?
*       Will the solutions be adoptable by the villagers?
*       Will the solutions be replicable in other villages?
Albania Foremy EnviroDDneIU  Arnsnsc
page 70



       Will the solutions be sustainable, satisfying social, economic and environmental criteria?
To begin to answer some of these questions, a conmuunal pilot project was started in August 1994
with project preparation funds. The following tasks have been accomplished under the pilot project:
(i) a methodology for participatory management of communal forest and pasture areas has been
prepared; (ii) a questionnaire has been sent to 250 candidate Communes for later analysis of results
and selection of participating Communes; (iii) three Commnunes near Elbasan have started pilot
activities, particularly data collection and mapping; and (iv) silvo-pastoral commissions have been
established in these three Conmmunes.
With respect to the existing conditions, it is clear that:
i)      The resources of Zodder and fuelwood near villages have degraded in quantity and
quality under the pressure of exploitation by villagers for fuelwood and for cash derived
from anirnal husbandry;
u)     these processes have led to enviromnental impacts on !te sustainability of the resources

9.2 IMAcr ANALYSIS AND MIGATIoN MEASURES
Impat 18:  Restoration of degraded ecosystems and beneficial impacts on water quanfities
and qualities and biodiversity
The pilot communal forestry projects will introduce new tools or identifying and solving problems
in communal resource management, including a simple GIS system for examining patterns of
communal resources and teaching villagers how to manage them.
The activities under the communal forestry and pasture component of the project will have beneficial
environmental impacts, tirough reduced erosion, restoration of degraded ecosystems, and imnproved
operation of rural irrigation systems and hydraulic structures. These improvements may also
translate into improved conditions for biodiversity. Because the activities under the project cover
only a few communes and a small area of land, the direct beneficial impacts will be limited. There
is substantial opporunity, however, for indirect beneficial impacts of a wider scope if the approaches
to land and resource management developed under the project are underaen by other vilages.
Application of fertilizer to pshr will add incremental nitrates to soils and streams, but owing to
the limnited and restricted application, the impact would be minor.

Midgati.o Measure: No mitigation is needed
Impact 19:  Improved economic conditions for illagers through increases in production of
milk, meat, fuelwood and roundwood
Improved management of the conununal resources is expected to lead to economic and social benefits
to the participating communes and villages. These will include improved cash inputs and cashflow
in villages, wi:h improved savings and local investment: and improved self-reliance and initiative.
Improved management of communal pasture lands and forests are expected to increase yields of
fodder, estimated at 80% for 10 years from 'improved pasture lands", by 110% for 10 years after
the fifth year from fodder trees n plantations", by 150% for 10 years after the fifth year from
'fodder tree plantations in shrubs", and by 100% for 7 years after the third year from "coppice
rehabilitation'. Consequent increases in stocking rates, and milk and meat production, are
forecasted.  Increases in fuelwood are forecasted from  coppice rehabilitation (by 3 cubic
meters/halyr), and in roundwood from afforestation on plains, hi:ls and mountains.
Other direct benefits include higher fuelwood production, more efficient fuelwood use and possibly
lesser fuelwood demands, decreased demands for illegally obtained fuelwood and thus better State
forests; improved quantiies and qualities of fodder of many types, and thus much better animal
husbandry with higher animal growth rates, higher productivity and higher cash reurns; more shade
for aninals, thereby improving growth rates; improvement of soil fertility and soil physical and
biological status; improved crops through agroforestry techniques with nitrogen-fixing species; and
decreased soil erosion.
Alhough the economic impacts are beneficial or favorable for the individual villagers and the
commune, the villagers may not perceive that ese incomes would accrue soon enough for them to
regard it as worthwhile to be involved. If this occurs, the social and economic benefits of this
component wvil remain positive, but may not be maximized. 'he magnitude of beneficial impacts
will depend on villager participation in integrated natural resource management, particularly in
grazing managenme"t of pastures.
Reversing the current overharvesting and ovcrgrazing of communal forests and pastures these trends
should be approached by addressing the causes rather than the symptoms. The causes are based on
the villagers' need for disposable cash, which they satisfy by increasing the numbers of runinants
utilizing the free fodder on state forests. The approach to the problem could be technical (improving
pasture and fuelwood productivity), but must mainly depend on changing the attitudes and
involvement of the villagers to the management of their local resources by helping them to
understand how thqy have penal aWaditfiable stakes in sustainable resource managemenL
An understanding of the magnitide of the benefits achieved under the project can be obtained only
in the long term, but prelimnaty indications will be obtained from the pilot project in the 30
communes. Already, the communes have participated in collecting data and making administrative
arrangements for the project. It is less certain whether the villagers are committed to the project,
and unless this occurs, there will not be much interest in the preparation, approval, and
inplementation of the grazing management plans. In this connection, it is unlikely that villagers will
Alania Foresny Envronmal Assnsmem
page 72



be personally comnitted to preparing *10-year silvo-pastoral management plans' at the start of the
project until they are convinced that this will be in their interest. Experience in other community
forestry projects strongly suggests that this takes a long time, and depends upon prior success in
generating trust and raising awareness about participatory resource management.
The economic and social benefits of the communal forestry project depend on participation of
villagers in the pilot projects, and on whether project activities will continue to be implemented after
the project funds are disbursed. If project activities are diminished or discontinued after the project,
the beneficial social and economic environmental impacts will not be fully realized. If an anticipated
environmental benefit is "an increased capacity for participatory resource managementm - from which
should flow tangible improvements in local management of fiuelwood and fodder resources - then the
extent to which the project methodologies capture the interest of the villagers must have an important
impact upon the ultimate environmental impacts of the component.
Mitigation Measures: No mitigation is needed
9.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF IPACTS AFTER IMPLNENTATION OF MITIGATION MEASURES
The proposed interventions under the project, although limited ir. scope, will have positive
environmental impacts on soils and plant comununities in the short-term. No mitigation measures
are needed. The long-term sustinability of these environmental benefits will depend on successful
consensus-building anong villagers.

10.0 BloDrVERSrrY
10.1 EX=TG CoNDmTIoNs
This chapter is based on an ecological survey conducted by Habili et al (1995) on 34 forest areas
comprising 68,141 hectares and another 5 forest areas previously proposed as National Parks,
covering 16,700 ha.
Flora and Vegetation
There are approximately 3,300 plant species in Albania, representing 30 percent of the l1,000
species known from Europe. Considering that the surface area is much smaller than 30 percent of
Europe's, Albania's flora is relatively rich. This richness is thought to be the result of its
geographical position within Europe and the Balkan Peninsula, and its varied topography and climate.
The Albanian flora shows high levels of endemism, both within Albania and the Balkan Peninsula.
About 450 (15 percent) of the Albanian plant species are found only on the Balkan Peninsula: 180
species are sub-endemic to Albania, former Yugoslavia, and Greece, and 30 species are endemic to
Albania. The flora of Albania is considered a national, economic, and scientific asset. Many of the
species have inportant medicinal, industrial, alunentary, and decorative uses, and are therefore of
economic value as well. The flora has scientific values for determining the origin and links of the
Albanian flora with the flora of neighboring countries.
Due to the level of development in Albania, and the development of a market economy that can be
expected to further impact the nation's flora, the Red Book of Albanian plants was prepared by the
botanists at the Institue of Biological Research and the University of Tirana. This effort was
important for understanding the curreat conditions of the natural ecosystems, trends in the ecosystzems
and individual plant species, and to define ecosystems and species at are endangered or threatened,
and those that are rare and could reasonably be expected to be threatened or endangered in the fure
as a consequence of human activities.
The forest vegetation of Albania has bee. classified in the .ollowing major classes:
Class Abw-Popu:letea. This class includes flood-plain forests along the downstream and outfall
of rivers and along coasal lagoons and lakes. The vertical structure of these plant conmnunities
is composed of three layers, and have a characteristic fauna.
erdrtaneanpineforests. The dominant species of tihis formation are Finus halpwensf and Phw=
puzea. These are pioneer forests that function in improving the quality of coastal sandy soils.
Cazss Querceaea ici&. This cbss is represented by low evergreen, non-deciduous forests, and is
composed of two alliances: Oko-ceraionion and Quercion iL;cis. The Quercion iUcis alliance is
found in the eumediterranean region of the Albanian coastal zone and is replaced by the Oko-
ceraonion alliance in dry rocky areas of this region.
Abania Formy Eironmemal Asssmem
page 74



Class Querceea pubercenus. This class includes a heterogeneous mix of various species of oak,
black pine (Pns nigra), Macedonian fir, and hornbeam, forming different plant communities on
different soil types. W;thin this class is order Quercetala pubercenis and its two alliances:
Osrryo-Carpuwon orieneas and Quercionfraineno.
Class Querco-Fageiea. This is the formation of deciduous forests on fertile soils, of alkaline,
neutral, or slightly acid Ph and distinguished by high biological activity. It is widely distributed
throughout the country, but is concentrated in northern and central Albania above the oak forest
line. This class includes two orders: Carpimedara and Fagetala.
Class Quercetea robori-pegrecae. This represents the formation of dxciduous forests occurring
or. acid soils and silicious and decalcified terrains. In Albania, this class is mostly represented
by chestnut (Casranea sadva) forests.
CZass Erico-Pinerea. This is represented by xerophylic forests on limestone or dolomite, rarely
on serpentinous terrains. The main pine trees of this formation are Pinus sylvesi and P.
leudcod errmu.
The vegetation of the forest units of the forestry project are largely within the Querco-Fagetea and
Erico-Pineea classes, which are the most comnmon forest formations in Albania.
THiEATENED AD RARE PLANTS OF ALBNIA
There are about 320 dtratned and rare plant species in Albania, representing nearly 10 percent of
the Albanian flora. Four species that fonmerly occurred in Albania are now extinct and another 12
species are expected to become extinct in the near future. In general, species have been and are
being thratened with extinction due to damage to their habitat as a result of developnut, forest
operations, agriculture, draining of wetlands, and associated impacts.
Albanian endemic plants include paleoendemics and neoendemics.  Although all species are
evolutionarily distinct from one another, paleoendemics are more distinct from their living relatives
than are neoendemics. Because of this higher level of distinctiveness, and because they possibly
represent the last survivors of a unique evolutionary lineage, paleoendemics are of highest
conservation value and scientific importance. The paleoendemics of Albania are Wiffenfa baklaccil,
Gymnwspermiwn shqedriw, Forsythia europaea, and Ajuga piskoi. Most of tde Albanian
endeniics are neoendemics, and many of these (e.g., Lunaria tlekkaw, Peasites doeaferi, and
Ligusciaon albanicum), occur in the mountains of northem and northeastem Albania.
Fauna
Mhe fauna of Albania, especially its terrestrial vertebrates, is not as well known as the flora, and
more research is needed on tese groups. The vertebrates show a peninsular effect, with a larger
number of species in northern Albanian than in southern Albania. Northern Albania shares floral
and faunal species groups with central Europe whereas southern Albania shows a greater contribution
of Mediterranean species.
Abania Foresty Enviromemd Assmem
pag  75



Mainmjli: 81 terrestrial mamnals are expected to occur in Albania, with 63 species recorded to
date. There are two subendemic species. 58 species are more or less closely associated with
forest habitats, 27 of which are Strictly Protected Species. Inventories of large mammals show
wide variation in the distribution and abundance of bear, boar, deer, fox, wolf, and chamois
(mountain goat). Forests of moderate to high importance are generally among those recommended
for Protected Area status, or are in forests without access roads. Forests without access roads are
recommended to be removed from consideration for forest interventions under the forestry project.
Dir: There are 305 birds species in Albania. 60 species are more or less closely associated with
forest habitats, 43 of which are special taxa. These special taxa are considered declining in
numbers elsewhere in Europe, but may show stable populations in Albania. The highest levels
of bird diversity are known from those districts having different types of forest (ie, broadleaf and
conifer).
AmpDhibians ar.J Reptiles: Albania possesses 15 amphibian species (9 special taxa) and 37 reptiles
(lo special taxa). None of these are found only in Albania; 1 species occurs only in Albania and
its surrounding countries; 11 species occur only in the Balkans.
Butterflies and Moths: 877 species occur in Albania, 142 of which are closely linked with forest
habitats. None of these are found only in Albania; 11 species occur only in the Balkans. 43
species are included on the Red List of Albanian macrolepidopterans. Several areas (Livadhi
Harushes, Lura, Qarrishta, Shelegura, and Dhrovjan) are identified as centers of Macrolepidoptera
biodiversity. Different levels of protected area status for each of these except Livadhi Harushes
are were recommended by Habili et al (1995).
10.2 LIPACT ANALYSIS AND MmGAToN MEAsuRES
Issue 20: Incomplete data on species and habitats in rarest units of the project
The ecological survey (Habili et al, 1995) provides a good sumunary of the biodiversity of Albania.
In general, the flora of Albania is well known and there are substantial data available for butterflies
and certain vertebrates (e.g., amphibians and reptiles). However, there has historically been limited
research on the birds and mammals of Albania. The information on the distribution and abundance
of large vertebrates (e.g., wolf, bear, lynx, and chamois) is limited and largely out of date.
Moreover, there is only a single university expert within the country who is working to fill this gap
in knowledge on Albanian biodiversity, and funds have dwindled for the annual censuses of large
vertebrates (wolf, bear, chamois) and smaller game species (hare and various fowl) that were
traditionally conducted by the DGFP andlor FPRI. While the forest engineers at the district and
forest unit levels possess general skills in censusing game animals, it is reconunended that
professional development and taining be given under the project in the design and implementation
of vertebrate censusing.
The ecological survey (Habili et al, 1995) focused on three groups of forests identified in the
proposed Intgrated Forest Management project (FAO/World Bank, 1994): 20 forests (52,000 ha)
that are without access roads, 14 forests (15,572 ha) with access roads, and 5 forest areas (16,700
ha) that were previously proposed as National Parks. Of the 47 forest units currently being
considered for road rehabilitation and thinning operations under the project, 22 were either
ALbani Foresmy Enviunmematat Auamem
page 76



investigated in the ecological survey or are adjacent to forest units that were investigated in the
ecological survey, and all of the forest units in the same districts.
The floral and faunal studies that will be conducted during preparation of the forest management
plans will provide some of the data needed to incorporate biodiversity conservation into forest
management. For example, the field studies for the forest management plans will identify important
biodiversity components of the forest unit and recommend how their conservation can be integrated
into management of the forest unit. This task will be feasible for some elements, such as threatened
and endangered plant species, special stands ot trees, snags (i.e., dead, upright trees) that provide
important nesting habitat for sensitive bird species, and other sensitive plant communities. For
speJies such as bear, wolf, lynx, and chamois, large-scale studies are needed as a basis for long-term
conservation efforts. These large scale studies are beyond the scope of the field studies that will be
undertaken to update the forest management plans, and will not be funded under the project. The
DGFP, Museum of Natual Sciences, and the Faculty of Natural Sciences should work together in
contacting bilateral granting and other intenational organizations to obain funding and technical
assistance for the necessary studies.
Mitigation Measure:
20.1    Field studies of flora and fauna sinilar to those conducted for the ecoiogical survey for
the updated forest management plans and the ELAs for forest operations shall be
conducted by specialists from the EBR and the MNS.
20.2    Foreign technical assistance from IUCN or another qualified contractor shall be provideci
under the project to provide professional development and training for site-specific and
regional biodiversity analyses and planning to appropriate staff of the DGFP. FPRI, to
the PEMU, and to specialists from the MNS and IBR.
Impact 21: Direct and indirect impacts of forest thinning and harvesting on flora and fauua
Timber harvesting and other vegetation-altering activities change the character of the habitat and its
ability to provide for various species. These changes will be beneficial for some species and
detrimental for others. Populations such as roe deer benefit from increased forage produced in
harvested forest units whereas species dependent on mature or old growth forest may decline.
Cavity-nesting species are further impacted by the removal of snags and hollow trees.
Two principal concerns are:
I)      Species that are dependent on specialized habitat conditions such as cavity nesting bird
species or that require a particular seral stage such old growth. There are a number of
species that are associated with old growth beech and pine forc.ts that would be
impacted by forestry operations in such areas. This includes woodpeckers, and other
cavity nesting birds, bats, and arboreal rodents. Most of the old growth forests are
found in inaccessible areas without roads. No road building or other forestry operations
(except possibly the preparaton of forest management plans) would occur in these areas
during the project. During this period, it will be necessary for the GOA to better

management of these wild areas and their unique habitat. The Forest and Pasture Sector
Strategy is expected to address the inventory, conservation, and managemrent of Albanian
old growth forests.
is)     Threatened and endangered species. Albanian botanists possess a good understanding
of threatened and endangered plant species. The majority of sensitive plants of the high
forest areas are grasses, herbs, and shrubs that would benefit from forestry operations
because they reach their greatest abundance in open forests and meadows. A number
of other species, including species such as the nearly extinct yew tree (Taxus baccara)
would potentially be adversely impacted by forestry operations. The floral studies that
would be conducted in the course of updating the forest management plans and in the
ELAs for forest operations will locate populations of sensitive species that can be
conserved through avoidance.
The distribution and abundance of the wildlife of Albania, especially the birds and mammals, are not
well known. Field studies of these taxa are especially important in the preparation of the forest
management plans and ElAs. Table 4 summarizes the numbers of wildlife species of the Albania
high forest that are associated to a greater or lesser degree with forest habitats.

Thinning of young, dense forest stands as proposed under the project would result in changes in
beech and pine forest habitat The stands to be thinned are dense young ( < 15 years) stands, with
up to 200,000 stems per hectare. Currently, these dense young stands have virtually no shrubs and
herbs in the trnderstory, and provide limited wildlife habitat. Thinning the stands will allow light
to penetrte the understory and increase habitat diversity. Harvesting of the stands would begin from
60 to 80 years in the future.
Tumber harvesting operations would have potentially significant impacts on sensitive wildlife species
associated with forest habitats of the project region. The sensitive mammal species are four large
mammals (bear, wolf, lynx, wildcat) and 14 species of bats. The sensitive birds include 8 raptoral
species (hwks and owls), hazel grouse, capercaille, 6 species of woodpeckes, and 27 passeriforms.
The sensitive reptiles and amphibians are comprised of 7 amphibians (largely frogs), 3 lizards, and

9 species of snakes. The sensitive but..,rflics arc species that are associated with forest habitats, but
whose abundance is largely determi.hed by the availability of shrub and herbaceous vegetation. The
poor understanding of the vertebrate fauna of Albania is one of the principle reasons for exduding
forestry operations in the old-growth stands of those forest units without access roads (Habili et al,
1995).

Impact 22:   Impact of road rebabilitation activities on soils, habitats, and species
No new roads will be constructed under the project The rehabilitation of about 350 km of roads
is expected to consist of snall-scale operations confined to regrading, filling of potholes, and
correction of drainage problems responsible for erosion of road surfaces.
The direct impact of road rehabilitation of existing roads on biodiversity would be small. The
potential irnpacts of the indirect effects are difficult to estimate with the available information.
Indirect impacts of road rehabilitation include: 1) lead to wider and heavier harvesting operations by
privat. logging companies, and to an increase in illegal harvesting, and 2) improved access for local
villagers, hunters, and other visitors, thereby increasing disturbance and removal of wild flora and
fauna, and potentially to increased goat and sheep grazing.
Such measures are needed to min=nize the adverse impacts of illegal harvesting and uncontrolled
public access in forests, including tourism, recreational hunting, and pasturing/grazing activities.
Mitigation Measure:
22.1     Road Tehabilitation activities shall be undertaken only after implementation of the action
plan for controlling illegal harvesting, after completion of the road rehabilitation

proposed activities
10.3 SIGNIGICANCE OF IMPACTS AFFER IMNIEMNTATION OF MMGATION MEASURES
Forestry operations have potentially significant impacts on wildlife. Recommendations on expanding
the protected areas of Albanian high forests and mitigating the impacts of forestry operations were
made in the ecological survey (Habili et al, 1995) and have been incorporated into this environmental
assessment Additional mitigations that remove forest units without access roads from forestry
operations and requirements that floral and faunal surveys by qualified Albanian specialists be
prepared for the updated forest management plans and ELAs will assist in mitigating the impacts of
individual road rehabilitation and thinning activities funded under the ?roject.
Timber management of Albanian high forests will have a potentially significant impact on biological
diversity. This was recognized in the ecological survey, and resulted in significant changes in the
project design. Changes in the forestry project in response to significant biodiversity impacts,
especially removal of roadless forest units with old growth forests from the project and the current
emphasis on intensified management of forest units where harvesting operations are alrady
underway, will potentially mitigate the project's most serious impacts on biodiversity to a less than
significant level.

I 1.0 SUSrANABLE FoRYsmy
Sustainable development is broadly defuned as economic growth that benefits present and future
generations without adversely affecting bio:ogical and other natural resources. Sustainable forestry
is forest managemrent that benefits present and future generations, without the loss of ecological
processes, species, and genetic diversity. For the Albania forestry project, the issue of sustainability
intersects social and natural resource issues, but the more imrediate needs are for the sustainability
of the latter.
Based on the forest managemnent plans, which are largely out of date, Albania was apparently
practicing sustainable forestry as recently as 1992, at least from the standpoint of wood harvesting.
At that time, the annual allowable cut (AAC) for Albania's 1,031,000 ha of forest land was estimated
at 1,520,000 ni3: 747,000 in of timber and 773,000 m3 of fuelwood. Under the previous
government, the annual harvest was more than twice the AAC. Since the fall of communism, the
annual cutting level has reportedly fallen to only 200,000 m3. DGFPIFPRI estiates are that legal
and illegal harvesting in 1994 totaled 379,000 n3 (24.9% of AAC), comprised of 142,000 n3 of
timber (37.4%) and 237,000 n3 (62.6%) of fuelwood. These figures are well below the AAC, just
19% for timber and 31% for fuelwood. Provided these figures are good estimates of both legal and
illegal harvesting, the AAC was not exceeded in 1994. The iiitensity of illegal hzzvesting is
considered to be high in 1995, but reliable estimates of the volumes involved are not available.
Legl and institutional capacity for sustainable forestry
A Commission for the Study and Evaluation of Forest Projects? has been established to evaluate large
forest roads projects from the production, sustainability and environment standpoints. Under the
project this Commission will likely address rehabilitation of roads and forests for second and third
cuttings. Currently, the Commission tends to favor production over enviromnent concerns, yet one
former forestry professor cited examples where the environment has been the leading concern
resulting in ruling out certain projects.
Albanian laws and institutions support a general policy of sustainable forestry, as evidenced by the
following:

Illegal harvesting is currently a major problem that challenges the ability of the DGFP and FPRI to
implement sustainable harvestizag. This, together with the large backlog in updating the forest
management plans, indicates some institutional wealnesses in Albanian forestry. However, these
weaknesses may be largely attributed to economic difficulties being experienced during the country's
transition to democracy.
Areas for improvement in sustainable forestry
The foundation for sustainable forestry is in place in Albania, but improvements are needed in some
specific areas, as follows:
Optimization of non-wood products and values. Currently, forestry in Albania emphasizes
sustainability of wood products rather than a full range of natural and biological resources. The
change to valuing non-timber forest resources will be facilitated by governmental and non-
governmental organizations and individuals seeking to utilize a broader range of resources in the
Albanian high forest region. Non-wood products should be addressed as a separate chapter of the
forest management plans dth are updated under the project, as outlined in the recommendations
on guidelines for forest management plans found in Appendix 1.
Red1ction of total wuod harvest 21egal and illegal) to kvels at or below the AAC. The problen
of illegal harvesting is a potential obstacle to sustainable forestry in Albania. Achieving
sustainability and improving the accuracy of fte AAC estimates, and preventing illegal harvesting
are central goals of the forestry project.
Increasedresourcesdediaedtomnplementingsustainableforestrypracices: Currently, theDGFP
and FPRI lack the resources (financial and human resources and equipment) to achieve sustinable
forestry objectives. The forest service is apparently unable to control illegal logging, or to
provide effective management of protected areas. The project will help to address these
weaanesses in forest administration by providing training and transportation and communication
equipment
Need for Approved Med for CalulatngA MEC  The annual allowable cut is calculated based
on net annual growth and represents the maximum annual harvest from the state forest fund.
However, it is uncertain whether the AAC estimate is limited to stands identified for wood
Albana Foamy Enwnronema AssMsme

production. It appears that the AAC may include growth from stands that are accorded protection
(i.e., stands recognized by the forest management plans as occurring on slopes too steep for
logging), and may include other stands not appropriate for inclusion in the AAC calculation.
Appropriate methods for estimating the AAC for Albanian high forests will be developed for the
forest management plans that are to be updated under the project.
Major inprovements in forest managementepanrwzg: Forest management planning in Albania has
not been undertaken in recent years with a clear understanding of sustainability issues. Because
of their concentration on wood production, the sustainability of other forest roles and
characteristics has not received due attention. The planning process itself has not been sustainable
in recent fuiancial circumstances. The project will improve the quality of forest management
plans, including attention to sustainable management of many forest attributes.
Achieving sustainable forestry wiU require developing public involvement. Natural resource
management in Albania is based largely on  technical skills, and lacks a meaningful public
participation component. To correct this, an outreach effort is needed to inform people about the
value and potential of their natural resources and to solicit their attitudes about its management.
Public opinion can be expected to develop naturally over time as Albanians realize increased
opportunities to utilize their natural resources for all purposes, including recreation.
Undersading offorest and pasture ecosystems: Forest engineers and adminustrators possess an
understanding of the high forest ecosystems thzt is necessary for the project. However, the same
cannot be said for the villagers, who will be expected to prepare grazing management plans and
participate in rehabilitation of their communal forest and pasture resources. The activities
proposed under the project will contribute to this understanding.
Coppice and shrubforests:. Coppice and shrub forests are being over-exploltd for animal fodder
and for fuelwood, as evidenced by the stunted and sparse stands, lack of successful coppicing, and
the soil erosion. The causes lie in the economic pressures on the villagers, coupled with their lack
of understanding of alternative management methods.
The project will undertake a series of activities designed to: (i) make technical improvements to
the Coppice and Shrub Forests; and Cii) improve the ability and the willingness of the villagers
to manage their local land resources in a more sustainable way. These interventions - both
technical and social - will cover only a small part of Albania, but it is hoped that they will serve
as models for wider replication. If the villagers are convinced of their usefulness, it is probable
that the social improvements will be sustainable and that these will lead to technical and
managerial improvements which will also be sustainable and replicable.
Soivs: Soils in the high forests are generally in good condition, and will remain so under the
project On the other hand, soils of the coppice and shrub forests and pastures are showing severe
erosion, compaction, and loss of topsoil. The project will demostrate methods of mitigating these
trends in a sample of 30 communes. The project is expected to have a beneficial impact on
communal forest and pasture soils. However, the area of the communes to receive assistance
under the project is limited, and the post-project success of applying successful techniques will
rest with the specialists of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture.

and quality.

12.0 PUBLIC PARnCIPAnoN IN FoREsr MANAGEmENT
Under the project, forest management will be decentralized by establishing technical units at the
prefect level, and by reducing district staffing and increasing staffing at the sector or lower level.
This decentralization policy is consistent with increasing participatory management in the forestry
sector. By decentralizing authority, opportunities increase for the public to be more involved with
forestry staff at different levels. At the samne time, the trend to decentralize is offset by procedures
that require all logging concerns throughout the country to be reviewed by a forestry commnission and
then to register and establish their credentials at the judicial court in Tirana.
Issue 23: Need for a progrm of public participation in the management of state forests and
pasti,s.
The previous mrethods used in forest planning and management in Albania have not included any
sig.I Incaint degree of public participation. Whatever the environmental impacts of forest management
mnight have been, they have not been mitigated by any opinions from the general public and
professional inputs from technical specialists separate from the professional foresters in the DGFP
and FPRI.
The effective implemntaion of natural resource laws and regulations requires on-going participation
by interested and responsible agencies, communities, and individuals. In general, individuals and
groups becom and renain involved if they benefit, or expect to benefit, from the time and work
they contribute. The benefits can include: pr=onal, giving a sense of satisfaction for having
contributed to the bettennent of fellow citizens; _rofessional. in the sense of a professional job which
has been well done; montr, in that individual households benefit directly through higher gross
incomes from higher agricultural production; securiM, in that long-term fears of poverty are relieved;
and cornm[nal, in the sense of an individual's contribution to the facilities and better functioning of
the community in which the household exists.
Natural resource planning and management are increasingly becoming 'top-down', with greaer
responsibilities taken by government bureaucracies and fewer taken by local rural commnunities.
While governmnent is expected to be responsible for management of its resources, this top-down
approach is not sufficient for susinable natural resource management
Top-down natural resource management by government agencies must be reconci!ed with bottom-up
forms of participatory integrated natural resource management if the degradation of the resources -
particularly the soils - is to be arrested and rehabilitated. Some useful guidelines about reconciliation
of these approaches are starting to eme.r from experience in many community forestry projects in
many countries. They are discussed below, and in Annex 3.
The major questions in top-down and bottom-up participatory management to, be resolved in the
forestry project are as follows (Each step in the sequence is dependent upon satisfaction of the
previous step):
1.        Does the Mjl exist at and below the highest levels of the Government to ensure that
adequate standards of environmental protection are used in all aspects of natural resource
management?
Albania Forestry EnWronmema A sem
page 86



2.        Do the appropriate policies exist for the effective implementation of this will?
3.        Have the appropriate laws and reugIations been formulated and passed for the effective
implementation of the policies?
4.        Have the appropriate institutions been created and staffed to implement the laws and
regulations? The instituions would have to include all levels of government, together
with Non-Government Organizations.
S.        If the institutions and agencies exist, do they have the appropriate and necessary
facilities and eauipment to carry out their assigned tasks?
6.        Assuming this, do the appropriate techniuues (for example; forest inventories, forest
management plans, grazing management plans) exist for the participatory management
of lands in an environmentally sensitive manner? Techniques must be appropriately
applicable at all levels of goverrnent.
7.        Assuming all the above, has the appropriate and necessary training been undertaken at
all levels in all agencies?
8.        Assuming all the above, are the types and phases of integrated and participatory
management undertaken and monitored to satisfy the specified levels of competence and
environmental responsibility?
9.        If not, what penalties are applicable for non-compliance?
The major questions in bottom-up participatory management to be addressed in the project are:
1.        Are villagers individually and collectively ready and willing to consider formulating and
articulating their concems to outsiders?
2.        If so, does a sufficient degree of social cohesion exist within the conmmunity, without
excessive inequities, to ensure that attempts by villagers and outsiders to elicit and
prioritize village concerns will be worthwhile?
3.        Is there a stable, effective and generally acoepted structure of village leaderhhin, both
elected and informal?
4.        Is there potential fQr village developnient and participatory inteerated natural resource
nianagement in and around the village?
5.        Assuning all the above, are villagers generally receptive to the concept of improvement
of their standards of living through individual and collective actions which will
ultimately also improve the integrated management of local natural resources?
6.        Having established all of the above pre-onditions, are relevant outsider organizations

improvement of natral resources through participatory management?
13.       Will villagers and outsiders (especially the community forester) effectively monitor

of relevant accepted Government policies, laws and regulations?
'he successful implementation of the project will require involvement of the public, which includes:
0() government institonal staff who have professional responsibilities for management of forests
and other naural resources; Cii) academic and scientific personnel with technical skills who could
contribute to management of these resources; (iii) interest groups and environmental NGOs, hunting

13.0 PRomwrED AREA NETIwoRK
Issue 24: Need for biodiversity strategy and its cordination with preparation of the forest
and pasture strteg
The ecological survey (Habili et al, 1995) of 39 forest units represents an important summary of the
biodiversity of the Albanian mountains. Various govermmental organizations (eg. the Committee for
Environmenal Protection) and non-governmental organizations (the PPNEA and ASPBM) are
beginning preparation of a National Strategy on Nature and Biodiversity Conservation (=Biodiversity
Strategy). This strategy is needed to extend the results of the ecological survey in identifying fte
native biological diversity and establish the goals and methods for its conservation and sustainable
use.
Although the Biodiversity Strt-egy is being prepared separately from the forestry project, it's
preparation shauld be coordinated closely with the Forest and Pasture Sector Strategy. If feasible,
meetings and public hearings for the two sategies should be held jointly.
Mitigation Measure:
24.1    The Biodiversity Strategy should be completed in year 2 of the forestry project, and
shall be coordinated with preparation of the Forest and Pasture Sector Stategy.   -
Issue 25: Adequacy of the existing protected area netvork and adoption of the
recommendations of the ecological survey
Currently, there are dtree categories of Protected Areas in Albania: forest National Parks (Category
11 according to IUCN), hurting reserves (IV category according to IUCN defiitions), and Nature
Monuments (HI category according to IUCN definitions). The total area in existing protected areas
is 140,000 hectares (ha), about 128,000 ha in forests and 12,000 ha in coastal wetlands and lagoons.
Of these 140,00D ha of exisdng protected areas, approximately 56,000 ha are in national parks and
hunting reserves and 84,000 ha in protected forests that are without official status but timber
harvesting and wood collecting is prohibited in them. The network of areas under formal protection
(i.e., as opposed to hunting areas and slopes too steep for forest operations) is limited in the number
of aras and their size. In addition to the need to create a functional and representative network of
protected areas, largely by increasing the numbers of categories and their numbers, progress must
be made on the management of these areas.
These issues were addressed in the ecological survey of 39 forest units (Habili et al, 1995), which
was prepared during preparation of the forestry project The purpose of the ecological survey was
to describe the biodiversity of 39 forest units with the aim of id ntifying biodiversity that is unique,
representative, and in need of protection as a result of rarity or threat from trends in exploitation,
particularly in the context of forest harvesting operations. A principal goal of the ecological survey
was to identify those forest units that merit some form of legal protection based on their biodiversity
value.
Abania Forestry EnWromnema A=lssme
page 89



Table 6 lists the protected areas recommended by the ecological survey (Habili et al, 1995), which
were prepared jointly by biologists and foresters from the Forest and Pasture Research Institute.
General Forestry Directorate, Institute for Biological Research, Museum of Natural Sciences, and
Faculty of Natural Sciences. The criteria for including all or pans of the forest areas as proteced
areas are:
1)      The presence of high biodiversity values: All of the areas recommended for protected
area status in Table 6 are characterized by high biodiversity values for the majority of
taxonomiic groups examined (plants, birds, mamnaIs, amphibians and reptiles, and
butterflies and moths);
ii)    the area's representativeness at the national or bioregional levels: The protected areas
recomne ded in Table 6 have distinctive biodiversity and contain forest conmnunities
that are representative of the Albanian bioregions in the project region. Additional
protected areas outside of the Albanian mountain region (e.g., in the coastal lowlands)
are likely to be reommended in the future;
ui)     the occurrence within the forest unit uf glcbally, nationally, or regionally dueatened
habitats and taxa: The ecological survey that provided the basis for the recommendation
in Table 6 focused on dutraeed forest communities, forest communities that represent
biodiversity values of their bioregion, and the importance of the community to
threaned and endangered plant and animals species. Insofar as the vertebrate fauna is
not well studied, additional protected areas may be proposed in the future as the fauna
of Albania is studied.
The reconumendations are derived from an understanding of the nature and importance of Albanian
biodiversity at various levels (regional, Balkan, national, and European). Special attention was paid
to the current and potential threats to the country's biodiversity and obstacles to its inventory,
conservation and management. At the same time, the recommendations are realistic insofar as they
consider the economic importance ,f on-going and improved forest management to Albania. Albania
is expected to affirm its commitments as signatory to international biodiversity conventions such as
the Rio Biodiversity Convention.
M-itigation Measure
25.1    The recommendations on protected areas from the ecological survey (Habili et al, 1995)
shall be approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food prior to negotiations of the
forestry loan.

14.0 ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS
14.1 No Project Altrative
Under the No Project altenative, the Albanian government and the DGFP would not receive the
loans and grants from the World Bank, the Italian and Swiss governments for forestry. As a result,
none of the forestry projects components as designed would be implemented. The DGFP and FPRI
would continue on their current course of forest and pasture management, which would include
efforts consistent with the project components, but at a much slower rate of implementation. The
forest ecosystems that are the focas of the project are currently in an unsatisfactory condition,
especially the coppice and shrub forests and pastures.
The No Project altenative is environmentally inferior to the proposed project The No Project
alternative would have adverse environmental consequences for sustainable forestry, participatory
forest management and protected areas management. Although the government is committed to
reversing problems with forest management discussed in this environmental assessment, without the
project, the DGFP is unlikely to be able to overcome the challenges, as due to its budgeary
problems. As a result, the opportunities for improving the sustainability of forestry and protected
areas management in Albania will be slowed, as will ongoing efforts to control illegal logging.
The No Project alternative may be acceptable in the short-term - according to the DGFP, sustainable
forestry is being practiced at least from a harvesting perspecive - but it is not likely to be acceptable
fbr the medium to long-term. Some of the deficiencies in management have been attributable to
financial constraints, many of which will be mitigated by project activities. However, this in itself
would not guarantee sustainable management and the reversal of the trends in resource degradation
unless all the project components as designed can be implemented.
14.2 Reduced Intensity Project
Under a reduced intensity project, funding and activities would be reduced for all or a selected subset
of the project components. The rationale for examining a reduced intensity project is to analyze
whether reducing the intensity of a project with significant environmental impacts would reduce
environmental impacts to an acceptable level.
A reduction in project intensity would not confer environmental or economic benefits. This is
because the forestry project has been revised to incorporate the principal recommendations of the
ecological survey and environmental assessment. The project components considered in this analysis
of a reduced intensity project are as follows:
Intttoa Sregthening
This project component involves reorganization and strengthening cf the DGFP, support for taining,
education and research in forestry and pastures, and project management Strengthening forest
management in Albania is necessary for implementation of the project objectives of sustainable and
multiple use of the forest fund. There are no sigrificant imnpacts of this component, and reducing
its activities would have no environmental benefit

Improved Forest Management and Updating Forest Management Plans
The forest management component involvc, strengthening forest management and conservation
capacity, preparation of updated forest management plans; pre-commercial thinnings; and forest
protection. No major modifications of this component have been reconmmendea in this report
although various mitigation measures and monitoring methods have been recommended. This
component would have beneficial environmental impacts that would be reduced if the project was
modified.
Forest Roads Rehabilitation.
No major modifications of this component have been recommended in this report. Mitigation
measures and monitoring methods have been incorporated into the project, particularly with rwspect
to the forest harvesting which will be a consequence of improved access to forests after road
rehabilitation. The project itself will not directly assist forest harvesting activities, and this report
does not recommend tiat the project should be modified to do so. Reduction of this component
could adversely affect the economic viability of the project without providing substantial
environmeent benefits.
Commual Forest and Pasture Management
This environmental assessment recommends minor modifications to the activities of this component,
giving greater emphasis on the needs and participation of villagers. These modifications are based
on the argument ha tree planing, pasture improvement and grazing management are necessary, but
will not ensure sustainability in the long-term. Sustinable improvements will only be realized if the
villagers fjX have an opportunity to participate in exploring their needs and expectations, and
planning the development of their village, Aftgr which the interventions (which may but not
necessarily will include tree planting and pasture improvement) can be planned within an agreed
village resource management plan. This is especially important for grazing management plans.
which are the single-most effective method of improving enviromental conditions and trends, but
which are the most difficult change in land management to instue owing to their reliance on social
consensus. Community forestry projects in oher countries have demonstated that methods of
grazing management are difficult to change in most rual societies, and that sustainable changes
cannot be imposed by outsiders. They can only be institued after lengthy participatory planing,
after tust is generated between outsiders and villagers, after technical methods for improved grazing
management are demonsed, and after agreement is reached within the village on adoption of the
new methods of grazing management
Protected Areas Mansgement
This component involves strengthening of protected areas deparument of the DGFP and preparation
of a management plan for Lutra National Park that may be used as a model for other protected areas.
A reduction in this component would reduce its environmental benefits.

Annex 1. Forest Management Plan Guidelines
1.    Over the past 20 years, the Forest and Pasture Research Institute (FPII) has, with limited
resources, built up a useful system of basic information for forest management planning purposes.
The forest management plans (FMPs) are prepared for each forest management unit (or 'forest
economy') with an area of some 3000 ha in principle every ten years. These FMPs were, in the past
regune, supposed to serve as a direcive for forest management. However, there are many problems
with the implementation of the present planning system: (i) since about ten years ago, there were not
enough resources to update the FMPs; (ii) during the previous regime, the FMPs were typically
overruled by the central planning system, and there is ample evidence that the plans were not being
followed; (iii) there is a marked increase of illegal felling, which means that the FMPs could not be
followed; (iv) the planning process is not sufficiently multifunctional, which explicitly include local
forest knowledge, nature conservation and sociological aspects of forest management.
2.    The Forestry Project is expected to address these problems by: (i) providing DGFP and the
FPRI with trining and technical assistance to improve present forest management planning regarding
both the subsancet o0 FMP.- 2d he nethods to develoD FMPs; and Cii) funding a 5-year program
to develop new FMPs in 57 management units over 160,000 ha of high forests including the
development of one 'pilot FMP' over one management unit during the first year, and the
development of new FMPs over 40,000 ha per year during the subsequent 4 years of the project.
3.    Ihe new FMPs would be developed according to new gdeines which would (i) take fully
into account the non-wood economic aspects as well as ecological and social functions of the forests;
and (ii) spell out the steps and procedures to develop FMPs with the participation of the various
parters interested. Development and adoption of these new guidelines is a condition for IDA's
funding the FMP program.
Expected Guidelines
4.    The new FMP guidelines are expected to provide operational guidance to those who will
develop FMPs under the Forestry Project; and serve as a reference for those who review and or
decide about proposed FMPs, at the local, regional, and national levels. For the various steps of
the development of an FMP, and when necessary, the guidelines are expected to provide clear
indications on (i) the data to be collected, how, and by whom; (ii) the data to be provided in the
FMP documents, and under what format; (iii) the responsibilities of the different parties involved;
and Civ) the procedures to be followed within each step, and from one step to the other; and (v) a
timetable to go through the following steps:
* Assessing the Present Statu of the Management Uni. This step will assess the ecological
parameters and constrais including geology, topography, soils, waters, vegetation, and
wildlife, and the economic potential of the management unit including wood and non-wood
(i.e. mostly resources for grazing, medicinal plants, and game) resources. The guidelines
should provide the techical specifications of the surveys of ecological parameters (e.g.
reference to existing maps for soils, or data and sampling techniques for wildlife surveys)
and inventories of resources (e.g. data and sampling techniques to determine the volume of
wood and its growth, and the carrying capacity for small ruminants);
Albania Forauy EnWronmeneul Ascssmut
page 103



* Assessing the Present and Future Demand on the Management Unit. This step will assess
the demand on the resource in and the benefits from the management unit at the local (e.g.
demand for fuelwood, grazing, other non-wood products, or protection of local
infrastrucures froe  erosion), regional (e.g. demand for industrial tunber, recreation, or
protecion of infrastuctures from floods), and national (e.g. biodiversity protection or
tourism). The guidelines should provide clear guidance on the socio-iconomic survey of the
local population (parameters and collectiori methods), and standard format or checklist for
demand at the regional and national level;
* Evauat8ng Past Management of the Management Unit. This step will document past
management of the unit including management regulations under the previous FMP, actual
intrventions that took place under the latter with a focus on forest regeneration and
maintenance, assessment of per; lavesting and grazing for each compartment of the unit,
assessmaini of past hunting, and overall evaluation of recent evolution of forest resources;
* Detamining Managenent Objectves. Under this step, the guidelines should indicace the
criteria by which (i) the mix of production, protection, and recreation objectives will be
proposed for the management unit; and (ii) particuiar objectives will be assigned to each
compartment. These criteria are either technical (e.g. precipitations, type of soil, slope,
potential growth of forest stands, carrying capacity for game or livestock) or socio-economic
(e.g. demographic parameters, incone level). The guidelines should also indicate the
procedures, including the institutional arrangements, by which the objectives are determined
and agreed upon at the local, regional, and national levels (e.g. composition and modus
gusrndi of local commnissions, possible district level committees, and the national
comnmission under the DGFP);
* Preparing Draft FMPs. The guidelines should provide clear, simple, and realistic
indications on how to
determine the zoning of the management unit into areas with similar objectives (e.g.
criteria to determine production, protection, and recreational compartments and
working circles);
- determineplanned output (e.g. method to determine the annual allowable cut for each
working circle, based on site and stand composition and structuire; method to
determine allowable grazing; method to determine allowable hunting);
* present the program of activiies including surveillance and protection of protected
zones; natural regeneration and reforestation, and pasture improvement programs;
young and mature stands maintenance; forest protection measures; organization and
schedule for wood harvesdng, grazing and hunting; and planned maintenance and
establishment of econoluic and social infrastructures;
propose a ficialplan, with expected expenditures and income;
present the docamenas composing the FMP (e.g. general outline, format of the stand
register, type and scale of maps).
Abania Foresoy Enironmea AsscssE
page 104



The guidelines should also provide the echnical regueiJons for the implementation of FMPs
including (i) silvicultura  practices (e.g. species composition and snd densities for
reforestation, thinning schedule); (ii) harvesting practices (e.g. selection criteria and tech' ical
specifications of felling and skidding methods and operations; technical standards for forest
roads rehabilitation and construction); (iii) hunting practices (e.g. allowed methods to
approach game); and (iv) grazing practices (e.g. rotational grazing arrangements).
* Maing Decions and Adopting the FMP. At this stage, the guidelines should indicate
procederes for (i) securing agreement on the FMPs at the local level (e.g. modalities and
timetable to inform and explain proposed draft FMPs to local people, and to incorporate their
proposed changes); (ii) securing environmental acceptability of proposed draft FMPs (e.g.
modalities and timetable to carry out tie EIA funded under the project, standard rules of
consultation with NGOs); Ciii) revising the proposed draft FMP further to the previous
procedures (e.g. timetable); and Civ) approving the fmal revised FMP at the local, regional,
and national levels. (e.g. composition. nodus oerandi, and timetable of local commissions,
possible district level committees, and the national commission under the DGFP).
Modaitis to Prepare the Guidelines
5.    Draft guidelines are expected to be prepared before the end of 1996, in order to serve as be
the basis to implement the first FMP on a pilot management unit. Final guidelines are expected to
be produced at the end of that pilot operation to serve for the development of FMPs over the 56
managenent units where such FMPs are supposed to be funded by the project.
6.    Preparing the draft guidelines is the responsibility of the FPRI with the technical assistance
of specialized institutions in Italy - which FPRI staff are expected to visit in early 1996 - and of
one forest management specialist funded under the technical assistance program of the project.

Guidelines for Updated Forest Management Plans
Objective                                           Description
Develop goals of the FRPs
Identify the goals and    FRP to summarize the management goals and objectives for the forest
objectives of sustainable  unit, including supply and demand conditions for forcst r-sources and
forestry in Albania        opportunities for production and protection and proposed and probable
management practices such as planned timber sales, grazing, hunting,
collection of other non-wood products, and recreation. FMP also to
describe cutrent and desired future condition of the forest and
identification of the quantities of goods and services that are expected
to be produced or provided during plan implementation.
Involve the public in      The broad goals and policies of Albanian forestry developed for the
developing goals and       Foest and Pasture Sector Strategy, and formulated with public
objetives                  participation, are to be summarized in each forest management plan.
Involve the public in regions  The purpose for involving the public is to broaden the information
around the forest units    base for the FMPst ensure that the DGFP understands the needs,
concerns, and values of the public; inform the public of the DGFP's
plans and activities; and to provide for participation in the preparation
of tde ElAs.
Public meetings for individual forest management plans or for groups
of plans of neighboring forest units are to be held, and the results
_______                 recorded.
Use of an Interdisciplinary    FMPs to be prepared using an interdisciplinary team approach,
team for FMP preparation    including specialists in forest engineering, biology, soils and social
scienes. The team shall consider problems collectively, rather than
separately along the lines of their individual specialities. The
functions of the interdisciplinary team are to: assess the problems and
opportunities of resource use; obtain the public's views about possible
decisions; implement forest management with other responsible
geocics Va.e., CEP); develop the standards and requirements by which
forest management implementation will be monitored and evaluated;
and develop an associated EIA for the forest management plan.
Methods of Forest Mnagement and Harvesting
Eslablish sandards for     Anual growth yidds of forests to be based on data collected from
calculating annual growth    inventory plots in each forest unit, following current Albanian method
and annual allowable cut   for calculating total annual growth for forest unit (based on estimates
for individual parcels), and on existing tables.
Annual allowable cut and applies only to stands classified for timber
production, excluding stands with protection function (e.g., steep
slopes, adjoining water courses and water bodies) classified. The
annual allowable cut (AAC) is, in all cases, to be less than or equal to
the annual growth in each forest unit. Stands that are given protection
functions, including those on steep slopes and adjoining water courses
and water bodies as well as sites or areas designated for protection as
a rcsult of floral and faunal studies conducted during FMP
preparation, are to be excluded from growth estimates and AAC
calculations.

Prepare Albanian Code for    DGFP and FPRI to prepare the dmRft code drawing on existing codes,
Forest Hsrvcsting Practice    such as the FAO Model Code. The code is needed to cstablish
sutdardized methods of forest mensuration and management, and will
scrve as a benchmark for Albanian forestry and environmental
management to be updated at least once during project implementation
to incorporate the advances made under the forestry project.
Code is to review and incorporate current Albanian changes in harvest
plans according to erosion potential as function of geology, slope,
climate, and sensitivity to erosion under rgional climatic conditions
(with rainfall below 1,000 mmlyear in southern Albania and up to
4000 mm in northern montane forests).
Classification of mountain soils in the project region that is in curmet
use (grey-brown soils; brown soils, dark-grey, and alpine meadow
soils) to be modernized in accordance wit recent Albanian soil
surveys (Zdruli, 1995).
Pr       standards for road    Road rbabilitation standards for design, grade, and stream crossings
buDding acd rehabilitation  to be developed.
Inventory of forest resources
Inventory of forest resources  FMPs to contain results of inventories of timber, soils, water
resources, and flora and fauna, to include, but not be limited to: I)
timber resources; 2) hydrological cbaraeristics (e.g., total discharge,
peak and minimum flows) and other notable hydrologic features and
processes in the watershed (e.g., seeps, wetlands, groundwater
recharge); 3) determination of importance of watershed(s) in forest
unit for aquatic resources; 4) vegetation and list of plant species,
based on spring field surveys by qualified bfanists (from IBR); 5)
field studies of brds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, and
butterflies, based on springlsummer field surveys by qualified
.. ____________________    zoologists  (from   MNS).
Classification of production and protection functions
Social requirements         Detail the major human uses, including villages and communal rights.
If local industry rlies on forest products (e.g., furniture
manufacturing, pulp wood processing, etc.), describe them and
acrrentlprojected demands.
Soil conservation           Soils in each forest unit will be mapped and classified as being
suitable or unsuitable for timber management, based on the potential
for irmversible soil damage by mass wasting and erosion, and or due
to the low potential for regeneration following timber harvesting. In
general, soils of the high forest in the study area show low erosion.
Protection of strams,       Forest streams are to be classified according to their beneficial uses:
streambankcs, lakes,        domestic water supplies; important fisheries; small but perennial
wetlands, and other bodies    streams, and streams with intermittent flows. Protection standards
of water                     (e.g., buffers and slope stndards) to be deailed..

Annex 2. Recommendations oc Participatory Management
or Communal Forests and Pastures
Communal Forestry Component:
There are four types of public participation in forestry (Dargavel !I al., 1995). These included
participation by: (i) the general public; Cii) bureaucrats; (iii) interest groups; and (iv) the FMP team.
In the context of Communal Forest and Pasture Management, these become: (i) the general public
in the Commune, including the villagers themselves; (ii) the Commune administrators, CU inspectors
and the 'comnunity forester'; Ciii) the villagers themselves; and Civ) the villagers, CU staff and the
Commune administrators. It is clear that the villagers must be involved in almost every way,
especially as they are the people who are physically degrading the resources and must become the
people who are responsible for physically improving them.
The implementation arrangements outlined in para. 11 of Attachment 7 of the Aide-Memoire of July
1995 do not give much encouragement in this regard. Following selection of the 30 Communes,
only I of the 7 steps for implementation appears to recognize that villagers (users' groups) are
involved and have the overwhelming and vital stake in the outcome. While the nominated steps are
not completely 'top-down', they certainly appear to be rather "middle-down'. The emphasis seems
to lie on administrative and procedural maters, with litle attention to discovering the real needs and
real wishes of the villagers, and letting them (within guidelines) decide upon the interventions which
would be most useful for them. It is usually argued by those unwilling to let this process evolve in
a truly "bottom-up manner that i) it all takes far too much time and is too much trouble; Cii) that
villagers will inevitably act irresponsibly in respect to the use of available funds; and (iii) that the
end result will not be improved management of natural resources. In response, it can only be
strongly stated that increasing experience in many countries with these forms of village-level
participatory management is showing: (i) that the processes need not take much time if efficiently
organized, and are much less trouble thn doing the job badly; (ii) that villagers, once they
appreciate both their utter dependence upon their local resources for their imnproved economic staus
jn  the linkages between the possible interventions and the state of the resources, do not generally
act irresponsibly but utilise consensual planning and their traditional knowledge of resource
management; and  liii) that these processes will cerainly and ultumately improve resource
management. In any case, the situation could hardly be worse than at the present time under "top-
down' methodologies, so any improvement from new "bottom-up" methods must have, at the least,
relatively favorable social and ecological environmental impacts.
The mitigating methods proposed here for this component of the project therefore concentrate upon
improvements to the participatory methodology. As most of the adverse environmental impacts of
current management regimes are apparent on the common property (m practice, even if not in law)
of the pastures, coppice forests and shrub forests, it is relevant to list some broad policy
recommendatons for successful common property management (McKean and Ostrom, 1995):
-     user groups need the right to organize their activities, or at least a guarantee of no
interference;
-     the boundaries of the resource must be clear;
-     the criteria for membership in the group of eligible users must be clear;
-     users must have the right to modify their use rules over time;
Albana Forety Ei*mnal Ass_em
page 109



-     use rules must correspond to what the system can tolerate and should be environmentally
conservative tO allow a margin for error;
-     use rules need to be clear and easily enforceable;
-     infractions of use rules must be monitored and punished;
-     distribution of decision-making rights and use rights to cD-owners of the commons need not
be egalitarian, but must be viewed as 'fair';
-     inexpensive and rapid methods of resolving minor conflicts need to be devised; and
-     institutions for managing very large systems need to be layered, with considerable authority
devolved to small components.
All of these recommendations can and must be instituted at village level by the villagers themselves.
They - not the outsiders - know best what will suit them, and outsiders should advise but not impose.
The project component, as described in the available documents, does not appear to recognize most
of these matters within its implementation procedures. However, they (and many other aspects) must
be incorporated into the 'Operations Manual' which is being prepared. It is suggested that this
Manual will largely fail in mitigating adverse environmental impacts if it concentrates upon
administrative, procedural and technical matters and neglects the enornous importance of
encouraging a truly participatory approach to resource management In this way it will niitigate the
current reliance upon technical solutions to social problems: the technical solutions might succeed
in a limited manner in particular places, but will fail in sustainability, adoptability and replicability
unless and until the social problems are addressed first, using effective methodologies.
A model approach for mitigating these problems of community participation in village development
and natural resource management has been worked out through much trial and error in several
community forstry projects. Its airns are:
-     effective participatory implementation and maintenance of selected field interventions in
village developernt and natural resource management, which have been chosen by villagers
themselves using processes of participatory consultation and planning;
-     sustainable improvement of the standards of living of villagers, and sustainable improvement
of the state of local natural resources; and
-     imlnprovement of the relationships between government officers and villagers as a precrsor
to, and as a result of, joint consultation, Dlanning and implementation of field interventions.
Its essential pre-conditions include:
-     appointment of a 'community forester' whose sole responsibility is to become closely
in-'v-red in project planning and implementation with villagers;
-     a clear understanding by all participants of the mandate and budgetary limits of the project,
and rules to govern use of project inputs;
-     a clear understanding by all parit.pants of what benefits each will get out of his or her
involvement with the project, as there must be benefits of some kind of everybody; and
-     small amounts of money for income-generating activities which provide significant short-temn
benefits for villagers and thus engender trust between participants, and willtagness to become
involved and aware of the potential of participatory integrated natural resource management.
'Te steps in the process must be followed in this order.

1.    a partcipatory runl appraisda by small teams of villagers and outsiders which creates and
gathers new and existing data about the problems as perceived by the villagers;
2.    a 'problem census and probiem solving" procedure which is carried out in a strictly
defined way with vigorous vil;ager participation and minor involvement by outsiders, and
which gives a prioritized list of perceived problems and indications of possible solutions;
3.    development of a Vdilage Development Plan after joint consultations and planning based on
the previous steps, and based on a clear understanding of the project mandate, budgetary
limits and probable benefits, and which results in commitments to certain implementation and
maintenance activities;
4.    feasibility studies for each intervention, using experience gained from  any local
demonstrations of technical solutions, and which results in a small number of agreed
interventions which will be technically and economically feasible in that village and with
those villagers, and in relation to selected purposes; and
5.    based on the above commitnents, formnation of co-management parterships for project
implementation, using appropriate village-level committees formed by the villagers
themselves, appropriate sympathetic support by outsiders, an appropriate legal and regulatory
environment, and fbrmal and infornal contracts between partners.
During all these steps, the villagers themselves (with appropriate help) will start to understand the
linkages between selected activities and the state of the natural resources, which will help to
create the awareness of the ways in which their own standards of living are deeply dependent upon
the state of the local environmrents and the environmental impacts of their own activities.

Annex 3. Recommendations on Public Participation
1.    Introduction
Four aspects of public participation are important in relation to the project:
-     generation of initial public interest, followed by conversion of public interest into effective
public participation;
-     recognition of the types of individuals or groups who might become involved;
-     selection of individuals or groups for public participation in selected project components; and
-     the organization and guidance of selected formns of public participation to enhance forest
planning and management.
Currently, forest planning and management is done by the professional officers in the DGFP and
FPRI, with virtually no involvement of other bureaucrats, technical experts or members of the
public. Public participation in these activities is needed and could make very useful contributions,
but it must be organized and guided if it is to effectively assist forestry officers in their duties.
2.    Public Interest
-     Public interest is an essential precursor to public participation.
-     FPublic interest in some aspect of forest management can arise quickly, often generated
through the media, and forestry officers should detect this.
-     Public interest in forestry can be very emotional, lack scientific credibility and may not be
based on reliable facts.
-     Extremne views of a few critics of the forestry profession are often taken to represent the
views of the majority of the public. Foresters have to separate the extreme views of the
minority from the generally moderate majority attitudes.
-     Foresters have to convert the general interest of the majority of the public into genuine and
useful public participation. It is important to detect those elements of public interest which
represent valid public concerns and genuine interest in natural resource management, and to
channel them into genuine public participation which is useful for enhancing more effective
natunal resource management.
IThis can be started at both central and local levels by: informal and friendly contact with
individuals and groups, especially the environmental NGOs'; memnership of professional
foresters in these groups;and approaches to individuals and groups to ascertain their interest
in participating in helping with natural resource management.
Using the media (newspapers, magazines, TV, radio) to change extreme types of public
interest from conflict into useful types of public partidipation.

3.    Types of Public Participation by Individuals and Groups
The zeneral public
This group comprises many different types of people: villagers and village leaders; townspeople;
schoolchildren in villages, towns and cities; businessmen; administrators in Communes and
Prefectures; members of interest groups, sporting clubs, hunting groups and many others; academic
and scientific professionals; and politicians, policy-makers and other bureaucrats. Some people in
other countries might have an interest in forestry in Albania, because of the international importance
of its particular flora and fauna. All are likely to have many different interests in the outcomes of
any activities in forestry plnning and management. The persons and groups are to be found in
villages, large and small towns, cities and even outside Albania.
They can be used for:
-     generating interest in forestry among the pub;ic, especially with schoolchildren;
-     supplying data and information about forests;
-     supplying opinions;
-     expressing goodwill and cooperation;
-     detecting people who damage forests and forest values;
-     planting trees, clearing up rubbish in forest areas, and reporting fires.
Non-forestr bureaucrats
Within Albania, there are many persons and groups within the bureaucracy who have a legitimate
interest in forestry policies, planning and management, but who are not forestry professionals.
Examples are the CEP, Government policy-makers, the Commune Chairmen, and the Chairmen of
the Conunune Pasture Commissions. Some of these persons or groups might be required to evaluate,
authorize or implement forestry plans, so they should be kept progressively informed about forestry
planning and management
They can be used for:
-     their appreciation of forestry problems;
-     raising the political and administrative profile of forestry within the administration;
-     helping to create a political environment which is more sympathetic to forestry and will get
more resources for forestry;
-     smoothing the evaluation and approval processes for forestry plans through the bureaucratic
channels.
Albania Forestry Enwsnmeal Asssme

Technical specialists
The most helpful specialists in respect of forestry planning and management are likely to be found
in the Faculties of Natural Sciences, Forestry and Agriculture of Tirana University, the Institute of
Biological Sciences, and the Museum of Natural Sciences. All have considerable expertise in fauna
and flora surveys and assessment of other forest characteristics, and their participation in forest
planning and management would be invaluable.
They can be used for:
surveys, inventories and evaluations of flora, fauna, soils, social and economic conditions
in and around forest nanagement units;
external professional evaluations of forestry plans;
providing informed professional views about forest management and its impacts.
Interest Eroups
These include the 'environmental NGOs' such as the PPNEA, ASPBM, REC and many others.
They also include hunting and fishing groups, and possibly hiking, photography and other clubs
interested in using the forests for recreation. All are concerned about the state of the forests, and
have legitimate interests in participating in the processes of planning forest management. They
should be given ample opportunity to do so through the processes of public participation.
They can be used for:
-     surveys and inventories of forest characteristics and values;
-     external evaluations of forestry plans;
-     as opinion makers among the general public, especialy through the media;
-     as contributors of special interest demands during FMP plan preparation;
-     assistance in drafting laws and regulations.
,1hemei
The media include journalists in newspapers, magazines, TV and radio. It will become very
important in Albania for the forestry authorities to keep the media fully informed about forestry
problems and plans, as they can be particularly helpful in raising the awareness of the Albaran
people towards the state of their own environment This is especially important in combatting illegal
logging.
Note that it is very important for foresters to keep the media accurately and fully informed, as they
can misrepresent public opinion and facts if they are antagonized.
Albania Foresty Envurowaal Assnusew
page. 114



Tbey can be used for:
informed and accurate reporting of forestry maters;
-     generating public interest which can later be converted into public participation.
4.    Public Participation in Selected Project Components
Effective public participation can make valuable contributions to the following project components.
The aims of any public participation must be clearly understood by foresters before any extensive
involvement is undertaken. It is important to be clear about who is to be involved, and how they
will contribute.
Preparation of Forest ManUage=ent Plans
Public participation can assist by and through:
-     providing channels for groups within the public to express genuine interest in the processes
of FMP preparation;
-     giving opportunities for technical specialists to become directly involved in FMP preparation;
-     media interest and publicity about the general aspects of FMP preparation;
-     non-forestry bureaucrats who can assist the processes of FMP evaluation and approval;
-     interest groups, especially the "enviromnental NGOsU.
Conununal Forest and Pasture Management
Public participation can assist by and through:
-     the general public in the Conmmunes and villages;
-     Commune administrs, Conmmune Inspectors and the Commune Forester;
-     Participatory Rural Appraisals in the villages;
-     participatory Problem-Census and Problem-Solving exercises in villages;
contributing to the preparation of Village Resource Management Plans;
feasibility studies for proposed activities;
village decisions on commnon property management, especially grazing management plans;
co-management partneships for other natural resources;
Albania Foresmy EnrWomnl Amumes
page 115



-     continuous monitoring of communal forest and pasture management plans.
Protected Area Manaement
Public participation can assist by and through:
-     technical specialists drawing attention to mnagement problems;
-     the general public enforcing rules for protecting areas from damage;
-     hunters and other interest groups obeying rules and reporting infringements.
Illezal Loee ing
Public participation can assist by and through:
-     appeals to national pride in the Albanian environment and the conservation of its nataral
resources;
-     changing public moral attitudes and acceptance of illegal activities;
-     exerting pressure on legislators to change laws, regulations and penalties;
-     reporting of illegal activities, which assists detection and also helps tD assess the scope of the
problem;
-     patrolling forest areas;
-     publicizing illegal logging and identifying perpetrators.
S.    The Organization and Guidance of Public Participation
Intoducion
Public participation can only become an effective contributor to the planning and management of
selected project components if it is carefully organized and sensitively guided.
Personal Attitudes
-     Any attempts by professional foresters to encourage public participation must be done
carefully and with sensitive appreciation of personal attitudes.
Informality and avoidance of authoritarianism are essential.
TMe important principle is that irdividuals and groups within the public are generally
inttd  (and later involved) on a voluntary basis and in a spirit of goodwill. There is a
Albania Foreary Enwronmemal Assemem
page 116



high degree of altruism and goodwill which can easily be discouraged by excessive
bureaucracy and authoritarian attitudes.
-     An individual or group which is trated insensitively may change its attitude to public
participation rapidly from  willing voluntary assistance to mistrust, antagonism  and
obstruction. If this happens, it will have serious implications for the current ad the fuMtre
anempts to encourage public participation.
Funding
-     Public participation is generally a very low cost and effective way for the forestry agency to
gain useful information and opinions, but it is not entirely costless.
Before an agency commences any large programme of public participation it should estimate
the probable costs and make allowance for them in its budgets.
Availability of Time for Public Participation
The individuals and groups who are interested in public participation are normnally prepared
to spend considerable amounts of their own time, often at great personal inconvenience,
because they have a commitnent to the particular matter.
IThis should not be taken for granted by the agency. If the agency is going to rely upon some
individual or group to devote a great deal of time to participating in forestry planning and
management, it should have the good sense and the courtesy to request whether this would
be convenient to the persons concerned.
RewaTds
-      XThe participation of individuals or groups within the public is generally willingly and
voluntarily given, and payments are not normally expected from the agency which is
organizing the public participation.
-     However, the agency must ensure that the generosity of the individual or group in spending
considerable personal time and effort is not taken for granted.
-     Arrangements must be made by the agency to reimburse reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
if these expected, especially if the public group incurs heavy expenses for transport.
-     It is sometimes expected and arranged that honoraria are paid to groups ralher than to
individuals.
-     Other forms of public participation, such as the involvement of technical experts, may be
rewarded by the payment of periodic fees.
Abania Forcsty Enrlvio_n Arsesswew

Organization of Public Participation by a Lead Agency
Within the project, the lead agencies which will be using various forms of public participation to
assist forest planning and management will be the DGFP and the FPRI. If some form of public
participation has been decided upon, then it must be organized and guided if it is to be effective in
helping the agency to accomplish its tasks.
The following steps are necessary:
-     reach a clear understanding of the aims of the proposed exercise;
-     define the lead agency, and the persons within the agency who should take primary
responsibility for any major work in public participation;
-     obtain assurances of funding, if necessary;
-      imake informal contacts to ensure that some individuals or groups within the public are
interested in participating;
generate appropriate publicity about the activity, depending on its aims and proposed
participants;
-     mak,e appropriate arrangements about the venues of the activities, if they involve public
neetngs;
-     allocate tasks to staff of the lead agency in relation to members of the public;
-     m-.ake arrangements about rewards for participation, if any;
-     imipleiment, supervise and monitor the public participation, as necessary;
-     evaluate the activities and results, both during the activities and afterwards; and
-     arrange for another agency to evaluate the completed activities, if this will be helpful in
ensuring that the public participation has been useful, effective and reliable.
Further Public Participation
-     When an exercise in public participation, whether large or small, formal or informal, has
been completed its successes and failures should be evaluated by the lead agency.
-     Individuals and groups which have taken the time and trouble to become involved in public
participation for the inprovement of forestry planning and management should be i;anked.
-     lhe media should publicize the results of the activity.
-     Repeating the activities, and involving the same and other participants, should be considered.

Annex 4. Report on Public Meetings
Introduction
Two public meetings were held to ascertain and assess the reactions of the participants to the
proposed project, the Ecological Survey and the Environmental Assessment. The following is an
account of the meetings.
The First Public Meeting
Publicity
The first meeting was publicized by the CEP, which invited each of the following organizations to
send at least two or three representatives: DGFP, FPRI, Museum of Natural Sciences, Faculty of
Natural Sciences, Project Management Unit, the PPNEA and the Regional Environrent Centre. The
REC is an umbrella organization for NGOs, which was able to invite participants from its affiliated
organizations in Albania.
Backpound Materials
Each organization received in advance copies of an Albanian translation of the Aide-Memoire ofJuly
1995, in which the five components of the proposed project were outlined. Participants also received
an Albanian translation of the outline Table of Contents of the Environmental Assessment report.
PurWses of the First Public Meetins!
The purposes of the first public meeting were to provide a forum for wide discussion of the proposed
project as currently formulated, and to receive spontaneous comments from a varied group of
participants about the project components. It was not intended to lecture the participants about the
project, or to lkad their discussions, but to elicit unforced conunents on issues perceived as important
by them. The focus of the discussion was to be an examination of those details of the proposed
project itself which were of concern to the participants, from which comments about the
environmental impacts of the project would arise if the participants fek they were important.
Procedures at the First Public Meetine
The meeting was attended by 22 persons, with at least one person from most of the organizations
listed above. The neeting was co-
chaired by Mr Arben Pustina (CEP), Mr P. Brylski and Mr P. Stevens (FAO Investment Centre).
Other foreign observers included Mr E. Goetz (World Bank) and Mr D. Fanciullacci (Consultant to
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Italy). The meeting lasted approximately 3.5 hours.
Most discussions were in the Albanian language, with translations provided for the foreigners where
necessary.
The meeing started with brief outlines of the main features of the proposed project, the Ecological
Survey which has been completed, and the Envirommental Assessment (EA) currently underway.
It was stressed that the EA would first be assessing the proposed activities against their probable
Abania Forasny EnWr _nemai Auzsmem
page 119



impacts. In doing this, the EA would propose ilnportant Issues and the related mitigating measures.
The EA would pay particular attention to how well each proposed activity satisfied the general
criteria of sustainability, participatory managemenL and biodiversity.
Discussion was vigorous on most topics selected by the participants. The participants decided that
there should be second meeting on Friday 6 October, to discuss more details of the findings of the
Environmental Assessment.
Summaay of Significant Public Conuents                                                      U
1.    Protected areas have an important role in Albanian forest management and natural
biodiversity, and this component should be strengthened. The numbers and sizes of protected
areas should be increased, but only when a clear need and value can be demonstrated.
2.    The project has an important role in rehabilitating and managing the forests. If strengthening
the administrating insfitltions does not result in better forest management and implementation
of existing legislation, then the success of the project will have been compromised.
3.    There is a lack of reliable data about the existing forest resources, the amounts of forest
products removed annually, the number of harvesting operations, and especially about
fuelwood supply and demand. Uncertainty about basic forest statistics provoked some
contention between participants.
4.    The processes for preparation of forest management plans are very important, and probably
require more resources under the project. Most speakers agreed on the necessity and value
of involving technical specialists from various academic and scientific institutions, which
would require additional funds under the project. The general public, both as NGOs and
odters, should also participate in formulating and assessing forest management plans. In
particular, if the new forest management plans are to be formally assessed for their
compliance with environmental criteria, specific funding will be required for those persons
and agencies involved.
5.    The project cannot be expected to solve all the problems of forestry in Albania, but
investments under the project should go first to those activities which are likely to return the
earliest and best dividends. This will generate revenue to be re-invested in forestry through
the Revenue Account
6.    Several participants were concerned about the removal from the project of the reforestation
component, based on fte evident uneconomic nature of this activity. Altnative arguments
about the desirability of reforestation in some circumstances were discussed.
7.    Training of future managers of protected areas was discussed at length. Te proposed
training under the project would probably not be sufficient to ensure sustainable management
for protection of these areas. A proposal was made that the Forestry Faculty and the Faculty
of Natral Sciences should cooperate to devise a curriculum for training a new type of
manager for natural resources in AlbaniaL

Tbe Seoond Public Meeting
lbe second public meeting was attended by 19 participants, of whom 12 attended the first meeting.
he mneeting was chaired by Mr P. Brylski, and lasted 3 hours. Participants at the second meeting
had been given an Albanian translation of a draft list of Issues and proposed Mitigation Measures,
grouped into first and second priorities.
Most of the discussion centered on Issues related to important institutional and administrative
arrangements which will: (i) significantly influence the emphasis given by Goverrnent to
environmental irnpacts in forestry planning and management; and (ii) affect the efficiency of
environmental assessment of proposed activities. Specifically, these included: changes in legal
structures; the roles of the CEP and the Forest Council; the legal and institutional capacities to
conduct environental reviews of FMPs and activities such as road rehabilitation; the legal basis for
multiple use mandates guiding preparation of FMPs; the transformation of the DGFP into a Forest
Corporation and a Department of Forests and Pastures; ard the need for funds and appropriate
arrangements to encourage the DGFP and CEP to prepare and evaluate environmental assessments.
Dr T. Lako, Director-General of the DGFP, assisted in many ways in clarifying these issues. Few
Issues were finally resolved, but in all cases there was a very valuable exchange of views.
The Vsdue of Pubic Partupaoin Projet Formulaton and Assessment
The meetings were deliberately not organized within a strict format becase it was considered
desirable to allow discussions to centre on those maters which were perceived to be important by
the Albanian participants.
The meetings were useful to the team preparing the EA, and to the participants. Differing views
were aired and useful degrees of fiuture cooperation were promised. The opporunity to participate
and to have had some influence was appreciated by those outside professional forestry. The primary
value of the meetings lay in clarifying the items of concern to different groups of participants, and
in demonstrating the strengths of conviction with which these concerns were held. The meetings will
have inproved the possibilities of more productive fiuture cooperation xetween professional foresters,
echnical specialists and NGOs.
Numerous small changes in emphasis and content in the draft EA were made as a result of the facts
and opinions expressed at the three public meetings.
