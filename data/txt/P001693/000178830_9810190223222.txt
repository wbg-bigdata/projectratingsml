REPORT AND RECOMHENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR A LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.        I subuit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Mali for the equivalent of US$13.3
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Livestock Project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
Background
2.        A report on "Recent Economic Developments in Mali" (233a-MLI) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on September 27, 1973. Country data
are attached as Annex I.
3.        With a per capita GDP of about US$70, Mali is one of the poorest
countries in Africa and one of the 25 "least developed" countries identified
by the United Nations. Agriculture, livestock and fisheries contribute over
two-fifths of GDP (1972) and are the backbone of the economy and the principal
source of foreign exchange. Manufacturing accounts for only 9 percent of GDP.
Real GDP growth during the 1960's was about 2.8 percent a year compared with
a population growth rate of 2.1 percent. In 1968-1972, GDP growth averaged
3.3 percent a year; but in 1973 GDP is estimated to have declined by about 3
percent because of the severe drought which Mali suffered during 1972. This
would imply a decline in agriculture in the order of 20 percent. Hardest hit
by this decline were the nomadic and semi-nomadic people, tens of thousands
of whom have fled the pastoral sone to seek refuge in the southern part of the
country. There is likely to have been a further drop in national output in
1974, as a result of poor weather conditions in 1973. Rainfall in 1974 was
close to the 30-year average and crops in 197V75 are expected to be about
normal.
Government Policies
4.        Reports on previous credits to Mali have drawn attention to the
legacy of difficult economic problems inherited fron the regime overthown by
the military in November 1968. Many of these problems persist, in spite of
the present Government's efforts to correct the most serious distortions in
the economy by removing some of the restrictions on trade and payments,
raising agricultural producer prices, and increasing budget revenue. The
Government's policy of hiring aIl graduates of secondary and higher schools
unable to find employment in the private sector has exerted constant upward
pressure on public expenditure. Many state enterprises appear to be still
operating at a loss, at least partly because they are not free in their
pricing decisions. The state enterprises were the main beneficiaries of the
66 percent expansion of bank credit between 1968 and 1973, which was one of
the chief causes of the continued balance of payments deficit.



-2-
5.        There are nevertheless a number of encouraging developments.
Production of cotton and groundnuts, the two main export crops, has been
fairly well maintained despite the recurring drought, reflecting government
investment and support. Substantial investments are being made to expand
cotton and rice output, including the Mopti Rice Project financed by IDA
(277-MII). River fisheries, for which mainly the European Development Fund
(FED) has provided assistance, have also been making good progress. In
connection with its efforts to increase food crop production, the Government
is now acting again on producer prices. During negotiations of the Integrated
Rural Development Project (491-MII) it agreed with IDA to raise prices of
millet and sorghum and to carry out a study on producer prices and marketing
arrangements for these two crops. In fact, prices have been raised somewhat
above the levels discussed at that time. The producer price of a kilogram
of millet or sorghum was raised in 1974 from MF 20 (1972/73 campaign) to
MF 32, of white paddy from HF 25 to MF 40, of seed cotton (first quality)
from MF 50 to MF 75, and of groundnuts (in shell) frao MF 30 to MF 40.
Financial Developments
6.        The balance of payments improved between 1968 and 1972, despite a
continued current deficit, as a result of a sharp reduction of private capital
outflows from US$13.6 million to US$4.9 million. Further, the proportion of
grants in total external aid inflows increased from about 30 percent in 1968
to over 80 percent in 1972. In spite of higher world prices, exports in 1973
stagnated because of the drought while imports went up sharply (+22.5 percent)
owing to the massive food imports required. The current deficit in 1973 thus
reached a record of US$69 million. Although inflows of official funds more
than doubled, net foreign assets of the banking system at the end of 1973
were minus US$108 million, again an absolute record. This was made possible
by the right to draw on the Operations Account with the French Treasury. The
balance of payments situation is unlikely to have improved in 1974.
7.        Public savings have remained negative despite considerable improve-
ment in tax collection in recent years. Government current expenditures have
been rising at a rate of over 11 percent annually between 1970 and 1974,
chiefly because of the strong increase of wages and salaries, which reached
a share of 67 percent in 1974. As a result, the overall deficit (excluding
investment expenditure financed out of foreign aid) rose from HF 2.2 billion
in 1970 (9.2 percent of total spending) to MF 7.7 billion in 1974 (21.2 per-
cent). Nevertheless, the deficits in the drought years 1973 and 1974
remained below what had been expected earlier for two reasons: FED aid, which
made up for the loss of revenue from the cattle tax that had been suspended
to help drought-stricken farmers, and the remarkable efforts of the Malian
Government in speeding up tax collection and improving tax administration,
which led to the collection of over MF 4 bill-on in back taxes during 1973
and 1974. Further, the introduction of a "taxe conjoncturelle3 in mid-1974
yielded another HF 500 million in revenue. Thus, instead of stagnating,
revenue in 1973 and 1974 increased faster on average than in the two years
before.



- 3 -
8.        Imports of petroleum products are only 10 percent of total merchan-
dise imports (1972). But their price to Mali has roughly doubled between
September 1973 and early 1974, adding another unfavorable factor to an already
difficult situation. Petroleum consumption could not be reduced without
affecting the productive sectors, since consumption for leisure and tourism
is marginal. The development of Mali's hydro-electric potential is currently
being studied by consultants under a project jointly sponsored by UNDP, FED,
Germany, France and Italy. It is expected that these studies will provide
the basis for a program designed to meet the country's long-term power require-
ments, and the World Bank would be prepared to provide some assistance for
projects of proven economic feasibility.
9.        Two large mmlti-purpose schemes for the development of Mali's water
resources are presently under examination. One would involve the construction
of a dam on the Sankarani River upstream from Bamako close to the border with
Guinea; this would permit regulation of the river for irrigation and the gene-
ration of power. The other envisages the construction of a dam on one of the
tributaries of the Senegal River in the West of Mali as part of a huge program
for the development of the Senegal River Basin for the benefit of Mali, Senegal
and Mauritania. An important aspect of this scheme would be the opening up
of the Senegal River to navigation, which would provide Mali with direct access
to the sea.
Foreign Aid
10.       The greater part of public investment is financed from external
sources. During 1966/67-1970, Mali received an annual average of US$30 million
of external aid disbursements, including technical assistance of about US$3
million. Nearly half of this aid was provided by the USSR and the People's
Republic of China in the fonm of medium- and long-term concessionary loans;
close to 40 percent came from France and FED in the form of grants.  In 1971,
Mali received foreign aid disbursements of US$31.3 million, of which 81 percent
were grants.  In 1972, disbursements increased sharply to US$54.3 million, of
which 86 percent were grants.
11.       The present drought has prompted special aid to Mali from the inter-
national community. Emergency aid amounted to about US$5 million in 1972/73
while US$17 million have been pledged for 1973/74. This aid consisted mainly
of food: 133,000 tons of food grains, powdered milk and other essentials were
provided in 1972/73 and another 150,000 tons in the following twelve months.
The EEC, individual EEC members, the FAO, the United States and Canada have
been the main donors. In addition, these sources and other agencies have
committed funds for rehabilitation and drought control projects totalling
about US115-20 million, including an IDA Credit of US$2.5 million. Despite
close to "normalm rainfall in 1974 and fairly good crops, the Government has
requested another 150,000 tons of food aid for 1974/75 to make up for some
local shortages and to rebuild grain reserves.
12.       Mali's external public debt outatanding at the end of 1972 was
US$324 million, including US$62 million undisbursed. IDA's share in the total
amount disbursed and outstanding at this date was 5.9 percent. Repayments of
principal and interest due in 1972 would have claimed about 15 percent of the



- 4 -
year's foreign exchange earnings (12 percent in 1971); actual debt service
payments were small (less than 1 percent in 1971 and 1.5 percent in 1972).
Outstanding debt at the end of 1973 was US$368.0 million, including an
undisbursed amount of US$85.1 million. IDA's share in the total amount
disbursed and outstanding was 7.7 percent. Repayments of principal and
interest due in 1973 would have claimed nearly 20 percent of foreign exchange
earnings (15 percent in 1972); actual debt service payments were small (1.5
percent in 1972, 1.8 percent in 1973), however, owing to the 1970 rescheduling
chiefly of Chinese and Russian debts on short- to medium-term arrangements.
Mali has received several standby credits frran the IMF, of which US$6.5 million
are outstanding. The lF recently agreed to reschedule US$2.5 million of
payments due in 1974 and 1975.
Development Prospects
13.       Mali's prospects for accelerating economic progress depend mainly
on raising farm and livestock production and on improving infrastructure
geared to the needs of the productive sectors. The next five-year plan,
now in the final stages of preparation, makes the achievement of these goals
its first priority. According to preliminary studies, the plan would require
investments -- estimated at 19714 prices -- of MF 395 billion (US$878 million
at the 1974 exchange rate), of which external sources are expected to finance
85 percent or nearly US$150 million per year. The plan's growth target
is 7.3 percent a year. The Government hopes that new partners will join
the traditional sources of aid to help achieve these very ambitious targets.
As in the past, however, the econoay will also be greatly influenced by
factors beyond the Government's control, chiefly the weather and changes
in the terms of trade. Attaining an annual growth rate of 5-6 percent would
thus already represent a significant success.
114.      Mali's capacity to increase public savings in the short and medium
run is strictly limited by a number of factors: the much-reduced capacity, due
to the drought, of a large section of the population to pay more taxes; the
existence of sizeable arrears resulting fran past budgetary problems; the
difficulties in reforming the public enterprise sector; and, last but not least,
world inflation. Though existing monetary arrangements with France signifi-
cantly a.leviate the foreign exchange constraint, M1ali 's heavy debtor position
on the Operations Account and its large outstanding obligations to China and
the Soviet Union clearly point to the need for the Government to be extremely
cautious in its borrowing. These reasons, added to Mali's poverty, strongly
suggest that foreign aid should be given on the most concessionary terms
possible, and should cover a h.gb proportion of total project costs, including
substantial amounts of local expenditures.
PART II: BANK GROJUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
15.       The proposed credit would be IDA's tenth operation in Mali, bringing
the total of IDA funds committed to US$7P.3 million, most of them during the
past three years. Of the presently outstanding amount (US$59.0 million),
US$25.3 million had been disbursed as of December 31, 1974.



16.       Bank Group lending during the 1960's was handicapped by the country's
poor economic performance and the lack of well-prepared and economically justified
projects. However, in 1966, a US$9.1 million IDA Credit (95-MLI) was made for
improvement of the Malian section of the Bamako-Dakar (Senegal) railway. Since
the end of the 1960's, project preparation has been sharply stepped up. The
Bank's 1969 economic mission and other reconnaissance and preparation missions,
as well as the Government's improved competence in preparing projects itself,
provided the basis for formulating a substantially expanded and diversified
Bank Group lending program, and the initial results of these efforts have
already materialized. An IDA Credit (197-MLI) of US$7.7 million helped
finance a first highway maintenance project in 1970. Credits of US$6.9 million
for the Mopti rice project (277-NLI) and US$3.6 million for a telecommunications
project (321-MLI) were approved in 1972. Further credits for a US$6.7 million
second railway project (384-MLI) and a US$9s5 million second highway project
(383-MLI), as well as a US$5.o million first education project (420-MLI) and
a US$2.5 million drought relief project (443-MLI), were signed in 1973. An
IDA Credit (491-MLI) of US$8.0 million helping to rehabilitate the groundnut
industry was approved in 197h. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA
Credits as at December 31, 1974, as well as notes on the execution of current
projects. Experience with ongoing projects has generally been good, although
the extreme shortage of rainfall and reduced flooding of the Niger River in
recent years interrupted production under the Mopti Rice project. That project
should nevertheless show a highly satisfactory rate of return because of rising
world cereal -prices;  a proposal for an increase in the amount of the credit
mainly to offset the effects of currency realignments and cost increases, has
been submitted to Executive Directors for their approval.
17.       Mali has considerable potential for agricultural and livestock devel-
opment, and most of the operations envisaged by the Bank Group in the near
future are related in some measure to the rural sector. They include a second
rice and a third highways project, the former providing a follow-on to the
Mopti rice project, the latter focussing particularly on feeder roads. A
cotton and foodgrains project in the south of the country will be ready for
field appraisal in the summer. Beyond that, further Bank Group financing may
be sought for other agricultural projects, and the Government is also interested
in having the Bank Group provide assistance for the large multi-purpose schemes
referred to in paragraph 9 above. Given the limited availability of IDA funds,
a major effort1 will be needed to mobilize financing from other sources if all
these projects are to go forward.
PART III: THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN MALI
18.       Agriculture, including livestock, is the most important sector in
the economy of Mali. It directly provides the livelihood of 85 percent of the
population, contributes 43 percent of GDP, and accounts for virtually all of
its foreign exchange earnings (US$54 million equivalent in 1972). Farming is
carried out on some 500,000 farms of 2-5 hectares, mostly at the subsistence
level. About 85 percent of the cultivated land is devoted to food crops,
principally millet, sorghum, and in the river valleys, rice. Cotton and
groundnuts are the principal cash crops.



-6-
The Livestock Sub-Sector
19.       In 1970, the country's livestock population included 5.4 million
cattle and about 11 million sheep and goats. Until the drought started to
cause major losses in 1972, growth of the national cattle herd (due mainly to
rinderpest control) had averaged about almost 6 percent annually over the
past decade. From 1960 to 1972, livestock exports more than doubled and
reached a yearly level of 220,000 live cattle and 210,000 small stock, or
30 percent of Mali's annual livestock production and 40 percent of all exports.
The most important markets are Ivory Coast and Ghana. Then, mainly due to the
repeated droughts, livestock's share of GDP declined from 20 percent in 1969
to 17 percent in 1972 and almost certainly declined further in 1973. During
the 1972/73 drought, the worst in 50 years, about 15-20 percent of the country's
cattle population was lost. Cattle herds typically consist of 50-80 head and
10-30 sheep and goats owned by semi-nomadic family groups consisting of 2-3
families each averaging 6 family members and provide a per family income of
US$100-150 a year. Virtually all beef production comes fram the traditional
sector, and the predominant production system remains nomadic or semi-nomadic
(transhumance). Livestock taxes normally constitute 8-10 percent of public
revenue.
Deterioration of the Pastoral Resource
20.       The principal problem facing the development of Mali's livestock
industry, and especially the traditional industry of the Sahelian zone, is
the progressive degradation of pastures, which in the northern areas is
resulting in the advance of desert conditions. The recent drought years
have accelerated this condition which results from overstocking and overgrazing
of cattle.
21.       In existing circumstances, maximizing herd size makes sense for
the average pastoralist, because:
(a) Pastoralists have no legal rights to the use of grazing
land, which is state-owned and used communally; consequently,
each livestock owner grazes as many cattle as he can in an
attempt to maximize his share of the common resource;
(b) In the absence of banking facilities and any other investment
opportunities, cattle provide the only means of accumulating
wealth;
(c) Milk is an important component in the pastoral family's diet,
and its sale is usually the only source of regular cash
income. Consequently, the proportion of cows is deliberately
kept high, which permits the herd to expand rapidly when
grazing conditions are favorable;
(d) Large cattle numbers are an insurance against the risks of
losses from drought and disease.



- 7 -
22.       External factors have further decreased the ratio of grazing land
to animals because:
(a) Livestock projects have concentrated on providing improved
animal health care and watering facilities, and neglected
the need for control to ensure a balance between animal
numbers and the carrying capacity of pastures. They have
led to a rapid increase in livestock numbers and serious
overgrazing;
(b) Due to population pressure more and more farmers have
moved into traditional pasture lands and started to
cultivate there;
(c) Increasing numbers of cattle have moved in from Upper Volta
and Mauritania.
23.       Until recently, cattle movements and the duration of grazing
in each area have been governed by strict traditional rules. Traditional
authority is now breaking down and there has been little if any effort
to provide an alternative. If one of Mali's principal resources is to be
preserved, and if the impact of future droughts is to be minimized, livestock
numbers must be regulated. The range must never be grazed so hard that it
deteriorates and fails to regenerate sufficiently quickly to prevent permanent
damage, which in the northern and drier areas already results in the advance
of desert conditions.
Livestock Development Strategy
24.       The objectives of Government's livestock development strategy are
to increase the productivity of livestock resources and to expand the volume
of livestock exports, principally, through:
(a) helping nomads and semi-nomads make the best use of pasture
land;
(b) opening up new grazing areas; and
(c) helping farmers in higher rainfall areas take up beef and
milk production.
25.       Achievement of the first objective requires an integrated approach
such as would be implemented under the proposed project.
26.       In the case of the second objective, Mali still has large areas of
underutilized rangeland that could be more efficiently used through providing
better watering facilities. A benefit of this approach would be to relieve
pressure on the present grazing areas. An important water development program
in the 5th Region is included in the proposed project. The Government also
plans to combat trypanosomiasis in large areas south of latitude 130 north,
and has already started to study the methods to be applied.



- 8 -
27.       In pursuit of the third objective, much is already being done to help
farmers Lake up livestock production.  Modern techniques are being tested and
demonstli.ted at two research stations, a FED-financed ranch, and in the
"Office cu Niger" irrigation scheme. A USAID scheme is to provide training,
extension, and credit for cattle fattening by farmers. Feeder steer marketing
to serve fattening schemes would be developed under the proposed project.
Finally, as the area around Bamako is suitable for milk production, the
Government intends to start a smallholder dairy scheme there which will
include artificial insemination, pasture improvement, and fodder growing.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
28.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Livestock Project" (N° 538a-MLI)
is being circulated separately. A credit and project summary, including a
breakdown of costs, is attached in Annex III, and the project area is shown
on the attached map (IBRD 11004). RMWA identified the project in October
1970, and subsequently prepared it with the help of studies financed by the
Fonds d'Aide et de Coop6ration (FAC). Field appraisal took place in January-
February 1974. Negotiations were held in Washington from December 10-12, 1974.
The Malian delegation was led by H.E. Sidi Coulibaly, Minister of Production.
The Project Area
29.       The project area would consist of about 89,000 km2 in central Mali
which is amhinistratively referred to as the 5th Region, Mali's most important
and high potential livestock area. Total population in the area is about
1.12 million people of whom 40 percent are semi-nomadic pastoralists (mostly
Peuhls and Touaregs) and the rest cultivators. In 1972, the area had about
30 percent of Mali's cattle (1.7 million) and 20 percent of the sheep and
goats (2.3 ,illion). As a result of the 1972/73 drought, about 25 percent of
the former and about 10 percent of the latter were lost. The ratio of grazing
land to animals has steadily decreased over the past decade mainly due to
over-stocking, rapid expansion of agriculture and uncontrolled bush fires.
Project Description
30.       The project would aim at the rational use of land and water in the
5th Region and would help about 100,000 pastoralist families to rebuild and
improve their herds and to protect them against future droughts. An essential
feature of the project would be to develop effective grazing control, which
offers the only means of creating and maintaining the conditions in which
efficient and stable livestock production can be developed on the 5th Region's
rangeland.
31.       A combination of incentives, regulation and education is needed to
make grazing control effective: regulation without education would mean
friction between pastoralists and authorities; education alone would produce
results too slowly; and neither would have any lasting effect in the absence
of strong incentives. The incentives and measures used would be adapted to
the different areas covered by the project.



32.       In three special areas - one of about 5,000 km2 and the other two
about 1,000 km2 together - permanent watering facilities would be provided,
along with animal health and extension services. Pastoralists in these areas
would have user rights to land and watering facilities which would be granted
and safeguarded by the Government. This would provide the pastoralists with
an incentive to use their land and facilities properly and an opportunity to
invest in further developmentssuch as fencing and additional watering facili-
ties. To facilitate regulation and control, the project would aim at setting
up pastoralists as legally constituted groups. Other areas amounting to about
10,000 km2 would be provided with seasonal ponds and improved animal health
services. The location of the ponds would be designed to increase the pasture
available at the beginning of the dry season and thereby reduce the pressure
on the dry season pastures in the Niger Delta. As the areas to be provided
with permanent and seasonal watering facilities only cover about 20 percent
of the 5th Region, and since the methods of introducing grazing control are
new and untried, emphasis would be placed on the preparation of a second-phase
project based on the experience provided by the first.
33.       The project would be carried out over the five years 1975-79 and
would comprise:
(a) introducing livestock extension services and grazing control
in three special development areas;
(b) providing improved animal health services throughout the
5th Region;
(c) constructing 70 wells and 50 ponds;
(d) constructing and managing an abattoir and hide-drying
facilities at Mopti-S6var6;
(e) constructing and managing five livestock markets;
(f) establishing and managing a 150-ha livestock and pasture
trial station;
(g) providing personnel training and testing a functional
literacy program for pastoralists; and
(h) preparing a second-phase livestock project.
Project Execution
34.       The Government would establish the Op6ration de Dgveloppement de
l'Elevage de la Region de Mopti (ODEM)- which woald be a branch of the
Ministry of Production responsible for all livestock development in the 5th
Region and for the execution of the proposed project. ODEM would have legal
authority to grant user rights to grazing lands and watering facilities and
to prescribe conditions for their use. It wcaldinclude a planning and range
management unit, and services for livestock extension, animal health, live-
stock marketing and processing. It would employ 12 senior staff and about
500 support staff. In the absence of qualified and experienced Malians,
expatriates would probably need to be recruited for at least the following:



- 10 -
Deputy Director, Range Management Officer, Water Development Officer, and
Pasture Agrorlomist. They would be replaced after four or five years by
Malians who would have been trained within the project and abroad. The pro-
ject would also provide for eighteen man-months of consultant services for
studies related to project implementation and preparation of a secand-phase
project. It would be a condition of Credit Effectiveness that ODEM had been
established with responsibilities and powers acceptable to IDA. An additional
condition of effectiveness would be that ODEM had employed a Director, two
Deputy Directors and an Administrative officer acceptable to IDA.
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
35.       The project cost for the five-year period, 1975-79, including taxes
and duties is estimated at US$17.3 million. Taxes and duties account for
about 14 percent of project costs before contingencies. It is proposed that
an IDA Credit of US$13.3 million be made to the Government on standard terms,
covering 89 percent of project costs, net of taxes and duties. The Credit
would finance the project's foreign exchange costs (US$9.0 million) and 52
percent (US$4.3 million) of local currency cost.   The remaining 48 percent
(US$4.0 million) of the latter would be met from Government budgetary alloca-
tions (US$3.4 million equivalent including about US$2.4 million in taxes and
duties), ODEM's revenues (US$o.L million), and livestock owners (US$0.2 million).
Procurement and Disbursements
36.       Contracts for all items in excess of US$50,000 would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guide-
lines. This would aggregate about US$7.8 million, covering: (a) buildings and
structures, US$3.0 million; (b) installation of 40 wells in the Seno Mango area,
US$2.2 million; (c) vaccines, US$0.9 million; (d) vehicles, machinery and
equipment, US$0.8 million; and (e) well construction and maintenance equipment
for the Ministry of Public Works, US$0.9 million, to construct 20 wells in the
Seno Mango area and 10 wells west of the Delta by force account. These 30 wells
are widely dispersed in remote areas and would be constructed over a three- to
four-year period. Contracts for all items below US$50,000 would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local
procedures, which are satisfactory to IDA. Domestically manufactured goods
procured for the project would be allowed a 15 percent price preference or the
level of applicable import duty, whichever is lower, over foreign goods; for
civil works, domestic contractors would be granted a 7.5 percent preference
over foreign contractors. The services of expatriate staff and consultants
(US$0.8 million) would be obtained according to procedures acceptable to IDA.
The construction and/or rehabilitation of 50 ponds, widely dispersed in remote
areas, would be carried out by the Rural Engineering Department by force account,
at a cost of US$0.8 million.
37.       The IDA Credit would be disbursed over five years to cover:
(a) 95 percent of local expenditures for the incremental local
staff of ODEM during the 5 years of project implementation,
expenses for staff of the Mopti abattoir for its first year
of operation, and local training expenses of ODEM staff --
US$1.3 million;



- 11 -
(b)  100 percent of foreign expenditures for expatriate personnel,
consultant services and training of ODEM's staff abroad --
us$950,ooo;
(c) 75 percent of total expenditures for civil works (including
preparatory works) -- US$3.6 million;
(d)  100 percent of foreign or 75 percent of total expenditures
of vehicles and equipment, and of livestock for the Mopti
trial station -- US$450,000; and
(e)  75 percent of ODEM's operating expenditures during the
disbursement period, other than expenditures referred to
under (a), excluding expenditures for the Mopti abattoir
beyond the first year of operations -- US$3.1 million.
US$3.9 million would be unallocated.
38.       Owing to the Government's difficult financial position, exacerbated by
the drought, it is proposed that the Association should pre-finance an initial
deposit of US$200,000 equivalent in a special account to be created (Section
2.02(b) of the Development Credit Agreement). Establishment of this account,
which would serve as a revolving fund, is a condition of effectiveness for the
proposed Credit.
Markets
39.       The market outlook for meat is very favorable in West Africa. Meat
is increasingly scarce due to the recent droughts, rapid population and urban-
ization growth, and the strength of demand is shown by rapidly rising prices.
Since the incremental production of the project at full development would not
exceed about 12 percent of pre-drought domestic output, it should find a
ready market. The hides and skins can easily be exported, or bought by the
Bamako tannery; the milk would improve the nutrition of about 100,000 pastora-
list families and neighboring farmers, and any surplus would find a ready
local market.
40.       Livestock marketing in the country is reasonably efficient, and
the project would improve the marketing facilities in the 5th Region. Slaughter-
ing facilities are adequate, since the Bamako slaughterhouse operates at only
about 50 percent of capacity, and the simple abattoir to be constructed under
this project would cover the needs of Mopti, the only large town in the project
area. Meat is retailed by an adequate network of butcher shops.
Benefits and Justification
41.       The principal direct benefits from the project would be incremental
annual livestock production worth MF 3.5 billion (US4$7.8 million) in 1974 terms,
yielding net foreign exchange earnings of the order of MF 1.7 billion (US$3.8
million). Some 100,000 pastoral families would increase their average cash
incomes from livestock production from MF 65,000 (US$144) to MF 100,000 (US$222),
and almost 400 jobs would be created.



- 12 -
42.       The economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 51 percent,
and is not very sensitive to increased costs or reduced benefits. This high
rate of return is due to the fact that the investment represented by the project
is expected to raise significantly the productivity of the existing herd the
investment in which may be regarded as a sunk cost.
L3.       Without the changes that would be introduced under the project,
it is likely that the 5th Region would continue to deteriorate as a grazing
resource, as more and more rangeland would be destroyed by overgrazing and
degraded by shifting millet and rice cultivation.
4L.       Risks.  The proposed project is risky because it is difficult to
assess: (1) the degree to which pastoralists will respond to the grazing
control measures introduced by the project; (2) the degree to which other
pastoralists will be prevented from encroaching on the grazing rights of
participating groups; and (3) the frequency and extent of future droughts.
Should the grazing control measures fail to be effective, the project would
be conducive to overgrazing and consequently to the deterioration of range-
lands. However, the project would proceed by phases and on the basis of a
development plan previously agreed between Government and IDA; each successive
phase would be undertaken only on the basis of evidence that the previous
phase had been completed successfully. These safeguards would make the pro-
ject adaptable to the lessons of experience and would allow the discontinuation
of activities which show high probabilities of being economically undesirable.
As for the second risk, should participating groups be prevented from cooperat-
ing with the project by encroaching pastoralists, sound resource management
would be impaired and overgrazing would likely result. It can, however, be
expected that the Government would take appropriate measures to protect the
rights of project participants.    Turning to the third risk, the project area
may be affected by two different types of drought: (a) moderate droughts
which may typically occur every four or five years; and (b) catastrophic
droughts suzh as the 1972/73 one.   Moderate droughts are not expected to
affect substantially the economic viability of the project. In fact, to the
extent that the project promotes a proper balance between cattle and land,
the project area would be better prepared to withstand such a drought than
otherwise. Historical data show that catastrophic droughts occur every 40
to 50 years. Should this pattern hold, the project will have been success-
fully implemented and extended throughout the region before the next catas-
trophic one occurs. An appropriate balance between cattle and land would
have been achieved and the region would be in the best possible position to
withstand a serious drought with minimum losses, However, in the unlikely
event that a catastrophic drought should repeat itself in the near future,
it would be very difficult to maintain discipline in the project area and to
prevent invasion by outside pastoralists; and as a result the project would
be in serious jeopardy, Nevertheless, the potential benefits of the project
are so important relative to this risk that the risk is worth taking.

C.   Projects in Execution /
Credit 95-MLI First Railway Project. US$9.1 million Credit of September
29, 1966; Closing Date June 30, 1974
The physical execution of the project is now completed, about three
years behind schedule. The Closing Date had been extended to June 30, 197h
to allow sufficient time for additional track renewal financed from savings
under the Credit, and for completion of a complementary study. Until about
two years ago, the railway was making slow but steady progress toward
achieving the financial targets set at project appraisal. Since then,
however, the railway's earnings have not kept pace with increasing
operating costs primarily because a proposed tariff increase was only
implemented at the end of 1974. An 8 percent across the board was not
implemented contrary to the reconmendations of appraisal, however, the
Government has now decided to apply an average tariff increase of 30 percent
on national traffic and 15 percent on international traffic which will result
in an 8 percent increase in real terms. On this basis, the regie's operating
revenue should amount to CFAF 3.7 billion in 1976 instead of CFAF 3.0 billion
in 1976 instead of CFAF 3.0 billion based on tariffs used prior to end 197h,
thereby enabling the regie to improve its financial situation.
Credit 197-NLI First Highway Project. US$7.7 million Credit of June 17,
1970; Closing Date March 31, 1976
The First Highway Project is being carried out with the assistance
of two teams of experts from the International Labor Organization (ILO) who
are also helping to reorganize the Equipment Department of the National
Directorate of Public Works (DP). The borrower's performance is good, and
the project is progressing satisfactorily after a slow start.
Credit 277-MLI Mopti Rice Development Project. US$6.9 million Credit of
January 6, 1972; Closing Date May 31, 1978
Started in early 1972 after initial delays, the project is progressing
satisfactorily. Construction works should be completed by the end of FY75 as
scheduled, but, following the US$ devaluation and sharp price increases, most
of the IDA credit will be disbursed by February 1975 and supplementary IDA
financing of about US$2.6 million required for the completion of the project
as initially planned has been presented to the Board for approval.
Government and FAC will finance the remainder of the overrun (US$1.2 million
equivalent).
j   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the solutions taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 4
Credit 321-MILI Telecommunications Project. US$3.6 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Closing Date July 1, 1976
Due to difficulties in selecting an engineering consultant and
divergencies of views as to the work to be performed by the consultant,
the implementation of the project is about 18 months behind schedule.
These difficulties have now been resolved and the procurement procedures are
being initiated. Good progress is being made in improving OPTM's accounting
system, but OPTM's financial position is weak mainly because of the Govern-
ment's debt to OPTM and billing delays by the office.
Credit 383-MIU Second HighwaZ Project. US$9.5 Million Credit of May 23,
1973; Closing Date July 19, 1977
The contract for the construction of Faladie-Segou has been awarded
but the contract price is considerably higher than estimated and the Govarn-
ment has requested that the Association consider supplementary financing. It
has been decided that the cost overrun of this project will be taken over by
the Third Highway Project which will be appraised during January 1975.
Credit 384-MLI Second Railway Project.   US$6.7 Million Credit of May 23,
1973; Closing Date June 30, 1978
This project was expected to cost a total of about US$8.33 million,
with IDA participation of US$6.7 million and FAC financing of US$1.8 million,
the rest being railway's own funds. Procurement of equipment, except for
freight-cars, is proceeding on schedule; FAC_financed locomotives are
already-in service, and track material has been delivered. However,
bidding results indicated considerable cost overruns, primarily because of
low original estimates, sharp increases in world market prices, and the
fact that only single bids were recieved for some items. Since no
supplementarv funds were available, the quantities of several equipment
items (specifically freight wagons, rolling stock for passenger traffic, and
equipment for supplying ballast) were reduced to match available foreign
exchange. The Government is now negotiating with France and Germany to obtain
the financing of the additional wagons needed to meet demand for carrying
international traffic and shipment for the Sahelian Zone under the Food
Relief Program. Canada is studying the railway's needs for ballast supply,
and may finance the necessary equipment; in addition, Canadian consultants
are executing the management reorganization study, an item previously scheduled
for financing under the Credit and now provided for under the Canadian Aid
Program. The project will be reviewed in January 1975 when the complete
bilateral participation in financing and final quantities of outstanding
project items are knomn.

Credit 420-MLI First Education Project. US$5.0 Million Credit of July 11,
1973; Closing Date December 31, 1979
The project is well managed and implementation of both physical
and software aspects of the project is proceeding according to schedule.
Credit 443-LI Drought Relief Project. US$2.5 Million Credit of December 7,
1973; Closing Date June 30, 1976
After initial delays, the project proceeding satisfactorily.
Applications for reimbursements are delayed, due primarily to the scattered
nature of the projects; updating of costs of the approved sub-projects
resulted in a slight overrun which called for a reduction of the program.
Credit 491-MLI Integrated Rural Development Project. US$8.0 Million Credit
of July 1. 1974: Closing Date September 30. 1975
Because of the delays in fulfilling legal conditions, the project
was not declared effective until December 9, 1974. The project will get
completely under way in the 1975/76 campaign. Steps are being taken to
enable timely and coordinated implementation of project activities, and
prospects for achieving targets appear good in view of the Goverrment's
determination to improve financial incentives to farmers. The proposed
marketing and cereal price study is expected to start shortly.

Arrangements:         Contracts for all items in excess of US$50,000 would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
(ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines. This would

and construction, US$3.0 million; (b) installation of 40
wells in the Seno Mango area, US$2.2 million; (c) vaccines,
US$0.9 million; (d) vehicles, machinery, and equipment,
US$0.8 million; and (e) well construction and maintenance
equipment for the Ministry of Public Works, US$0.9 million,
to construct 20 wells in the Seno Mango area and 10 wells
west of the Delta by force account. These 30 wells are
widely dispersed in remote areas, and would be constructed
over a three-to four-year period. Contracts for all items
below US$50,000 would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local
procedures, which are satisfactory to IDA. Domestically
manufactured goods procured for the project would be allowed

import duity, whichever is lower) over foreign goods; and
for civil works, domestic contractors would be granted a
7.5 percent preference ovrer foreign contractors. The services
of expatriate staff and consultants (US$0 8 million) would
be obtained according to procedures acceptable to IDA.

dispersed in remote areas, would be carried out by the Rural
Engineering Department by force account, at a cost of US$0.8
million.
Consultants:         International services of expatriate staff and consultants
