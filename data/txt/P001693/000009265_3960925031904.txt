PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALI LIVESTOCK PROJECT (CREDIT 538-MLI)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Livestock Project in
Mali, for which Credit 538-MLI in the amount of US$13.3 million was approved on
December 2, 1974. The original Loan Closing Date was December 31, 1979. The
final disbursement was made on August  20,  1985.    The project was the fourth
credit for agriculture and the first for livestock development in Mali and was
prepared by RMWA. It was followed by the Mopti Area Development Project 'Credit
1597-MLI) which was approved on May 21, 1985.
This PCR was prepared by the West Africa Region following a mission to
Mali from June 2 to 13, 1986 and is based in part on a Project Completion Report
prepared by the project implementing agency (ODEM), a review of the Staff
Appraisal Report 'No. 538a-MLI),  the  President's Report (No. P-1516a-MLI), the
Credit Agreement of April 11, 1975, relevant Bank files including correspondence
with the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda, minutes of the Board's discussions,
Bank supervision reports, project progress reports prepared by the Borrower as
well as interviews with officials both in the Bank and in Mali who have been
associated with the project.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower in April for comments.
However, no comments have been received.
This report has not been subjected to audit by OED.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALI LIVESTOCK PROJECT (CREDIT 538-MSI)
EVALUATION SUMARY
Introduction
1.      Tlhis was the first livestock project the Baik financed In Mali.
It was preceded by three credits for agriculture which had extended some
assistance to the veterinary service.   In 1970 the livestock population
included 5.4 million cattle and about 11 million sheep and goats.
Fifteen to twenty percent of the cattlet were lost during the 1972173
drought. An international emergency effort was launched in an attempt
to relieve some of the effects of the drought on the livestock industry.
Small, short-ternm projects were financed, including the IDA-finnmced
Drought Relief  Fund  Project.    The  effects  of  the 1972/73 drought,
howeverv spurred recognition of the need for long term projects aimed at
more rational land and pasture use in the Sahelien Zone and development
of more efficient beef and milk production in parts of Mali. Responding
to this need, the Bank's Regional Mission in West Africa identified the
project in  1970  and  also  prepared  it.    The  appraisal followed in
January/February 1974, and the credit was approved in February 1975.
Objectives
2.       The project's objectives were to  assist rural poor in particu-
lar pastoralists in the 5th Region and to rebuild their ecologically
fragile resources especially after the drought of 1972173. It was to
help about 100,000 pastorallst families by rationalizing the use of land
and water. The project was designed to (a) introduce livestock exten-
sion services and grazing control, (b) provide improved veterinary
services and training, (c) assist in the construction of water points
for stock watering, an abbatoir, livestock markets, and a pasture trial
station, ard (d) assist in the preparation of a livestock development
plan for the whole of the 5th Region and of a follow-on project. Total
project costs were estimated  at  US$17.3  million.    The IDA credit of
US$13.3 million was to be disbursed over four and a half years.
Implementation Experiznce
3.       The project was expected to begin  In  July 1975 and to be com-
pleted by June 1979. However, the project closing date, originally set
at December 31, 1979, had to be extended three times, the final closing



- vi -
date being June 30, 1984. This interim phase of four and one-half years
nearly linked the project to the now ongoing Mopti Area Development
Project. Final disbursement was made in August 1985. Total project
cost increased by local expenditure during the interim phase and brought
Government's participation from 20% (appraisal estimate) to 26.5% while
the Bank's credit remained unchanged at US$13.3 million of total project
costs of US$19 million (actual) against US$17.3 million (appraisal
estimate).
4.       The proposal that  pastoralists  manage their natural resources
and control grazing made the projecst innovative and risky. Risks were
taken into consideration when designing the project. However, two non-
livestock specific factors prevented the project from attaining all of
its objectives: (i) the late (only towards the end of the interim
phase) discovery of adequate groundwater resources for stock watering,
which delayed the formation of pastoral associations and pasture
management; and (ii) the unpredictable catastrophic drought of 1983184.
The groundwater resources crucial to project success should have been
more  carefully  appraised,  or   re-appraised   when  the  project  was
classified a problem project in April 1978 (para. 3.14).
Results
5.       Production  figures,  measured   by   livestock  marketing  and
slaughter data, had increased prior to the 1983/84 drought, and it
appears that the project had positive financial and economic results
until the recent drought in 1983/84 (paras. 5.01-5.03). The successful
veterinary component of the project was largely responsible for this.
Even were sufficient quantifiable informatiorn available (para. 4.23)
rates of return - which have not been calculated - would remain
questionable compared to those calculated at appraisal for the entire
project.
Sustainability
6.       The implementing  agency,  ODEM,  recognized  by Government and
pastoralists for its technical assistance, was instrumental in the
reconstitution of the livestock population in the 5th Region after the
drought. Its organization and re-organization, to become an effective
agency, took far longer than expected, yet its experience is important
to  the  continued   formation   of   pastoral  associations  and  their
participation in development for on-going and future lending operations
(paras. 4.01-4.09).    This  experience  led  to  a follow-on, livestock
component in the Mopti Area Development Project (Credit 1597-1LI).

Findings and Lessons
7.       Lessons to be learned from the project includet
(a) The project corresponded to the Bank's and the Borrower's
objectives. Its possible risks were taken into considera-
tion.   However,  more  intensive  project preparation and
especially hydrological testing and socio-economic studies
would have permitted correct pre-project assessments. A
project duration of ten years rather than five should have
been considered from the start to allow long term planning
and continuity.    More  intensive  prepitration would also
have prevented overly optimistic assumptions.
(b) Local institutions responsible for pre-investment studies
need to be assessed at appraisal or early supervision.
Their need for outside assistance can become crucial for
project implementation -ind the preparation o£ follow-on
projects (para. 7.05).
(c) Early identification of major problems by supervision
missions as in the case of the veterinary service (para.
3.23) led to more forceful action by the Bank and Govern-
ment  to  achieve  project  course  correction.   However,
components as crucial to project success as the ground-
water exploitation needed to be more thoroughly analyzed
during implementation by teams rather than be based on one
individual's opinion (para. 7.07).
(d) Research components of a project (such as the Mopti Trial
station) need to be from the start attached to established
and experienced research agencies (para. 3.10).
(e) Monitoring requirements should be defined in detail.
Progress reports should include production and income as
well as input data.    These  reports could facilitate the
evaluation of project impact. Supervision missions should
observe such requirements.



MALI
LIVESTOCK PROJECT
(Credit 538-MLI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.  General
1.01      The population of Mali, about 7 million (1983), of which over 80%
inhabit rural areas, depends on food production from areas of 800-1200mm
rainfall, roughly 3 million cultivable hectares. The vast Saharan zone in
the North and East is almost uninhabited. In the densely populated areas
in and along the southeastern part of the inner delta, land is scarce.
Annual rural income lies within the US $60 - 70 per capita range or about
two thirds of the average rural income for low-income sub-Saharan
countries.
2.  Livestock Subsector
1.02      The country's livestock constitutes the major store of wealth and
income in rural areas. Livestock production, based on 6.4 million cattle
and 12.4 million goats and sheep, still relies on an extensive semi-nomadic
grazing  pattern.  However,  the encroachment of crop cultivation into
grazing lands, resulting from migration and population growth, has severely
constrained this type of land use In certain areas. Livestock production,
limited by the lack of watering points in the North and by Tsetse fly in
the South,  is of three major types:   (i) the patoral system;  (ii)
livestock associated with dryland and irrigated agriculture; and (iii)
agro-pastoralism, where livestock is owned by farmers, but provides less
than half of their total revenues. The last two systems are overtaking the
first one in importance, a process accelerated by recent droughts which
forced many pastoralists to sell their anlials. Livestock is second to
cotton as earner of recorded export revenues. Integration of crops and
livestock is increasing, particularly in the cotton producing areas where
the use of manure as fertilizer has increased rapidly over the past few
years.
3.  Project Area
1.03      The project area covered the whole 5th Region and the District of
Niafunk6 (part of the 6th Region). The most productive part of the region
is the "live" delta of the Niger River covering about 18,000 kma2, which
normally floods from early September to late November. The delta, with its
alluvial soils, annual inundation and highly productive dry season grazing
areas, represents the largest single area In Sahelian West Africa with a
potential for intensified crop and livestock production. After the floods



- 2 -
recede, the flood plains provide dry season grazing to most of the cattle
and small ruminants of the project area.
1.04      The population of the 5th Region is estimated at 1.3 million (20%
of Mali's population) of which some 220,000 reside permanently in the
delte.. The population density is highest in the eastern part, reaching
50/km2.  Mopti, the regional capital t;lth over 50,000 inhabitants, is the
third largest urban center of Mali. The ethnic composition of the delta is
mixed, with many descendants of the origirslly nomadic Peul and associated
groups now settled in villages.  The P.uls' main source of capital and
income is livestock, but many of them have adopted crop cultivation. The
pressure on land is growing rapidly because many of the Dogon and Bambara
people3 of the drought-stricken uplands in the East and South are migrating
to the better-watered delta to take up crop cultivation there.
1.05      The three primary economic activities in the area are, in order
of  importance,  livestock,  crop  production  and  fishing.   The  original
livestock production systems are transhumant, predominantly practiced by
the Peul and the Tamachek. The flood plains of the delta provide grazing
during the dry season. During the rainy season, all animals, except for
some village milk cows, leave the inundated delta to graze the pastures to
the East and West, where they rely on natural ponds for water.
The Project
1.06      The Mali Livestock Project (Credit 538-MLI) was of the four IDA
credits for agriculture the first for livestock development. The objectives
of the project were to rationalize the use of land and water.  It was to
help about 100,000 pastoralist families to rebuild and improve their herds
and to protect them against the effects of future droughts and to introduce
grazing  control,   vital   to  livestock  production   and   development.
Pastoralists would have user rights to land and watering facilities granted
and safeguarded by the Government on condition that the land and facilities
were properly maintained and that grazing was controlled. To facilitate
regulation and control, the project aimed at combining pastoralists into
legally constituted groups.
1.07      At the time of appraisal, in February 1974, Mali had just had the
worst drought in 50 years that caused major livestock losses in cattle:
15-20% of the country's herd. Livestock's share of GDP declined from 20%
in 1969 to 17% in 1972 and certainly further thereafter.   Until then
livestock numbers had more than doubled in the previous 25 years and for
cattle the annual rate of Increase was almost 6% from 1960-1970. From 1960
to 1972 livestock exports more than doubled and reached a yearly level of
220,000 live cattle and 210,000 sheep and goats or about 30% of annual
livestock production and 40% of all exports.
1.08      About 40% of Mali's cattle were raised by Peuls, 30% by Touaregs
and Bellas and 10% by Maures, all traditional producers. The remaining 20%
of the cattle were raised by Bambara, Malay, and Dogon farmers. Nomads
were reported to settle, giving up nomadism.  Transhumance remained the
predominant production system. Except for the wet herd, which remained in



- 3 -
the villages, cattle moved to find forage.  The principle problem facing
the  development  of  Mali's  livestock  industry,  and  especially  the
traditional industry of the Sahelian zone, was the progressive degradation
of pastures. Considering the country's potential for livestock production
and the need to help the rural poor, in particular the pastoralists, the
IDA credit was approved.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION AND PROCESSING
A. Origin and Processing
2.01      Government's 1974-1978 Plan and subsequent 1979-1981 investment
program gave absolute priority to food production investments designed to
prevent a recurrence of the shortages experienced in the 1972-73 droughts. 1/
IDA lending for livestock development was a logical follow-up after three
credits for agriculture extending some assistance to the veterinary service
had been given to Mali. 2/ Mali's livestock industry contributed 20% to
the GDP in 1969, but declined to 17% when the droughts hit in 1972.  In
1970 the livestock population included 5.4 million cattle and about 11
million sheep and goats. Fifteen to twenty percent of the cattle were lost
during the 1972/73 drought. An international emergency effort was launched
in an attempt to relieve some of the effects of the drought on the
livestock  industry.   Small,  short-term  projects  were  financed.   The
IDA-financed Drought Relief Fund Project was one of them. The effects of
the 1972/73 droughts spurred the recognition for long term projects aimed
at more rational land and pasture use in the Sahelian Zone and development
of more efficient beef and milk production in parts of Mali.
2.02      The Bank's Regional Mission ir West Africa (RMWA) identified the
project in October 1970 and prepared it thereafter.
2.03      RMWA's project preparation was based on FAC-financed SEDES and
IEMVT studies and supported by Malian Government Services. RMWA suggested
the project include:
-    construction of 85 wells and 20 ponds;
-    animal health and extension services;
-    construction of 5 livestock markets and one abattoir;
-    a trial station for fodder and livestock research;
-    preparation of a second phase project; and

1974.

-    personnel training.
2.04      A Bank mission 3/ appraised the project in January/February 1974.
It proposed a livestock development program for the 5th Region. It amended
the RMWA project concept to include 120 water points (instead of 105), and
a hide drying unit for the abattoir. Resource management was to become a
key issue.  Therefore, the Bank's mission proposed the inclusion of (a) a
livestock extension service and a pastoral service for grazing control; (b)
an abattoir and hide drying unit; (c) animal health services; (d) construc-
tion of water points; (e) construction and management of cattle markets;
and (f) a trial station for fodder and livestock research. An autonomous
Government agency, ODEM, was to implement the project and plan further
development in livestock production.
2.05      The issues paper adopted the proposal but sought clarification on
two matters: (i) Government's participation in project financing; and (ii)
participation of other agencies.
2.06      The Decision Meeting recorded:  (i) that Government's participa-
tion would be about 5l of total cost and that IDA would provide the
remaining 85X; (ii) the participation of other agencies, in particular
USAID, would be pursued. Government wanted to ask FAC about the prospects
of deputing some technical assistance staff.
2.07      Negotiations took place in Washington from December 10 to 12,
1974 and resulted in no major changes in project concept and design. The
Bank relaxed some conditions proposed by the appraisal report:  (i) the
issuance of a decree establishing the project agency ODEM became a
condition of effectiveness rather than one of Board presentation, as the
Malian delegation brought an acceptable draft decree to the negotiations;
and (ii) also as a condition of effectiveness, the Malians agreed to
appoint a director, a deputy director, and an administrative officer. The
CVs submitted by the Malian candidates were found suitable. In view of the
complexity of the project the Bank proposed, and the Malian delegation
agreed to appoint a second Deputy Director, an expatriate with broad exper-
ience. 4/ He would be responsible for the planning and organization; the
Malian Deputy would be in charge of all technical aspects of the project.
2.08      The Bank increased the credit amount from US $11.7 million to
US $12.2 million to cover the increased costs due to a negative dollar
exchange rate which had raised project cost estimates, and to prefinance an

agro-industrial specialist (all three IDA), a hydro-geological
consultant, a socio-economic consultant, a livestock consultant

Credit Agreement and the first expatriate deputy director was never
replaced after 1978 (para 4.12).

initial US  $200,000 equivalent  to the project's  revolving  fund.   The
establishment of the revolving fund was a condition of effectiveness
because of the extraordinarily difficult financial situation of the Govern-
ment, partly attributable to the drought. The credit amount was further
increased to US $13.3 million before Board presentation to finance the
project's foreign exchange costs (US $9.0 million), and 52% (US $4.3
million equivalent) of local currency costs. The total project cost was at
the time estimated to be equivalent to US $17.3 million.
2.09      The Executive Directors approved the credit on February 11, 1975.
Speakers generally noted that the project was inevitably risky, but was
justified by the prospect of benefitting large numbers of the rural poor.
Speakers particularly mentioned the precarious 'alance between natural
resources and livestock in the Sahel and the difficulties of implementing a
project there.  It was recommended to proceed cautiously and to ensure
effective grazing control. Speakers asked the Bank to be on guard against
over-optimism toward changes in the social behavior of the beneficiaries to
achieve controlled grazing. The need for closer than usual supervision and
the readiness to reassess the project, if it did not proceed as planned,
was emphasized.
2.10      The credit effectiveness date was set for July 24, 1975 and the
project became effective on this date.
B. Project Description and Objectives
2.11      The project was to be carried out over the five years, 1975-79,
in the 5th Region and was to include the:
(a)  introduction of livestock extension services and grazing control
in three special development areas;
(b)  provision of improved animal health services throughout the 5th
Region;
(c)  construction of 70 wells and 50 ponds;
(d)  construction and management of an abattoir and hide-drying unit
at Mopti-Sevare;
(e)  construction and management of five livestock markets;
(f)  establishment and management of a 150-ha livestock and pasture
trial station, an incomplete take-over of the Drought Relief Fund
Project; 5/

- 6 -
(g) provision of personnel training and introduction of a functional
literacy program for pastoralists; and
(h) preparation of a second-phase livestock project.
2.12      In three areas - one of about 5,000 km2 and two other areas of
together about 1,000 km2 - permanent watering facilities were to be con-
structed, and animal health and extension services pr,vided. Other areas
of about 10,000 km2 were to be provided with seasonal ponds and improved
animal health services. The location of the ponds was to help increase the
pasture land available at the beginning of the dry season, and thereby
reduce the over-grazing of the dry season pastures in the Niger Delta.
2.13      The project's incremental cattle production was expected to add
annually about 14,500 t of carcass weight or 12% to Mali's 1970 domestic
beef output by PY12 (full development). This would include 33,000 surplus
heifers and 73,000 feeder steers. In addition, the project was to produce
about 4,400 t of edible offal, 137,000 hides, and 20 million kg of milk.
The sheep and goat flock was estimated to increase from 2 million to 2.5
million. Incremental output of sheep and goats was estimated to be 1,800 t
of carcass meat, 540 t of editable offal, 150,000 skins, and 3.5 million kg
of milk. The family average annual cash income from livestock production
in PY12 (full development) was estimated at US $222 (MF 100,000) compared
to US $144 (MF 65,000) without the project, assuming that all 100,000
beneficiaries share equally in the overall benefits, each owning 20 cattle
and 5-10 sheep.
2.14      Total project costs were estimated at US $17.3 million (MF 7.78
billion) with an estimated foreign exchange cost of US $9.0 million (MP
4.04 billion) or 52%.  The proposed IDA credit of US $13.3 million was
expected to cover the total foreign exchange costs and 52% (US $4.3
million) of local currency costs. The IDA credit was on standard terms, 50
years with 10 years grace period at 0.75% interest rate.
2.15      To implement the project and for all livestock detelopment, in
the 5th Region, the Government established the "Operation de D6veloppement
de l'Elevage de la Region de Mopti" (ODEM), under the Ministry of
Production (para 4.01). The establishment of ODEM with responsibilities
and powers acceptable to IDA was a condition of effectiveness. The sole
Government livestock agency for the 5th Region had been until then the
Regional Livestock Service of the Ministry of Production, which had
provided veterinary service only. The project, however, required an agency
unifying its diverse and novel programs.
2.16      ODEM was to be empowered with authority to grant in agreement
with the regional administration user rights to grazing lands and watering
facilities, to issue and enforce grazing control regulations, and to
prescribe conditions for their use (para 4.01). OtEM was to be supported
by  four  internationally  recruited  technical  specialists:   a  deputy
director, a range management officer, a water development officer, and a
pasture agronomist.



-7-
2.17      The project was to rationalize the use of land and water   It was
to help about 100,000 pastoralist families to rebuild and improve their
herds and to protect them against the effects of future droughts, and to
introduce grazing control, vital to livestock production and development.
A combination of incentives, regulation and education was needed to make
grazing control effective:  regulation without education would have meant
friction between pastoralists and authorities; education alone would have
produced results too slowly; and neither would have had any lasting effect
in the absence of strong incentives.  Incentives and enforcement measures
were to be adapted to tribal customs in the project area.  Provision of
livestock markets were an incentive for destocking (para 3.31).
2.18      Pastoralists  would  have  user  rights  to  land  and  watering
facilities, granted and safeguarded by the Government, on condition that
the land and facilities were properly maintained and that grazing was
controlled. The grant to use land and facilities would be an incentive and
would present an opportunity to participate in further development such as
fencing, construction of additional watering facilities, planting and
maintenance of fodder trees and firebreaks, etc. To facilitate regulation
and control, the project aimed at combining pastoralists into legally
constituted groups.
2.19      The project was from the beginning considered part of a long term
development. Eighteen man-months of consultant services were provided for
the preparation of a Regional Livestock Development Plan and a follow-on
project. Methods of introducing grazing control were new. The formation
of grazing associations was untried. Under the current project the areas
to be provided with permanent and seasonal watering facilities covered only
about 20% of the 5th Region.  The experience of the project would help
launch a second phase project and facilitate its spread to other areas.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Start-up
3.01      The Government set the stage for an early start-up by fulfilling
the conditions for project effectiveness without delay.  One of the first
supervision missions reported that "the project - headed by an active,
competent and forward-looking management team - is getting off to a good
start." 6/   But the same report recognizes that "the project is still
about six months behind schedule", as the 1975 activities never progressed
beyond organization and establishment of ODEM.
3.02      ODEM,  responsible for most of the start-up activities had to
establish and organize itself.  It had limited experience and was a novice
in conducting the type of studies which were required for the project.
Furthermore ODEM had few precedents to follow which could have served as
6/   Progress Report of January 8, 1976



-8-
examples. Procurement and recruitment of expatriate consultants and senior
Malian personnel continued into the second project year, and even into the
later project implementation period. Appraisal estimates for start-up time
were evidently overly optimistic.
3.03      Project-related studies  7/ were initially delayed by about one
year, because of a mix-up. During negotiations it was lecided that IER,
responsible for research and evaluation, would be in charge of these
studies. Project documents however showed ODEM responsible. Finally in
March 1978, IER was asked to take over and prepare more detailed TORs and
to carry out the studies under RNWA's supervision.
3.04      By June 1976 construction works on the Mopti-Trial Station were
still incomplete and not up to standard.  Funds from the Drought Relief
Project were exhausted. At that time IDA requested that Government submit
research plans for the station which would not duplicate research done
elsewhere in Africa.
3.05      From the start the construction of the abattoir was delayed
because the construction site became a matter of dispute between the
Ministries of Production and Defense, the latter being responsible for land
allocation.   The municipality of Mopti allocated a new site in November,
1976 (para 3.11).
3.06      The Animal Health Service initially appeared to be working with
good results. Increasing vaccination figures were reported until the March
1978 supervision mission questioned the validity of these records.  The
mission recommended the replacement of the service's management resulting
in a more efficient Animal Health Service and larger scale vaccination
campaigns.
B. Revisions of Project Components
3.07      Plans for the livestock extension and grazing control components,
the construction of water points, the use of the Mopti Trial Station, the
preparation of the follow-on project and the abattoir construction were all
revised during implementation.
3.08      Livestock Extension,  Pasture Management and Water Point Con-
struction: Livestock extension with grazing control and water points con-
struction was to be concentrated in the Seno Mango, an area of nearly
500,000 ha lightly grazed because of lack of stock water, rather than
implemented equally intensively in all three grazing areas.  The credit
agreement specifies (Section 3.11) that (a) well construction be preceded
7/   eight pre-investment studies and ten studies aiming at the preparation
of a Livestock Development Plan in the 5th Region including
identification of a future investment program and the preparation of
the Seno Mango grazing scheme.



-9-
by a development plan for the Seno Mango and be phased to provide an
opportunity to weigh further construction against technicai4 and managerial
results,  and  (b)  agropastoralists  be  organized  into  agropastoral
development units, elect development committees and sign land usufruct
rights.
3.09      Upon  ODEM's  suggestions,  supervision  missions  dealing  with
differing interpretations of the credit agreement between project
management and IDA, and facing technical difficulties in the field, changed
the sequence of development for the pasture management component:
(a)  In November 1976, ODEM requested and IDA agreed to develop the
scheme in two phases: (i) by dividing the project area into four
pastoral development units, an administrative step; and (ii) by
forming grazing associations within each pastoral development
unit after livestock producers better understand the project's
objectives and after their social structure be better known to
ODEM. ODEM management was firmly convinced that well drilling
should precede the organization of pastoralists and that drilling
begin near villages peripheral to the Seno Mango area;
(b)  In May 1977 tle supervision mission agreed with ODEM that a
program of quick benefit be launched which would include
deworming, the provision of mineral licks, the development of
stock water and firebreaks;
(c)  In October  1977, ODEM,  convinced of having attained a more
intimate understanding of the socio-economic conditions in the
Seno Mango, decided to move the headquarters of the pastoral
units to more congenial surroundings: the administrative centers
of Diankabou, Dinangourou, Douentza and Boni;
(d)  In April 1978, the findings of the first drilling campaign and
the difficulties encountered during the second, made it clear
that the costs for watering point construction in the Seno Mango
would be much higher than expected. The hydrological findings of
drilling expl-rations were disappointing compared with appraisal
expectations (para 4.18). By then management and the exteasion
officers had surveyed pasture and village socio-economic
structures;  the tree planting operation was under way;   and
through the functional literacy program, several aspects of the
grazing scheme had already been introduced to pastoralists. It
was therefore decided to begin with the organization of grazing
associations without relying on the construction of water points;
(e)  By October 1978, however, there was no progress in organizing
pastoralist;, and no specific livestock program dealing with
cattle was underway (para 3.20-3.23). The results of the second
drilling campaign proved that the well construction program, as
proposed at appraisal, was not equally feasible for the entire
Seno Mango because of geological constraints (depth of the
underground water, difficulty in discovering the faults and their



- 10 -
locations at 120 m) and the inaccessibility of certain sites
(pars  3.14).   Even where  borehole  drilling  might  have  been
effective, water extraction from a depth of 100-120m, as would
often have been required, was believed neither reliable nor
economically feasible.  The average construction costs of both
wells (40-70m) and boreholes reached an unacceptable level (about
US  $130,000  per  watering  point).   Therefore  the  mission
recommended, and ODEM management agreed, to cancel further
drilling investments in the Seno Mango, but to pursue the
organization of pastoralists into grazing associations in the
area surrounding wells or boreholes which were under construction
in eastern Seno Mango. Here contracts on exclusive land rights,
water facilities and equipment were to be signed between the
grazing associations and ODEM; and
(f) The March 1979 supervision mission established that no contracts
had been signed or even prepared on exclusive land rights even
though the completion of 180 km of firebreaks, the testing of one
windmill and four manual pumps, the extension of the functional
literacy  program  and  the  establishment  of  medical  drug
dispensaries for human health were noted.. ODEM's efforts had
concentrated on these and animal health (distribution of mineral
licks, castration, treatment against parasites) rather than the
formation of grazing associations.
3.10      In November 1976, the Mopti Trial Station was reduced from 150 ha
to 65 ha because (i) appraisal estimates for funds were too low; and (ii)
it was questionable whether 150 ha were necessary for the research (pasture
trials with Bourgou grass in the higher Niger Delta). By the end of 1977
25 ha were cultivated and another 40 ha approved for irrigation. Between
US $1.5 million 8/ and US $2.0 million 9/ were spent for development and
research on the station. The 1979 supervision mission effected its closure
(para 3.28).
3.11      Abattoir and Hide Drying Unit  The construction site of the
abattoir became a matter of dispute.  The mix-up caused a delay of four
years. The refrigeration plant was excluded because carcasses were to be
picked up after slaughter, eliminating cold storage (para 3.32).
8/   Mopti Rice (Cr. 277-MLI), US  56.9 millioni approved in 1972; Drought
Relief Fund (Cr. 443-MLI) US $ 2.5 million approved in 1973; and
Integrated Rural Development (Cr. 491-MLI) US $8 million approved in
1974.

3.12      Project preparation for a follow-on project was unsuccessfully
attempted by IER who did not complete the studies necessary for project
preparation. Eventually, with ILCA assistance, the studies were completed
in June 1982 (paras 3.33 and 4.20).  FAO/CP identified and prepared the
project thereafter, and submitted the preparation document to Government in
February 1983.
3.13      The revisions, the incomplete project implementation and unspent
IDA funds caused the project closing date to be extended three times. The
first extension (December 1979 to June 1980) was to allow investments to be
completed and sufficient time for preparation of a possible interim phase
program. The preparation of the follow-on-project was originally assigned
to t'le IER which was also responsible for project monitoring and
evaluation; however by the end of 1979. IER and ODEM had not prepared a
project proposal. Yet the preparation of a follow-on project was important
as Government and IDA wished to continue assistance to Mali's livestock
development. Therefore a second extension to prepare the follow-on project
became  necessary:   from June  30,  1980  to June  30,  1982.   The  third
extension to June 1984 was required to complete the project preparation and
to link the two projects.  The momentum finally achieved after years of
problems and the benefits anticipated for pastoral organizations during the
extension period were not to be lost.  In November 1985 the follow-on
project became effective as the Mopti Area Development Project.
C. Implementation
3.14      Construction of Water Points;  Pasture Management Component
The many difficulties in project implementation led to its classification
as a problem project from April 1978 onward.  From then on it was also
realized that the construction of water points in the Seno Mango was far
more difficult than proposed at appraisal.  Management problems and cost
overruns became stifling. The disappointing results had an irreversibly
negative effect on other project components, especially the formation of
grazing associations as part of the pasture management component.
3.15      The Seno Mango area is surrounded by 16 very old traditional
wells and 13 ponds (plus the 11 wells and five equipped boreholes con-
structed under the project.) Estimates of total water resources show that
during the rainy season, from July to October, ponds and surface collection
amply cover the water demand. From October to July, during the dry season,
water resources diminish to the extent that only ca. 10,000 head of cattle
can be watered daily. The estimated cattle population in the area however
is several hundred thousand, making the problem immense. Over-grazing of
pastures near watering points is common, intensified by the fact that most
of the permanent watering points are located near rainy season ponds or
surface water collection points.  This holds true in particular for the
western part of the Seno Mango.  The best pastures under-utilized, are
located in the central and eastern-central parts where there are few
watering facilities.
3.16      Of the 70 wells proposed at appraisal only 11 were sunk (only
five with wat'er flows as expected at appraisal).  It became clear by 1978
that (i) well construction costs far exceeded appraisal estimates (para



- 12 -
3.09) and as a result, Op6rations Puits would have difficulties fulfilling
its commitment of the first 11 wells and therefore would not be able to
sign a second contract;   (ii) some of the selected sites could not be
reached by the drilling set; (iii) only 50% of the boreholes drilled were
successful; and (iv) no cheap and reliable means of water extraction would
be possible from water table levels which ranged from 50 to 80 meters. It
was  therefore decided  to stop new borehole/well drilling and  to test
various means of water extraction by handpumps, a windmill ar'd a solar
pump. Successful water extraction would facilitate the formation of grazing
associations in the eastern part of the Seno Mango area, at least to serve
as example for the follow-on project.
3.17      The   test   results   of   water   extraction   equipment   were
disappointing.   The windmill never worked properly.   Handpumps neither
produced sufficient flow nor were they reliable at the depth at which they
were installed. Efforts were made by ODEM between 1979 and 1981 to develop
a workshop to manufacture handpumps. Following the July 1979 Supervision
proposal, such a workshop was set up under the leadership of an expatriate
technician, Mr. Gabriel Bourrier, a priest recruited locally, formerly
employed as ODEM's garage-chief. He succeeded in manufacturing and selling
both in Mali and abroad, dozens of handpumps locally made and designed by
him. The five models of "Bourga" pumps were tested along with other
imported models in the Seno Mango and the delta fringe and proved to be by
far better adapted. They became well known in Mali and abroad, and dozens
of them were sold at a profit to clients who had ordered them in advance.
Mr. Bourrier had officially registered his models and was willing to enter
into  some  kind  of  contractual  association  with  ODEM  or  the  Malian
Government.  Since the latter failed to give him enough of a guaranty,
Mr. Bourrier did not renew his contract with ODEM beyond 1981. The solar
pump was finally installed in November 1979 at Boni, a site in the eastern
central part of  the Seno Mango.   Although it pumped less water than
expected, with an average daily flow of 15 mi, it allowed the grazing of
pasture land hardly used before. In theory, the installation of the solar
pump would have allowed approximately 600 heads of cattle to graze all year
round on a grazing area of almost 18,000 ha with water resources of about
15m3 per day.  Potential users number ca. 7,000 cattle and thousands of
small ruminants.  Few cattle from the Seno Mango area move to the Niger
Delta during the dry season increasing the problem of over-grazing. ODEM
was asked to negotiate a contract with the pump site's traditional land
holders to permit the use of pasture land in the peripheral areas still
accessible to the pump site in an attempt to integrate grazing associations
and  traditional  land users.   ODEM discussed  the matter with  relevant
parties and a contract was prepared but never signed. Due to a drought the
pastoralists moved away halting these efforts. But the Boni association
became the first grazing association and remained so even when the pump
broke down and was not replaced by the firm.
3.18      After substantial delays a contract was agreed upon by IDA for
the construction of 20 ponds in the western delta area.  Cause for the
delays were the high number of bids and ODEM's inability to prepare a



- 13 -
documented plan for site locations.   In 1979 at a total cost of nearly
MF 230 million the ponds were dug. The construction work was apparently
monitored by the GR.  The construction was well done, the excavated earth
had been taken far enough back from each pond to avoid backfill.  During
the first rainy season only 1 to 5 m9 per pond had drained back.  Before
their completion, ODEM had presented a plan to the Bank for 30 more ponds
in the eastern delta area.  After a survey of many of the new sites, the
April 1978 supervision mission rejected the program for insufficient
preparation.  Most of the sites were located in areas where the pasture
problem was over-grazing rather than water.
3.19      Of the 54 borehole drillings 28 were positive, with flows ranging
from 1 to 18 m3 per hour.  Two boreholes were from the start treated as
exploratory drillings; they have no casings and cannot be developed. The
remaining 26 are potential watering facilities and are located:
(i)   in the Seno Mango and surrounding area:
- five wells with sufficient flow (4 m3 and over/hr),
- six wells with insufficient flow (from 0.5 to
3 m3/hr),
- five equipped boreholes (one solar pump, one windmill
(not in operation), three Bourga),
- two boreholes not yet equipped;
(ii) in the western delta area:
- seven boreholes not yet equipped; and
(iii) at the Fatoma Market:
- one equipped well.
3.20      The pasture management component was risky (see para 2.09 and
3.09) and difficult because of its new approach (e.g. introduction of
grazing control through the formation of grazing associations), the
region's  harsh  environment,  remoteness  and  poor  infrastructure.   The
pastoralists, generally suspicious of Government interference, were equally
suspicious of project benefits. Initial weak management of ODEM only added
to the problem as did the differing interpretation of the Credit Agreement
between IDA and ODEM management and the disappointing development in water
point construction.
3.21      ODEM suggested that to promote grazing associations,  the four
pastoral unit headquarters be moved to more congenial surroundings, (para
3.09) where villagers were also interested in grazing associations in the
Seno Mango and where well construction would support their efforts.  But



- 14 -
even the relocation did not yet promote this most difficult projact
component because of continued difficulties in water point construction.
But finally, during the interim period, pastoral associations were formed
around nine newly drilled boreholes equipped with pumps (para 4.07). All
of these associations manage their natural resources to some extent. One,
Boni, is legally recognized. Eight are awaiting legal recognition through
an official  letter  from  the Governor  of  the  5th  Region.   A  legally
recognized association is fully in charge of its designated grazing area
which it protects by employing watchmen on camels. Associations rmay extend
temporary grazing rights by written contracts to herdsemen passing through.
ODEM then also concentrated its efforts on programs which helped the
grazing association idea 10/:
(a)  functional literacy:  this program began in 1978 with the devel-
opment of seven functional literacy centers.   It was observed
that farmers of the Dogon tribe were more interested in the
classes than herders, mostly Peuls, even though classes were held
in Poular. The program was continued in 1979 in five additional
centers. In 1980, however due to a local drought, most potential
participants fled the area, and only one center remained open;
(b)  firebreaks:  ODEM tried to persuade the local population to make
firebreaks throughout the Seno Mango area.  Almost 180 km of
firebreaks were completed in 1978 and 200 km more in 1979. ODEM
paid workers MF 11,500 per km and supplied drinking water which
helped to make this program a partial success;
(c)  reforestation.  a forestry agent was hired in 1977 to develop a
tree nursery in Douentza. From there almost 7,000 plants (neems
and prosopis) were distributed to the Seno Mango villages.
Approximately 30% took root; and
(d)  human health program:   ODEM developed,  with the help of the
Health Department in Mopti and Douentza, a human health program
establishing medical drug dispensaries and training medical drug
dispensors and mid-wives, and teaching first aid to interested
villagers.  ODEM funded the initial purchase of medicines and
paid all training costs. In Douentza medicines, their sales, and
the training courses were organized by the representative of the
Health Department of Douentza. ODEM paid for operating costs.
3.22      ODEM's  Veterinary  Service  consisted  of  staff  with  extensive
knowledge of the region's livestock problems. However, because of initial
rigid management it was not efficiently deployed. The result: vaccines
10/ Supervision Report of August 7, 1980



- 15 -
and drugs were frequently ordered too late.  Since it was never monitored
properly, the first free distribution of drugs against parasites in 1977
became a relative failure.  Vaccination campaigns were not carried out as
required and serious disease outbreaks reoccurred.
3.23      In late 1978 two experienced and motivated veterinarians were put
in charge.   From this time on the service was kept supplied with the
veterinary equipment as foreseen at appraisal and was regularly supplied
with vaccines and drugs.  The veterinary staff in the field was closely
guided. Upon ODEM's reorganization in 1979 the Animal Health Service was
regionally divided into three zones (western, central and eastern). Each
zone was headed by a zone chief who was automatically sector chief for the
Central Department of his zone. Head of the Service, combining all regions
was ODEM's deputy director, responsible for all technical matters as well
as extension activities in the entire region.
3.24      The vaccinati ^ campaigns were off to a bad start (3.22).  From
1978 onward, however w.ch experienced veterinarians (3.23) more than 3
million vaccinations were made in one year compared to fewer than 1.2
million in 1975. In 1979 approximately 75% of the total cattle population
was vaccinated against Rinderpest alone. These results are excellent for a
region  where  transhumance  is  prevalent.   Vaccinations  against  CBPP,
blackleg and pasteurellosis, rarely administered before project begin, also
increased.
3.25      In special project development areas treatment against parasites,
drugs, insecticides and mineral licks were to be given free of charge in
PYI and PY2. As grazing associations were not as yet formed and drugs had
been ordered too late, the first campaign against parasites was carried out
in 1977. Although conducted on a small scale numerically, it covered the
entire region.  The number of treatments increased in 1978, but due to
their dispersion and because no test lots were monitored, the effects of
the treatment are not known and have been estimated insignificant. When by
1979, drugs against internal parasites were no longer distributed free of
charge, their use declined considerably. By June 1980, however, treatments
for the current year already equalled the total of 1979.
3.26      Extension activities:  Already in 1978, Bank supervision missions
pointed out that the veterinary staff, active in the entire region, experi-
enced in livestock matters, responsible for vaccination campaigns and
animal health care, was chronically underemployed. The repeated recommen-
dations to depute some extension work to this staff were reflected by
ODEM's reorganization in late 1979.  An assessment of the staff's prior
input led to the establishment of a time-table which permitted their
participation in the intensified parasite campaigns, castration, hay
storage, supply of feed supplements, pasture improvements, and herd moni-
toring. By June 1980 a small scale improvement, particularly in the Mopti
department was noticeable:  (i) 40 tons of hay were collected in the Rihe
II project perimeter and almost sold in total at full cost to herdowners;
(ii) 100 tons of cotton seed and 10 tons of molasses were supplied also at
full cost to herdowners; (iii) small-scale experiments were carried out
with the full participation of villagers: range pasture land was freed from

Mimosa pigra, a dominant weed of the Inner Delta "Bourgouttibres"; and (iv)
to improve pastures, forage seeds were sown in two areas.

3.27      Headquarters office, housing and garage  Construction of the ODEM
headquarters housing and workshop was completed in 1978. It Included 12
houses, one office building, onre workshop with a special handpump repair
shop, and storage facilities for spare parts, fuel, vaccines, drugs, etc.
3.28      Mopti Trial Station   The embankment of the 150 ha Mopti Trial
Station was comnleted in 1979, as were the buildings, offices, housing
facilities for a watchman and sheds. Works on the electricity connections
and  water  supply  were  not  yet  terminated.   Unfortunately,  due  to
deficiencies in the embankment only 12 ha with full water control and 13 ha
with  incomplete  water  control  could  be  cultivated.   This  fact,  bad
management, and ODEM's inability to use the trial station to promote
project objectives, led the October 1979 supervision mission to recommend
its closure. Agreed to by Government, the station then served as storage
space for rice straw sold to herders.
3.29      Animal Health Buildings:  Three veterinary posts and nine vac-
cination yards were completed on contract.  In addition, ODEM pursued the
renovation and maintenance of existing veterinary buildings on force
account throughout the project area.
3.30      Seno Mango Construction:   The construction on force account of
14 stores and buildings to accommodate ODEM staff in the Seno Mango area
was completed in 1980 despite long delays and substantial cost overruns.
As activities in the Seno Mango area were reduced on recommendation of
supervision missions, and the extension staff was moved in December 1979,
the buildings were generally used as homes for veterinary staff.
3.31      Only one livestock market at Fatoma was constructed instead of
the five suggested at appraisal.   IDA did not agree to finance further
construction because of substantial cost overruns (MF 69 million compared
to MF 22 million appraisal estimate). The Fatoma Market is in operation.
The livestock owners frequent it and are not reluctant to pay the user's
fee. The 1985 revenues (F 5.3 million) and presentation of cattle (24,529)
and small ruminants (40,913) were between 15 and 18 times those of 1979,
the first year of operation (paras 2.17 and 5.07).
3.32      Mopti/Sevarg Abattoir and Hide Drying Unit   After a dispute over
the construction site between the Ministries of Production and Defense the
municipality of Mopti allocated a new site in November 1976. Bids for the
construction  were  submitted  by November  1978.   Construction  began  in
January 1979. Construction of both the abattoir and the hide drying unit
was completed in 1980. The abattoir was first used in January 1981 with a
throughput of 20 cattle per day, its capacity being 48 cattle and 100 sheep
and goats.
3.33      Project  Extension  and  Follow-on  Project    The  Project  was
extended three times (para 3.13) from its original closing date of December
1979 to:
June 1980,     first  extension
June 30, 1982, second extension



- 18 -
June 30, 1984, third extension
The extensions from 1980 to 1984 are also referred to as the interim
period, linking the first project and the current follow-on project.
3.34      By June 1980, the first extended closing date, US $3.5 million
IDA credit funds were unspent. At this point IDA contemplated 11/ either
stopping the project but continuing to support the sector along lines to be
defined; or financing a program reduced to pastoral organizations and
hydraulics,  or financing a comprehensive program including financing some
of ODEM's operating costs for animal health activities. The comprehensive
program was preferred  (para 3.35).   The project's experimental pasture
management component through the formation of grazing associations remained
to be implemented, the construction of water points was incomplete, the
livestock production potential in the 5th Region was still immense.
3.35      IDA believed that the concept of the pasture management component
was essentially correct and that the organization of pastoralists should be
tried in the Niger Delta area, where a village social structure existed
and, where most of the project livestock was concentrated. The veterinary
services anu successful vaccination campaigns needed to be continued with
the  Malian  livestock  services,  strengthened  by  project  experience,
implementing the follow-on project. A sector mission of RMWA, FAO/CP and
IDA staff confirmed the feasibility of potential development. IDA did not
want to turn its back on a sector that is of primary importance to Mali. 12/
3.36      A second extension was proposed.  The extension was to become
effective as soon as Government had negotiated a contract with ILCA and
ODEM was reorganized and two expatriates hired (livestock specialist,
financial management specialist). A two year extension was decided, the
new closing date being June 30, 1982.
3.37      By June 1982 US $1.8 million were still left of the IDA credit
538-MLI.  The three components of the second extension (1980-1982) phase
were in various stages of completion: (i) the hydrological survey to find
viable well sites outside the Niger Delta area, was completed and the
report expected in February 1983; (ii) the research on existing livestock
production systems was not yet terminated; and (iii) the formation and
monitoring of grazing associations would follow the report on production
systems.  On-going project components needed to be continued, especially
-the livestock extension services and the successful vaccination campaigns.
11/  Supervision Report of August 7, 1980
12/  eight pre-investment studies and ten studies aiming at the preparation
of a Livestock Development Plan in the 5th Region including
identification of a future investment program and the preparation of
the Seno Mango grazing scheme.



- 19 -
Furthermore, the surveys and studies of a renewed extension were important
for the preparation of the follow-on project through FAO/CP.  The project
vas extended for the third time from June 1982 to June 1984.   13/ This
extension was considered the best way to avoid a financial gap in financing
ODEM's activities.  Bringing forward the 1986 Livestock II project would
have been more risky because experience with pastoral associations was
needed first.   The three project extensions are not an exception.   OED
found that all livestock projects in West Africa had been extended beyond
six months and that agricultural Projects evaluated from 1979-1983 showed
completion times of up to 277% of the appraisal average. 14/
D. Procurement
3.38      The procurement procedures of the loan agreement required LCB for
contracts of US $50,000 or higher and LCB for contracts less than
US $50,000. The SAR expected only the construction or renewal of about 50
ponds on force account by the GR. The credit agreement was more flexible
and extended the use of force account to the construction of about 30 wells
in the Niger Delta.
3.39      Procurement was generally handled efficiently.  The appointment
of international consultants was based on direct negotiations satisfactory
to IDA.    Apparent  delays  in procurement  of goods or works  could be
attributed  to  overly  optimistic  appraisal  estimates.   Problems  were
mutually resolved by IDA and the Borrower when:
(a) in September 1977 an IDA mission suspended a construction tempo-
rarily because procurement procedures had not been observed;
(b) an IDA mission reactivated the supply of cement to ODEM by
insisting that Government provide funds for the purchase of
cement;
(c) an IDA mission recommended test drilling in two shifts to accel-
erate progress; and
(d) reductions in construction work became necessary because of cost
increase.
3.40      Other than analyzing the inadequacy of boreholes and wells, the
supervision reports do not go into de il about the quality of works and
equipment.   Positive mention was however made about pond construction.
Excavations were of good quality with very little backfill during the first
rainy season (para 3.18).  References to the Mopti Trial Station mention

- 20 -
.deficiencies in the embankments which prevented full utilization of the 25
ha (para 3.28).  Earlier reports reported on unsatisfactory construction
quality of hydraulic structure.   15/  Construction of buildings was not
always satisfactory as ODEM discovered after take over.
The abattoir (para 3.32), its contracting and construction mainly
supervised by RMWA, became unnecessarily expensive because the two
contracts for civil works and for equipment were not coordinated. This
resulted in the dismantling and reconstruction of parts of the building to
fit  the  equipment.   Buildings  at  ODEM's  headquarters  were  not  well
designed: offices were sometimes flooded by rain water from the roof, and
imported turnable ventilator windows could not be replaced when broken.
Staff houses are too small and doors with glass panes impractical
considering the family size and the number of children. Veterinary posts
were generally overconstructed in number and size of buildings.
E.Project Costs
3.41      IDA monitored project costs throughout the implementation period.
IDA and the borrower agreed to reductions in project scope and to redefine
reasonable objectives as well as maintain total project costs within
appraisal estimates 16/ (Table 2).

F. Financing
3.42      The IDA Credit of US $13.3 million was given on standard terms to
the Government and was to finance 77% of project costs during the five-year
disbursement period  (Table 3).  The credit was to finance  100% of the
project's foreign exchange costs (US $9.0 million), and 52% (US $4.3
million) of local currency costs. The remaining 48% (US $4.0 million) of
the local currency costs were to be met by Government budget allocations
(US $ 3.4 million), ODEM's revenues (US $0.4 million), and livestock owners
(US$ 0.2 million). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Govern-
ment would make available its contribution to ODEM as a grant, quarterly in
advance, on the basis of ODEM's budgets plan.

3.43      With the disbursement of the IDA credit of US $13.3 million, ODEM
received  the  equivalent  of  FCFA  3,387,708,665.   This  amount  is FCFA
395,208,665 above the amount calculated at appraisal because of the altered
exchange rate from US $1-FCFA 225 at appraisal to US$1=FCFA 500 in June
1985.
3.44      Government's contribution increased from 20% of total project
costs (appraisal estimate) to 26.5% (actual cost).  This increase was due
to the unforeseen Government expenditures for the project's interim phase
form 1980 to 1984 which increased Government's total expenditure by FCFA
537,123,696 (from FCFA 1,033,759,694 appraisal estimate to FCFA 1,570,
883,390 at final disbursement), while the IDA credit of US $ 13.3 million
remained unchanged and the undisbursed amount, part of the 1975-1980 phase,
was used during the interim phase of 1980 to 1984.

G. Disbursements
3.45      Throughout  the project  disbursements  lagged  behind  appraisal
estimates and, (except for one quarter) never amounted to more than 52% of
the original estimates.   Only US $0.2 million were disbursed, one year
after loan effectiveness (from July 1975 through June 1976). At appraisal
the estimated disbursements for the same period had been US $4.7 million.
By the original loan closing date on December 31, 1979 only US $6.6 million
of a total of US $13.3 million were disbursed. The loan closing date was
extended three times, finally until June 30, 1984.  The last and total
disbursement was on August 20, 1985.  (See estimated and actual disburse-
ment schedule in Annex 1).
H. Covenants
3.46      The Borrower had difficulties complying with the Credit Agreement
covenants, yet IDA referred to Government only in the case of staff
recruitment  (Section 3.09) and contract of civil works.   Some covenants
were complied with late, others were not complied with.  Some covenants
were waived and others became obsolete because of the course the project
implementation had taken.
3.47      Audit Reports (Section 4.01) were generally received with one
year delay of requirement for five months after close of fiscal year.
ODEM's eight senior staff members (section 3.09 (b) Credit Agreement) were
recruited with delays and only after IDA's intervention. IDA received the
first monitoring report (Sections 3.05 & 3.13) only in the beginning of
1979. The construction of the abattoir (Section 3.07) was delayed because
of a dispute over the construction site which Government was to acquire.
Government's financial contribution to ODEM (Section 3.01) became delayed
which resulted in delayed procurement of cement for ODEM's construction
works.  Earlier projects reported of implementation delays because of a
shortage of cement at the national level.   19/
3.48      The preparation report for the follow-on project to be written by
IER (Section 3.02) based on the experience during project implementation
was never issued. It was ultimately prepared by FAO/CP in 1983 during the
interim phase of the two projects, with little reference to adaptable
experience for the follow-on project.  ODEM recruited personnel without
informing IDA (Section 3.09 (b) Credit Agreement), however IDA accepted the
appointments  retrospectively.   ODEM  did  not  fill  the  second  deputy
director's post when it became vacant in 1977 (Section 3.09 (c) Credit
Agreement).   In  1978  doubts  arose   on  the  veterinary  service  when
vaccination campaigns were poorly conducted and disease outbreaks became
frequent (Section 3.01). The Borrower did keep records of the total cost
of the project (Section 3.05). The compliance with reporting requirements
19/ 1980: PCR Mali-Mopti Rice Project (Credit 277-MLI)



- 24 -
(Section 3.05) was deficient as evidenced by the irregularity with which
IDA received reports.
3.49      Covenants were waived as project components were eliminated or
changed (e.g. 4.04 (b), 3.06, and 3.11 (b) Credit Agreement, on pastoralist
organizations, work on the Mopti Trial Station, and the sequence of
developing the Seno Mango grazing area). Covenants became partly obsolete
(Section 3.10) when ODEM did not have to use its authority to grant user
rights  for  grazing  land  and  watering  facilities  to  pastoralist
organizations as long as these had not been legally instituted.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A. Institutional Design
4.01      The formation of an implementing agency was made a prerequisite
to the project. ODEM, a branch of the Ministry of Production, was then
established by Government decree and was headquartered at Mopti SevarE. It
was the implementing agency of the project incorporating the veterinary
service. It was responsible for all livestock development in the 5th
Region. ODEM had legal authority to grant upar rights to grazing lands and
watering facilities to pastoral groups in  ,e 5th Region, to issue and
enforce grazing control regulations and to prescribe conditions for their
use (para 5.05).
4.02      The pilot character of the project, its complexity, and its size
required an independent agency.  ODEM also played an important role in
linking the closing project with the follow-on project in 1984, for which
it remained the implementing agency for the livestock component. ODEM's
monitoring and evaluation was done by IER.
4.03      In the beginning of PY 6  (August 1980) and as a result of
reorganization, ODEM's staff was reduced to 267, of which 198 worked in
animal health and 69 in ODEM management. During the two previous years the
total staff was approximately 300, with about 50 in management, 170 in
animal health, 30 in the Seno Mango extension and 12 each in livestock
marketing, pastoral service, and community development at the Mopti Trial
Station. ODEM's staff was - at least temporarily - reinforced by three
expatriate specialists, a hydrologist, a range management officer, and an
administrative officer. Another 18 man-months of consultant services were
made available to ODEM but never used for the preparation of a Regional
Livestock Development Plan to be implemented under a follow-on project
(pars 4.20). IER was to implement an evaluation system.
B. Government's/ODEH's Performance
4.04      Government promptly established ODEM and supported it.  During
the second project year, in a drive to inforce retirement laws, it replaced
the first Project Director, a decision taken against IDA's advice.  IDA



- 25 -
subsequently agreed when it found it a good decision that facilitated
supervision (supervision report of 11.02.77). The second Project Director,
was replaced with IDA's agreement in project year 5 when reorganizing ODEM.
This reorganization took place with Government cooperation. The Livestock
Department officially became the leading agency of the sector. Staff
reduction  reportedly  increased ODEM's  efficiency.   Government  improved
ODEM's management by   the recruitment  of experienced veterinarians  in
project year 4.
4.05      The project provided for Malian participation of 20% of costs
(para 3.44). But local costs increased because of the project extension by
about five years during which unspent amounts of the IDA credit were
supplemented by Governmert funds.  Government's participation eventually
became about 26.5% of total project costs.
4.06      ODEM's input was not as expected at appraisal.  But ODEM's impact
should be gauged by its task and not only by project results. Expectations
on project implementation were from the beginning too optimistic. ODEM's
task was especially demanding as (i) the project was the first livestock
project IDA financed in Mali; (ii) the Borrower, IDA, and the expatriates
were dealing with novel project ideas; and (iii) the complexity of the
project had not been fully realized at the time of appraisal.
4.07      ODEM deserves credit for an amendment which fundamentally changed
the direction of project implementation and was subsequently agreed to by
IDA.  ODEM suggested building pastoralists' confidence  in the project
before undertaking the formation of grazing associations. Therefore the
sequence of development program was changed to produce quick benefits.
Priority was given to the development of watering points and animal health
services (see para 3.09). However the development of water points became
neither technically nor financially feasible and therefore obsolete as
prerequisite to the pasture management component (paras. 3.21 and 7.07).
4.08      ODEM's efficiency varied with its management and the technical
assistance it received from expatriate specialists and from IDA. At times
ODEM's intervention lagged due to weak management. 20/ This was reflected
by an increasingly ineffective veterinary service provided by ODEM in PY2
and PY3, as reported by IDA missions, leading to an increase in disease
outbreaks.   During approximately  the same period,  IDA rejected ODEM's
investment proposals for pond construction (see para 3.18).  Studies, in
particular the preparation of the follow-on project were not done.
Expatriate technical specialists were at times ineffectively employed
resulting in implementation progress being slower than expected.  IDA
missions called inefficient management the key issue in PY4. At the same
20/ A February 1978 back to office report informs of serious problems:
managerial (extremely weak staff, Malian and expatriate); Technical
(unsuccessful groundwater drillings); and Financial (cost overrun for
water development)



- 26 -
time,   however,   it   was   recognized   that   the   project   had   been
overoptimistically designed.
4.09      For monitoring and evaluation ODEM had to depend on IER (para
4.21).  It became active cnly in the interim phase when a joint monitoring
system was set up with ILCA.  This experience repeats the one made under
earlier projects in Mali (Rural Development (Credit 491-MLI) and Mopti Rice
(Credit 277-MLI) where monitoring and evaluation started late and had no
impact on the projects. 21/IER had little impact as the project formed only
few grazing associations.   The pasture management component of granting
user rights to grazing lands and watering facilities never reached an
assessment  stage.    ODEM's  reports  on  implementation  progress  were
irregularly received by IDA Headquarters but cften supplemented by detailed
letters from the Project Director. 22/ IDA preferred to depend on the
information of its supervision missions. Audit reports were received
regularly.
C. Extension and Supervision
4.10      ODEM's extension and veterinary service is done by 220 veterinary
agents who are working in nine sector stations and 33 veterinary posts.
Besides fulfilling their veterinary tasks of disease control through
vaccinations (rinderpest, CBPP, and anthrax) these agents provide some
technical assistance as advising livestock producers on control of diseases
(e.g. endo and ecto parasites), improved feeding (e.g. use of agriculture
by products and crop residues)  as well as some breeding and selection
measures (e.g. castration).   Their limited equipment does not allow for
complicated veterinary services.
D. Technical Specialists
4.11      During Credit negotiations the following agreements were reached
with Government: (i) the qualifications, experience and terms of reference
of the project's 12 senior staff and the consultants (18 months) to prepare
the Regional Livestock Development Plan to be implemented in a phase II
project would be acceptable to IDA; (ii) Government would cause ODEM to
employ no later than October 15, 1975 eight senior staff, the remaining
four to be expatriates, namely: deputy director, range management officer,
water  development  officer,  and  pasture  agronomist;   and  (iii"  the

consultants for the preparation of detailed plans and tender documents for
the construction of the Mopti abattoir and hide drying unit and their terms
of reference anJ conditions of employment would be acceptable to IDA.
4.12      ODEM initially employed only three expatriate specialists:  one
deputy director (until 1978), one water development officer (until 3/1980)
and one range management officer (until 3/1980).  No pasture agronomist
could be found. Therefore it was agreed in April 1977 that ILCA's senior
pasture researcher would regularly supervise the study program on the Mopti
Trial Station. To run ODEM's workshop IDA and ODEM agreed in 1978 to the
employment of an expatriate mechanic under a two-year contract (para 3.17).
4.13      Supervision reports give little information on the specialists'
influence or impact. The specialists were from the beginning frustrated by
the project's lack of progress.  The project never reached the stage of
challenging them professionally. The April 1977 mission mentions that the
range management officer is not effectively employed. The Malian Chief of
service did not assign him to field work according to his preference. The
March 1978 mission, generally critical, was critical also of all three
specialists and rated their performance from "not good" to "unsatisfactory"
and recommended not to renew their contracts when they expired in 7/78
(deputy director), 3/79 (range manager), 7/78 (water manager). The water
management officer had already resigned in January 1978 for family reasons.
He was requested to stay on to supervise the pending drilling campaign.
The October 1978 mission confirmed the previous mission's recommendations.
Subsequent recommendations however were again for the extension of con-
tracts. The specialists left between 1978 and the beginning of 1980 (range
management officer).
4.14      Beginning in 1978 IDA repeatedly recommended that ODEM employ two
expatriate professionals, a deputy director to assist the Director General
in planning and supervision of technical services and one chief for ODEM's
deteriorating  administrative  and  financial  department   (para  4.11).
Government initially rejected these recommendations. They were renewed in
1980 but in vain.  Ultimately three expatriate technical specialists were
employed during the Interim phase: a water management consultant (in March
1981 for 4 months) to assist in preparing the stock water component of the
follow-on project, a financial and administrative manager (in March 1981),
and a technical consultant to the Director General of ODEM (in late 1980).
E. Training
4.15      The project provided for some specialized training for ODEM's
medium and lower grade technical staff, particularly in range management
and extension methods (4.25 SAR).  Thirty participants in PY1 and PY2 and
20 participants in PY3, PY4, and PY5 were to receive four monthly courses
at the National Livestock Research Center at Sotuba. Once a year a 2-3 day
seminar was to be held at Mopti for all project staff to review and plan
project progress. Six two-month fellowships for senior ODEM staff to "isit
livestock projects in other African countries and four man-years of



- 28 -
overseas training, mainly in development planning and management for four
Malian graduates were to be financed. A functional literacy program for
pastoralists was to be developed and evaluated by the Pastoral Service with
the aid of the National Functional Literacy Center to reinforce the impact
of the training programs under the project.
4.16      The functional literacy program gave very satisfactory results in
10 villages already in 1976. 23/ The technical training did not begin
before 1980. ODEM staff benefitted from some training with in Mali through
seminars and visits to institutions  of project-related works.   ODEM's
higher level staff received management and complementary technical training
overseas (e.g. in France and at the EDI). The training however followed the
SAR proposals in general without fully using what was provided.
F. Technical Studies
4.17      Project implementation and the development of the 5th Region were
to be complemented by studies  (footnote to para 3.03).  Preinvestment
studies for well construction in the project were a condition of
disbursement   and  included  a  population  and  a  livestock  census,
socio-economic surveys, a survey for well site location and ecological
studies in the Seno Mango as well as pre-development range surveys, a
geo-physical survey and a land resource assessment west of the delta.
4.18      It appears that these studies did neither adequately assess the
supply of stock water nor its socio-economic importance for the formation
of pastoral associations, both of which were crucial for the success of the
entire project (para. 4.07). The findings of these studies were preceded
by (i) the appraisal mission's conclusion that construction of wells in the
Seno Mango and west of the delta (mema) was possible without large scale
studies as adequate d,ata were available on these locations (Annex 6, para
9, SAR) and by (ii) the assumption that the groundwater level was the same
within and outside the delta.   The  studies were undertaken with the
assistance of consultants and wells were sunk but with varying success
(paras 3.16 - 3.17). Later studies, undertaken also with the assistance of
consultants during the project's interim phase, revealed that the
groundwater level in the Seno Mango was 100 m and more compared to 65-80 m
in the delta. These delayed findings became the basis for the stock water
development plan of the follow-on project rather than for the ongoing one
altering project implementation and results. OED found many examples of
deficient technical preparation resulting in delayed project execution;
some of the examples were caused by overestimating the capacity of agencies
to undertake pre-investment studies, others by an incorrect assessment of
23/ Supervision Report of 2/78



- 29 -
the working of local laws and institutions or insufficient kn-'wledge of
local conditions.   24/
4.19      The project's full package of grazing control, water development,
and veterinary service covered only about 20% of the 5th Region (para 4.27,
SAR). Therefore these studies were important as a basis for the Regional
Livestock Development Plan for the entire 5th Region and the identification
of a future investment program and a second phase project. Pastoral and
agro-economic surveys of the central delta were as necessary as a
hydro-ecological survey of the delta fringe, a hydrological survey of the
area east of the Seno Mango, a livestock census, and an identification of
development areas through ecological studies.
4.20      IER started these studies as late as 1978(para 3.03) with ILCA's
assistance (para 3.12) and did not complete them before the first project
closing date.  ILCA completed the studies in June 1982.   FAO/CP completed
project preparation for the follow-on project in January 1983 after it had
identified it in June 1982, thus 2 1/2 years later than anticipated at
appraisal.
G. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.21      Requirements were broadly defined:  (i) Progress and achievements
of the project needed to be properly monitored so that the Regional
Livestock Development Plan could draw from the experience gained (SAR,
4.27); and vii) IER was to monitor the project's effect ou the population
in the 5th Region and on Mali's economy (DCA 3.13 and Schedule 2).
4.22      Under a three year US $80,000 contract approved by IDA, IER and
BARA (a Malian consulting firm) monitored the project beginning in 1977
(para 4.09). By September 1978 two reports were produced. ODEM contested
the conclusions of the second report on the project's impact and on
pastoralists' adherence to the project. The Bank expected to receive the
results of the discussions between ODEM and BARA by the end of 1978 but did
not. There is little information on the Bank's record on the continuation
of  progress  monitoring  except  that  in  1980  through  a  national
reorganization   the   livestock   department   became   responsible   for
implementation and monitoring of all livestock projects, while OMBEVI took
over planning and project preparation and IER the research.  It appears
that no further monitoring reports were prepared because too few of the
original project objectives were attained, little transmittable information
for the Regional Livestock Development Plan and for a second phase project
could be gathered.

4.23      Production results were not monitored since the monitoring system
(para  4.21)  did  not  specifically  require  this.   Herd monitoring was
difficult because of transhumance and migration as a result of the drought.
Detailed information on project costs is only available after 1981, and
pricea for livestock and livestock products were not recorded. They vary
greatly within the project area.  Consequently insufficient quantifiable
information is available to measure financial and economic results through
rate of return calculations.  Yet the project had an unpredicted impact
(Chapter V).
V. PROJECT IMPACT AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE
5.01      The project was designed to benefit the rural poor in particular
pastoralist families. The resvlts were far below expectations but the less
complex components such as vaccination campaigns, animal health care in
general, the literacy programs and programs (3.21) by efforts of the
villagers themelves were successful to some extent. Even though the lack
of data does not permit a systematic analysis of project impact (OED made a
similar observation in its review of 176 projects with food production
objectives.    25/),   an  assessment  of  results  for  future  livestock
development in Mali can be made on:
(a) production benefits (paras 5.02 - 5.03);
(b) institution building (paras 5.04 -5.05); and
(c) establishment of a basis for future lending operations (paras
5.06 - 5.07).
A. Production Benefits
5.02       Production benefits are measured by data on livestock marketing
and slaughter rather than number of vaccinations as usual in projects in
West Africa. 26/ These benefits then reflect the success of the project's
veterinary and extension service responsible for vaccination campaigns, the
promotion of veterinary drugs, and the introduction of feed supplements
(para 5.03). ODEM estimates that before the recent drought in 1983/84:
(a) the cattle and small ruminant population increased in the 5th
Region by about 20% 27/ and 30% respectively;
25/ See Tenth Annual Review of Project Performance Audit Results, OED Report
No. 5248, dated August 30, 1984.
26/ See The Smallholder Dimension of Livestock Development, A Review of Bank
Experience, OED Report No. 5979, dated December 18. 1985.
27/ from 1.4 million to 1.8 million



- 31 -
(b)  the controlled annual exports of live cattle   28/ and small
ruminants 29/ and the export of livestock products grew to about
US$ 30 million; and
(c) marketing and controlled slaughter 30/ increased.
This general information was supported by livestock producers who reported
reduced mortalities as a result of veterinary drug use and vaccinations.
5.03      ODEM reports that without the project's pre-drought  (1983/84)
activities the reconstitution of the 5th Region's livestock population
would not have been possible.  The project area reflected the country's
highest level of disease protection at that time:  75% of the cattle were
vaccinated against Rinderpest and CBPP.  A study found that 62% of the
livestock had antibodies against Rinderpest, i.e. had been immunized
effectively.  However, because of transhumance this level of protection
probably decreased during the drought.  The introduction of payment for
vaccinations, an early example of cost recovery in West Africa, only
temporarily  decreased  their  use.   Use  of  veterinary  drugs    31/  and
agricultural by-products 32/ increased impressively, and the expansion of
areas under planted Bourgou grass (Echinochloa stagnina) in the delta added
to the feeding resources during the dry season. The nine wells with water
for about 3,000 cattle each and the 20 ponds helped to develop new grazing
areas.
B. Institution Building
5.04      As a prerequisite to the project the establishment of ODEM as
project implementor was correct in its conception and faulty in its set-up,
from the very beginning. ODEM, required to organize itself while already
implementing the project, was overtaxed. The substantial reorganizations
(4.04) on a managerial and staff level, as well as its integration into the
existing veterinary service took much of its efforts away from the project.
(OED estimates the success of institution building noticeably higher for
28/  from 18,000 (1981) to 23,000 (1983)
29/  from 66,000 (1981) to 76,000 (1983)
30/  from 6,000 cattle and 36,000 small ruminants (1980) to 11,000 cattle
and 42,000 small ruminants (1982)
31/  Sales went from FCFA 200,000 (1977) to FCFA 15 million (1985).
32/  Cottonseed as feed supplement from 30t (1979) to 3,000t (1985); rice
straw became feed supplement in the dry season whereas it was burnt

projects not in sub-Saharan Africa 33/). ODEM now a part of the existing
veterinary service is recognized by both Government and livestock producers
(para  5.05).   Future  livestock  development  should  pofit  by  ODEM's
experience (para 4.02).  IDA's dialogue with Government's Livestock and
Veterinary Service was intensified through ODEM and ultimately led to a
follow-on project.
5.05      ODEM is the intermediary for the pastoral associations  (para
4.01).  It provides technical assistance and regulates their rights (para
2.16). The pastoral associations look to ODEM for technical assistance in
managing their resources under contract (cahier de charges). ODEM assists
in providing:
(a) infrastructure for livestock markets;
(b) maintenance of water points;
(c)  protection against cattle thefts;
(d) mediatio. in case of disputes between pastoralists and farmers;
and
(e) advice to producer groups regarding investments in developments
rather than re-investment in cattle to reduce over-grazing.
(e.g. veterinary posts, human health centers, schools, plantation
of tx3es, wells, tools, and possibly savings accounts).
C. Basis for Future Lending Operations
5.06      Essential  for  future  lending  operations  is  the  continued
formation of pastoral organizations (para 3.21), their attitude towards
development, their confidence in ODEM, and the realistic assessment of
natural resources (para 6.02).  Pastoral organizations are a reasonable
guarantee for project continuity because their members have often strong
family links.  34/  OED found that autonomous,  self-reliant  grassroots
organizations were instrumental in several sustainability successes. They
provided an indigenous institutional framework for project activities. 35/
5.07      Pastoralists' confidence in ODEM is reflected by self-initiative.
Grazing associations have begun to participate communally:

(a)  to construct houses and offices (in 20 villages) for livestock
agents as well as livestock markets;
(b) to maintain the wells belonging to them (nine wells and nine
associations) with the help of one mechanic a, each well seconded
by ODEM;
(c) to pay for the pump, the generator and the reservoir usually with
a 50% downpayment before installation; and
(d) to clear fire breaks annually.
In cities ODEM has encouraged private initiative in small dairy and
fattening operations.
VI. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RESULTS
6.01      It appears that the project had positive financial and economic
results until the recent drought in 1983/84 (paras 5.01 - 5.03).  The
successful veterinary component of the project was largely responsible for
this.  Even if sufficient quantifiable information were available (para
4.23) rates of return would remain questionable compared to those calculat-
ed at appraisal for the entire project. OED correctly states that: The
ERR, regarded Bank-wide as the key indicator of project impact, does not
fully reflect project outcome in institution building, technological
development and environmental quality. Performance of livestock projects
must also be measured in dimensions other than the simple ERR, especially
when they are of pioneering character involving new technologies or
requiring institution building and staff development. 36/
6.02      The follow-on project, the livestock component of the Mopti Area
Development Project (Credit 1597-MLI), is estimated to yield an ERR of 25%
which hints at what the potential percentage figure of the ERR of this
project could have been.  Project area, objectives,  and inputs of the
follow-on project are similar to those of the Mali Livestock Project. The
new project reflects the experience gained by the Mali Livestock project
and performance and production parameters are assumed accordingly and are
less optimistic.
VII. BANK'S PERFORMANCE
A. Project Formulation and ObJeCtives

Experience, OED Report No. 5979, dated December 18, 1985.

7.01      The Bank showed confidence in the country by financing the first
livestock project there.  It seemed a logical follow-up after financing
three agriculture projects. With great optimism, an innovative but risky
project was  designed.   It  aimed  at  improving  livestock husbandry  and
nutrition along with disease control, whereas projects in the Sahel had
usually focussed on disease control only. The pasture management component
was  its most  interesting  and novel  part.   Pastoralists,  grouped  into
legally instituted grazing associations, would manage and protect their
natural resources.  The risk was known   37/ and the uncertainty of the
pastoralists' response to grazing control and the frequency of droughts was
taken into consideration. Moderate droughts, occurring every four or five
years were not expected to substantially affect the economic viability of
the project.  Catastrophic droughts, occurring every 40 to 50 years, were
not  expected  before  project  completion.   However,  the  intense  and
unpredicted drought of 1983/84 caused a drastic reduction of estimated
project results.  The impression is that measured by its prior livestock
potential, the country's urgent need for livestock development after the
drought  in  the  early  1970s  brought  about  project  approval,  'hich
corresponded to the Bank's strategy.   38/
7.02      To minimize the risk the project was to be implemented in phases,
each successive phase beginning after the preceding phase was successfully
completed and developed grazing areas satisfactorily managed. The project
was to be reviewed after about three years.   The Bank's frequent and
intensive  supervisions  substituted  the  review.   The  project  was  not
implemented in phases because pastoral associations were only formed toward
the very end of the project.
7.03      Special  credit  is  due  for  a  sustainability-oriented  project
design  depending  largely  on  grassroots  organizations  for  project
continuation.    Project   objectives   corresponded   to   the   country's
requirements at that time, but there was little experience in financing
livestock  development  in West  Africa.    39/   Project  performance  and
benefits were over-estimated as Bank's reports 40/ and ODEM 41/ observed.
In particular the stock water development potential, i.e. the actual
availability of groundwater was judged too optimistically and caused
project performance to fall below expectations (para 3.16).  Stock water
development was important for the formation of pastoral associations.

7.04      The project  could be  compared  to lending operations already
reviewed 42/ by OED which it found innovative, but too large in scope and
therefore difficult to implement.  OED found that in most instances an
exploratory pilot phase would have been appropriate, which is also true for
the Burkina Faso Livestock Project.    43/   It  appears  that  the Mali
Livestock Project should have been preceded by a pilot phase which would
have corresponded to WAN's tendency toward pilot projects or projects with
a pilot phase to avoid inadequately researched technical packages.   44/
There is no indication that a pilot phase would have altered the course of
project implementat_on especially since the droughts prevented the project
from attaining all of its objectives. Unless the veterinary component and
the institution building for project implementation had been included in
the pilot project, the reconstitution of the 5th Region's livestock
population after the catastrophic drought of 1983/84 (para 5.03) would
probably not have been possible as quickly. The failure occured where it
was least expected, namely in the groundwater component, which jeopardized
other components.
7.05      Project performance would have benefitted by a better assessment
of local instituLions in charge of the preparation of pre-investment
studies.   The  assessment  should  have  revealed  the  need  for  outside
assistance.    Consultants  would  have  expedited  the  preparation  of
preinvestment studies (para 4.17-4.20).   The appraisal should also have
provided more explicit guidelines for monitoring and evaluating and for
establishing a systematic data collection and analysis and the re-use of
such data. Their availability would have facilitated project evaluation.
Finally, the project should have been integrated with agriculture rather
than restricted to livestock development only even though it would have
somewhat complicated implementation. Pastoralists have realized that they
can no longer depend on livestock production alone.  They look for risk
diversion possibilities as agriculture and, if possible trade. In Burkina
Faso and in Nigeria, it was observed that stock owners took up farming. 45/
Livestock  and  agriculture  production  complement  each  other best when
integrated to protect the natural resources and to prevent their
destabilization. The follow-on project, the Mopti Area Development Project
(Cr. 1597-MiLI) finances both, agriculture and livestock production at about
equal costs. However the appraisal mission of the Mali Livestock Project

(538-MLI) aimed at a manageable project which was not too complicated for
Malian conditions and limited itself to livestock development.
B. Supervision
7.06      Project  processing  was  efficient  and  Bank  supervision  from
Washington started early (the first one was in April 1975, before effec-
tiveness and the second in September 1975, right after effectiveness) and
continued at regular six month intervals supplemented by missions from the
RfMWA. Missions had appropriate staff and staff continuity was observed.
Missions were  thorough  and  reports  detailed.   The  Bank  informed  the
Borrower of the missions' observations and recommendations. Thus it was
instrumental in gradually improving ODEM's management starting with the
recruitment of a dynamic and experienced veterinarian in 1978 after ODEM's
veterinary service had deteriorated.
7.07      It is, however, evident that the course of the project could not
be corrected before the interim phase despite the Bank's regular and
thorough supervisions and despite the doubts that appeared on the water
development component in PY3 and PY4. In February 1978 and following the
previous mission's recommendation,   46/  a hydro-geological consultant
assisted  in  supervision.   Only  after  the  recruitment  of  a  second
hydro-geological consultant in 1981/82 was sufficient groundwater reported
to be available in the Seno Mango area at a level of about 100 to 150 m
compared to less than 100 m in the delta. This positive discovery enabled
the preparation of a follow-on project.   47/   More than one opinion is
important when crucial project components are at stake. OED observed that
lack of firm, consistent, but flexible supervision 48/ was a principal
factor effecting proJect outcome. Nevertheless the slow development of
water points was not the only cause for the difficulty in forming pastoral
associations. General administrative and legal procedures led to delays as
did disputes between pastoralists and farmers over land use. OED found
that projects should be based on sound technological foundations and be
designed   compatible   with   the   socio-economic   background   of   the
beneficiaries. 48/ Only one association has been legally recognized with
eight still awaiting recognition, whereas nine water points have been
functioning for several years (para. 3.21).
7.08      The  need  for  outside  assistance  for  the  preparation  of
pre-investment studies should have been realized by Government long before

the interim phase.  (para 7.05)  A mid term review would have been of
benefit to the project implementation.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Overview
8.01      The project was prepared and appraised when financing livestock
development in West Africa was new to the Bank. There were few precedents
to follow.   Pre-investment  studies were not provided  in time by  the
Borrower (paras 4.17 through 4.20). Appraisal estimates reflected the
Bank's initiative and were optimistic in productivity and production
increases (para 2.13) dependent on the availability of groundwater. The
groundwater exploitation, important for other components, was however below
appraisal expectations.
8.02      The ri:ik of the project was recognized from the start and seen in
resource manageiaent and grazing control  (paras 2.09 and 7.01).   Risk
minimizing measures were built in (paras 2.16 through 2.19 and 7.02 -
7.03). But the failure occured where it was least expected, namely in the
groundwater component, which jeopardized other componeuts (para 7.04) The
catastrophic drought of 1983/84 further reduced project results. There is
no indication that a pilot project would have taken a different course.
However,  during  implementation  when  recognizing  the  problem  of  the
groundwater component (paras 3.08 through 3.09) the project should have
been redirected into a lower cost pilot operation testing in particular the
groundwater  availability.   As  many  components  were  delayed  in  being
implemented, this redirection should have been possible without disruption
of other project components. Because of its new ideas and complexity, the
project was of a pilot character (para 4.02) and should have been expected
to require revisions (para 3.07) and a long implementation period (para
3.13.).   It was  from  the beginning  considered  part  of  a  long  term
development setting a trend for further projects (para 2.19) with pasture
management by pastoralist organizations (para 3.35). A follow-on project
based on the experience of this project became effective in November 1985
(para 3.13) and should be intensively supervised and monitored.
8.03      ODEM, as the project-implementing agency and now a part of the
Veterinary Service, is recognized by both Government and livestock
producers (para 5.05). Pastoralists' confidence in ODEM is reflected by
self-initiative (para 5.07) and increased marketing of cattle (para 3.31).
ODEM's animal health service and vaccination campaigns take credit for the
reconstitution of the 5th Region's livestock population after the
catastrophic drought of 1983/84 (paras 3.24, 5.03, 7.04).
B. Lessons Learned
8.04      The  project  corresponded  to  the  Bank's  and  the  Borrower's
objectives.  Its possible risks were taken into consideration.  However,
more intensive project preparation and especially hydrological testing and



- 38 -
socio-economic   studies   would   have   permitted   correct   pre-project
assessments. A project duration of ten years rather than five should have
been considered from the start to allow long term planning and continuity
More intensive preparation would also have prevented overly optimistic
assumptions.
8.05      Local institutions responsible for pre-investment studies need to
be assessed at appraisal or early supervision.  Their need for outside
assistance can become crucial for project implementation and the
preparation of follow-on projects.
8.06      Monitoring requirements should be defined in detail.  Progress
reports should include production and income as well as input data. These
reports could facilitate the evaluation of project impact.  Supervision
missions should observe such requirements.
8.07      Supervision should have more forcefully led to project course
correction.   Components  crucial  to  project  success  need  to  be  more
thoroughly analyzed by teams rather than be based on one individual's
opinion.
