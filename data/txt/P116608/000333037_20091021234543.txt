1.     Despite being a small remote island, Mauritius was able to escape grim
development prospects over the last 40 years. Between 1968 and 2009, Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita grew from US$260 to more than US$6,000. As indicated in
Figure 1, GDP hovered at around 5 percent growth without strong deceleration episodes
for more than 25 years. This remarkable record o f economic growth was the result o f
successful policies, institutions and preferential market access to sugar and textiles.

2.       n
        I the mid-1990s a new vision began taking shape in Mauritius o f a higher value
added, more diversified, skill and knowledge intensive economy. To realize this, planners
recognized they would need to invest massively in human capital and infrastructure,
make better use o f advanced technologies and reform the regulatory erivironment to
harness the creativity o f the private sector. Yet, little was achieved in these areas during
the decade which followed. Instead, trend growth slowed as new sectors failed to
generate hoped for levels o f output and employment while traditional ones lost ground to
increasing competition in their export markets. The miracle years o f the 1980s receded
into history.

3.      In July 2005, Mauritians went to the polls. With the "triple trade shock" - eroding
textiles and sugar preferences and rising energy prices - exacerbating the longer term
decline, they were in an uncharacteristically pessimistic mood.' The outcome o f the

election was a new Government with a strong reformist platform that touched on virtually
every facet o f economic and social policy.2 In the economic sphere, the Finance Minister
urged the need to halt the slide in performance by raising competitiveness, promoting
higher value added exports, investing in infrastructure and education, and reforming
industrial relations. These were well rehearsed themes, but it soon became apparent they
did not portend business as usual. The new Government immediately set to work on an
ambitious and comprehensive structural reform program intended to raise the efficiency
o f the private sector and modernize the public sector for a post-regulatory world.

4.      As the Government worked out the details o f i t s reform program, it called on the
World Bank (WB) and other Development Partners3 for both technical and financial
assistance. The current series o f Development Policy Loans (DPL) has played a central
role in the resulting collaboration. WB Technical Assistance undertaken during the
identification phase helped to clarify the context and logic o f the reforms and establish a
disciplined framework for monitoring implementation. Subsequent preparation and
appraisals have served as a platform for dialogue with Government and civil society,
building awareness and consensus around the reforms. Joint missions carried out with
other Development Partners have been instrumental in harmonizing the development
community around the Government's program.

5.       Since 2006, Mauritius has moved from a first-generation o f reforms, championed
and executed mostly from the Minister o f Finance, to a second-generation reform
environment where coordination among multiple ministries/agencies as well as broader
institutional capacity in the public sector has become a key challenge. In t h i s context,
prioritizing reforms that are both politically feasible and hold the best potential to unlock
growth with equity has become a core challenge. The Government has invited the
Development Partners to actively participate in t h i s process. Today, the WB's
engagement in Mauritius i s based on a mature policy dialogue which has generated useful
learning experiences for both the client and the WB .

6.      The world economic crisis hit Mauritius at the very moment in which
implementation o f second-generation reforms was being intensified. The Government
was then forced to balance the long-run nature o f i t s policy measures with more
immediate focus on economic and social consequences from the crisis. This required
greater emphasis on proactive management o f risks and real-time policy responses, while
maintaining the overall reform agenda on track. The WB was part o f this process,
providing timely assistance at the request o f the Government. The DPL3 operation
approved by the W B ' s Board o f Executive Directors o n March 3 1,2009 and already fully
disbursed, featured an increased loan amount - US$100 million - to mitigate the fiscal
impact o f the crisis.

Republic," http://www. gov.mu/portaygoc/assemblvsite/ftle/Presidentaddress.pdf.
 The term, "Development Partners" i s used throughout this document to refer to Mauritius' main external
partners - the African Development Bank, Agence Frangaise de DCveloppement (AFD),the European
Commission (EC), United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank (WB).

7.      The proposed DPL4 i s the last operation o f the current series. I t s proposed amount
o f US$50 million, i s also higher than the US$30 million originally planned. Continuing
fiscal pressures and global economic uncertainty affecting Mauritius' engines o f growth
motivates the Government request. The timing o f DPL4 should also support the current
bridging six-month budget (July-December 2009) put in place to align fiscal and calendar
years. Reforms continue at a satisfactory pace and have retained their strategic focus even
after the crisis. However, the logical steps in a long-run approach to transforming the
Mauritian economy are now punctuated by timely, targeted and temporary actions to
mitigate significant growth risks triggered by the negative external environment. The
macroeconomic policy framework has also remained adequate throughout the turbulent
times.

8.       Although DPL4 i s the last operation o f the series, dialogue around substantive
policy issues i s maintained and the Government has requested a continuation o f the DPL
engagement, which i s currently being prepared. There are a number o f specific areas for
deepening the existing policy dialogue through a new DPL series - I C T reforms, trade
regulatory environment, public debt management, investment climate reforms,
rationalization o f social protection, to name a few. In t h i s process, strengthening
coordination with the AfDB and the IMF will be essential to improve delivery o f
development assistance, particularly given the availability o f resources from both
institutions for future lending. I t must be noted, however, that future WB lending in
Mauritius as part o f a new DPL programmatic series (or any other investment project)
would be subject to the W B ' s capacity to lend in the country (IBRD exposure limit).

9.       Mauritius was hard hit by the world economic crisis. Before the Lehman Brothers
bankruptcy (September 2008), GDP growth forecast for the fiscal year 2008/09 was 6.2
percent. In December 2008, early signs o f domestic economic slowdown led the Central
Statistics Office to announce a GDP forecast o f 4 percent for the 2009 calendar year. In
February o f 2009, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered i t s 2009 growth
forecast for Mauritius to 2 percent. A month later, the Central Statistics Office aligned i t s
official projection with the IMF, further lowering i t s forecast to 2.5 percent. During the
budget speech last May, the Ministry o f Finance and Economic Empowerment (MOFEE)
predicted growth in the range o f 2 to 2.2 percent. This estimate has remained stable and
credible since then. WB staff i s forecasting 2 percent growth for 2009 and 2.5 percent for
2010 (calendar year^).^ The fast pace in which expected growth performance for 2009
deteriorated in Mauritius i s commensurate with developments across the globe. Between

10.     Leading drivers o f the Mauritius slowdown are tourism, textiles, and Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) inflows. Tourism receipts fell by 18.5 percent in the first five
months o f 2009 and tourist arrivals fell by 13.9 percent in the first quarter o f 2009 when
compared to the same period a year ago. Although Hotels and Restaurants represent
approximately 10 percent o f Mauritius GDP, the indirect impact o f a fall in tourism
activity r u n s much deeper in the economy affecting sectors such as domestic
manufacturing and retail. Decreased liquidity in international capital markets and
negative prospects for demand contributed to zero growth in FDI inflows in 2008. By
May, government expected FDI to fall by at least 50 percent in 2009, but the most recent
data warrant a more optimistic view with a reduction o f about 25 percent for 2009. The
construction sector, a key driver o f growth and employment, has weakened as a
consequence. Faltering external demand for textile exports (particularly the UK market)
has created heightened uncertainty in the sector, contributing to job losses and lower
investment. Performance o f the sector has not been dismal as initially feared; real growth
and export performance posted mild declines in the first quarter (4.1 percent and 2
percent, respectively). Export-oriented textile companies have been able to adapt to the
difficult times by shifting to small orders placed under tight deadlines. Nonetheless,
uncertainty remains a key factor with potentially large effects over investment and
employment.

11.     The fiscal outlook deteriorated quickly during 2009 and poses a clear risk,
particularly if the world economic recovery i s too sluggish. This risk partly motivates
both the timing and the amount of the DPLA. The overall deficit for the 2008/09 fiscal
year was 3.6 percent o f GDP given most recent Government figures (but s t i l l subject to
revision). Though b y no means particularly high in the context of the international crisis,
the deficit has been partly contained b y low execution rates of capital expenditures in the
first half o f 2009. More importantly, a bigger impact on the deficit i s expected for the
coming budgets as the effects of lower revenues and expansionary fiscal policies fully
materialize. For the current six-month budget (July-Dec 2009), the overall deficit i s
officially estimated to reach 4.8 percent of GDP. In 2010, Government expects the deficit
to remain at about 5 percent. W 3 staff i s forecasting fiscal deficits of 4.7 percent and 5.0
                                  E
percent in 2009 and 2010 (Table 2). However, given the low level of total fiscal revenues
in Mauritius (22.9 percent in 2008), high levels o f current expenditure (23.6 percent in
2008) and ambitious public investment program, there are clear downside risks to the
fiscal deficit. The Minister of Finance has gone on record stating that anything higher
than a 5.5 percent of GDP fiscal deficit i s unsustainable. This i s a welcome statement as
the use o f fiscal measures to boost demand and protect vulnerable people must be
 consistent with medium-term macroeconomic stability. Existing space for conducting
 counter-cyclical fiscal policy also remains limited b y a high level o f public debt - Public
 Debt to GDP ratio w i l l interrupt i t s declining trajectory and may go over the 60 percent
 threshold recently imposed by the Debt Management Act (DPL3 prior action)(Table 2)?

12.       The balance o f payments also poses an important risk, but less immediate than
fiscal.6 Current account deficits are structural in Mauritius, but in 2008 deterioration was
particularly severe. The deficit doubled from 6 to 11percent o f GDP. This was driven by
large increases in the import bill (fuel and food) and lackluster performance o f services
exports (tourism) concentrated at the end o f the year. Despite i t s high level, the current
account deficit has been adequately financed by flows in the capital and financial
accounts. Overall balance o f payments has remained positive and no deterioration in
official international reserves.has occurred so far, even between October 2008 and initial
months o f 2009. The fact that Mauritius' external balance was preserved during acute
financial turbulence in international capital markets should not be taken lightly. At this
stage, a full blown balance o f payment crisis does not seem a pressing short-term concern
as external financing requirements for 2009 are expected to be covered - though with a
slight decline in international reserves. For 2010, the WB staff s t i l l forecasts a benign
baseline scenario (Table 3), but acknowledges greater uncertainty. The risk o f a pickup in
o i l prices unmatched by a rebound in external demand for Mauritius exports can increase
financial requirements through a quick deterioration of the trade deficit. Additionally, the
current account deficit has been financed mostly through the "other investments"
category in the capital and financial accounts o f the Balance o f Payments whose
 sustainability i s difficult to asses^.^ Hence, while in 2009 the scaled up resources o f
Development Partners help to downplay concerns about fluctuations in "other
 investments", there are risk scenarios for 2010 that could bring stress to the external
 accounts.




  In the M a y 2009 budget, the MOFEE stated: "our worst fear i s that a deepening o f the crisis could
potentially drive our economy into a precarious external balance"
  "Other investments" i s different from F D I or portfolio inflows. In the case o f Mauritius, it i s primarily
driven b y variation in assets and liabilities o f banks and maybe to be associated to the Global Business
License (GBL) sector. There has been concerted attention to methodological aspects in order to clarify the
impact o f the GBL sector on balance o f payment statistics. The IMF i s assisting the Bank o f Mauritius and
relevant regulatory bodies in overcoming the shortfalls.

    13.     First quarter data for the 2009 balance o f payments indicate that the current
    account deficit narrowed sharply (75 percent over the quarter and 66 percent when
    compared to Q1 2008). T h i s result was driven by a decline in the merchandise trade
    deficit, which displayed reasonable goods export performance combined with strong
    reduction in the goods import bill. A self-correcting reduction o f capital goods imports
    has not happened. Instead, the decline in the goods import bill was largely due to lower
    fuel prices, highlighting the vulnerability o f the external accounts to o i l shocks.8 Overall
    balance o f payments recorded a surplus in the first quarter o f 2009 (US$5 million) and
    errors and omissions stood at.approximately 0.5 percent o f GDP.

    14.     Nominal exchange rate has also responded to the world economic crisis, initially
    depreciating by 17 percent from September 2008 to March 2009 and appreciating by 4
    percent since then against the Dollar. Interventions in the foreign exchange market
    occurred only to smooth out volatility in 2008 and the Bank o f Mauritius (BOM) has not
    intervened in 2009. Indeed, Mauritius already qualifies as a free-floater according to IMF
    criterion. Currency depreciation did not produce significant inflationary pressures so far,
    as the fall in o i l prices and weakening aggregate demand generated stronger
    disinflationary pressures. Twelve-month change in the CPI declined from 11.7 percent in
    August 2008 to 1.9 percent in July 2009 - month-to-month deflation between October
    2008 and January 2009 was recorded. This drastic fall i s also explained by relative
    position o f the economy in the business cycle. Right before the crisis, as argued in the last
    IMF Article I V (July 2008), Mauritius was at a risk o f overheating.




    *Since May, price o f o i l has picked up and should lead to increases in the import bill again. Lackluster
    performance o f goods exports (stagnant in real terms since the early 2000s) and dependence on foreign
    commodities remain key drivers o f a structurally weak goods trade balance.


                                                           7
    15.     The financial sector withstood the crisis well so far. Key commercial banks in the
    domestic sector which dominate a substantial share o f the market remain very well
    capitalized according to international standards. As in other stock markets, their shares
    have been subjected to heightened levels o f volatility since the crisis started. Concerns
    about exposure o f the banking sector to the weakening real economy have been contained
    since the beginning o f the year, but it i s s t i l l early to have a clear picture. The same holds
    for the substantive profits made by the largest commercial bank in regional markets. In
    July 2009, Moody's announced that a rating review was underway for the two main
    commercial banks in Mauritius. The rating agency cited concerns on the bank's asset
    quality through credit losses on loan portfolios. The last Financial Stability Report issued
    by the Central Bank i August 2009 qualifies the move as unjustified. The Global
                             n
    Business License sector (off-shore banking), despite increasing sophistication, did not
    suffer directly from exposure to sub-prime assets. Concerns regarding Mauritius being
    listed as a tax haven by OECD have been addressed and the country was put o n the
    OECD clear l i s t in April 2009.

    16.     Summing up, despite very adverse conditions triggered by external forces, the
    small and vulnerable Mauritian economy has demonstrated noteworthy resilience. Stress
    in public finances i s visible, but i s being well managed. External balance i s a concern, but
    by no means an immediate threat. The 2 percent GDP growth forecast for 2009, while
    well below potential, i s s t i l l an achievement given the importance o f cyclically sensitive
    sectors in the economy. The financial sector has weathered the crisis well so far. Perhaps
    most importantly, a meltdown in the j o b market has been avoided. Unemployment rate
    for the entire 2008 calendar year was 7.2 percent and increased to 8 percent in 2009 Q1
    according to CSO.' This represents only a mild deterioration in labor market conditions,
    though there are significant upside risks.

    Policy Response to the Crisis

    17.     Fiscal consolidation achieved over the last years was fundamental for enabling an
    effective Government response now. N o t only did it directly generate part o f the fiscal
    space necessary for counter-cyclical policy, but i t was also a key ingredient for the
    overall success o f the government reform program so far, allowing Mauritius to face the
    crisis from a position o f strength. At the Government's request, the international
    community quickly scaled up on-going budget support assistance to help mitigate fiscal
    pressures and support continuation o f the reform program - Table 4 provides a summary
.   o f policy lending activities currently being prepared. Another important ingredient that
    benefits the Government today in preparing i t s policy response i s the wide spectrum o f
    policy reforms pursued over the last years. While t h i s often stretched capacity in the



     In June, the Central Statistics Office released labor market statistics for the first quarter o f 2009. Total
    employment declined b y approximately 14 thousand between 2008 4 4 and 2009 Q1 in a total labor force o f
    560,000. Overall unemployment rate increased to 8 percent in 2009 Q1 from 6.2 percent in 2008 Q l , but
    seasonal effects in employment and labor market participation flows complicate a clear assessment o f
    quarter on quarter labor market statistics. Unemployment rate for the entire 2008 was 7.2 percent and CSO
    expects it to reach 8 percent in 2009.

18.     The 2007/08 and 2008/09 budgets demonstrated foresight by setting aside
resources which can now be used to cushion an externally-driven economic slowdown. In
particular, the Government used improving fiscal space from the first years o f reforms to
establish and appropriate resources for six different investment funds. As the world
economy deteriorated much faster and deeper than most would have expected, the
Government drew on these resources to finance i t s countercyclical policies. Table 5
indicates how the funds were appropriated during good economic times and the expected
schedule for withdrawal until 2011. The funds, when combined with the fiscal outcomes
and projections o f the central government (Table 2), provide a better picture o f the total
stimulative stance adopted by the government.

19.     A stimulus package was announced in December o f 2008 amounting to 3.8
percent o f GDP. The M a y 2009 Budget was then built upon the December package and
cast as a comprehensive 18-month action plan "to ride out the global crisis to save jobs,
protect people and prepare for the recovery." Measures announced are numerous and they
were grouped into five different paths: (i) b preservation; (ii)
                                                jo                     project realization
                                 i ipublic sector investment program ((PSIP); (iv) social
capacity in the public sector; ( i )
programs; and (v) expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. In general, they were
timely, targeted and temporary. B o x 1 (pg 17) provides a l i s t with key examples o f
measures announced - most o f them are set to expire in December o f 2010.

                        Table 6: Key Measures to Ride Out the Global Crisis

the economy.
  Implementation o f programs with direct support for job preservation (Mauritius Approach, working and
training program)

20.     Emphasis on public investment as a key element o f the short-run policy response
to the crisis also attends to structural needs o f the Mauritian economy. Indeed, strong
investments in physical infrastructure are needed to overcome supply-side constraints for
growth. T o this end, a PSIP has been recently published by the MOFEE. I t represents an
important step towards a strategic and coherent approach for investment planning and
financing. As an instrument, it will enable the Government to translate the national
economic vision and sectoral policies into distinct investment projects that are necessary
to meet the existing infrastructure needs and ensure sustainable development. The PSIP
covers the period 2009-2013 and includes the General Government sector, the Statutory
Bodies, State Owned Companies, and Local Authorities including the Rodrigues
Regional Assembly. The projected investment between July 2009 and December 2013
will amount to Rs.81.6 billion (US$2.72 billion or 28 percent o f 2008 GDP) o f which
external project financing w i l l account for around Rs.24 billion or 30 percent,
Government financing and other Public Sector Institutions' own funds for Rs.29 billion,
thus leaving a financing gap o f approximately Rs.28 billion.

21.    Government i s well aware that implementation capacity i s the binding constraint
on public investment in the short/medium run and thus has taken policy measures to
address bottlenecks. One o f them, namely the setting up o f the Project Plan Committee i s


                                                   10
a proposed prior action in this operation. This Committee i s tasked to determine the
infrastructure needs o f the country and develop a pipeline o f projects. This Committee i s
under the aegis o f the Ministry o f Public Infrastructure, Land Transport and Shipping.
This will ensure implementation o f the most urgent projects on a timely basis. Moreover,
two schemes - the `Service to Mauritius Program' and `Capacity Building Program' have
been set up to develop capacity for project preparation, implementation, and supervision.
These schemes have been put in place so as to facilitate the recruitment o f
localhternational expertise in specific areas to assist MinistriesDepartments in the
formulation, design and evaluation o f projects and programs. Also, the institutional
framework for public procurement has been improved by streamlining procedures that
were causing delays at the tendering stage and thereby putting pressure on limited
financial resources. The new Public Procurement Act 2006 (amended in 2009 as per the
Additional Stimulus Package (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009) and i t s
accompanying regulations o f 2008 establish three independent bodies to ensure that
public funds are spent in a transparent, efficient, and fair manner.

22.     On the microeconomic front, Mauritius took note o f the added challenges that the
world economic crisis i s bringing to f i r m s and workers. As a result, a number o f
measures are being pursued in the context o f the Saving Jobs and Recovery Fund
mentioned in Table 6. A salient policy initiative in this context has been the Mauritius
Approach which started to be implemented in December 2008. In this approach, the
government becomes an equity partner up to the level o f 40 percent o f additional funds
required for the survival o f the firms. The firm will itself participate with equity o f 20
percent, commercial banks will assist with loans o f 40 percent, at a concessionary interest
rate, not exceeding the savings rate, and the remaining 40 percent will be contributed by
the Government. The Government's contribution will be in the form o f redeemable and
convertible preference shares remunerated at 5 percent annually or provide a guarantee
for 50 percent o f the additional financing given by the banks. The, firms that require
assistance will have to prepare a comprehensive and viable reengineering plan that
ensures that the f i r m s will make enough profit once the international crisis i s over.

23.     The main goal o f the Mauritius approach i s to reduce the likelihood o f lay-offs. It
has saved jobs already, but i t s effectiveness in the medium-run remains to be tested
particularly if the downturn persists. Over the last months, there has been growing
pressure to broaden coverage o f firms under the program. The M O F E E and other
stakeholders involved are aware o f the importance to target viable f i r m s only and not to
stifle necessary on-going transformation in the economy, but a balance against short-term
social needs i s being sought. All measures announced in the last budget are being
implemented with awareness to their fiscal implications. Hence, while there i s an element
o f policy experimentation in the efforts to support f i r m s and workers directly during the
downturn, such policy initiatives have not implied disregard for budgetary constraints so
far. The government has also announced other policy measures to reduce likelihood o f
massive layoffs - the working and training program, also a proposed prior action, i s an
example.

24.     O n the macroeconomic front, the policy framework remains adequate. Before the
crisis, macroeconomic management was based on a contractionary fiscal policy designed
to reduce the debt burden and to leave room for private investment growth. Tax revenues
increased in 2007 and 2008 following important tax reforms and reduction in trade tariffs.
This helped to strengthen attractiveness of the economy while attaining fiscal
consolidation goals. Greater fiscal responsibility in the form o f lower government
spending along with strong GDP performance allowed a reduction o f debt-to-GDP ratio
from 69.2 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 53.7 percent o f GDP in 2008. A Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) was established in March 2007 to set basic interest rates and improve
inflation control. For some time, monetary policy effectiveness was hampered due to
excess structural liquidity in domestic capital markets, but the issue was addressed.
Though not always a smooth ride, the monetary policy framework improved over time as
the functioning o f the MPC benefited from leadership, acquired experience and external
contribution. Regarding exchange rate management, the BOM did not resist appreciating
pressure when FDI inflows were at its peak, letting the currency appreciate almost 25
percent between January 2007 and M a y 2008. This revealed consistency between
exchange rate and monetary policies as well as political resolve from Central Bank given
the pressure exerted by the export sector in favor o f a depreciated currency. Despite the
large swings in the nominal exchange rate, an IMF assessment indicated that the real
exchange rate remained aligned to i t s fundamentals.

25.    Once the crisis hit, the economy experienced a marked shift in the balance o f risks
from inflation to growth. Macroeconomic policy reaction was swift and provided a
coordinated response to help minimize fall in domestic output. A fiscal stimulus package
combined with monetary easing was put in place s t i l l in 2008." So far, these
expansionary macroeconomic policies have been carried out within reasonable limits
given projections for the fiscal deficit and inflation, and complemented by initiatives at
the microeconomic front as listed above. Exchange rate management has, once again,
remained consistent with active monetary policy. Overall, macro policy framework
contributed to internal and external balances by directly cushioning fall in quantities
(monetary and fiscal policy stimulating real domestic absorption) and allowing price
adjustments to take place (adjustment o f the real exchange rate contributing to external
balance).

26.      Despite the challenging international environment and the possibility o f risk
scenarios leading to grim macroeconomic outcomes, the policy and institutional
framework to manage aggregate demand i s good. Sustained efforts in fiscal consolidation
over the recent years, timely and sustainable fiscal stimulus package to counter an
external shock, evolving monetary policy framework that quickly aligned with fiscal
tools to support aggregate demand when necessary, and policy-consistent exchange-rate
regime all uphold this assessment. Accordingly, the baseline scenario produced by WB
staff projects that Mauritius should emerge from the world crisis without macroeconomic
disruptions, although the near-term outlook i s unfavorable (Table 7). Appendix 3 brings a
table with Selected Economic Indicators.

                                            SUSTAINABILITY

27.     From the 1990s to early 2000s, slower growth and eroding trade taxes fueled
growing deficits and a progressive rise in public debt to around 70 percent o f GDP.
However, between 200906 and 2008/09, a concerted effort to restore fiscal discipline has
succeeded in reversing the upward trend." The establishment o f a Debt Management
Unit in the MOFEE, preparation o f a debt management strategy and recent passage of a
Debt Management Act 2008 (DPL3 prior action) all underscore the Government's firm
intentions to reduce the debt burden in Mauritius.

28.    The world economic crisis interrupted such good momentum in public debt
dynamics. Despite progress achieved so far, level o f public debt remains high,
particularly for a small and vulnerable open economy. Fiscal measures to support
aggregate demand and protect vulnerable people in response to the crisis are important
and politically unavoidable, but should not threaten macroeconomic stability. The same
holds for the increased willingness to enhance budget support from Development
Partners. Hence, analysis o f the public debt trajectory where all these factors are
considered - along with updated macroeconomic projections - are necessary.

 29.      Total public sector debt stands at 55.4 percent o f GDP as o f March 2009. The
 bulk o f the debt i s domestic (48 percent o f GDP) and short-term. External public debt i s
 predominantly long-term and contracted on favorable terms with multilateral institutions.
 The fact that short-term debt constitutes a large portion o f the domestic debt (46 percent
 o f total) (Table 8) poses a potential roll-over risk. The current situation, however, i s o f
 excess structural liquidity in domestic capital markets. This eases concerns over roll-over
 risks for now, but also stresses the vulnerability o f public debt dynamics to performance
 o f the domestic banking sector (key buyer o f domestic public debt).




 l1 Note that the 2007/08 budget also discontinued a Consolidated Debt Sinking Fund, reducing both the
 liability and asset sides of the balance sheet b y around Rs.6 billion or 2.5 percent o f GDP.

30.        In this context, the increased interest for external borrowing observed during 2009
(Table 4) serves the purpose o f debt portfolio diversification. Foreign debt carries
currency risk, but with much longer repayment periods (20 to 30 years). Given the l o w
levels o f external debt in Mauritius (less than 10 percent o f GDP), debt substitution
(foreign for domestic) i s recommended. I t must be said, though, that public debt
management in Mauritius needs to be strengthened in order for strategic considerations
like t h i s to be systematically factored into debt management. This i s a key area for further
progress in macroeconomic management over the coming years, and particularly relevant
if the world economy undergoes an inflationary cycle leading to rising interest rates once
the global recession i s over. The Government i s aware o f the need to advance in t h i s area
and has requested advisory services from the WB in Public Debt Management. A WB
Treasury mission visited Mauritius in June 2009 and jointly with the BOM and the
MOFEE developed an action plan for improving Public Debt Management. The mission
also provided training workshops which proved quite helpful in strengthening the
relationship with key counterparts and advancing the policy dialogue. Table 9 outlines
the action plan and i t s components as i t was presented to the authorities. Since then, there
has been continuous engagement and the WB i s exploiting modalities under which
technical assistance could be maintained.

31.    Published in July 2008, the last Article I V and Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA) praised the steady decline o f public sector debt as well as improvements in i t s
maturity structure. Risk o f external debt distress was considered to be low. Clearly the
world economic crisis has changed the landscape and a new assessment i s necessary. An
IMF mission took place in early February o f 2009 with the objective to conduct a
macroeconomic update. The WB was part o f the mission, which directly fed into the
preparation o f DPL3. A public release statement was then issued and Mauritius'
macroeconomic fundamentals were assessed as solid despite the sharply deteriorating



                                              14
external environment. The mission specifically welcomed the "government's proactive
policy response in the form of a fiscal stimulus package and coordinated monetary
easing" while stressing the need "to remain vigilant in maximizing the impact of the
stimulus, while containing fiscal and balance o f payments pressures."

32.    A new Article I V mission i s scheduled to visit Mauritius in October of 2009. In
the meantime, to verify debt sustainability we conduct a DSA using the macroeconomic
                         n
framework presented i the previous section. I t is important to note that, since the last
budget (May 2009), both the IMF and the WE3 have been benefiting from the close
dialogue with the Ministry o f Finance that shares fiscal updates on a monthly basis. In the
midst o f a very uncertain economic environment, such information sharing has allowed
WE3 staff to construct an up-to-date macro-framework and perform an informative fiscal
sustainability analysis.

33.    The conclusion of the debt sustainability analysis i s that public debt i s sustainable
under the baseline macroeconomic scenario presented in the previous section. T h i s result
takes into account the outlook for sluggish domestic growth, higher fiscal deficits and
increased external borrowing for the coming two years already discussed. I t i s
particularly important to highlight the role of GDP growth rate assumptions in public

debt sustainability for Mauritius. WB staff have erred on the side o f caution when
projecting economic recovery in Mauritius (see table 7). Although public debt dynamics
                  n
will deteriorate i the coming years, debt-to-GDP ratio i s expected to revert to i t s
declining trend after 2011. Additionally, bound tests indicate small vulnerability o f public
sector debt dynamics to interest rate and primary balance shocks. There i s greater
vulnerability, however, to depreciation, contingent liability and growth shocks.I2




l2The impact of the latter shock i s influenced by the conservative assumption o n GDP recovery built in the
baseline scenario.

          C. IMPACT OF THE STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND STOCK-TAKING OF
                    THE DPL-SUPPORTED GOVERNMENT  PROGRAM



34.     This DPL i s the fourth and last operation o f the current programmatic series.
Originally planned for three operations, the series was extended by one to support the
reform program through the completion o f the term o f current administration as well as to
continue to support the Government in the midst o f the crisis. Since DPL1, which
coincided with the first year o f the newly elected Government (2006), a number o f core
policy actions and institutional reforms have been supported by the DPL (Annex I).
Between 2006 and 2009 a bold reform agenda has been implemented and B o x 1 presents
a summary l i s t o f critical reforms achieved. The DPL series has been an integral part o f
the reforms process and most o f the measures cited below were triggers or prior actions
in the individual operations.

                       Box 1: Key Reforms Achieved Between 2006 and 2009

Consolidating Fiscal Performance and Improving Public Sector Eficiency
 Fiscal rules implemented (current expenditure rule and public debt legislation)
 PBB, PMS and MTEF frameworks introduced
 Tax system was revamped (single flat tax o n personal and corporate income)
 New procurement legislation
 Reforms in the parastatal sector launched
Enhancing Competitiveness
 Tariff duties reduced
 Regulations for export-processing zone (EPZ) and non-EPZ firms have been unified
 Air access liberalized
 Immigration restrictions eased
 Reduction o f broadband internet costs through regulatory action
 Improving the Business Climate
 Business registration and regulation procedures simplified through new legislation
 Restrictions o n land acquisition b y foreigners eased
 New insolvency legislation
 New labor market legislation
Widening the Circle of Opportunity through Participation, Social Inclusion and Sustainability
 The National Empowerment Foundation for training redundant and re-allocated was established
 Education reform was launched
 Plan for Eradicating Absolute Poverty launched

35.     The objectives o f the series are twofold: (i) support the transition of the
                                                            to
Mauritian economy from a l o w wage, l o w skill.sugar and apparel exporter to innovative,
knowledge and skill based services economy; and (ii) support the economy in coping
                                                           to
with effects o f the so called "triple trade shock" (phasing out o f sugar and textile
preferences and high o i l prices). Given the structural and long-term nature o f (i),
assessments o f the program at t h i s stage w i l l be necessarily partial. Many o f the new
pieces o f legislation introduced will take time to produce i t s full effects, and promoting a
more innovative, entrepreneurial culture i s by nature a sluggish process. Nevertheless, as
the series come to a close, it i s important to assess the likely impact o f what has been


                                                  18
accomplished. In regards to objective (ii),      more definitive indication that desirable
outcomes have been met i s available given the macroeconomic performance in the last
three years. In assessing the impact o f the reforms, the team takes note that the issue o f
attribution i s notoriously complex and refrains from tying particular reforms to specific
outcomes. Instead, this section discusses the pace o f economic transformations over the       .
last years and their potential relationship to the overall reform program, also identifying
areas where faster progress i s needed.

36.      At the macroeconomic level, early indications that Mauritius i s coping well with
the "triple trade shock" i s positive. GDP growth averaged 5.3 percent annually between
2006 and 2008, against an average o f 3.3 percent between 2002 and 2005.
Unemployment rate reduced from 9.5 percent in 2005 to 7.2 percent in 2008, as female
unemployment rate went down significantly given new job opportunities in the service
sector. Growth and employment are two key indicators in the results framework o f the
operation which have achieved excellent performance. More importantly, they were
attained concurrently with fiscal consolidation: budget deficit reduced from 5.4 percent o f
GDP in 2005/06 to 3.1 percent in 2008/09, and debt-to-GDP ratio has been declining over
the period as well. In 2009, weaker macroeconomic outcomes are expected due to the
negative external environment, but t h i s i s an exogenous shock.

37.     Regarding growth drivers, physical capital accumulation has been for a long time
the key driver o f the Mauritian economy, dominating the contributions o f human capital
and total factor productivity (TF'P) to growth. This stylized fact has not changed after the
reform program started in 2006. Indeed, growth accounting techniques suggest that GDP
growth in Mauritius continues to be led by input accumulation as opposed to increases in
total factor productivity. Physical capital has been particularly dominant, accounting for
72 percent o f output growth between 1984 and 2008; while human capital accounted for
24 percent and total factor productivity only 4 percent.

38.        Strong investment pace (capital accumulation) i s fully consistent with a fast
growing economy like Mauritius that has accomplished remarkable catch-up in GDP per
capita over the last 40 years. However, achieving higher total productivity i s crucial to
diversifying and sustaining economic performance in a world where trade rents are n o
longer available. Pillars B and C o f the DPL series (trade competitiveness and investment
climate) focus directly on promoting an environment capable o f engendering total
productivity growth, while pillars A and D (fiscal consolidation and social inclusion)
target the necessary underlying conditions for it to happen. So far, at a n aggregate level,
t h i s has not taken place. Labor productivity has increased, but as a result o f capital
accumulation. Transferring resources from l o w to high productivity activities at a faster
pace remains a key challenge for faster productivity growth in Mauritius. Diversification
into new emerging sectors such as seafood, knowledge hub, financial services,
Information and Communications Technology (ICT), with the potential to create high
value added knowledge based activities holds significant promise, but has not
materialized at the speed that one would hope for.

39.       The reforms supported by the DPL have tackled key obstacles for this process to
happen though. In particular, the overall regulatory framework has been revamped by
now with key pieces o f legislation (Labor, Insolvency, Public Debt Management,
Procurement) introducing fundamental changes to economic life and laying the necessary
g r ~ u n d w o r k . ' Government policies are being designed with a clear competitiveness
                        ~
perspective. Support to SME development and transitional support to workers have
played a key role in mitigating social adjustment costs. There are, however, challenges
that cannot be resolved in the short-run. Chief among them are the infrastructure gap and
the readiness o f the labor force to participate in the new economic model where human
capital requirements are much higher. Another challenge relates to the balance between
social support and economic agents and maintaining reallocation incentives that will
ultimately channel resources towards their highest value o f use. Natural political frictions
emerge from this trade-off, which have been compounded by the potential social impact
o f the world economic crisis.



l3Performance on the World Bank doing business'rankalso reflects the positive impact of reforms.
Mauritius was placed in 28' position in 2008, moving to 24' in 2009 and finally to 17" in 2010. The
Government has stated back in 2006/07 the objective of reaching the top 10 position on the ease of doing
business.


                                                    20
40.     Given all complications involved, i t i s not surprising that significant changes in
the structure o f the economy are taking time to materialize. What i s most important i s that
government policies have moved in the right direction. Along the process, as illustrated
by the respite in tariff reductions for DPL2 for instance, Government has course-
corrected when necessary. The world economic crisis also provides a case-in-point where
policies were promptly adjusted to combine long-run objectives with pressing immediate
threats to the economy. This i s true not only for the more obvious macroeconomic
policies, but also at a microeconomic level where timely, targeted and temporary policies
were put in place.

41.     Despite bottlenecks in implementation capacity at the public sector, the
Government has demonstrated ability to cope with a changing world and to formulate,
implement, and monitor policies conducive to growth and equity. Clear commitment to a
reform track embracing economic openness together with pragmatic policy decisions in
the face o f unexpected difficulties has quickly built a positive reputation for the
Mauritian policy makers. The manner in which the reform process has been conducted
has yielded a key asset for the Government: credibility.

42.       Credibility was a key factor allowing Mauritius to post the strong growth figures
since reforms started. Accumulation o f physical capital was once again instrumental for
the growth pick-up since 2006 (dispensing TFP growth), but t h i s time FDI inflows into
emerging service sectors played a crucial and unprecedented role (Figure 5). In particular,
investment into Hotel & Restaurant and Financial Intermediation led the process as FDI
inflows raised to 40 percent o f gross capital formation in the economy. Such a positive
performance was facilitated by the environment o f global liquidity existing at the time,
but ultimately could only materialize in full force due to the liberalizing thrust o f the
reform program and the commitment demonstrated by the government in implementing
i t s plan. The high levels o f economic growth recorded between 2006 and 2008 on the
backings o f strong FDI-led investment galvanized broad domestic and international
support which allowed the government to continue pursuing i t s reform agenda.

43.     The DPL series strengthened t h i s credibility building process by providing a
framework for policy sequencing and prioritization. It has also provided a platform for
dialogue between the MOFEE and various line ministries contributing directly to an
increase in reach o f the reform program. DPLs 1 and 2 were particularly useful to the
government not only because o f the financial resources they brought to the budget, but
because o f their preparation cycle which introduced structure in the way that needed
reforms were diagnosed, formulated, implemented and monitored. Under the leadership
o f the MOFEE, the DPL was able to further empower the government reform program by
bringing in sectoral expertise and steering dialogue with line ministries. DPLs 3 (and the
proposed DPL4) played a similar role and enjoyed the benefit o f a well established policy
dialogue. The financial resources brought to the budget were particularly useful given
fiscal pressures created by the world economic crisis. The good track record o f reforms
and the fact that Mauritius had been nurturing a meaningful policy dialogue with the
Development Partners since the beginning o f i t s reform program in 2006, allowed for a
quick rally o f the international community in support o f the country as the world
economic crisis hit. Credibility again functioned as an important asset, creating more
headroom for policy response and continuity o f the reforms.

44.      The reform program has not yet been able to diversify Mauritius export profile
significantly. In particular, stagnant goods export performance continues to generate the
need for external savings absorption and to imply vulnerability to external socks. The
Mauritian trade balance (good and services) has deteriorated at a fast pace since 2001,
when the demise o f low-end textile manufacturing started. As indicated in Figure 7 , the
trade deficit has been hovering between 10 and 15 percent o f GDP for the last three
years. The current account deficit has also increased significantly more recently. I t i s true
that the widening Mauritian trade deficit partly reflects increases in the import bill due to
strong capital imports and high prices o f energy and food. Both factors are permanent
features o f either the nature o f the emerging economic model for Mauritius (openness to
the world economy) or the country's commodity dependence. Nonetheless, while services
export grew 35 percent between 2006 and 2008, goods exports grew only 2 percent
during the same period - Figure 8. The vision that Mauritius w i l l specialize in high value-
added services and thus overcome external vulnerabilities through a massive quality-
driven increase in services export i s not a short-run solution. It i s important to continue
trade reforms and channel reallocation pressures across the economy towards the
exploitation o f niche markets abroad. This i s the best route to improve export profile,
economic diversification, enhance linkages across domestic manufacturing and service
sectors, and boost resilience to external shocks.

45.       Having noted the inability o f goods exports to post strong growth over the recent
years, it i s also important to highlight the adjustment that the manufacturing sector
(mostly driven by export-oriented textiles and garments) underwent. Faced with the
phasing out o f trade preferences, textile companies had to change to survive. They
acquired capital and vertically integrated part o f the activities. Even smaller f i r m s
climbed up the value added ladder. Data on manufacturing gross job flows reflect the
dramatic adjustment that has taken place at the establishment level. While sheer
movements in aggregate net employment figures already hint to the magnitude o f t h i s
process, looking at simultaneous j o b creation and destruction at the micro level suggests
an even more impressive adjustment. As indicated in Table 11, Job destruction rates in
the manufacturing sector reached very high levels in 2004 and 2005 i anticipation to the
                                                                        n
phasing out o f preferences, declining steadily from 2006 to 2008. Job creation rates
sustained healthy levels (2006 being an exception) and overtook destruction in 2007 and
2008. The adaptation o f the textile sector has been remarkable and the poor performance
in overall goods exports should be seen as inability o f other sectors to reach the same
level o f competitiveness.

46.     International competition triggered by the phase-down o f trade preferences was an
important driver o f the adaptation process in the textile industry. I t remains to be seen the
extent to which voluntary exposure to international competitive pressures will be used
across other sectors as a leverage for economic transformation. The reform program has
been preparing the landscape for the blossoming o f a high-value added service economy
and this should remain a priority. It helped to attract strong investment inflows which
sustained growth over the last years. However, a number o f factors beyond tariff


                                                                     23
reductions - importlexport licenses, administrative trade regulations and technical
standards - s t i l l protect and insulate part o f the domestic economy, stifling reallocation
pressures. Mauritius can s t i l l gain from reforms that raise competitiveness and
productivity within the confines o f existing structural bottlenecks (human capital and
infrastructure deficits). A s with textiles, fully exploiting the benefits o f engagement in
international markets as a transformational force can bring further competitiveness to the
economy. In particular, Mauritius will not become a dynamic competitive exporter unless
it becomes a competitive importer as well. The existence o f enough political traction for
reforms in that direction i s not clear, but the Government i s aware about the issue and it
remains part o f on-going policy dialogue.

47.     There are other areas o f the reform program in which progress has been difficult.
For example, under the theme o f efficiency in the public sector, restructuring of public
enterprises has witnessed only initial reforms, but sufficient traction has not been
generated to follow up with fundamental changes needed. Governance arrangements s t i l l
insulate public enterprises from the more efficiency-oriented mindset being promoted
across the central government. The N e w Chart o f Accounts o f the Treasury has not been
rolled out to parastatals yet, which means that breakdown o f information on expenditure
i s not as rich as one would hope to allow for an effective use o f PBB. Finally,
information on parastatal debt i s not up to the level o f reporting as the central government
debt.

48.      Also under the theme o f efficiency in the public sector, progress on Performance
Management Systems (PMS) has been sluggish. The Government has adopted a bottom-
up strategy to carry out P M S reforms whereby sensitization exercises were conducted as
a first step to familiarize staff with the new tool for performance assessment. While this
has been positive, some crucial steps s t i l l remain to be taken. For example: (i)    subject
                                                                               i)
high-level officials in line ministries to performance criteria as well and ( ilink PMS and
PBB exercises - the IMF has been providing technical assistance in this area. Effective
implementation o f a P M S system is an important component o f civil sector reform and
(as in the case o f parastatals) it requires both the strategic use o f political capital and a
high level o f internal consensus. While the Ministry o f C i v i l Service and Administrative
Reform attempted to face the latter head on, consensus was slow to build and it seems
that less than sufficient political capital was allocated to push the reforms through.

49.     A third area in which progress has been weak i s on the rationalization o f social
safety nets. Mauritius's complex web o f social programs has historical roots. As the
economy benefited from trade preferences, a vast social protection system was developed
as a way to redistribute rents back to the society. It i s only natural to revisit the system
now that i t s underlying logic (trade rents) i s n o longer valid. However, the task o f
implementing such reforms has proven to be politically very difficult. Political
willingness for a fast and deep reform (such as the one with tariff duties) i s not present
and the Government has concentrated o n consensus and capacity building with the help
o f Development Partners so far. Hence, structural impact o f the reform program o n the
public sector functioning has been less than hoped for. The Government remains




                                              24
committed to maintaining the course and it has established partnerships with the
Development Community to speed address the known shortcomings.

50.     T o complement the discussion above, table 12 presents some o f the indicators o f
the DPL series - the complete version can be found at the DPL matrix in Annex I The   .
overall assessment i s positive with strong outcomes on fiscal consolidation, investment
climate and trade competitiveness. Deterioration on macroeconomic figures i s observed
around 2009 as a direct reflection o f the world economic crisis, an exogenous event.
Some indicators under investment climate and trade competitiveness reforms (e.g.
exports as percentage of GDP, number o f days to enforce contract) did not achieve the
progress envisaged, reflecting the point made above that Mauritius can still gain from
reforms that raise competitiveness and productivity within the confines o f existing
structural bottlenecks. On the social sector, indicators o f performance have not been
strong. Government has stepped up i t s effort, particularly after the 2008/09 budget, and
remains committed to reforms in the corresponding pillar.

                 1 1 THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
                  1.

51.     The Government came to power with a clear vision o f restoring growth through
such measures as cutting red tape, improving the investment climate, empowering
economic agents, supporting SMEs, liberalizing air access, while at the same time
providing specific support to various existing and new sectors.14 After the election, a
number o f working groups were set up to review existing policies and look for ways to
streamline and simplify the regulatory framework. Policy makers recognized an array o f
interrelated problems to be addressed, chief among them:

l4See" Setting the Stage for Robust Growth," (statement b y Hon. Ramakrishna Sithanen, Deputy Prime
Minister, Minister o f Finance and Economic Development at the National Assembly on 30 August 2005).


                                                     25
 0    Distorted incentives and ineficient resource allocation: Inherent biases in the tax
      system as well as burdensome controls and regulations hindered efficient resource
      allocation (and reallocation), innovation and risk taking.
 0    Poor quality and costly services: Poor quality and expensive utilities and services
      such as transport and communications lowered productivity and undermined the
      competitiveness o f both existing and new sectors.
 0    Low educational attainment: Capacity constraints in the education system, high
      attrition rates and outmoded curricula were contributing factors to l o w basic
      languages, math and science proficiency and a shortage o f workers and
      professionals with world-class skills.
 0    Laxfiscal management: Failure to adjust to slower growth and declining trade taxes
      since the late 1990s put the public finances under increasing stress, with public debt
      o n an unsustainable trajectory.
  0   Public sector ineficiency: Complex and bureaucratic regulations, poorly designed
       and executed social programs, weak procurement practices and loss-making
      parastatals undermined efficiency and diverted resources from priority needs.

52.    By the time the Finance Minister introduced his first budget in June 2006, the
Government's views had evolved to the point o f advocating, "wholesale change and
adoption o f a totally new paradigm.. .. It i s time for the nation to embrace radical change
and build a new, open and competitive service platform that i s fully integrated into the
global economy.. ..7 ~ 1 5 The budget speech announced forty major reforms structured
around four main pillars:

      A.   Fiscal Consolidation and Public Sector Efficiency
      B.   Improving Trade Competitiveness
      C.   Improving the Investment Climate
      D.   Widening the circle o f opportunity through participation, social inclusion and
           sustainability

                      A. Fiscal Consolidation and Public Sector Efficiency

53.     Macroeconomic stability i s a necessary cornerstone o f integration into the global
economy. "Hence the imperative of pursuing sound macroeconomic policies and putting
public finance on a solid footing. Investors must have the confidence that the deficit and
debt will be brought down to sustainable levels and that Government will become lean
and trim."16 Fiscal rules were adopted for the FY2006/07 budget: (i) golden rule that
                                                                      the
Government should borrow only for investment and not for recurrent expenditure; and
(ii) sustainable investment rule that net public debt as a proportion o f GDP should be

on a downward track.17 Sector Ministry Support Teams (SMSTs) were set up in the
MOFEE" to work with sector Ministries on budget preparation, and audit committees
and "cut waste" squads were put in place to monitor execution and look for cost savings,
especially in the capital budget. Numerous recommendations to improve efficiency were
put forward based on their investigations.

54.     The 2006/07 budget demonstrated a serious commitment to reversing the upward
trend in deficits and debt. A sharp reduction in primary spending by 2 percent o f GDP far
                                                                                     i)
exceeded the target o f 0.5 percent (a DPLl prior action), though in fact only rule ( iwas
achieved as total borrowing (4.3 percent o f .GDP) exceeded the capital budget (3.4
percent of GDP).19

55.      Beyond restoring fiscal balance, the public sector agenda addressed a number o f
important issues, including reducing distortions and increasing equity in the tax code,
relinquishing discretionary powers to grant tax and duty exemptions and operationalizing
the Mauritius Revenue Authority. With technical support from UNDP and IMF, an
important initiative to improve public sector efficiency and effectiveness has been to
modernize the budget process through adoption of a Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) and PBB. A key PBB requirement i s the development o f sector
strategic plans, currently proposed prior actions under DPL4. Rounding out the public
sector agenda are an overhaul o f procurement, parastatal reform, improved debt
management and civil service reform.

                                  B. Improving Trade Competitiveness

56.    Over the years, an accretion o f interventions and regulations had impacted
negatively on trade competitiveness and impeded the flow o f resources to new, potential
growth sectors. The structure o f incentives was biased:

         Toward domestic production rather than exports. Trade protection skewed returns
         in favor o f producing for the domestic market, reducing competition and overall
         efficiency to the detriment o f exporters.
         Toward existing; rather than new sectors. Rigid and inflexible regulations deterred
         businesses from innovating or changing the skills m i x o f their labor force, limited
         entry and reduced competition.
         Toward large rather than small firms. Smaller firms were unable to take
         advantage o f complex incentive schemes, while high compliance costs drove
         many SMEs into the informal sector, curtailing their access to credit, training and
         other benefitsa2'


l7 However, that classification o f expenditure between capital and recurrent i s to some extent arbitrary. For
instance, all expenditure under the Empowerment Programme has been charged to the capital budget.
Roughly 90 percent o f spending o n health and education i s classed as recurrent spending.
l8 The MOFED was renamed MOFEE in August 2008.
   Note that rule (i) not part o f the new Debt Law.

57.        The reform program addressed these problems in two ways. First, revamping
incentives, eliminating the distinction between Export Processing Zone and non-EPZ
f i r m s and dismantling tariff barriers (while iving f i r m s accustomed to high levels o f
effective protection an opportunity to adjust2K); eliminating a 25 percent investment tax
credit to remove the anti-labor bias o f the tax system; dramatically lightening regulatory
burdens, including by simplifying the application process for permits and licenses and
substituting ex-post verification o f health and safety standards for ex-ante approvals to
register a business.

58.    Second, developing and implementing sector strategies to reduce costs and
increase competitiveness in existing and new sectors - sugar, textiles and apparel,
tourism and financial services, Information Technology (IT) and Business Process
Outsourcing (BPO), fisheries, aquaculture, land-based ocean industry and a knowledge
hub. These strategies would define the vision for the sector and provide a road map for
Government policy, identifying needs for resource planning and capacity building.

                                 C. Improving the Investment Climate

59.    Weak investment spending over the years (prior 2006), especially FDI, had
eroded competitiveness. Elements o f the business environment such as labor regulations,
land titling and business registration procedures needed to be overhauled and
Government set the goal o f moving Mauritius into the top ten o f the W B ' s Doing
Business survey. A key element, largely addressed in the 2006/07 budget, was
eliminating bureaucratic obstacles to starting a business. The Registrar o f Companies was
designated as a one stop focal agency for business registration and the Board o f
Investment converted from being an administrator o f programs to a facilitator and
promoter. Whereas f i r m s previously had to obtain ex-ante fire and health certificates
before starting operations, now they can begin operating subject to ex-post verification o f
adherence to published guidelines. Other measures include merging development and
building permits and reducing the number o f distinct activity clusters from ten to three.

60.      A perennial obstacle to operating a business in Mauritius had been the shortage o f
human capital. Entry o f foreign workers was eased to overcome skill shortages by
combining residence and work permits into a single occupation permit to be issued within
no more than three days for workers earning above preset thresholds. Provisions for
spouses to work as professionals and for conversion o f tourist to business visas were also
liberalized. An important aspect o f opening the economy was amending the L a w
Practitioners' A c t to allow entry o f international law firms. At the same time, measures
were taken to encourage the return o f the Mauritian diaspora to work in Mauritius.

61.    Central to improving the investment climate was implementation o f labor market
reforms aimed at increasing flexibility, tying wages more closely to productivity by

21A decision to increase adjustment assistance and slow the pace o f tariff reductions required deferring an
indicative trigger o n tariff reform from DPL2 to DPLS.



                                                     28
replacing the tripartite wage setting mechanism with a National Pay Council, disbanding
the current system o f Remuneration Orders and relaxing the need to seek approval for
lay-offs. In addition, land administration and management needed to be modernized
through the introduction o f a cadastre system and establishment o f transparent and
predictable procedures for transfers o f ownership and usage.

62.    Finally, infrastructure investments were needed to alleviate road congestion and
increase capacity in the port, airport, and power sector at the same time as enhancing
regulatory capacity.

               D. Widening the circle o opportunity throughparticipation,
                                       f
                          social inclusion, and sustainability

63.    The President's speech to the National Assembly put forward a program that was
equally committed to equity and social justice on the one hand and economic efficiency
on the other. Widening the circle o f opportunity implied, "reforms to the national
economic structure that will open the doors o f economic opportunities to the majority o f
the population. This will in turn contribute to mobilizing the overall competitive
advantage o f the whole population to create more wealth." Thus, the transition to higher
value added services would require both optimizing the use o f available human resources
and providing adequate social safety nets for the vulnerable; increasing access to
education and (re)training, land and financing to start a business, but at the same time
protecting the vulnerable by channelling social support to the truly needy and
implementing a comprehensive strategy for poverty alleviation and ensuring
environmental and pension sustainability.

64.                    n
      Many initiatives i these areas were incorporated into an Empowerment Program
with a budget of Mauritius Rupees (Rs.) 5 billion over five years. The program
encompassed seven activities: (i)      land for social housing; ( i land for small
                                                                  i)
entrepreneurs; ( i ) workfare program emphasizing training and re-skilling; (iv) special
                 i ia
programs for unemployed women; (v) tourist villages; (vi) assistance for outsourcing;
and (vii) support for development o f new entrepreneurs and SMEs.

65.      Beyond these measures, the goal would be to expand opportunities in education,
improve teacher training and supervision, modernize the curriculum to feature more
critical thinking and mathematics, science and language training, revitalize the Zones
d'Education Prioritaires (ZEP) schools with provision o f supportive services (food,
health, and remedial teachers), active community participation, and expand tertiary
education. D P L 2 and DPL3 triggers have supported preparation o f a national education
strategy.

66.     Government planned also to reform the administration o f social safety nets to
strengthen financial viability and focus support on the truly needy, replacing consumer
price subsidies with conditional cash transfers to the most needy, improving access to
high quality health care, and reforming the pension system to ensure long term
sustainability. Conscious o f environmental vulnerabilities, particularly in light of the



                                           29
projected rise in tourist arrivals to 2 million by 2015, a new National Environment
Strategy would be developed and implemented to protect the nation's environmental
assets.

Consultations and Political Economy Aspects o the Government Reform Agenda

67.     The main instrument for introducing the reforms i s  e budget. Hence,
                                                                     h
consultation and engagement o f stakeholders in design and formulation o f reforms take
place through the budget preparation process. Each year, the largest private sector
coordinating body in Mauritius (Joint Economic Council) prepares a private sector
budget proposal and forwards it to the Minister o f Finance for consideration. The Joint
Economic Council's (JEC) view represents a substantial portion o f the business
community. Besides the document itself, the JEC meets with the Finance Minister and
officials from his office for discussions. MOFEE also meets with industry associations
(which may also be members o f the JEC) to discuss sectoral issues/ proposals. The Labor
Unions also normally prepares their position and discuss with the MOFEE. More
recently, proposals from the civil society i s being requested by emails and some
documents are posted on the web for consultation process prior to submission to cabinet.

68.     As the Government advances with i t s agenda, dealing with the political economy
aspects o f the reform process has become crucial. The Ministry o f Finance has been
leading the way and has quickly implemented bold measures over which it had control
during the f i r s t two years o f reforms. Going forward, more efforts on consensus building
across line ministries and society at large will be essential to tackle some o f the
remaining crucial issues in the agenda. The Ministry o f Finance i s well aware o f this
challenge and has followed an approach with three main ingredients: (i)        mediation and
                                                    i)
conciliatory attempts to harmonize views; ( i policy debate persuasion informed by
sound analysis to anchor the discussion on technical grounds, often performed by
                                                                 i ia

70.     Table 13 illustrates the close connection between DPL and CPS outcomes. The
WB and Government both envisage the DPL as a main instrument for policy dialogue, a
role reaffirmed during the past two Annual Business Planning meetings.22 The DPL has
also played a useful role in harmonizing and coordinating external support in the donor
community.

                B.   COLLABORATION W I T H IMF AND OTHER DONORS

7 1.    A close collaboration has developed with Mauritius' other Development Partners
- the European Commission (EC), Agence Franqaise de DCveloppement (AFD),African
Development Bank (AfDB) and UNDP. The WB and IMF also collaborate closely. The
Government urged all external partners to harmonize their support and the DPL has been
instrumental in accommodating t h i s request through joint preparation and appraisal
missions and coordination o f Technical Assistance (TA) and other activities. However, it
i s the Government which deserves the lion's share o f any credit for harmonization and
coordination which could not have been achieved except in the framework o f a strongly
owned, country-led program.

72.     International Monetary Fund: Mauritius has no formal program with the IMF,
though relations are close. Over the years, the Fund has carried out work on sources o f
growth, labor markets, inflation, exchange rates, and monetary and fiscal policy. More
recently, the Fiscal Affairs Department has provided key support in the area o f fiscal
adjustment and budget reform. WB and Fund s t a f f work closely together and exchange
views frequently. In 2007, they jointly prepared a Financial Sector Assessment Program
update. Over the past three years, (annual) Article I V reports have given cautious, but
positive appraisals o f the Government's program and macro management as evidenced
by assessment letters provided for the DPL series. Both the DPL series and the country
dialogue in general have benefited greatly from the IMF's analysis o f macroeconomic
performance and debt sustainability.

73.       During the first half o f 2009, the Government o f Mauritius expressed interest for
the I M F ' s recently created Flexible Credit Line (FCL) facility. The possibility o f balance
o f payment difficulties in 2010 motivated the interest. If the external environment
continued to deteriorate quickly, strong declines in tourist earnings and textile exports
could drive the Balance o f Payment into a precarious situation. Although certainly a risk,
t h i s was never discussed as an emergency issue, but rather an insurance against further
exogenous shocks.

74.     The F C L introduced an important change to the Fund's lending framework.
Among its features: (i)   modernization o f conditionality (focus o n pre-set qualification
criteria as opposed to traditional conditionality found in the stand-by arrangements); (ii)
doubling access limits; and (iii)  adaptatiodsimplification o f lending costs and maturity
structures. The facility, however, has been awarded only to three countries so far
(Mexico, Colombia and Poland) and has not come as a blanket substitution to all other
lending instruments the IMF possesses - or stand-by arrangements in particular. Under
the FCL, Mauritius could tap up approximately US$1 billion in the form o f a credit line.
The IMF may also decide to explore other possible alternatives to support Mauritius.

75.    In the context o f the recent call for US$250 Billion SDR allocation by the IMF,
Mauritius's SDR allocation has increased from SDR 18.8 million (US$30 million) to
SDR 75.3 million (US$117 million). This increase feeds directly into the official reserves
o f Mauritius and help to cushion possible Balance o f Payment stress.



                                              32
76.    European Commission: The EC has been present in Mauritius for more than
three decades. Under the ninth European Development Fund (EDF) which spanned the
period 2002-07 the focal areas for E C intervention were environment, especially
wastewater, and poverty reduction for the most vulnerable marginalized groups which are
not benefiting from Mauritius' development success. Since 2006 the E C has also
supported the restructuring o f the sugar industry in the context o f the phasing out o f price
guarantees. T w o sector budget supports (SBS) have been completed by 2008: (i)              in
Wastewater 38 million have been disbursed since 2004; and ( iin Sugar 11 million
                                                                      i)
have disbursed since 2007.

77.    In 2007 the E C started i t s first general budget support program in support o f the
economic reform program o f Mauritius called Improved Competitiveness for Equitable
Development (ICED) Program. Total funding for the Program was 108.21 million
                              I which has been disbursed already. For the period 2009-
(adding I C E D Iand I C E D I )   ,
2011, the E C has a new three year program under preparation called Promoting
Sustainable and Equitable Development (PSED). Its total funding to date i s 124.79
million with additional amounts to be added by 2011. Disbursements are expected to
range from 30 to 40 million each year (2010-2012).

78.      The EC General Budget Support (GBS) being grant funded, differs however from
the DPL approach in that it: (i)  bases support on outcome-based indicators, rather than
actions as specified b y DPL triggers; (ii) a different time horizon from the DPL; and
                                           has
(iii)maintains a special interest in sugar sector. The disbursement o f E C funds i s based
on fixed and variable tranches, the former being disbursed against general and specific
conditions and the latter against the achievement o f specific performance indicators. E C
performance indicators are identified and formulated in such a way as to reinforce DPL
triggers wherever possible.

79.      In addition to budget support, in 2007/08 the E C has funded a Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment, and funded technical assistance to
assist the Government o f Mauritius to prepare a long term energy policy and a long term
education sector strategy. The latter was peer reviewed by both E C and WB (with co-
financing from UNDP) education experts. The WB and E C collaborated closely on a joint
diagnostic and results matrix for the W B ' s CPS and the European Union's (EU) tenth
EDF Country Strategy Paper and both participated in the Annual Business Planning
exercise for the current year. The E C also participates in the DPL missions to evaluate the
progress in the economic reform program. The preparation mission o f DPL4 held in June
2009 was jointly conducted with AFD, AfDB and E C as the Development Partners
prepared their respective budget support operations. The E C used the opportunity to
review overall progress in the implementation o f the economic reform program, with
specific focus o n the sectors covered in the PSED program namely sugar, education,
empowerment, energy and environmentlwastewater;

80.    As part o f extra efforts to mitigate the impact o f the global crisis o n most
vulnerable countries, the E C set up a mechanism called vulnerability FLEX to support




                                              33
ACP countries - 500 million for 2009 and 2010. Mauritius has expressed interest on
tapping resources from this newly created fund, but a decision i s still pending.

81.      Agence Frangaise de DCveloppement:AFD has opened an office in Mauritius in
line with the Document Cadre de Partenariat signed on April 2, 2007 between the
Mauritian and French authorities. AFD has supported Mauritius in i t s transition to higher
productivity and competitiveness and greater integration in the world economy through
budget support and TA. A F D ' s focus i s on clusters together with public entities and/or
the private sector, as well as on financing infrastructure to enhance the attractiveness o f
the country to foreign investors. AFD i s providing cofinancing for the reform program
and i s particularly interested in the assessment o f social and environmental impacts o f the
economic reforms and the capacity o f the Government to mitigate them. AFD has
disbursed 24 million per year from 2007 to 2009 aligning with the DPL series calendar.

82.     Sustainable development and the implementation o f the "Maurice, Ile Durable"
program i s a key underlying concern o f AFD in Mauritius. I t s next budget support
operation will be an Environment Aid Program in the form o f non-targeted sectoral
budget support. Financing will come as support to a bundle o f structured and quantified
set o f actions to meet global and sustainable targets in the field o f environment. The
evaluation o f this Program will be based o n an environmental roadmap to be readjusted
every year according to the progress made. The roadmap will not introduce new
disbursement conditions (prior actions), but would be used as a tool for policy dialogue.
Indicative amounts are: 25 million (2009), 50 million (2010), and 50 million (2011).

83.    African Development Bank: The AfDB produced a new Country Strategy Paper
(CSP) for the period 2009-2013 which is organized around two pillars: (i)         enhanced
competitiveness and trade integration; and (ii)  enhanced public sector efficiency and
basic service delivery. The new CSP reflects a scaling up o f AfDB activities in Mauritius.

84.     So far, AfDB's lending in Mauritius has comprised: (i)      budget support to the
order o f US$30 million between 2007 and June 2009; and (ii)       investment projects in
transport ahd water to the order o f US$28 million between 200.1 and 2009. AfDB also
offers M I C grants on different sectors, totaling approximately U S $ l million. There has
been increased collaboration between AfDB and the W3 in the production o f Economic
                                                         E
and Sector Works (ESW). Recent examples are Africa Competitiveness Report,
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and on-going C E M Update on Competitiveness.

85.    Going forward, the AfDB i s preparing a sizeable three-year budget support
operation to the amount o f US$700 million. The first tranche, to be disbursed s t i l l in
2009, w i l l be o f US$200 million. Second tranche, to be disbursed by June 2010, will be
of US$300 million and third tranche o f US$200 million by June 2011. During the DPL4
preparation mission in June 2009, AfDB and the WB worked closely in preparing their
respective operations.

86.    United Nations Development Program (UNDP): As a member of the United
Nations (UN) family, the WB liaises closely with the local UNDP office. The UNDP i s
engaged in a number o f areas which directly support the DPL and i t s current Country


                                              34
Program (2009-2011) totals US$16.5 million. K e y areas o f engagement are: (i)
formulation o f strategic plans at the ministry-department level, Performance-Based
Budgeting and PMS, and Social Register o f Mauritius; (ii) social inclusion through the
Empowerment Program with especial attention for the island o f Rodrigues, the ZEP
educational program and HIV/AIDS; and ( i )    i i environment protection, energy and
management o f natural resources, human rights and governance.

                C.   RELATION T O OTHER WORLD BANKOPERATIONS

87.     On January 2009, the World Bank Board approved the Mauritius Economic
Transition (Technical Assistance) Project (METAP). This i s a US$18 million project with
three components: business facilitation, public enterprise reform, and utility regulation
and public and private partnerships. The objectives o f strengthening the investment
climate and supporting public enterprise reform are well aligned with the DPL. METAP
i s feeding directly into series objectives, particularly under Pillar C (improving the
investment climate) by providing support in business licensing procedures, access to
commercial justice, land title registration, and competition legislation. METAP also plays
an important role for continuing policy engagement in parastatals and utility regulation
reforms, areas where progress o f the Government reform program has been relatively
more sluggish. Finally, METAP will also fund capacity building for a PPP Unit, which
should prove quite important in light o f the country's infrastructure deficit and the need
to attract investments to the sector.

88.     A private sector development investment loan (manufacturing and services
development and competitiveness project) o f US$20 million i s due to be presented at the
Board in the first half o f FY10. Its overall objective i s to support enterprise growth,
competitiveness and employment creation in manufacturing and services sectors by (i)
                                                                                  i)
improving access to quality business development services and markets; ( iincreasing
access to finance through introduction o f financial products better suited to Small and
Medium Enterprise (SME) needs; and ( i ) i ipromoting a conducive business environment
through policy and institutional support. As with METAP, the project also strengthens
and complements the development objectives o f the DPL series, particularly under the
pillars investment climate and trade competitiveness. Furthermore, given the attention
with SMEs, the project also relates directly to the social pillar o f the DPL series.

89.     The Mauritius Infrastructure Project was approved by the Board for US$50
million on September 24, 2009. The project's objective i s to assist Mauritius to improve
its national infrastructure, with emphasis on the transport, energy and water sectors. I t
will provide the necessary financing for activities which have been identified through
extensive policy dialogue with the government, as well as through consultations with
other development partners. The project has two components: (i)     road investments and
  i)
( itechnical assistance and institutional development in transport, watedwastewater and
energy subsectors. The technical assistance component has a strategic importance to
Mauritius given the critical infrastructure bottlenecks and l o w disbursement ratios o f
public investment in the country. In fact, this component feeds into a number o f high-
priority policy initiatives that are currently being undertaken such as preparation o f the
Public Sector o f Investment Program and establishment o f a Project Planning Committee


                                            35
(PPC). The PPC i s responsible for assessing infrastructure needs o f the various sectors o f
the economy and for developing a project pipeline to streamline execution. Given the
existing infrastructure gap o f the country and i t s impact on economic growth potential,
the infrastructure project i s also well aligned with the DPL series objectives. More
importantly, the project helps to pave the way for continuing engagement in
infrastructure lending for Mauritius.

                                         LEARNED
                                 D. LESSONS

90.      The DPL series affords important lessons with regard to: (i)                i)
                                                                         ownership; ( i
teamwork and collaboration; (iii)    flexibility; (iv) alignment with the Government's
priorities; and (v) mutual understanding and respect.

91.     Ownership: No doubt ownership has been the single most important factor in the
operation's success. From the outset, the Government has had a strong sense o f direction
about i t s reform program and even a strategy for availing of technical and financial
resources from the Development Community. O f course, ownership cuts both ways. The
Development Partners shared the Government's vision and thus were willing to accept i t s
leadership.

92.     Teamwork: A close collaboration developed as both sides worked together to
diagnose the constraints to growth and ,articulate a strategy to overcome them. This
subsequently became the framework for the DPL program. Open and frank dialogue
created a strong program with buy-in and t r u s t on all sides. As a result, the DPL has been
able to adhere closely to i t s initial structure even as conditions have changed.

93.    Alignment with the Government's priorities: The Government's agenda i s
broad and i t s priorities have inevitably evolved over time. Occasionally this has created
tension when the DPL could not incorporate every current interest. Nevertheless, careful
design o f the operation and linkage to the core reform program have kept the DPL
relevant and even provided a valuable counterweight to short term policy exigency.

94.     Flexibility: By i t s nature, a programmatic operation entails a high degree o f pre-
commitment. The DPL has contributed a useful discipline, but also, where appropriate,
trusted in the Government's judgment and good faith rather than insisting on an overly
rigid interpretation o f the triggers. The second year o f the operation saw significant
slippage in four o f seven triggers: (i)            i)                    i iInformation and
                                           tariff; ( iparastatal reform; ( i )
Communications Technology Authority (ICTA) review; and (iv) the education strategy -
but extended the benefit o f the doubt and interpreted the outcome as political risk
mitigation rather than a wavering of commitment. In the third year, the reform program
regained i t s momentum. Substituting trust for threats has fostered a more open and
effective collaboration.

95.    Mutual understanding and respect: Both sides have been able to respect each
other's needs and objectives. Development Partners deferred to the Government's
assessment o f political economy costs and benefits in such areas as trade policy and
parastatal reform. For i t s part, the Government accepted the Development Partners could


                                             36
    not commit to areas where they had not done due diligence or where there were possible
    reputational risks or conflicts with other obligations o f international organizations.

                                E. ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

    96.     During recent years, the WB has carried out extensive Analytical and Advisory
    Assistance (AAA) work that fed directly into the DPL preparation. The 2006 Aid for
    Trade Report has played a key role in supporting the ambitious government reforms
    initiated in the 2006107 Budget. The 2006 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM),
    2005 Investment Climate Assessment, and 2005 Unemployment Study have also
    contributed to identify crucial constraints to growth and propose policy actions. Technical
    assistance in the areas o f MTEF and Performance Management dating back to 2002 have
    also generated important insights regarding modernization o f Public Sector. The IMF has
    taken a lead role in t h i s area and Fiscal Affairs Department missions to look at options for
.   fiscal consolidation in the context o f the Government's reform program generated useful
    policy recommendations. All o f the above have provided strong analytical underpinnings
    for the initial design o f the Mauritius DPL series and have informed the preparation o f all
    individual operations.

    97.      n
            I the addition to the activities mentioned above, there i s on-going or recently
    completed AAA work that continues to provide solid analytical underpinnings for the
    W B ' s policy dialogue. The on-going CEM Update on competitiveness and the 2009
    Investment Climate Assessment have produced updated diagnostics o f the challenges
    faced by the Mauritian economy after a first generation o f reforms has been completed.
    There i s also analysis underway regarding (i)  trade, FDI and technology transfer; and ( i i)
    social protection. Interaction with the respective T T L s have been very informative and
    shaped some aspects o f the DPL4 operation. Additionally, diagnostics work has taken
    place through technical assistance and advisory services, which have also benefited
    directly preparation o f this operation. Below i s a brief description o f AAA activities and
    their immediate relationship to the preparation o f the DPL4 and the overall reform
    program.

    Country Economic MemorandumUpdate on Competitiveness

    98.     The C E M Update on Competitiveness i s under preparation and it addresses the
    issue o f competitiveness in the second generation reform environment o f Mauritius. It
    focuses on two themes: trade policy and labor markets. Findings related to the trade
    policy part have been shared with the government already. Strong interest from the
    authorities nurtured a productive policy dialogue between the WB and the Ministry o f
    Foreign Affairs (International Trade Division), who i s moving quickly to implement one
    o f the key policy recommendations presented (which i s also featured as proposed prior

including duplication o f requirements; and (v) encourage and assist the r o l l out o f IT
solutions for trade.facilitation across ministries and agencies. Findings related to the labor
market part o f the E S W have been used in this Program Document as well to provide a
stock taking o f the Government reform program.

WB Treasury Advisory Mission

99.     At the request o f the Government, a WB Advisory Services mission from the
Treasury department visited Mauritius in June 2009. The focus o f the mission was on
Public Debt Management and it involved a combination o f diagnostic work, training
sessions and joint production of an action plan to improve Public Debt Management in
Mauritius. From the perspective o f the DPL4 operation, this mission was very
informative to firm up assessment o f the overall macroeconomic policy framework. WB
staff felt reassured by the open dialogue with the Central Bank and MOFEE. Policy
recommendations built in the action plan (Table 8) were not directly used as prior actions
in DPU, but the Treasury team continues to provide support to the Mauritian authorities.

Investment Climate Assessment

100. A new investment climate assessment i s under preparation. Preliminary findings
have been discussed with the Government in April o f 2009 and informed budget
preparation. The work notes reduction in unit labor costs (manufacturing) since 2005 and
identified an interesting shift in constraints reported as main obstacles by firms.
Regulatory environment (licensing, labor regulation, tax policy) became less o f problem
overtime whereas infrastructure issues (transport, electricity) became more binding.
Finance and lack o f skilled labor remain as top constraints. Immediately before the
beginning o f the reform program supported by the DPL series in 2006, an ICA was also
carried out. Preliminary findings were also discussed with the Government in July 2005,
after which an Investment Climate Committee was established, chaired by the Prime
Minister.

Aid for Trade Report: From Preferencesto Global Competitiveness

101. The Aid for Trade has been a very influential piece o f analytical work for the
preparation o f t h i s DPL series. At the Government's request, an "Aid for Trade" mission
visited Mauritius in early 2006 to assess the country's trade competitiveness, facilitate the
adjustment from protection to global competitiveness and link to the international
community's AFT initiative. The project was demand driven and quickly built up an
excellent and highly influential dialogue at both the technical and policy levels. I t s work
underpinned many o f the ideas and even some o f the language o f the reform program
with regard to improving incentives, simplifying the regulatory environment and
providing transitional support to workers and firms.23The report proposed measures to
strengthen competitiveness; move resources out o f declining and into dynamically
growing sectors; improve the quality and cost o f input services such as

 I t bears repeating that this was not a matter of pushing the Bank's agenda, but rather supporting the
23
Government as it moved in its chosen direction.

telecommunications, air transport, and cargo handling; and strengthen transitional support
for displaced workers. Findings were presented to the MOFEE in mid-April and
subsequently disseminated more widely across the Government. A final report was
           n
submitted i M a y 2006, prior to the 2006/07 budget.

102. Other analytical work discussed in previous Program Documents o f the DPL
series that helped to shape the WB policy lending in M.auritius were the 2006 CEM,
unemployment study, and work on a medium term expenditure framework and program
based budgeting (mix o f TA and ESW).

                                                  DESCRIPTION

103. The DPL series has been structured around key elements o f the Government's
strategy, in particular reflecting areas where Development Partners were already engaged
and/or the Government saw particular benefits to intensifying the dialogue. All four
pillars were intentionally incorporated into the design o f the operation to underscore the
breadth o f the reform program.

104. DPL4 i s the last operation o f the current series, which has played a central role in
supporting the reforms and coordinating the Development Partners. The Government has
in fact requested the operation to be rolled over into a new series, and demonstrated
appreciation for the policy dialogue developed over the last years. The full DPL program
matrix i s presented in Annex 1. The proposed prior actions firmed up after the June 2009
preparation mission, along with the indicative trigger as presented in the DPL3 Program
Document are included in Table 14 below.

                            Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
In July 2005, Mauritians elected a new Government o n a strong reformist platform to revitalize the
economy, restore the public finances and broaden opportunity. The Government took office with a clear
strategy for reform, much o f which has subsequently been implemented in the 2006/07,2007/08,2008/09
and 2009 budgets. While working out the details o f its program, the Government turned to the WB for
support which was provided in the form o f targeted, high impact TA and ESW linked to preparation o f the
DPL. The partnership which developed represents a best practice example o f how to provide external
support for strong, locally-owned and championed reforms.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and otherfinancialpartners on a coordinated
accountabilityframework.
The E C and World Bank collaborated closely o n the preparation o f the EC's Country Strategy Paper and
the World Bank's Country Partnership Strategy in 2006. A t the same time, the Government was refining i t s
strategy in conjunction with preparation o f the DPL. As a result, all these efforts feature common
objectives and diagnostics. Subsequently, the EC, AFJ3, AfDB and World Bank participated injoint
preparation and appraisal missions for DPL1-4 and, to the extent possible, all Development Partners have
adopted common triggers and indicators for their parallel operations. The DPL has been highly effective in
coordinating and harmonizing development assistance in the areas i t covers. Preparation o f DPL4 has also
informed a new programmatic series o f budget support operations being developed b y the AfDB.

Principle 3: Customize the accountabilityframework and modalities o WB support to country
                                                                   f
circumstances.
The DPL has focused on issues o f strategic importance, but also o n those where the Government saw a
particular benefit to availing the resources o f the Development Partners, for instance in order to overcome
resistance or surmount capacity limitations. The DPL has helped to maintain consistency in the dialogue - a
counterweight to the continual need to fight fires - and encouraged policymakers to stay focused o n the
core reform agenda. AAA activities, particularly ESW and TA, have fed directly into a specialized policy
dialogue as the DPL series progressed.

Principle 4: Choose only actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursements.
The Government's reform program i s structured around four main pillars, all o f which have been supported
b y the DPL. DPLl featured a relatively large set o f prior actions, consciously intended to signal to investors
the breadth o f the program. DPL2 and DPL3 narrowed the focus to a smaller number o f prior actions.
DPL4 benefited from on-going AAA activities and also supported timely, targeted and temporary measures
taken b y the Government to counter the effect o f the global economic crisis.

 Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support.
 The annual budget has traditionally been the vehicle for announcing major economic,policy reforms in
Mauritius. Thus the programmatic DPL series has easily been aligned to the budget cycle, drawing prior
actions from budget measures and providing financing for successive fiscal years.

                                       B. POLICY

A. Consolidating Fiscal Performance and Improving Public Sector Efficiency

DPL4 prior action: Preparation of at least four line ministries strategies for the
Borrower's Fiscal Year 2010 budget in line with program-based budget reauirements.

105. Description: For Pillar A, the DPL has focused on the twin components o f (i)
tightening fiscal discipline; and (ii)    improving efficiency and effectiveness. The
Government's strategy o n the latter has been built around adoption o f a MTEF and PBB,
which together aim to increase predictability o f resource envelopes for planning
purposes, clarify tradeoffs, and actively engage senior policy makers to align budgetary
allocations with national priorities. Under DPL2, a MTEFPBB budget was prepared in
2007/08. Though highly effective in building interest and awareness, the exercise was
"indicative" only insofar as the traditional line item budget remained the official basis o f
financial management and reporting. Initially, DPL2 proposed as an indicative trigger for
DPL3 preparation o f sector strategies for the 2008/09 budget. The logic o f this choice i s
that effective budgeting demands a clear vision o f sector objectives and a menu of
strategically relevant, costed programs f r o m which policymakers can choose as they
make tradeoffs within and across sectors. The Government provided a l i s t o f priority
sectors which the Development Partners divided up and supported in various ways,
including funding and helping to prepare TORSfor consultancies, peer reviewing outputs
and facilitating the work o f Sector Ministry Support Team as they linked sector strategies
to PBB budget submission^.^^ The DPL was instrumental in orchestrating the response
and helping to overcome capacity constraints, and considerable progress was achieved as
a result. In the end the task proved too large to be achieved in time for the DPL3
operation and the trigger has been slipped to DPL4.

106. DPL3 then focused o n an equally important and related policy action: revising the
Chart of Accounts and Financial Management Information Systems. Indeed, moving
beyond 2007/08's "indicative" MTEFPBB entailed revising the Chart o f Accounts
(COA) in the Treasury Accounting System (TAS) to compile financial data according to
the programs, objectives and outcomes o f the PBB. The new system was developed in
time for the start o f the 2008/09 financial year and i s now being used as the basis for
processing and recording transactions and preparing annual financial statements and other
reports. The changeover also allowed the new system to be updated to the 2001 revision
o f the IMF's Government Financial Statistics Manual enabling more comprehensive and
flexible financial management information and reporting. New software also allows for
the recording o f non-financial data (ie., PBB outcomes and indicators) to strengthen
further the monitoring o f budget effectiveness - see DPL3 PD for a deeper discussion o n
the issue.




24 The Bank has provided support to education, ICT, housing and lands, tourism and external
communications, mainly under the Sector Strategic Planning TA Project (P107215); the E C has supported
tourism and education; AFD environment and industry; UNDP ICT and social security; AfDB health.


                                                  43
107. With an operational PBB and a new Chart o f Accounts and Financial
Management Information System, the DPL4 returns to the preparation o f sector strategies
as a key step to improve public sector efficiency and overall fiscal performance. This
proposed prior action for DPLA puts line ministries at the forefront o f this process.
Preparation o f strategic plans compliant with PBB format offers a platform for dialogue
between MoFEE and line ministries. It creates opportunities for promoting expenditure
efficiency and effectiveness by systematically linking funding to results. I t must be said,
however, that t h i s process takes time to bear the intended fruits. Even among the line
ministries that are more advanced in this task, there i s s t i l l scope for improving
communications and reliance on the PBB exercise as an efficient tool for allocating
public resources. The government continues commitment to press ahead with reforms in
this area and the UNDP and IMF have been providing assistance.

108. Finally, as indicated in table 14, an indicative DPL4 trigger which has not become
a prior action in t h i s operation i s "Reduce debt-to-GDP ratio in line with Public Debt
Management A c t ceilings". Public debt was reduced from nearly 70 percent o f GDP in
2006 to 53.7 percent in 2008 as the government made progress on fiscal consolidation.
However, in the context o f world economic crisis, lower fiscal revenues arising from
subdued growth and the need for counter-cyclical spending interrupted the good
momentum. Public debt i s expected to increase in 2009 and could reach the ceiling
mandated by l a w (60 percent o f GDP) - which was a DPL3 prior action - over the
coming years. Nonetheless, debt sustainability analysis indicates that the public debt i s
sustainable. Fiscal policy response to the crisis remains timely, targeted and temporary.
High quality fiscal policy i s discussed in Section 2 and they include measures designed to
improve capital execution rates, containment o f recurrent expenditures and prudent debt
build up.

109. Expected results: Improve ability to control primary spending and debt public
while maintaining quality o f public sector service delivery.

                            B. Improving Trade Competitiveness

DPL4 prior action: Revision of the legal and regulatorv framework of the Information
and Communications Technology (ICT) sector in line with the international best
practices and changes resulting from technological convergence for modern competitive
ICT markets, as shall be evidenced by: ( i ) reduction of the prices of international private
leased circuits from Mauritius to Paris: ( i i ) preparation and approval by the Board of
ICTA of draft proposals for amendment to the Information and Communication and
Technologies Act; and ( i i i ) appointment of the Data Protection Commissioner pursuant
to the Data Protection Act.

110. Description: The strategy o f becoming an open, globally connected, l o w tax,
business friendly platform entails eliminating anti-export biased policy distortions. In this
context, tariff reduction has been a prominent area o f reform in Mauritius where bold
progress has been achieved (Table 15). The 2006/07 budget committed Mauritius to
becoming a "duty free island" by eliminating tariffs substantially (95 percent o f tariff



                                             44
lines) on a phased basis over three years. Reflecting the importance o f t h i s objective, all
three years o f tariff reductions were included either as prior actions or triggers in DPLs
1-3. For DPL4, due to the added economic hardship domestic producers are facing in the
context o f the world economic crisis, the trade competitiveness pillar does not focus on
further tariff reductions. Instead it reverts to an earlier theme o f ICT and
telecommunications, equally relevant for trade competitiveness in Mauritius, particularly
in services.

                             Table 15: Evolution of Tariff Structure




111. International connectivity i s critical for a small, remote economy, especially one
seeking to exploit communications-intensive activities such as call centers, BPO and
financial services. In fact, DPLl and DPL2 focused on reducing the cost o f international
connectivity and increasing capacity, and DPL2 also called for a review o f
telecommunications regulation.

112. Despite the good performance o f the I C T sector in Mauritius, relative to other
countries in the region, significant improvements will be required if the country i s to
meet the targets laid out in the sector Strategic Plan - particularly to allow I C T to develop
into a significant source o f economic growth and employment. Two key areas can be
named: (i)                                                 i)
            reform o f the telecoms sector itself; and ( iimprovement o f the regulatory
environment for ICT-based services.

113. International Private Leased Circuits (PLCs) are a key input for 'any ICT-enabled
business. They are the high bandwidth l i n k s that connect these businesses to customers in
other countries. The price and availability of IPLCs significantly affects the
competitiveness o f the IT-enabled industry. Recognizing the high cost o f IPLCs in



                                               45
Mauritius, the government has taken regulatory action to reduce the prices. They have
fallen by 50 percent between 2003 and 2008. The government is also proposing
amendments to the Information and Communication Technologies Act (2001) to bring
the overall licensing and regulation into line with international standards. The key
proposed changes are the following: (i)    Introduce competition regulation principles into
                                        i)
the sector regulatory framework; ( i Revise the structure o f licenses to increase
flexibility for operators and bring the framework into line with international norms; and
  i i Revise the system o f tariff regulation to allow more flexibility in competitive
(i)
markets.

114. These draft amendments will be approved by the Board o f ICTA, reviewed by the
State L a w Office (SLO) - which i s responsible for ensuring that the legal drafting i s
correct - and then subject to public consultation. After that, submission to cabinet will
take place.

        f
Reform o the legal and regulatory framework that governs ICT services

115. As I C T networks become more widespread, more services are provided
electronically. For this to take place, the legal framework governing e-commerce,
e-legislation and online activity requires revision. One key piece o f legislation governs
data protection. Parliament passed the Data Protection A c t in 2004 but i t was not fully
brought into force and the Data Protection Office was not established. This was finally
done in 2009. The commissioner has been appointed and a set o f amendments were made
to the Act to bring it into line with the EU data protection framework. Mauritius i s
currently in the process o f applying to the EU for Data Protection accreditation. Once
approved, this would allow EU countries to export data to Mauritius, permitting business
process outsourcing f i r m s in Mauritius to provide services to companies in Europe.

116. Expected results: Increase exports as a percentage o f GDP, particularly service
exports. Increased investment in BPO sector.

DPL4 prior action: Establishment of a joint Public-Private Sector Standing Committee
to review the design and implementation of regulatory measures relative to import and
export licenses with a view to eliminate unwarranted barriers to trade.

117. Description: As countries progress along the path o f development they typically
move from high to l o w tariff policies. At the same time the quality o f trade regulations
and their implementation come to play an increasingly important role in determining
economic efficiency, investment and growth. As a matter o f fact, high tariffs may hide
inappropriate regulations and weak capacity towards implementation. If these are not
dealt with, trade tariff reduction may not deliver the full impact. I t i s important to ensure
discipline in the use o f rules and trade regulations to prevent non-tariff barriers from
creating both unfair competition and protectionism. Hence, it i s necessary for countries to
put in place procedures ensuring that regulations are designed and implemented in a way
that is consistent with: (i)   public policy objectives (health, safety and the environment);
       i)
and ( idevelopment o f the economy as an efficient global competitor. Looking beyond
tariffs i s a critical continuation o f the trade competitiveness agenda in Mauritius.

118. Mauritius s t i l l has a long way to go before becoming a dynamic competitive
exporter such as Hong Kong or Singapore. The tariff reforms accomplished over that last
years under the duty-free island policy represented important steps in that direction, but
to effectively compete in international markets the country should ultimately move
towards a "barrier free island". A World Bank ESW under preparation ( C E M Update on
Competitiveness) identified a number o f inappropriate non-tariff trade-related regulations
and implementation bottlenecks which compromise competitiveness in Mauritius (Box
4). Preliminary findings along with policy recommendations were presented to the
authorities in February o f 2009. Strong Government interest on the subject nurtured a
productive policy dialogue between the WB and the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs
(International Trade Division), who i s moving quickly to implement one o f the key policy
recommendations presented earlier this year: set-up o f a permanent regulatory review
committee with responsibility to: (i)   define the general principles o f regulatory reform
based on international best practice and to ensure that these are applied consistently
across line ministries and departments; (ii)     review all new and important existing
               i i oversee the introduction o f regulatory impact analysis as a key tool
regulations; ( i )
across the government; (iv) facilitate the intra-ministry coordination that i s essential to
address a wide range o f the regulatory constraints, including duplication o f requirements;
and (v) encourage and assist the roll out o f IT solutions for trade facilitation across
ministries and agencies.

                                    Box 3: Diagnostics CEM Update

Lack o systematic approach to assessment of regulations and their implementation. There i s no clear
      f
procedure b y which actual and proposed regulations are examined and analyzed i terms of: (i)
                                                                                    n              whether
design i s consistent with the underlying public policy objective; (ii)    whether design consistent with
capacity in government ministries and agencies and in the private sector to effectively implement; and (iii)
n
i terms o f impacts o n competitiveness, growth, employment and poverty.

Lack of transparency in design and application of regulations. Regulations are not designed o n the basis o f
consultation with interested stakeholders, even with different parts o f the government.

Resources are poorly utilized due to lack o risk-based approach in many parts of the government. W i t h the
                                             f
exception o f customs, most government ministries and agencies take a very rigid approach to the
implementation o f regulations and do not apply risk-based approaches that target resources, such as those
for inspection, at the most risky transactions.

No recourse to dispute procedures. Individuals and fims have no formal mechanism by which to challenge
the decisions o f civil servants as they implement regulations. In practice, large fims and well connected
individuals are able to exert influence and obtain a review o f decisions that they deem to be incorrect or
inappropriate. I t i s small and new fims and ordinary individuals who are unable to dispute decisions.

Duplication o requirements across government ministries and agencies. In many cases different parts o f
             f
the government are making similar requirements, such as permits or licences or the testing o f products, to
achieve the same objective.

Lack o coordination and cooperation across ministries and agencies. While different elements o f the
       f
government have responsibility for achieving the same public policy objective, the efficiency with which
this objective i s achieved i s often undermined b y lack o f coordination and cooperation.




                                                     47
Lack of competitivenessperspective in many ministries and agencies. The culmination o f the weaknesses
discussed above i s that in designing and implementing regulations few ministries or agencies consider the
impact o f their actions o n the competitiveness o f the country. An approach, similar to that o f trade
facilitation in Customs, should spread throughout the government leading to a move from a rigid, non-
contestable mindset in which Ministries and agencies seek to shelter their requirements and approaches, to
one in which civil servants are continually exploring ways in which to better design and implement
regulations through openness and cooperation.



119. There i s on-going policy dialogue between the WB and the International Trade
Division at the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs o n the topic above. The WB i s exploiting
modalities in which further assistance to Mauritius can be provided in the context o f this
proposed prior action. In particular, the proposed public and private sector standing
committee will need capacity building assistance to perform i t s tasks. In that regard, a
specific request that the WB has received from the authorities relates to assistance for
putting in place a mechanism for regulatory impact assessment o f new and existing
importlexport licenses and regulations.

120. Expected results: Reduce, rationalize and streamline licensing requirements for
export and import. Increase exports.

                                 C. Improving the Investment Climate

DPL4 prior action: Enactment of the insolvency legislation (Insolvency Act No 3 of
2009).

                     n
121. Description: I March 2004, the World Bank submitted the "Report on the
Observance o f Standards and Codes" (ROSC) o f Insolvency and Creditor Rights Systems
for Mauritius" after a wide consultative process with relevant stakeholders. A Steering
Committee on Insolvency and creditor rights was then appointed to incorporate policy
recommendations into legislation. Since then there has been close collaboration with the
WB and other stakeholders towards the preparation o f a new insolvency bill for
Mauritius.

122. The statutory insolvency framework in Mauritius was scattered, based on various
pieces o f legislations which left serious gaps. The process for corporate insolvencies -
closure, receivership and liquidation o f companies - was dealt with in the Companies A c t
1984. Individual insolvencies were dealt with in two separate statutes, namely the
Bankruptcy Ordinance o f 1888 and the Insolvency Act 1982. The latter was essentially
the Insolvency Ordinance o f 1856, which dealt with the insolvency o f individual non-
traders while the Bankruptcy Ordinance o f 1888 dealt with the insolvency o f individual
traders. The Code C i v i l Mauricien and other laws, including the outmoded law for trader
(1888), also complemented this complicated legal framework. The proposed new
insolvency bill consolidates, updates apd integrates the current fragmented framework in
one modern legislation.

123. Regarding substance, a major weakness o f the legal framework related to i t s bias
                     n
towards liquidation. I many circumstances, companies were placed into liquidation


                                                    48
when alternative resolutions could be possible or even less costly. The new insolvency
bill corrects t h i s bias. It allows for procedures that permit quick and easy access to the
process o f rehabilitation, providing sufficient protection for all those involved. It also
offers a structure that permits the negotiation o f a commercial plan, enabling the majority
o f creditors in favour o f the plan or other course o f action to bind all other creditors by
the democratic exercise o f voting rights. Finally, i t provides for judicial supervision to
ensure that the process i s not subjected to manipulation or abuse. The two new
alternatives to liquidation are out-of-court debt restructurings (workouts) or temporary
relinquishment o f power by the f i r m ' s directors (voluntary administration). Liquidation
will then take place as a last resort only.

124. The bill also improves on the treatment o f employee rights. Liquidation o f a
company under the existing legal framework produces little or no return to the unsecured
creditors and a comparatively l o w return even to non-WB secured creditors. The
proposed bill reviews the process in order to give greater protection to employees while
at the same time protecting the priority o f secured creditors. The bill redefines the priority
o f claims in the distribution o f assets in liquidation and gives workers' unpaid salary
higher priority than the secured creditors. The new order o f ranking o f creditor claims
also affects the Government, who now is limited in i t s claims against a company in
liquidation. This new order was proposed after a survey o f practices adopted across
countries and takes into consideration suggestions received during the consultation
process. As a result, all stakeholders are benefited (shareholders, creditors, employees,
the State) with a fair share in the distribution o f realized assets at each stage o f the
process.

 125. The bill also addresses the issue o f cross border insolvency (cases in which assets
and/or creditors are held in more than one jurisdiction). The growing importance o f the
global business sector makes this aspect o f the law particularly relevant. The proposed
bill provides for Mauritius to adopt the United Nations Commission on International L a w
model law on cross-border insolvency which has been adopted by a number of
jurisdictions. Implementation o f UNCITRAL, however, will only take place when there
 i s sufficient reciprocity in dealing with insolvencies in jurisdictions that have been
trading with Mauritius. Finally, in what regards to individual insolvency, the proposed
bill consolidates fragmented pieces o f legislation and clarifies rules for a bankrupt to
 apply for discharge.

126. Altogether, the proposed bill represents a fundamental change in the legal
framework governing corporate and individual insolvency in Mauritius with major
positive implications to the quality o f the business environment. Another important
policy measure that complements t h i s prior action and contribute to the overall
investment climate i s the establishment o f a specialized commercial division o f the
supreme court o f Mauritius with jurisdictions to deal with all matters o f bankruptcy,
insolvency and other commercial matters.

127.   Expected Results: Increase investment in emerging sectors and S M E registrations.

DPL4 prior action: Appointment of the commissioners to the Competition Commission
of Mauritius.

128. Description: Mauritius economic development i s not a direct consequence o f trade
preferences. These were powerful enablers o f success, but government policies also
played an important role. In particular, they achieved a working compromise between
incentives in the EPZ sector and the level o f protection in the domestic sector economy.
Aggregate income and investment growth led by the former allowed the latter to function
as a social buffer that employed workers and created more opportunities to local
entrepreneurs. Though successful, the model negatively impacted the level o f efficiency
in the domestic sector economy by insulating individual f i r m s from foreign competition.
Additionally, it favored development o f domestic market structures with concentrated
market power.

129. As Mauritius i s forced to adapt i t s economic development model in response to
the phasing out of trade preferences, the role o f the domestic sector economy must be
adjusted as well. The country can no longer afford to grow on the basis o f selected
leading sectors while vast portions o f the domestic economy remain uncompetitive. This
i s well understood by the Government, forming the core purpose o f the wide-ranging
tariff reductions and other policy measures adopted to open the economy at a gradual but
determined pace. There is, however, another very important dimension relating to the
domestic economy that needs to be targeted. As in any developed country, but in
Mauritius perhaps even more because o f i t s dual EPZDomestic-economy history, it i s
crucial to set up mechanisms that prevent anti-competitive behavior by domestic
business.

130. This will be accomplished in Mauritius through the creation o f a Competition
Commission (CC). The C C i s a statutory body established in 2009 to enforce the
competition Act 2007. This A c t established a competition regime in Mauritius, under
which the CC can investigate possible anticompetitive behavior by businesses. . [this
sentence i s a little vague - the following sentence addresses the issue anyway?] If it
decides that a business's conduct i s anticompetitive, the CC has powers to intervene and
correct the situation through fines and/or other punitive measures.

131. Although a parastatal under the aegis o f the Ministry o f Business, Enterprise and
Co-operatives, the CC i s independent o f Government in i t s decision-making. The
Executive Director (ED) o f the Commission, supported by his staff, decides
independently what to investigate and carries out the investigation. The ED heads the
staff o f the CC and i s responsible for day-to-day management o f the institution, reporting
to the Board o f the Commission. In addition, the ED has specific powers under the
Competition A c t to initiate and carry out investigations, to report the results o f that
investigation to the Commissioners for a decision, to publish the results o f that decision
with reasons, and to implement and enforce the decision.



                                             50
132. The first Executive Director o f the CC has been appointed in January 2009. The
Mauritian authorities selected a candidate with proven technical background and
experience o n the area, who has been working since 2003 with the UK CC (first as
Deputy Chief Economist, then as Chief Economist). The next critical step, proposed as a
prior action above, i s to appoint the Board o f the Commission (Chairman, Vice-
Chairman, and Commissioners) responsible for judging the cases put forth by i t s
Executive Director. According to the Competition Act, the Board i s to be appointed by
the President o f the Republic and should be selected "from the public sector, private
sector and academia, appointed by virtue o f their qualifications and experience in law,
economics, accountancy, or commerce."

DPL4 prior action: Imvlementation of a targeted and temporary policv action in the
form of a work and training scheme bv the National Empowerment Foundation to
mitigate the risks of widesvread layoffs in the context of the economic slowdown.

134. Description: The global economic slowdown initiated in September o f 2008
affected external demand for goods and services in key sectors o f the Mauritian economy.
Tourism and manufacturing (textiles) exports are two leading examples. Despite only
mild negative impact so far, the direct effect on employment i s potentially large given the
employment shares o f these sectors in the economy (6 and 23 percent, respectively) and
their dependence o n external demand. In this context, the government has exploited
targeted and temporary policy actions to reduce the likelihood o f massive layoffs. These
efforts have been announced in December 2008 (Additional Stimulus Package) and M a y
2009 (last budget). They act o n top o f the various government programs already in place
to accommodate the social costs o f the economic transformation in Mauritius.

135. The work and training scheme i s an example o f such timely, targeted and
temporary policy action in the context o f the economic slowdown to mitigate the risks o f
widespread layoffs. The focus o f the program i s on j o b preservation in the manufacturing
and tourism sectors. It provides enterprises in difficulties in these two sectors with an
alternative to laying o f f their shop floor/rank and file workers. The selected companies
will have the possibility o f providing, in lieu o f work, training on one day or at most two
days a week to these workers to upgrade their skills. The workers concerned will
continue to be paid their salary and other standing benefits by their employer for the full
week, while the employer will be refunded by the equivalent o f the basic salary paid to
the workers for the days o n which they were on training. The cost o f training - up to an
agreed ceiling - will be met by the government as well. Interested companies will submit
application to the scheme which w i l l be reviewed by a Committee comprising
representatives o f relevant Ministries and Government institutions and the private sector.
The scheme will cease to exist in December o f 2010.



                                             51
136. The importance o f this particular prior action in the context o f the long-run reform
program supported by the DPL series resides o n the need for just-in-time policy measures
to cushion the potentially acute short-run impact of the world economic crisis. This can
be cast in terms o f political sustainability o f a government's agenda. Throughout the
world, policies geared towards employment preservation have indeed become a political
necessity. Nonetheless, containing massive employment losses triggered by a severe
temporary exogenous shock makes sense from a purely economic perspective as well -
even at a microeconomic level as f i r m s would need to go through time-consuming and
costly scaling up o f i t s labor force after the crisis i s over.

137. Putting in place job preservation policies in the current context i s not a simple
task. First, there i s an issue o f financing requirements. It i s important to be clear upfront
what i s the fiscal envelope available for the scheme and to have an estimate o f what it
implies in terms o f potential jobs saved. In the case o f the work and training scheme, the
budget allocation i s estimated at US$10 million (less than 0.1 percent o f GDP) which i s
expected to save 6,000 jobs (a bit more than 1 percent o f total employment) directly. A
second complication arising from the implementation o f j o b preservation schemes relates
to informational distortions. Adverse selection and moral hazard issues can arise from
this type o f government intervention. While t h i s concern must be acknowledged, given
the severity o f the circumstances, the proposed prior action seems a reasonable tool (in
combination with others) to mitigate risks o f layoffs. The scheme i s targeted (tourism and
manufacturing) and temporary (valid until December o f 20 10). Additionally, the training
element provides a chance to increase future productivity precisely at a time when the
opportunity cost o f not having the worker fully utilized i s low.

138. Expected results: Reduce layoffs in sectors mostly affected by the world
economic crisis.

DPL4 prior action: Production of a final poverty map by the Central Statistic Office of
Mauritius (CSO) combining the Borrower's FY 2001/02 Household Budget Survey and
2000 Population Census data with the objective of improving the capacitV for
geographical targeting.

139. Description: Mauritius i s classified among the high human development countries
and i t has displayed very good progress in achieving the MDG targets. Although
prevalence o f absolute poverty i s l o w (less than 1 percent o f the population living with
less than a US$1 per day), the June 2008 budget witnessed renewed government efforts
to eradicate absolute poverty. A dedicated program (EAP) with emphasis o n education
for children and o n life skills for their parents was created. The EAP targets 229 pockets
o f absolute poverty which were preliminary identified on the basis o f personal visits to
poor regions o f the country - including the island o f Rodrigues. In parallel to these
actions, government has also pursued the strengthening o f technical capacity to measure
and monitor poverty evolution. This i s key for improving policy formulation and
effective implementation o f measures in the social sector, T o this end, capacity building
initiatives that the Government o f Mauritius has developed with the support o f the
Development Partners combine technical work done at the Central Statistics Office with



                                              52
engagement o f the relevant line ministries/departments that will eventually make policy
use o f the information produced.

140.      In t h i s context, a range o f activities are being developed in poverty measurement
and monitoring. The UNDP has provided support for the construction o f a Social
Registry containing information on beneficiaries o f social programs in Mauritius. It has
also carried out work to calculate poverty lines based on different criteria (nutritional,
relative, absolute). The E C has supported the setting up o f a poverty observatory in
Mauritius to monitor the effectiveness o f poverty alleviation policies and to produce high
frequency information for policy makers through the use o f qualitative methodologies.
The WB has been providing advice towards rationalization o f social programs in the
context o f budget preparation. The goal i s to identify shodmedium-run actions that could
generate efficiency and financial gains.

141. The proposed prior action above relates to a n additional activity that the WB has
been providing to Mauritius: building capacity at the CSO for production o f poverty
maps. Poverty i s typically identified from household expenditure survey data, which are
usually sample surveys representative at highly aggregated levels over large areas.
Therefore, t h i s type o f survey does not provide precise estimates o f poverty for smaller
areas. Census data, on the other hand, cover almost the entire population and do allow for
fine geographic disaggregation. However, censuses are not carried out frequently and
they only collect information on a limited set o f indicators. Poverty mapping combine
census and household data to allow for yearly monitoring o f poverty using fairly
disaggregated criteria (geographical being one o f them). The technique was first used in
the late 1990's and by now has been applied to more than 40 countries. The WB has been
a leader in supervising implementation and developing software for the exercise.

142. A poverty mapping capacity development mission from the WB visited Mauritius
in M a y 2009. The goal was to familiarize the CSO staff with the techniques, and oversee
the production o f a preliminary poverty map for the country using the household budget
survey from 2001/02 and the 2000 Census. The mission focused o n methodological
requirements o f the exercise such as (i)     establishing comparability o f data sources
(common variables); ( i estimation o f consumption models using the survey data; and
                        i)
(iii)s subsequent use with census data to predict consumption, estimate poverty and
     it
inequality. Pros and cons o f the exercise were discussed, and the training provided aimed
at enabling Mauritius to independently carry out future analysis - particular in light of the
2010 Census planned for next year.

143.     Expected results: Improve institutional capacity and develop necessary tools to
monitor poverty

                            A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL I M P A C T

144. No proposed prior action in DPLA i s expected to produce specific negative
poverty and social consequences o n poor or vulnerable people. More broadly, however,
the DPL series supports the overall government reform program whose objective i s to
promote a fundamental transformation in Mauritius towards a high value-added services
economy. In the process o f adapting to a world without trade preferences,
competitiveness reforms will naturally lead to increased labor reallocation in the
economy. This impacts disproportionally more old workers with l o w educational
attainment and narrow professional experience. Within t h i s group, women are
particularly at risk given high levels o f engagement in the textile sector. It must be noted,
however, that cumulative net j o b losses in apparel and sugar industry between 2001 and
2006 (sectors facing the trade preference shocks) reached around 9 percent of total
employment. So, already before reforms started, job reallocation pressure was strong,
reflecting a feature o f the new world economic landscape that Mauritius needs to deal
with. Inability to adapt to it means that ``. ..those who will suffer most are the very people
we want to protect: the poor, the vulnerable, the ~ n e m p l o y e d . " ~ ~

145. The reversal o f both growth slowdown and increasing unemployment between
2005 and 2008 provide early evidence o f a positive overall social impact o f the reform
program. Most significant has been the decline in female unemployment rate in the last 3
years (Figure 9), explained by strong job creation in the services sector. Unemployment
rate among males has also been declining between 2005 and 2008. For 2009, the world
economic crisis i s expected to cause a mild deterioration o f labor market outcomes,
though there are risks of a more severe retrenchment. CSO projects unemployment rate at
8 percent for 2009.

146. Detailed micro data on consumption and income i s necessary for a thorough
poverty impact analysis. The last two household budget surveys featuring such
information were published in 2000/2001 and 2006/2007. Hence, at t h i s stage, it i s not
possible to provide a complete assessment o f how the reform program has impacted
poverty in the country. The Government o f Mauritius i s currently receiving technical
assistance from Development Partners to develop techniques and capacity for monitoring
poverty evolution (calculation o f poverty lines, poverty mapping, qualitative monitoring
o f poverty),. but they do not provide a basis for comparing household-level outcomes
before and after the reforms either. In order to do so, the analysis presented below relies
on micro data from the Continuous Multi-Purpose Household Surveys (CMPHS). This i s
an annual household survey more suited for production o f labor market statistics, but that
can be informative in the current circumstances o f limited data availability. Findings
must be interpreted with caution due to methodological changes in the survey over time

147. Appendix 1 presents changes in the employment structure o f Mauritius broken
down by gender, education, occupation and sector. The last three years have witnessed
clear reduction in the female unemployment rate, but movements in female participation
rate have remained limited. Among the employed females, those with primary education
represent a smaller proportion today than in the past, while percentage o f females with
post-secondary education has increased. The proportion o f women working in textiles has
decreased steadily from 31.2 percent in 2001 to 20 percent in 2007. The bulk o f t h i s
reduction took place before the reform program as women went into different sectors o f
the economy, but mostly into Wholesale and Retail. After 2005, and during the reform
years, Financial Intermediation and Hotels & Restaurants also played an important role in
employment absorption. Reduction o f overall female unemployment rate was generated
by new entrants finding jobs in the services sector. However, displaced women from the
transforming textile sector could not be all absorbed elsewhere and retirement from labor
force also contributed to a mechanical reduction o f the unemployment rate. There i s a
stock o f female workers that cannot benefit directly from job creation. Employability i s
an issue for these women who are left in a precarious situation when faced with a j o b
loss. Among the men, one can observe a gradual decline both in participation and
unemployment rates also starting before the reform program. Changes in employment
structure are much less pronounced than for women, but it i s possible to see the increased
role o f the construction sector for male employment in 2007. This i s likely to be directly
linked to foreign direct investment, very strong during the reform years.


26From 2001 to 2003, around 6,500 households were covered each year. In 2004, the sample was increased
to 8,640. As from 2005, the sample for each year has been further increased to 11,280.


                                                          55
148. Appendix 2 presents the distribution o f average real hourly earnings from 2001 to
2007. Real earnings at the bottom o f the income distribution (first deciles) have remained
broadly constant throughout the period, and gender wage gaps have not changed either.
Towards the top o f the income distribution it i s possible to observe (both males and
females) a gradual increase in real earnings from 2001 until 2005. From 2005 onwards,
there has been a reduction for top earners. At face value, t h i s might look like a negative
impact o f the reform program. However, it i s important to interpret this evidence in light
o f the increasing unemployment that occurred before 2006 and i t s subsequent decrease
during the reform years. In fact, unemployment rate reached a peak in 2005 and, with less
low earners employed, upper deciles o f the wage distribution would be higher by
construction. Once j o b creation started to pick up again in 2006 and 2007, newly
employed workers moved the upper deciles back to their original levels. Containment o f
real earnings growth in Mauritius, particularly after trade preferences were no longer in
place, i s crucial for overall competitiveness.

149. The empirical evidence described above endorses the course o f action adopted by
the Government since the beginning o f the Reform program. Indeed, under pillar D o f the
DPL series, the authorities have pursued a number o f policy actions to assure that
opportunities would reach as many Mauritians as possible while fundamental economic
changes would take place. Measures can be divided into two broad groups: (i)  immediate
assistance; and ( i preparation o f a competitive labor force through new educational
                   i)
policies. Regarding the former, the Government has pursued a number o f social programs
to support adjustment o f workers and SMEs. A major initiative to facilitate the
adjustment process was the establishment o f the Empowerment Program in July o f 2006
(DPL 1 trigger) with a budget o f Rs.5 billion over five years (around 0.4 percent o f
GDP). Objectives o f the program include: (i)     providing placement, training and re-
skilling for the unemployed; (ii) supporting entrepreneurship and S M E competitiveness
through financial and technical assistance; ( i )advancing social housing and
                                                    ii
development amongst poor families; and (iv) support older unemployed women.

150. The Government has scaled up the operations o f the Empowerment Program
which i s now called the National Empowerment Foundation (NEF). The NEF has a board
o f directors involving the private sector and civil society who defines strategies and
budgets for the programs. Implementation i s entrusted to existing institutions with
expertise in the relevant areas. Targets and performance indicators are prepared under the
Program Based Budgeting o f the Government and w i l l form the basis o f regular impact
assessments. As o f February o f 2009, almost 12,000 f i r m s and individuals had benefited
from NEF services and Rs.1.5 billion had been spent. About 6,000 j o b seekers were
placed in internship and training in companies. Almost 5,000 f i r m s received support
amounting to Rs.290 million.

151. The NEF oversees a wide range o f initiatives, but the main one i s the Placement
Program. Since i t s creation, about 6 thousand workers have been placed. A look at the
sectors benefiting from such initial placement (Table 16) shows that ICT corresponds to
80 percent o f the total. I t i s clear then that this particular program does not cater to
structurally displaced workers from the reform program. It i s true that the NEF also has



                                             56
other initiatives targeting displaced workers, but progress there i s much less impressive.
Another important question i s why I C T f i r m s in Mauritius need to hire workers through
the NEF given the very tight labor market condition in that sector. The placement
program offers certain pecuniary benefits to participating f i r m s and it would be important
to demonstrate the impact o f those funds in terms o f jobs created, particularly as one
decides how to better allocate resources. An assessment o f the Placement Program i s
underway and should provide some answers. At any rate, the NEF i s a key institution in
Mauritius today. It has the mandate and institutional capillarity needed to mitigate social
adjustment costs implied by the economic transformation. N o w that the process o f setting
up i t s basic infrastructure and organization structure i s completed, it will be crucial to
allocate funds in programs with maximum impact over the most vulnerable groups.

152. The Government also remains committed to Eradicating Absolute Poverty (EAP).
Absolute poverty (share o f the population living below US$1 per person daily) i s below
one percent in Mauritius, which means that efficient targeting requires the improvement
o f measurement capacity. With technical assistance from UNDP, the Central Statistics
Office o f Mauritius (CSO) has launched a new survey - Survey o f Living Conditions
(SLC) - to better measure the low-frequency event o f absolute poverty in Mauritius. The
UNDP i s also assisting with the production o f absolute poverty lines. The E C i s
supporting qualitative poverty monitoring, and the W 3 i s providing technical assistance
                                                       E
for the CSO to develop poverty maps combining household surveys and census data.
While all these initiatives are important, they have not informed policy making directly
yet. T o deal with the issue o f absolute poverty, the government has conducted a lighter
survey to identify pockets o f extreme poverty and created an item o f expenditure in the
budget to be spent in the 229 pockets identified. Resources will be used towards children
education and life skills training.

153.     Another area that witnessed slow progress and for which no impact assessment
can be produced i s Social Protection reform. Social protection in Mauritius i s complex,
spread across several ministries with many small programs and high administrative costs.
More than sixty one social programs have been identified in 2007. The combined budget
for these programs was about 5 percent o f GDP - possibly higher (8 percent) when
subsidies were fully monetized. This i s a high figure by international standards as most
countries spend in the order o f 1 to 2 percent. There is, however, a history to
redistributive policies in Mauritius. They have been central to social stability and policy
continuity. A complex and large web o f social programs was instrumental in


                                              57
redistributing sugar and textile rents across society. As a new economic model takes
shape, government i s pursuing reforms to align labor market incentives and liberate
resources for "non-subsidized" wealth generation in a competitive private sector. This
will require a more efficient public sector and some changes to the social protection
system needs to be considered. There i s on-going assistance from UNDP and the WB on
t h i s issue, which have concentrated on the measurement agenda as outlined above so far.

                                             ASPECTS
                               B. ENVIRONMENTAL

154. Few if any o f the reforms supported by the DPL series i s likely to have significant
effects o n the environment, natural resources, and forestry, and this i s true also o f the
current operation. Beyond the immediate focus o f the DPL, other policies and
development objectives such as doubling tourist arrivals by 2015, expanding the port and
airport, relieving traffic congestion, making the business climate more investor friendly,
and allowing expedited environmental assessments on a cost recovery basis may pose
environmental risks. Historically, the record o f environmental management, though not
perfect, has been relatively good.27 Stringent environmental safeguards are provided for
in the Environmental Protection Act and all projects must obtain a . preliminary
environmental report or, in the case o f heavy polluting activities or major investment
projects, a full environmental impact assessment.28An environmental police force under
the aegis o f the Ministry o f Environment i s responsible for monitoring and enforcing
environmental provisions.

155. Meanwhile, over the past two decades policy has continued to evolve in response
to emerging threats and needs and i s currently under review again. The National
Environmental Policy white paper o f 2006 evidences a clear awareness o f environmental
risks and the importance o f careful management o f the fragile ecosystems o f a Small
Island Developing State dependent on environmentally sensitive sectors such as tourism
and fisheries. The white paper recognizes the, "need to properly manage wastes generated
from new industries such as from ethanol distilleries, sea-food industries and Information
and Communication Technology., .,[and] integrate policies for sustainable consumption."
(para. 2.6-2.7) More generally it stresses that, "Government i s fully conscious that the
long-term socio-economic success o f the country i s not possible without environmental
sustainability and i s therefore putting environmental concerns high on i t s agenda."

156. All Development Partners recognize the strategic importance o f environmental
protection and AFD, UNDP and the E C are actively providing technical support. With
E C assistance, a Strategic Environmental Assessment has been carried out for the Multi-
Annual Adaptation Strategy and Government has expressed an interest in carrying out
similar exercises for other environmentally sensitive sectors. AFD budget support
operation will have a strong focus on environment for the coming years as explained in
part I V section B.

157. In June 2009, a WB follow-up visit to the 2009 February evaluation and
assessment mission for the proposed use o f Mauritius country systems for environmental
and social safeguards has taken place. This follow-up mission presented draft findings o f
the Safeguards Diagnostic Review at a consultative workshop. There i s strong support for
a systematic approach to enhancing Mauritius' environmental and social safeguards
system so as to promote greater consistency with international best practices while at the
same time contributing to Mauritius' economic and social development objectives. The
WB shared the draft Safeguards Diagnostic Review with authorities and will incorporate
the comments. A final version, including a proposed Action Plan for Gap-Filling
Measures, will then be sent to the Government o f Mauritius for i t s review. After
agreement i s reached on gap-filling measures, the final Safeguards Diagnostic Review
will be disclosed to the public. The use of country systems will be adopted for the W B ' s
first investment project that reaches appraisal stage subsequent to the approval o f the
Safeguard Diagnostics Reviews and implementation o f the agreed Action Plan for gap-
filling measures.

158. The Government, represented by the Financial Secretary at the MoFEE, and the
WB, represented by the TTL, will meet to review progress o f the DPL program, together
with other Government and WB representatives as appropriate. Periodic monitoring will
take place through field missions and through staff based at the country office, which was
opened in February o f 2008. The WB will also maintain a dialogue with departmentnine
ministries, and other stakeholders involved in the implementation o f reforms. MoFEE, as
the primary counterpart o f the operation, will furnish data as required to monitor
outcomes in the matrix.

                                D. FIDUCIARYASPECTS

Public Financial Management System

159. Financial controls at the BOM and in the Government appear to be entirely
satisfactory. No problems or errors have been reported by the National Audit Office. This
information was supplemented during Preparation and Appraisal for the DPL, by
discussions with the Accountant General, officials o f the BOM, and others. No evidence
was found o f any material weakness with the Public Financial Management system that
would preclude general budget support. A Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability assessment undertaken with EU support in early 2007 had reached the
same conclusion. It found that donor-provided project loans and budget support were
"properly presented both in budget and outcomes, to a large extent using national
procedures." (p.8) A thorough overhaul o f procurement practices including new
legislation prepared in consultation with the World Bank should further strengthen
confidence.




                                            59
Funds Flow Arrangements

160. There has been no safeguard assessment o f the BOM by the IMF. Nevertheless,
the country has a well respected capacity for project implementation and financial
management. Audited accounts are published on the BOM web site. Information obtained
since the first DPL corroborates that the control environment for funds disbursed by
Development Partners i s adequate. Positive assessments continue as evidenced by
independent auditor's reports o f the Bank o f Mauritius' financial statements. The most
recent one was made publicly available in the 2008 Annual Reports o f the Bank o f
Mauritius. The independent auditor's reports comprised the balance sheet as at 30 June
2008 and the income statement, statement o f changes in equity and cash flow statement
for the year then ended and a summary o f significant accounting policies `and other
explanatory notes.

161. The loan disbursement will follow Bank procedures for Development Policy
Lending. The loan proceeds from the Bank will be credited to an account that i s part o f
the country's official foreign exchange reserves. The Borrower also confirmed that the
Rupee equivalent o f the loan proceeds will be reflected in the budget to finance budgeted
expenditures. The Government will provide a letter within 30 days o f receipt o f the loan
proceeds, from i t s Accountant General confirming: (i) the account into which the
                                                          that
loan proceeds are deposited i s part o f the country's official foreign exchange reserves;
and (ii) the Rupee equivalent o f the loan proceeds has been reflected in the budget
         that
and in the State's accounts.

                           E.   R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION

162. For DPLl and to a lesser extent DPL2, the main concern was whether
Government would stay the course. Even the chief proponents o f reform had argued less
that the benefits were large, than that there was no alternative. Some measures were
highly unpopular with the electorate and even in the Government there was widespread
anxiety about if and when the reforms would succeed. However, outcomes over the first
two years o f the reforms have convinced many of the skeptics. The 2008/09 budget used
the headroom created by buoyant revenues to set-up investment funds and to distribute
some o f the fruits of the harvest, including a generous pay increase for civil servants. The
world economic crisis initiated in September 2008 reinstated fiscal concerns and the
DPL3 helped to mitigate some o f the pressures. The proposed DPL4 i s also part of
scaled-up budget support operations that Development Partners are preparing to support
Mauritius. Despite the negative external environment and i t s consequences over
economic activity in Mauritius, reform implementation has remained on track as
demonstrated by the fulfillment of prior actions and the critical reforms that continue to
be pursued.

163. Mauritius i s a parliamentary democracy where general elections are held every
five years. The mandate o f the current Assembly will end no later than July 2010 and
elections are -to take place within the next s i x months after the end o f the mandate.
Mauritius has a tradition o f maintaining continuity o f the State in spite o f changes in
Government. However, it i s important to acknowledge that there are risks around


                                             60
maintaining the same focus and momentum for reforms after a new Government takes
office. A way to mitigate the risks i s to articulate and communicate to the public the
beneficial impact o f the reform agenda. Indeed, such strategy has already been
successfully used in Mauritius, as the Aid for Trade work helped to galvanize support
around the course o f action that the 2006 newly elected government decided to pursue. A
new Government may also provide an opportunity for deepening reforms in the
beginning o f a new term in office. This could be hampered by design and implementation
capacity constraints and risk mitigation would involve pro-active capacity building
efforts. The World Bank remains engaged to assist Mauritius through technical
assistance.

164. Another risk relates to the concentration o f reform ownership within the
government and the role o f line ministries. The leadership o f the Ministry o f Finance in
the reform process has been an important element o f the successful implementation o f the
reform program so far. However, efforts to broaden consensus building are essential. I        n
particular, deepening dialogue at the line ministries should help to generate stronger
leadership outside Finance. I t i s fair to say that the Ministry o f Finance itself encourages
that movement and has called upon the development partners to provide support for it.
Such mitigation strategy also helps to address some o f the "reform momentum risks"
identified in the previous paragraph.

165. The global economic slowdown also continues to produce key risks. As a small
open economy, Mauritius i s vulnerable to external shocks which create two main threats:

        (i)    Fiscal: Slower growth will continue to depress tax revenues. Lagged
               impact from growth to revenues makes it possible that the fiscal stance
               will deteriorate further even if the economy has started to recover.
               Pressure for other forms o f fiscal spending will only increase in the run-up
               to the election. All o f t h i s against a background o f high public debt.
               Furthermore, counter-cyclical policy i s largely based on infrastructure
               investment which faces notorious implementation bottlenecks and can
               hamper efforts to minimize declines in the aggregate demand. Mitigation:
               The government i s cognizant o f the importance to maintain a sustainable
               and good quality fiscal response. Concrete measures to improve project
               implementation capacity are being taken and the level o f budget deficit i s
               being contained. The Development Partners have scaled up budget
               support. This should mitigate impact o f falling revenues and allow for an
               improvement in the public debt profile (less short-term borrowing).

        ( i Balance o f Payments: Large current account deficits have been adequately
         i)
            financed so far. However, the dependence o f the trade balance on few
            export markets (tourism and textiles) and on imported commodities can
            become a source o f concern, particularly in 2010. Increase o f commodity
            prices outpacing recovery o f external demand for goods and services
            exports could drive the current account deficit to very high levels.
            Mitigation: An exchange rate policy conducive to external adjustment i s
            being followed. Counter-cyclical policies should help to mitigate fall in


                                              61
              GDP while slowdown in export-oriented sectors last. Temporary sectoral
              measures to improve competitiveness o f tourism and manufacturing
              should also contain increase in unemployment and limit second round
              effects from the slowdown. The government continues to monitor closely
              the evolution o f the balance o f payments and has kept an open dialogue
              with the Development Partners and the IMF.

166. Beyond the near-term, an overarching risk i s the lack o f capacity in the public
sector at large. Over the past 3 years, policy making has been driven by the economic
reform agenda, with the MOFEE playing a center stage. As the role o f line ministries
increase in a second generation reform environment, capacity shortages in line ministries
are likely to become more problematic. C i v i l service reform (PMS) should help to
ameliorate the constraints by promoting a more meritocratic public service, but only in
the future. As mitigating measures, initiatives such as Service to Mauritius, Capacity
Building program or Redeployment from Parastatals are being undertaken. It i s unclear,
though, how effective they will be in the short-run.

                               Shoringup EconorntcPerformance

   1.     Mauritius has been implementingwide-ranging reforms and policy measures over the
   past 3 to 4 years with a view to securing transition from reliance on trade preferences to
   global competitiveness and setting the stage for robust growth. The broad-based reform
   programme being implemented since FY 06/07, has received Budget Support from the World
   Bank (WB), the European Camrnisslon (EC), the African Development Bank (ADB) and the
   Agence Franvise de Ddveloppement (AFD). The InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) and the
   United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are closeiy associated with the
   implementation of the programme and have extended technical assistance. Collectively
   Mauritiushas secured Development Policy Loans amounting to US $210 million, representing
   the third disbursement of a three-year support programme,U $70 million from the EU in the
                                                                 S
   form of grants, US $100 million from WE, U $10 mllllon from ADB and  24 million from
                                                  S
   AFD. Other DeveIopment Partners, namely BADEA, IFAD, OFID, JICA, China and India amongst
   others, have also provided financing for projects aligned to Government's reform programme
   while bringing their expertise in their areas of interest.

. . 2.      Whilst the reform programme has opened the economy, built resilience by reducing
     macroeconomic vulnerabilities and improvingfiscal sustainability, there remains a number of
     challenges due to the global financial and economic crisis which have to be deait with. To
 . . cushion the negative effects of the global economic crisis, a host of measures were taken since
     May 2008. These include increased spending on capital investment, including fast tracking
     and frontloading of some key investment proJects, measures aimed at expeditlng
     implementationof projects and programmes through the creation of special funds to realise
. the Maurice fle Durable vision, build food security, boost education and knowledge, eradicate
  ' poverty, widen the drcIe of opportunities, save jobs, improve local infrastructure, carry out

     social housing commitments and to sharpen the competitiveness of domestic industries and
  ' SMEs. In addition, the Bank of Mauritius has also been implementing measures in a bid to

     keep the economy buoyant.

   3.      The reforms implemented over the last few years have thus been instrumental in
   cushioningthe economy From the crisis. In 2008, in spite of the deterioratingglobal economic
   conditions, the Mauritian economy did welf with most key indicators showlng strong
   performance. Economic growth reached 5 3 % in 2008, the unemployment rate dropped to
   7.2%, FDI reached more than Rs 10 billlon, import cover reniained close to 8 months of
   imports and the overall budget deRclt was brought down to 2.7% of CDP [07/08]. However,
   as regards external trade, the current account of the balance of payments recorded a hlgher
   deficit in 2008 partly due to the dedine in demand for main exports and high fond and energy
   prices in early 2008 that lmpacted on the import bill,

   4.     Based on the performance noted during the first semester of 2009, there are
   indications that the impact of the crisis on the Mauritian economy would be less pronounced
                                                                                   ,
   than initially expected. For 2009, economic growth in now projected at 2.5 % investment
                                                                             A.    ..-I

                                                                                             1




                                                  79
(gross domestic fixed capital formation) as a percentage of CDP is projected to remain around
24.4%, the rate of unemployment Is expected to be around 8%, inflation is expected ta fall
below 4% while forelgn direct investment is likely to remain at comfortable levels. As
regards, the overalI budget deficit, it is likely to increase from 3% of CDP in 2008/09 to
around 4.8% of GDP in F 2009 (July-December). The increase is mainly due to the stimulus
                        Y
package measures and lower tax revenue.

5.     Mauritius has successfully met the targets set out under DPL1, DPL2 and DPLS. The
four pillars of the reform programme are:

       A, Fiscal Consolidationand Public Sector Efficiency
       B. ImpravingTrade Competitiveness
       C. Improvingthe lnvestmentClimate
       D. Widening the Circle of Opportunity through Participation, Social Inclusion and
          Sustainability

   This will continue to underpIn our strategy. The letter of development policy broadly
outlines how current and prospective reforms will consolidate and extend the gains in each of
the areas.

  . . A. FiscalConsolidationand Public Sector Efficiency

 6.      Fiscal consolidation and improvement of efficiency in the public sector remains high on
 the agenda given the pressing need to put debt on a declining path to meet the targets set out
 in the Public Debt Management Act and to further improvequality of spending. As regards the
 latter, a host of reforms are under way to improve quality of spending. These include the
 extension of the Programme Based Budgeting (PBB} to parastatal bodies, implementation of
'performance management systems, restructuring of parastatals, introduction of a social
 register for Mauritius. In the medium term, government will continue to take measures to
 improve revenue buoyancy through improved tax administration and review of kes and
 charges where needed. .

. 7 . .. .
        A Project Plan Committee under the aegis of the Ministry of Public infrastructure, Land
 Transportand Shipping has been set up to assess the infrastructureneeds of the economy and
 develop a project pipeline. To fast-track and frontload public infrastructure,Government has
 set up mechanisms to improve implementation capacity by mobilising support from
 Development Partners to flnance the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP).
 Government has smoothed the progress of the implementation of projects through the
 advanced purchase of land required for the PSIP, hence reducing implementationdelays. In
 this context, systems have been set up leading to major improvements in the pace of project
 tmplementatlon whllst ensuring vakue for money and moblllsing adequate resources to
 finance maintenance and operation.
    . .
 8.     In the medium term, the priortty remains the bringing down of the borrowing
 requirementswith a view to reducing Oublicsector debt as a share of GDP. For this purpose, a
 MTEF with PBB embedded has been introduced with the support of UNDP and IMF, so that
 resources are channeled for optimal outcomes. This modern approach to budgeting i s about
                                                                                              2



                                               80
    more judicious use of public money and greater fiscal responsibility. Promotingownership by
    sector Ministries, coherence wlth the Government Reform Programme, internal consistency
    and ensuring programmes and projects are fully financed and consistent with the economic
    reform programme have been encouraged. As DPL4 prior action, at Ieast four line ministries
    strategies For 2020 budget in line with PBB requirements namely for Ministry of Environment,
    Mhlstry of Tourism, Ministry of Industry and Ministry of Public Infrastructure, Land
    Transport and Shipping have been agreed to.

         E, ImprovingTrade Competitiveness

    9.      The Additional Stimulus Package (ASP) proposed in the wake of the global economic
    crisis comprises 59% public infrastructure including land acquisition. Government has
    initiated an action plan to boost up project realisation capacity in the 2009 Budget. Project
    realtsauon capacity is vital for a dynamic bounce back when the world economy reaches its
    turning point. To boost up this capacity Government will thus act on three core elements,
    namely human resources, processes in the public sector and institutions.

. 10.    In both the public and private sectors, there is a dearth of skiIls and expertise that
  htnders project implementation, undermines the country's competitiveness and constrains
  growth potential. Reforms have been introduced to make the labour market more flexible.
  These reforms are vital but not enough, Government recognizes the need to act on human
  capaciy as well. Government has increased the provision for its Capacity Building
  Programme to Rs 190 million to be partly financed by grants from Development partners.
  This should enable the Capacity Building Programme to rapidly mobilize technical expertise
  both at home and abroad to serve in the public sector in line with the ASP and the 2009
. Budget The Service to Mauritius programme has also been expanded. A special window will
  be developed under the Service to Mauritius Programme to employ newly qualified engineers
  who are required to undertake industrial and pre-registration training. The Regional Multi
  Disciplinary Centre of Excellence (RMCE] can be a plus to our efforts on Human Resource
  Capacity building. Government wilI pursue negotiation efforts to mobilize more support for
  the RMCE, which has already rallied the participation of COMESA and the AFD on two training
  projects.

-   1.
     1      The hmework for autonomous campuses has been approved whlch will have the
. . multiple objectives of opening greater access to tertiary education for students, create jobs for
    graduates and researchers, attract expertise from other countries and make of Mauritius a
    centre of excellence for the region. I t wfll also open the way to an investment potentlal of Rs
    1.2 bilIion over the next two years. In an endeavor to build knowledge and human capital,
    Government Is exempting loans contracted by an Individual for educational purposes lrom
    payment of reglstra~on   duty on reglstrarion OF the loan agreement.

   1 . Furthermore, considerable progress has been achieved in reducing tariffs. Customs
.. duty on 87% of tariff lines were eliminated by 2008/09, and Government Intends to
   eventually abolish custom duty on remaining tarrff lines. A joint Public- Private Sector
   Standing Committee has been set up to review the design and implementation of the
   regulatory measures relative to import and export licenses with a view to eliminate
   unwarranted barriers to trade.
                                                                                          3

 with all matters of bankruptcy, insolvency, matters arising out of the Companies Act, banking.
 Insurance, bills o f exchange, offshore, industrial property, patents, sale of goods and other
 disputes that are of a commercial nature. To increase investment in emerging sectors,
 Government has adopted the Insolvency legislation as a result of improving the quality of the
 buslness environment. The Competition Commission has been set up to improve competitive
 practlces and Increase the efficiency of firms. FIve commissioners have been appointed by the
 President of the Republic of Mauritius. Government i s also giving permanent resident status
 to purchasers in Real Estate Scheme (RES) developments provided they buy a property worth
 at least US$500,000.

   18.    To further encourage private seam investment, Government has adopted the
   necessary legal and regulatory framework for accelerated decision-making process. The Law
   Practitioners Amendment Act has been proclaimed and the International Arbitration
   legislation has been passed to allow us to expand the range of Business Process and
   Knowledge Process Outsourcing Services offered from our country. This legislation provides
   a framework to attract international law Arms that will bringthe much-needed skills to export
   legal outsourcing services. Other measures include giving the necessary clearance for the
   setting up of the Air Cargo Logistics Centre, an airport hatel and business cum commercial
. centre. This will clear the way for the implementation of 4 major projects in the Air Cargo
   Logistics Centre for an estimated investment of RS 1bilIion. Support to Board of Investment
   has been stepped up with an additional Rs 25 r n i l l h ~ marketing and promotion to a m a k
                                                            for
 . Foreign Dtrect Investment.

   .   D. WLdealng the Circle of Oppormnltlesthrough Participation,Soda1lncluslon and
          Sustainability

  19. * The Government is very much aware that the success and sustainability of the reform
  programme i s conditional upon ownership by the people. The best way to protect the
  papulation L these uncertain economic times Ls to preserve Its purchasing power and to
               n
  empower it through self employment. The stimulus package has achieved this partly by
..saving jobs and thus reducing the impact of the crisis on the labour force. The centerpiece of
  the stimulus package is to keep jobs and maintain famlly income. The implementation of
  work and training scheme is an example of such timely, targeted and temporary policy action
  to mitigate the risks of widespread layoffs.

 20.    In an effort to strengthen and widen protection to shield more citizens from the
 Fallouts of the Great Recession, Government is bringing the different agencies involved in
 empowerment and in the fight against poverty under one raof. The National Empowerment
 Foundation (NEF] will, fn addition to hlfllling its mandate, provide an overall coordinating
 framework for the Trust Fund, the Eradication of Absolute Poverty [EAP) programme and the
 Decentralised Cooperation Programme (DCP). Each agency will continue to operate on its
 own agenda but with savings on overhead from pooling of common services and better
 coordination and synergies from being under one roof. Rs 2.5 billion have been earmarked
  for the collective efforts of all these organizations under the roof of the NEF. Development
  Partners supported the production of a Rnal poverty map by Central Stattstlcs Offlce [GO)


                                                                                              5

13.     ICT is an important pillar of the economy and is at the same tihe one of the most
resilient industries to the global crisis. In fad, ICT enterprises have been expanding by 10 to
12%. To further boost this sector, the 301 will step up its promotionand marketingcampaign
especially in business outsourcing. Costs have continued to come down wlth a reduction in
IPLC prices of 35% this year which has allowed Internet Service Providers to offer consumers
twice the speed for the Same price. Significant cost reductions of around 50 % are envisaged
in the wake of a second underwater fibre optic cable becoming operational by 2011. This
cable is being built as an open system by regional private investors. Government will support
this initiative through the State InvestmentCorporation (SIC).

    14.     Our industrialsector needs additionaland better infrastructure,further improvements
    tn the doing business environment and measures to enhance competitiveness. Thus there is a
    need to build public inf'rastructure and improving competitivenessthrough modernization of
    machinery and equipment and upgrading of skills. The ManufacturingAdjustment and SME
    Development Fund (MASMED] has been restructured into the SavingJobs and Recovery Fund
    (SIR FUND) which will have a much broader scope, encompassing ail sectors of the economy
    and enterprises of all sizes. It will support businesses in the services sector, tourism,
    domestic oriented and export oriented enterprises, including textiles and clothing, diamond,
    watch-making and other jewelry and seafood and SME's. I n the ASP, the mandate of the
    MASMED FUND was broadened to include support for the export of services and raised its
    contributionto Rs 1 billion. Government is injecting an additional of Rs 2 billion to the Fund.

    15.                                                                               -
            An innovative scheme- the Mauritius Business Growth Scheme (MBGS) to promote
    business growth in SMEs has also been set up. ,ltIs conventlondwisdom that support i s most
    effective when firms have full freedom to choose services and suppliers. This is a model that
    has succeeded in other countries and i s being replicatedin Mauritius. Under this new scheme,
    eliglble firms will receive finance to support their business growth on a cost-sharing basis. In
    view of soothing financial difficulties of enterprises, an Emergency Export Credit Insurance
    scheme will be set up for SMEs as well as large enterprises in all sectors until December 2010.

       C. Improvingthe investment Climate

    16.     In the 2010 World Bank Ease of Doing Business Survey, Mauritius is at the top in Africa
    and ranks 17* world wide graduating from 24th position in 2009. Mauritius has further
    simplified the transfer of property by abolishing t w o procedures. It Is no longer necessary to
    obtafn a clearance certificate from the Waste Water Authority or a tax clearance certificate for
    municipal taxes. Start-up is also easier: name verification for a new company Is now done
    online. Gettlng credlt too may he easier: after eliminating the minimum threshold for loan
    amounts and the pubiic credit registry of the Bank of Mauritius now captures informationon
    all credits extended by the financial system.

    17,    The priority is to maintain our momentum to further improve on the progress made in
-   the Ease of Doing Business Survey. Regulations are being streamlined further and expertise is
    being mobilized to draw on internationalbest practices to modernizelicensingprocedures in
    four ministries, namely Agro-Indushy, Finance, Health and Tourism which collectively issue
    some 440 different licenses. In the area of busjness facilitation, Government has set up a
    specialised Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of Mauritius with jurisdiction to deal
                                                                                                4




                                                    83
         combining 2001/02 Household Budget Survey and 2000 Population Census data with the
         objective to improve capacity for geographicaltargeting.

         21.     The DCP will continue supporting various projects by non-state actors and local
         governments such as basic education, upgrading of social infrastructure and services. In
         Rodrigues, micro projects have been supported ln the Beld of irrigatton, livestock
         management, reforestation and agricultural and agro-industrial production. Rs 300 million
         are being provided for the next 18 months. The activities of the EAP Programme are being
         expanded to include medlcal screening for around 600 children of pre-primary schools In
         selected areas. Spectacles,hearing aids, food supplementsand other facilities will be provided
         free to those children who require them.

          22.    As part of our policy to broaden the circle of opportunities and to ensure that the fruits
          of development are shared by all, a corporate social responsibility (CSR) scheme was required
          of the IRS promoters wirh well defined guidelines for their actions and to align their CSR
          projects with Government's emphasis on saving jobs and protecting people. To ensure that
          there is no duplication and that there is an integrated approach, the IRS will work with the
          NEF and EAP. Out of 6 IRS projects, 3 have developed their CSR plans for a total of Rs 50
        . million. A special vehtcle will be created for the Rs 50 million to be deposited with the NEF
          and these funds will be supplemented with a matching grant from Government.

  .23.      Funds have been provided to increase old age and other non-contributory pensions
    and social aid benefits by 5.1%. The Ministry of Women is working with the Ministry of Social
    Security and NGOs to develop a comprehensive programme to offer shelter and support to
. 'Women and children who need assistance. Government has also introduced a scholarship for
   -all students attending courses at tertiary institutions in Mauritius, who face severe hardship
    '


    following the death or serious incapacity of a wage earner in the family.

~         Outcome, Past and Projected

          26     I t i s most crucial to continue with the reforms but at the same time our policy focus has
    '
          shifted to the need to save jobs and to protect people from the Recesslon. As a consequence,
          the resilience of the economy should be reinforced. Resources mobilized from the
          Development Partners will help us stay on course for the reforms and long-term goals whilst
          addressing the short term priority of preventing a reversal of t h e important gains achieved
          since 2005.

. 25.           The indicators to be used for disbursement of funds for DPL 4 have been agreed. For
          the World Bank and AD5 conditions are to prepare sector strategies, debt management,
          removal of non-trade barriers and facilitation for dolng business among others. As concerns
          the AFD, disbursement of funds is not linkedt o indicators.

        Conclusion

        26.    Government is determined to stay on the path of reform and thus to save jobs, protect
        people and prepare for the recovery. Development Partners are, therefore, requested to
        continue their support to the implementation of the ongoing economic reform programme.
        Mauritius relles on the technical expertise of its Development Partners, in aligning the sector
        strategies and programmes to the reform agenda. The collective challenge i s to focus on
        implementation with the full support and active engagement of our DeveIopment Partners.

 Mauritius has a long andsustained track record o implementing strongpolicies, and the
                                                   f
 authorities have responded appropriately to the global financial crisis by easing macroeconomic
policies. While the crisis response has halted the decline in public debt, the public finances are
fundamentally sound and external debt is sustainable. I n light o theflexible exchange rate, the
                                                                 f
 country's current reserve position is comfortable, and banks have remained liquid and
prof table. With these strong economic fundamentals and an effective institutional policy
pamework, Mauritius is well placed to weather the current challenges.

Recent Economic Developments and Short-Term Outlook

The Mauritian economy is suffering from second-round effects o f the global financial crisis, with
economic growth slowing but expected to remain positive. Direct financial spillovers have been
limited, reflecting conservative investment practices o f Mauritian banks. As a result, banks had
little direct exposure to subprime and other affected assets, and have remained liquid, profitable,
and well-capitalized, thus far. The stock market has moved in tandem with global trends.
The global crisis is affecting Mauritius primarily via a sharp drop in external demand for tourism
and textiles, and a fall in capital inflows. As a result o f these developments, economic growth i s
projected to slow to 2 percent in 2 0 0 9 4 o w n from 5.3 percent in 2008-with depressed imports
likely to keep the current account deficit in single digits, as a share o f GDP. At the same time,
inflation, which has dropped below 1 percent (year-on-year) in August, i s expected to stay
subdued for the remainder o f this year.

Economic Policy Response

In tight o f the global financial crisis, the authorities have responded with an appropriate easing o f
macroeconomic policies:
        F'kcalpolicy. The government is implementinga fiscal stimulus package o f about
        5 percent o f GDP spread over 2009-10. The targeted and temporary stimulus measures
        focus on advancing planned infrastructurespending and providing financial relief to
        those firms hit hardest by the global crisis. These stimulus-related expenditures will lead
        to a deterioration o f the fiscal deficit during 2009-10 (Box 1). To keep the deficit and the
        debt dynamics under control, the government has also introduced partially offsetting
        adjustment measures in its recent budget, which should help bring the primary balance
        back to a small surplus by end-2011. Public debt has declined sharply in recent years but
        still stands at around 60 percent o f GDP, and medium-term fiscal policy will need to aim
        at bringing it down further to reduce potential vulnerabilities, Financing on favorable
        terms will thus be important to keep both the public finances and debt ratio on a
        sustainable path.

        the fall o f 2008, when it cut the repo rate by 250 basis points and reduced reserve
        requirements. Since then, the policy rate has been left iinchanged. In addition, the central

        drawn thus far by one bank, to a very limited extent.
4       Exchange ratepolicy, The BoM has refrained from interventions in the foreign exchange
        market since December 2008. This has kept official reserves at a comfortable level, while
        resulting in a depreciationof the rupee by 4 percent, in nominal effective terms, between
        end-December 2008 and end-August 2009.

                            Box 1. Fiscal Policy Stance and Measures
Based on the budget approved in May 2009, and in light ofthe government'sfiscal stimulus
package, Mauritius is expected to record a dejlcit, including grants,for the six month budget
(July-December) o 5 percent o GDP (about 4 percentfor full calendar year 2009) and in FY
                 f            f
2010 o again around 5 percent o GDP.
       f                        f
    4   Revenue are projected to decline across the board: Customs and excise revenues are
        falling because of lower imports; VAT because of lower domestic consumption,
        including significantly lower spending by tourists; real estate taxes due to depressed
        activity; corporate taxes because o f a lower level o f profits, reflecting depressed demand
        together with actions to preserve employment; and dividends because of lower
        profitability o f state owned enterprises,
    0   Spending isprojecfedto increase. Starting in the first half o f 2009, the authorities
        began to implement the stimulus package announced in December 2008 that is
        targeted and temporary. As programs get into full gear, spending i s expected to
        accelerate over the next 18 months. During this period, the stimulus package accounts
        for about 5 percent o f GDP o f which 3 to 3.5 percent o f GDP will be carried out
        through dedicated funds. The latter were established at the end o f the 2007/08 fiscal
        year, when funding was set aside as a contingency against an economic slowdown,
        and were stocked up further in FY2008/09.

External Sector Vulnerabilities
Economic vulnerabilities have been reduced in recent years and risks appear manageable. The
main risks arise from much lower demand for tourism, textiles, and real estate development.
Also, continued turmoil in global financial markets and reduced appetite for emerging market
assets could diminish FDI inflows further and reduce activity o f the important Global Business
Companies, However, the external position remains sustainable and medium-termrisks,
including for external debt sustainability, are manageable. In addition, the solid level of
internationalreserves (as o f July about 6 months o f imports) provides a welcome cushion, while
the orderly depreciation o f the rupee i s helping export competitiveness, without having hindered
a significant decline in inflation.

Relations with the IMF
The 2008 Article I V consultation was completed on July 2,2008. The next consultation is
expected in the fourth quarter o f 2009.
