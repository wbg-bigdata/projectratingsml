MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for SDR 90.6
million (US$120.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. Part I of
the document discusses Nigeria's development problems and prospects, the
key priorities of the economic reform program at the macroeconomic and
sector levels, and the Bank Group's assistance strategy. Part II of the
document describes the proposed Credit.
I. Country Policies and Bank Group Assistance Strategy
Background
2.        Nigeria has considerable potential for diversified development.
It is a major oil producer. Petroleum production accounts for 25 percent
of total GDP, over 80 percent of foreign exchange receipts, and 70 percent
of budgetary revenues. There are also vast reserves of natural gas, which
are only beginning to be exploited. Agriculture employs over two-thirds of
the labor force and provides about 30 percent of GDP. Yams, cassava, and
food grains together account for over 85 percent of GDP derived from the
crop sector, which is largely based on small-scale farming. Cocoa, oil
palm, rubber, groundnuts, and cotton are the principal cash crops. They
account for less than 10 percent of crop-based GDP. Agricultural
productivity is low, with considerable scope for improvement through the
extension of small scale irrigation and improved technology. Manufacturing
production increased rapidly during the 1970s, but because of
tariff-distorted incentives, much of the expansion was in import-dependent,
assembly-type activities that contributed little to local value-added and
employment. The sector accounts for less than 10 percent of total GDP and
employment. Services, which account for over 25 percent of GDP, are
dominated by wholesale and retail trade.
Legacy of the Oil Boom
3.        Buoyant oil revenues in the 1970s provided the basis for large
increases in government expenditures designed to expand infrastructure and
non-oil productive capacity. Some successes notwithstanding, many public
investment projects were undertaken without sufficient attention either to
their economic viability or to the capacity of government agencies and
public enterprises to implement them. In many cases, the public sector was
used more to distribute the oil riches and to provide employment for the
rapidly expanding labor force than to ensure efficient delivery of services
to the population at large. Meanwhile, the increased spending on
construction and urban services boosted relative prices of non-traded goods
and services and undermined the incentive framework for the traded sector.



Traditional agricultural exports were particularly hard hit, as the real
exchange rate was allowed to appreciate substantially. The share of
agriculture in GDP shrunk from 50 percent to 30 percent in less than a
decade. This decline was accompanied by a massive migration to urban
areas.
4.        When the oil market weakened in the early 1980s, depreciation of
the exchange rate was resisted, and sizeable external and fiscal imbalances
emerged. These were financed by public sector borrowing, a rundown of
international reserves, and a large-scale accumulation of payments arrears
on external trade credits, while commercial bank debt mounted. In 1984,
the authorities began to implement austerity measures to redress these
deficits. Budgetary expenditures were slashed across-the-board, and
administrative controls over imports -- in the form of import licenses and
prohibitions against imports of certain items -- were tightened,
multiplying the inefficiencies that had developed during the period of
strong oil revenues. Non-oil GDP fell sharply. As a result of plummeting
spending throughout the public sector in the face of increasing demand,
budgets became salary budgets, leaving severe shortages of inputs such as
drugs, textbooks and spare parts, and no funding for maintenance. This, in
turn, led to a rapid deterioration of social and economic infrastructure
facilities. The downturn in the economy also exposed underlying weaknesses
in the financial system associated with poor management, limited
accountability, and regulatory deficiencies.
5.        Over this period, Nigeria's foreign debt increased dramatically,
with the US dollar value of the debt stock doubling between 1982 and 1987.
At the end of 1989, Nigeria's external debt totalled US$33 billion,
corresponding to over 300 percent of exports of goods and services and over
100 percent of GDP. Virtually all is on commercial terms; since Nigeria
has had only limited access to concessional loans in the past, the
financial terms for its external debt are significantly more onerous than
for most other low income countries. Debt service obligations have placed
great strain on the balance of payments and have necessitated major
rescheduling exercises with the London Club, the Paris Club, promissory
note holders and other creditors. Despite these reschedulings, the debt
burden remains high and will continue to constrain Nigeria's ability to
achieve per capita growth over the medium-term.
6.        Meanwhile, Nigeria's poverty, which had been obscured by its
temporary oil riches, was becoming increasingly apparent. GNP per capita,
which had been estimated at US$1000 in 1980 on the basis of a grossly
overvalued exchange rate, fell to US$370 in 1987 and to only US$250 in
1989, as the exchange rate was adjusted to reflect underlying economic
conditions. The fall in export earnings triggered a major contraction in
imports -- on a per capita basis, real imports in 1989 were below the level
in 1970, before the onset of the oil boom. This impacted on levels of
investment and consumption, both of which, on a per capita basis, are also
now below 1970 levels. Basic socioeconomic and infrastructure indicators
place Nigeria among the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. As a
result of deteriorating quality of public services in combination with
falling household incomes, primary school enrollment dropped from
92 percent in 1982183 to 65 percent in 1989; health clinic attendance also



- 3 -
dropped over the same period; and water delivery has continued to
deteriorate.
The Structural Adjustment Program
7.        The sharp decline in world oil prices in the first quarter of
1986 increased the urgency of reform, and in mid-1986 the Government
introduced a comprehensive and courageous Structural Adjustment Program
(SAP). The SAP combined exchange rate and trade policy reforms with
stabilization policies designed to restore balance of payments equilibrium
and price stability. Considerable stress was laid on shrinking the public
sector and improving its efficiency. Although the SAP formally ended in
June 1988, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to the program and has
continued to take steps to strengthen and consolidate it.
8.        Over the past four years, the Government's commitment to the
program's structural policies has generally been steady, although weak
implementation capacity and pressures from interest groups have caused
performance on policy reform measures to lapse from time to time. Within
the public sector, economic criteria have increasingly influenced decision-
making. The direction of public spending has been changing, emphasizing
maintenance and completion of viable on-going projects, and shifting to
infrastructure and human resources and away from commercial projects. As
of September 1990, 44 publicly-owned enterprises had been sold to private
investors and over 400,000 new shareholders created under the privatization
program. At the same time, the groundwork has been laid for
commercialization of parastatals remaining in the public sector. In the
financial sector, interest rates have been liberalized, and a wide-ranging
program of reforms initiated, including a movement towards indirect
instruments of monetary control and away from specific credit ceilings,
strengthened supervision by the Central Bank of Nigeria, and restructuring
of insolvent banks. For the private sector, the general policy thrust has
been maintained: greater use of price signals and market mechanisms. The
real exchange rate has been devalued by 70 percent, import licensing has
been eliminated, the scope of import prohibitions has been reduced, and the
commodity boards :ave been scrapped.  The regulatory environment for
private investment has been simplified and limitations on foreign
investment reduced.
9.        Notwithstanding a brief period of expansionary policies in the
early part of 1988 in an attempt to accelerate economic growth, progress
has also been made in reducing macroeconomic imbalances. Thus, the general
government deficit was reduced to about 3.5 percent of GDP in 1989, and
monetary policies tightened. Reflecting these measures, consumer prices,
which rose by about 40 percent in both 1988 and 1989, are expected to
increase by a more modest 14 percent in 1990, with further reductions in
the rate of inflation expected in 1991 and beyond. The domestic savings
rate has increased significantly to about 20 percent of GDP and is now
higher than for most other countries at a comparable per capita income
level. Despite this, Nigeria's heavy debt service burden has necessitated
a substantive reduction in domestic investments, which are now down to only
13 percent of GDP. Over the period, continuous efforts have also been made
to reduce Nigeria's debt service obligations.



- 4 -
10.       Impact of the Adiustment Program.  There is considerable
evidence throughout the economy of program-related changes.  After falling
by over 3 percent in 1987 due mainly to the effects of bad weather on
agricultural output, non-oil GDP recorded positive, albeit modest, growth
rates in 1988 and 1989. Preliminary estimates indicate a further
acceleration in non-oil GDP growth to close to 4 percent in 1990.  The
reforms of the foreign trade system combined with a more realistic exchange
rate have rationalized the incentive framework. As a result, there is now
a more economically-rational allocation of foreign exchange across
competing uses. Domestic terms-of-trade have changed in favor of the rural
areas. In turn, these changes have produced some important responses. In
the agricultural sector, the initial impact on food production was masked
by effects of poor weather conditions. Sharply rising food prices have,
however, improved producer incentives, assisting the output recovery in
1988-89 and increasing rural incomes. In the tree-crop-based export
sector, the supply response to price incentives of the reform program has
been strong. In manufacturing, SAP has eliminated much of the earlier bias
against export activities and improved the competitiveness of activities
relatively dependent on local resources. The shift in relative prices,
while benefitting the rural population has, however, impacted heavily on
urban real incomes, prompting the Government to take steps to minimize
socially disruptive consequences through a relief program. In general, the
private sector's investment response to the adjustment program has been
muted. This is due partly to doubts regarding the sustainability of the
government's adjustment measures -- in particular after the scheduled
transfer of power to a civilian government in 1992. Investment has also
been affected by uncertainties engendered by earlier periodic shifts in
macro policy stance and by effects of Nigeria's serious infrastructural
deficiencies, which increase the required size of the upfront investment
outlays.
The Government's Policy Agenda and Issues
11.       The present military government is firmly committed to
continuing the process of economic reform it initiated with the SAP. It is
also committed to holding democratic elections and handing over to a
civilian government by October 1992. Extensive political activities have
already begun, and two political parties have been formed. During the
transition to civilian rule, which will involve a devolution of power from
the center to the states, the Government will need to guard against a
relaxation of centralized discipline over spending and public sector
management. For the longer term, there is the question of the extent to
which a prospective civilian government will persevere with all elements of
the reform program. This is of particular concern since, while much
progress has been made in reducing macroeconomic imbalances and major
distortions in the incentive framework, much remains to be done to overcome
the severe structural and institutional problems left as a legacy of past
policies, and to promote a resumption of growth in per capita incomes. A
continued commitment is required to create and maintain an environment
conducive to the private sector investment and expansion needed to generate
this growth.



12.       Priority components of the Government's short-term agenda, which
it wishes to complete before the handover to a civilian regime, include
locking in the process of financial sector reform, completion of the
privatization program, and achieving a more durable solution to the
external debt situation. At the same time, however, there is considerable
political pressure to complete and initiate some capital-intensive
investment projects whose economic rationale is doubtful. Financing these
projects will pre-empt public resources required to meet more pressing
needs in the economy, and may crowd out the growth of the private sector
which lies at the heart of the adjustment strategy. These risks will be
compounded unless action is also taken to reduce the fiscal drain and
resource costs of existing subsidies, particularly on oil and fertilizer.
13.       The resumption of per capita income growth over the medium term
requires that some major constraints resulting from past policies are
removed. Private sector investment confidence has to bo restored. This
will require the government to pursue a steady course of structural reform
and to maintain macroeconomic stability. Adequate resources for private
sector expansion will have to be ensured by restraining government
expenditure and borrowing. This will also assist in the stabilizing
domestic prices, which is essential for maintaining a market-determined
exchange rate and sustaining business confidence. The allocation of public
spending must be concentrated in areas such as physical infrastructure and
human resources that will be complementary to private sector expansion.
Sector reforms will need to be vigorously pursued: priority areas will be
to continue the course of financial sector reform, including the
restructuring of the banking system, and to remove government regulations
that limit private sector investment response to economic measures already
taken. To ensure a stronger, long-term response in food production,
serious non-price development constraints -- including the slow pace of
technological upgrading at the farm level, the lack of market integration
due to poor infrastructure, and the neglect of the special constraints
faced by women farmers -- need to be overcome.
14.       To date, the major challenge in implementing the structural
adjustment program has been in the area of broad macroeconomic and
stabiliz,.zion policies. As the adjustment program in the coming years
moves into a new phase, with emphasis on institutional and sector reform,
progress will crucially depend on the government's ability to improve
project implementation capacity and public administration at both federal
and state levels. One effect of the deficiencies in public administration
has been the very slow execution of the Bank's lending program. This has
also made it difficult for other donors to lend. There is growing
awareness at senior government levels of these problems, but it will take
time for new initiatives in staffing and training to have an impact, and
proposals to change the ways of doing business to become effective. Major
management and administration reforms will still be required, together with
measures to mobilize private sector management capabilities to ensure
improved efficiency in public sector functions.
15.       Other long term challenges are to reduce the population growth
rate and to reverse the current trend of environmental degradation. There
is little opportunity for improving the quality of life in Nigeria without



a slowdown in the growth rate of population, currently estimated at
3.1 percent per annum. With population doubling every 23 years, the
pressures on the social infrastructure and on employment opportun.ities are
overwhelming the productive capacity of the economy. The government has
recognized the importance of reducing the growth rate, and a comprehensive
population policy was launched in 1989. While the seriousness of the
situation calls for strong, immediate actions, it is recognized that
adjusting fertility preferences requires a long term approach.
16.       Due to the population pressures on land use in Nigeria, the
period of fallow has shortened, while techniques of sustaining intensive
cultivation are not yet well entrenched. This has resulted in soil loss
and deterioration of soil quality. The increased demand for fuelwood, as
well as uncontrolled logging, has accelerated the loss of forest cover,
leading to the encroachment of the desert and infertility of the soil.
Water contamination from both industrial and biological waste is also an
important issue. Some of the problems associated with the deteriorating
environment have already become acute and are weakening sustainable
development in the short as well as the longer term. Redress of these
problems requires strong commitment by the government at both the federal
and state levels, as well as adequate strengthening of federal, state and
local institutions.
Impact of the Gulf Crisis
17.       In the immediate future, the challenge of sustaining the reform
process, while maintaining responsible fiscal and monetary policies and
managing the transition to civilian rule, has been complicated by the
impact on oil markets of the Gulf crisis. The size and durability of any
resulting revenue windfall to Nigeria remain uncertain. But the benefits
to Nigeria are likely to be temporary and have little effect on the
underlying economic realities. Even if oil prices were to average US$30
per barrel through 1995 -- a highly unlikely scenario -- per capita income
would barely reach US$400, and Nigeria would remain one of the poorest
countries in the world. However, there is a risk that perceptions of a
sizeable increase in oil revenue may lead to a relaxation of discipline on
public spending, and also obscure the reality of Nigeria's needs in the
eyes of the international community. The need to undertake the investments
necessary to address Nigeria's accumulated infrastructural and social
sector deficiencies, while at the same time ensuring adequate scope for
expansion of private sector investment, will require both efficiency
improvements and substantial external assistance.
18.       Even though recent reschedulings have reduced Nigeria's debt
service burden, the Government will continue to face the challenge of
balancing external debt service obligations against the need to increase
imports to allow resumption of growth and rehabilitation of the
infrastructure and social sectors. The increase in oil export revenues
following the Gulf crisis will improve Nigeria's financial situation -- but
for 1990, a foreign exchange financing gap before reschedulings in the
order of about US$1 billion is likely to remain. For the meditui term, the
size of any likely windfall income from higher oil prices, even if the Gulf
crisis persists, will be dwarfed by the volume of outstanding "cernal



debt, which currently amounts to US$33 billion. Under current projections
of an average oil price of US$23.80 per barrel in 1991, Nigeria would be
better positioned in that year to deal with the trade-offs between building
reserves, increasing imports, and meeting its debt service obligations.
However, if, as projected, oil prices fall back to around US$19 in 1992 and
beyond, Nigeria's medium-term balance of payments situation is likely to
remain very tight, with a financing gap of roughly US$2 billion annually
expected over the 1992-95 period. If oil prices remain at a high level
longer than projected, the emergence of large balance of payments deficits
may be postponed for one or two years. However, continued pressure on the
balance of payments is inevitable, given the present compression of imports
and investment to levels, in per capita terms, below those of two decades
ago. In these circumstances, significant growth in imports would be well
justified if resources are available.
19.       Should a significant increase in oil revenues eventuate, the
Government is proposing to use the additional resources for four main
purposes. The first is to finance investments in the oil sector to
compensate for significant under-investments in the past and to enable
Nigeria to respond to opportunities in world markets. The second is for
enhanced expenditures on the social sectors, targeted at the poor and other
vulnerable groups, and on physical infrastructure. The third will be to
build up reserves to provide a buffer against future reversals in the
external account. The final use will be to reach a more durable
accommodation with external creditors and to reduce internal indebtedness.
Bank Group Operations in Nigeria
20.       Broadly speaking, Bank operations may be grouped under four
themes, representing the core elements of the Bank's policy dialogue and
assistance program.
(a) Maintaining Structural Adiustment: The Bank's strategy over the
next few years emphasizes consolidation of the substantial gains
made so far, and a deepening of the structural adjustment
process. Considerable progress has been made on trade and
exchange rate reforms, on commercialization and privatization of
public enterprises, and on strengthening systems for monitoring
and control of public spending. A start has been made on
liberalizing the regulatory framework, and initial financial
sector reforms have been initiated. Together with maintaining
sound fiscal and monetary policies, continued and consistent
efforts will be required in each of these areas: to move
towards a more neutral structure of protection with a minimum
bias against exports; to implement commercialization of large
scale parastatals and complete the privatization program; to
further improve the efficiency of financial markets and ensure
the soundness of the financial system; and to increase the
efficiency of public spending. An additional short-term
priority will be to ensure the efficient utilization of any
windfall resulting from the Gulf crisis.



(b) Growths Promoting economic growth will require that domestic
policies are directed toward promoting an appropriate supply
side response. The specific objectives include stimulating
private sector investment, through budgetary restraint to free
up resources, revenue mobilization, and improvements in the
efficiency of the financial sector, as well as improving the
efficiency of public investments in infrastructure and human
resources development. The Bank's program therefore includes
substantial improvements in the physical infrastructure sectors
(transport, power, and telecommunications), and support for the
government's program of privatization and commercialization. In
addition, the Bank will continue to provide substantial direct
support to agriculture and selective interventions in the
industry and energy sectors.
(c) Poverty Alleviation: Towards the objectives of long-term growth
as well as to alleviate poverty and mitigate the social costs of
adjustment, we plan extensive support for programs in the
social, huma:. resources, and agriculture sectors. In addition
to supporting specific project initiatives for health,
education, urban slum improvement, and rural water programs,
Bank assistance will include special initiatives in the cross-
sectoral areas of food security and women in development. In
the latter context, priority areas -- such as women's access to
credit, and their need for literacy and non-formal education
programs -- where action programs need to be initiated hive been
identified. The Bank is also assisting the Government in
establishing a social development fund to earmark potential oil
revenue windfall for priority social sector expenditures.
(d) Long-Term Sustainability: A major priority is to design a
policy framework for population and environment that will
establish the basis for long-term sustainability of improved
living standards. The Bank is preparing a project to provide
significant support to a nation-wide population program, and is
proposing operational assistance to the Government's
environmental initiatives. The Bank will build on its past
efforts to address key environmental issues, including soil
degradation, water resource integrity, and deforestation.
21.       Economic and Sector Work.  A substantial portion of the Bank's
ESW resources has been related to macroeconomic issues and support for the
adjustment program. As Nigeria's reform policies have become more deeply
rooted in the economy, the Bank has been shifting its concentration to
sectoral issues, in particular to the financial sector, population, human
resources, poverty issues such as food security, and the environment. At
the same time, the Bank is continuing its core macroeconomic work, which
includes country economic memorandums targeted at consultative group donors
and public expenditure reviews directed at raising key sectoral issues with
Nigeria's economic management team.
22.       Substantial resources are being allocated to work underway in
helping to assess Nigeria's environmental problems and their impact, and to



- 9 -
develop programs for women and further identify their role in the
development process. The Bank's work will also explore additional
opportunities to encourage and facilitate private sector investment and to
address issues in the public sector on long-term planning and management
issues. The financial sector work will focus on integrated capital market
development, improvements in the credit delivery system, and further
strengthening of the banking sector. We are proposing to deepen and
broaden work more specifically $lated to poverty alleviation, in
particular with regard to health and education, and rural development to
help strengthen local institutional capacity, increase food security, and
expand and improve rural water and road programs. In addition, the Bank
*          proposes to undertake several studies that will help strengthen the
development of selected growth areas: irrigation, energy, and non-oil
exports.
23.       The Lending Proaram.  The Bank is proposing an overall lending
program of about seven projects, totalling US$1.0 billion per year. Given
its status among the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the
relatively limited access Nigeria has had to donor and concessional
financing, the case for continued IDA support is strong. As has been the
case since Nigeria was declared IDA-eligible in 1988, IDA resources would
be expected to play a critical role in galvanizing support both within the
country and from the international donor community for poverty alleviation,
expenditure in the social sectors and dealing with long-term issues of
sustainability, such as population and the environment. However, given the
competing demands for scarce IDA resources, the amounts available for
Nigeria will be very limited relative to the country's needs, and Nigeria
will remain primarily an IBRD borrower.
24.       The proposed lending program assumes continued satisfactory
economic performance, including an appropriate structuring of the public
investment program. Significant progress in improving implementation
performance will remain a key condition for maintaininS the proposed
program.
25.       Implementation problems are being tackled on a number of fronts.
Our policy-based loans have helped to establish and increase the
effectiveness in implementing macro-economic reforms. In each of the major
development areas, the Bank is involved in institutional development and in
supporting manpower planning and training programs. With regard to
improving the very poor processing and implementation performance of Bank
projects, the Government is beginning to act on a series of specific
measures recommended by a Special Presidential Task Force. This work is
being supported and monitored by frequent joint Bank/Government
implementation reviews. In addition, the Bank has substantially increased
its supervision and is introducing measures to facilitate disbursements, in
particular through standardization of procurement documentation and project
and sector workshops. In the short term, results from these efforts are
being closely monitored and the continuation of a large Bank program will
depend on significant improvements. In the longer term, we are exploring
with the Government opportunities for undertaking additional reforms to
reduce bureaucratic layering, mobilize private sector management



- 10 -
capabilities and to address difficulties arising from Nigeria's system of
highly centralized decision-making.
26.       In the past four years, the Bank's lending program has been
dominated by large adjustment loans, starting with the US$452 million Trade
Policy and Export Development Loan, approved in September 1986 (Table 1).
A second policy-based loan, the US$500 million Trade and Investment Policy
Loan, was approved by the Bank Board in December 1988. These very large
loans, which covered a wide range of policy areas and often amounted to
over 50 percent of the lending program, were necessary to meet the
country's balance of payments needs at that time and to mobilize donor
support. We are currently preparing with the Government a program of
public enterprise and financial sector reforms, as well as actions to
deepen progress on the agenda addressed by the first two structural
adjustment loans. A number of issues remain to be resolved before an
operation supporting this program can be presented to the Board. In view
of the present circumstances, we are also discussing with the Government
the possibility of supporting the program with a series of smaller sector
loans instead of a single large adjustment loan.

27.       In the future, therefore, the lending program will shift to
smaller sector loans and a re-emphasis on basic sector investment
operations that address systemic issues. Agriculture will continue to
account for about 20 percent of lending, concentrated on groundwater
development; improved rural infrastructure; increased livestock production;
institutional reforms to rationalize organizational structures, the
introduction of cost recovery, the transfer of input distribution to the
private sector; and developing a strong extension and adaptive research
program. The lending program includes a number of projects in power,
transportation, water, and telecommunications -- areas where improvements



- 11 -
are essential to support private sector growth. This assistance accounts
for about 40 percent of our lending. Investments in energy will be limited
to high priority projects where the Bank can play a catalytic role in
attracting substantial assistance from the international community, such as
in the case of the Oso Condensate project.
28.       In the past few years the Bank has substantially strengthened
its programs in the social sectors, providing assistance to primary health
and essential drugs, and to technical, university, and primary education.
In the future, work is planned on developing more effective information,
communication and education systems in the health and education sectors,
and to support secondary education in particular.
29.       Looking to long run sustainability, the Bank has been assisting
efforts to reduce population growth through the integration of family
planning into primary health care services. These efforts are being
stepped up and broadened with financial and technical support for the
Government's recently developed national population policy. With regard to
environment, a recent environmental assessment report will provide the
basis for developing sector operations, and will lead to an expansion of
Bank assistance to address problems of forest management, deforestation,
soil degradation, and desertification.
30.       Relations with the IMF.  The IMP supported the Government's
adjustment program with stand-by arrangements in 1987 and 1989. The first
arrangement, for SDR650 million, was approved in January 1987, when a
critical mass of the commercial banks had expressed willingness to
participate in the 1986-87 rescheduling package. The second arrangement,
for SDR475 million for the period through April 1990, was approved in
December 1988. No drawings took place under either arrangement. A third
stand-by facility of SDR375 million is being prepared for IMF Board
approval in December 1990.
31.       The collaboration between Bank and Fund staff has intensified
with substantial informal joint work on the balance of payments and basic
macroeconomic data, and with support provided by the Fund in the
development of financial sector reforms. Fund and Bank staff will continue
to share infermation and to coordinate actions and recommendations.
32.       Aid Coordination and Cofinancing.   Since the Nigerian
Government embarked on the structural adjustment program in 1986, the Bank
has been the focal point of aid coordination and cofinancing operations.
The IDA eligibility granted to Nigeria in 1988 helped to lead the
international community to form a Consultative Group (CG) which met for the
first time in November 1989. Although the main purpose of the group was to
mobilize balance-of-payments support for 1990, follow-up discussions among
the donors and the government also focused on the three year public
investment plan and the selection of projects for the plan. This CG
meeting was preceded by two informal donors meetings in January and
September 1989, which discussed extensively government performance under
the program. Future CG assistance will be used primarily to finance key
investment areas, including the social sectors and environment. The Bank
has also been instrumental in organizing the two ECAs meetings on Nigeria



- 12 -
under the sponsorship of OECD. Recent Bank projects have been successful
in obtaining substantial amount of cofinancing; for example, about US$315
million in cofinancing was obtained for the second Bank structural
adjustment loan.
Summary Assessment
33.       The measures taken thus far as part of Nigeria's Structural
Adjustment Program have reduced earlier macroeconomic imbalances and some
of the grave distortions in the incentives framework. While far-reaching
and courageous, they nevertheless represent only the beginning of a long
journey of continuous reform to address the severe structural and
institutional problems left as a legacy of past policies. In addressing
these issues, the Government will be constrained by a huge debt overhang
and fragile popular support for the reform program. The size and
durability of the oil revenue windfall resulting from the Gulf crisis
remains uncertain and will not change the fundamental economic conditions
of the country; per capita income would remain among the lowest in the
world, and the external financing outlook over the medium term will remain
very constrained. The scheduled transfer to a civilian government in 1992
creates an additional uncertainty, which influences private sector
investment response to measures already taken. For the program to survive
the transfer of government, the challenge will be to consolidate and build
further on the gains made so far while establishing a broader constituency
for reform by increasing economic growth.
34.       The Bank's strategy over the next few years emphasizes
consolidation of the substantial gains made thus far with support for
further reform measures. Future lending is expected to shift from large
adjustment loans to sectoral reform operations. In our investment lending,
our focus will shift increasingly toward social sectors, physical
infrastructure, and the environment with a strong underlying objective to
alleviate poverty. Efforts to mobilize support from donor countries for
lending to these sectors will be a high priority in which a continued flow
of IDA resources will play a critical role.
35.       The Bank's support will depend on the continued satisfactory
implementation of the reform program. Criteria by which performance would
be judged include maintenance of sound macroeconomic policies, in
particular: a market-determined exchange rate; improved management of
public expenditure, especially redirection of the public investment program
to reflect priority economic and social needs; continued progress in the
privatization and commercialization of public enterprises; financial sector
restructuring; and significant progress in improving the implementation
capacity at all levels of government.
II. The Proposed Credit
36.       The proposed credit, which would be on standard IDA terms with
35 years maturity, would help finance a primary education project. A grant
of US$4.0 million equivalent from the Government of Japan would contribute
towards the financing of the project.

37.       Background.  Primary education in Nigeria is under-financed and
badly managed. Infrastructure provision has lagged behind enrollments;
existing buildings are too few and badly maintained; schools are
understaffed; there are few books and other instructional materials;
administrative and professional quality controls hardly exist; management
is inefficient; and the data base for planning purposes is weak. Regional
and gender imbalances in enrollment persist, while overall enrollment rates
have declined from 92 percent in 1982 to 67 percent in 1988.
38.       The Government is aware of these problems and has begun to
rectify the situation. In August 1988 it simultaneously established the
National Primary Education Commission (NPEC) and the National Primary
Education Fund (NPEF). The NPEC, which is under the supervision of the
Federal Ministry of Education, has broad-ranging powers to effect
improvements in primary education. Over the past year, it has managed the
allocation and disbursement of the NPEF effectively and efficiently, and
has made impressive progress in motivating efforts to rehabilitate the
primary education system at the state and local levels. It has developed a
five-year action program to improve primary education through safeguarding
staff salaries, rehabilitating infrastructure, providing textbooks,
supplementary materials and essential school supplies, upgrading personnel
skills, improving data collection and management and establishing a
monitoring and evaluation scheme.  There is, however, a shortfall in the
resources available for the implementation of this program over the next
few years.
39.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Many of the initiatives being
pursued by the NPEC were developed in consultation with the Bank during the
course of preparing the sector report, Nigeria: Primary Education
Subsector Study (No. 7389-UNI, June 30, 1989). The proposed credit would
provide timely support to the Government in maintaining the momentum of
these initiatives, and would help finance the resource gap envisaged in
implementing NPEC's action program over the next five years. It would
ensure that a large quantity of educational materials of acceptable quality
be made available very quickly to primary school children. Bank
involvement in the project would also help to strengthen institutional
capabilities -- especially in the areas of planning, project management,
information systems, research, and monitoring and evaluation -- which are
essential to effecting permanent improvements in the primary school system.
40.       Proiect Obiectives.  The overall aim of the proposed project is
to help the Government improve primary education. In particular, the
project would aim towards (a) upgrading the quality of primary education
through the provision of books and other instructional materials and
improvements in curriculum delivery; (b) ensuring sustainable financing
through adequate government funding supplemented by cost sharing and cost
recovery schemes; (c) increasing enrollments through media campaigns; (d)
strengthening institutions through training, technical assistance and the
provision of necessary equipment and vehicles; and (e) facilitating future
planning through improvements in information management systems, staff
training, research programs, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.

41.       Project Description.  The proposed project would:  (a) provide
books and supplementary materials to primary school children, and training
to ensure their effective use and conservation; (b) ensure that measures be
taken to maintain funding for primary education at adequate levels,
including budgetary provisions for non-salaried items, introduction of cost
sharing and cost recovery mechanisms, and establishment of a revolving fund
for textbook renewal (RFTR); (c) provide training of classroom teachers,
headteachers, administrators and inspectors to improve curriculum delivery
and training of administrative, finance, statistics and planning personnel
to help strengthen institutions responsible for managing and implementing
primary education programs; (d) provide fellowships, short-term
consultancies and technical assistance in procurement, accountancy, project
evaluation and related fields; (e) provide necessary equipment and vehicles
to help the relevant institutions function effectively and be able to
conduct an intensified media campaign on primary education; and (f) help
install management information systems at the NPEC and the state Primary
School Management Boards (SPSMBs), develop a program of coordinated action-
oriented research that would form the basis for development plans and
policy in the subsector, and implement a structured monitoring and
evaluation scheme to ensure that resources are efficiently utilized. The
total cost of the project is estimated at US$158.4 million equivalent
(including duties and taxes), with a foreign exchange component of US$101.2
million (64 percent). The IDA credit (US$120.0 million equivalent) would
finance 78.1 percent of project costs net of duties and taxes, estimated to
be US$4.7 million equivalent. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Nigeria are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is included at the end of
this memorandum. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8714-UNI, dated November
20, 1990, is also attached.
42.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following
actions: (a) provide in its budgets amounts sufficient to cover its
counterpart contributions to the costs of the project, and accordingly
replenish the project account each quarter; (b) prepare and furnish to the
Association for its review, by September 30 each year, a detailed statement
of the expenditures proposed under the project for the following year;
(c) establish not later than December 31, 1991, an RFTR account in a
commercial or merchant bank; (d) not later than three years after the date
of credit effectiveness carry out jointly with the Association a mid-term
review of the project, and prior to that review, prepare and furnish to the
Association all relevant documents showing progress attained in carrying
out the objectives of the project; (e) require SPSMBs and Local Government
Education Authorities (LGEAs) to prepare annual action plans on the basis
of school-based budgeting, including income and expenditure projections;
(f) prepare and furnish to the Association by January 1, 1994, the norms,
standards and specifications to be used in the selection of primary school
equipment and facilities; (g) prepare and furnish to the Association by
January 1, 1994, a set of enrollment projections to serve as a basis for
educational planning by NPEC for the period ending on December 31, 2000;
(h) prepare and furnish to the Association by project completion the norms
and standards to be applied in assessing pupil achievement in grades three



- 15 -
and five of primary schools; (i) require SPSMBs and LGEAs to integrate on-
the-job in-service training into the work program of primary school
teachers and supervisors, and prior to the mid-term review, prepare and
furnish to the Association plans for accomplishing such integration; and
(j) encourage LGRAs to include library periods in school timetables within
their areas of jurisdiction. The conditions of credit effectiveness are:
(a) NPEC has furnished to the Association details of the means to be used
to monitor and evaluate progress of the project; (b) NPEC has furnished to
the Association satisfactory plans for book distribution by LGEAs to the
schools; (c) NPEC has furnished to the Association satisfactory master
plans (including cost estimates of such plans) designed for use by the
states to upgrade the skills of inspectors, headteachers and classroom
teachers; (d) NPEC has awarded contracts for master trainers' courses; and
(e) NPEC has opened a project account with an initial deposit of N2
million.
43.       Benefits.  The potential benefits of the proposed project would
be far reaching and cost effective. In the short term it would reinforce
government commitment in the subsector and help ensure adequate funaing for
primary education throughout the country. Over the longer term successful
implementation of the project would result in permanent and continuing
improvements in terms of: (a) more books and instructional materials being
available to pupils and teachers; (b) improved teaching: (c) substantial
learning gains; (d) increased enrollments and fewer dropouts; (e) more
efficient quality control and management; (f) more reliable statistics and
better planning; (g) productivity and efficiency gains; (h) ongoing project
development to continue improvements; and (i) higher sustained level of
funding.
44.       Risks.  The two major risks are mismanagement during the project
and lack of sustainability after project completion. The first risk is
being minimized by actions -- some already initiated by NPEC -- to improve
accountability, competence and funding and by strengthening institutions to
fulfil their functions more effectively. The second is being addressed by
the creation of the RFTR to receive government's counterpart contributions
for grant-aided paper and parental contributions for book use. The
proposed project would also support sustained budgetary allocations to
teaching materials that are essential to boosting student achievement,
maintenance of existing buildings, and personnel training to upgrade
skills.
45.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
