PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
IVORY COAST - FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LN. 1161-IVC)
PREFACE
This report presents a completion evaluation by the Western Africa
Region of the Fifth Highway Project in Ivory Coast for which Loan 1161-IVC
in the amount of US$43.0 million was closed, fully disbursed in May 1982.
It is based on project files and discussions with staff; no special mission
took place for the report. A combined project performance audit report for
the Second, Third and Fourth Highway Projects in Ivory Coast was issued
in November 1981 (Report No. 3665). The projects resulted in upgrading
of three sections of main roads, initiated reforms in the administration of
road maintenance and betterment operations, and produced preinvestment
studies which provided the basis for further Bank lending operations.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower; however, no comments were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
IVORY COAST - FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LN. 1161-IVC)
HIGHLIGHTS
The main purpose of the Fifth Highway Project was to continue
upgrading the road network, through strengthening and new construction of
paved roads, and to strengthen the institutional capacity for adequate
planning through establishment of a planning unit, studies and fellowships,
and procurement of some equipment. Overall, the Project was successful, and
with some reallocations to more road construction, was completed with only
a 3% cost overryn. The investment is now expected to have a 15% economic
return, which is adequate but lower than the 19% expected at appraisal
as overall adverse economic conditions have reduced traffic or slowed
its growth. Institutional development could, as always, have been better,
but can be considered fair and is being pursued under the ongoing Highway
Sector Loan. There does not appear to be any special feature to highlight.

F?IFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
LOAN 1161-IVC
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The subject of this report, the Fifth Highway Project, was the sixth
in line in the transport sector in the Ivory Coast. The first project, for
railway motive power, was approved in 1954 prior to Independence. It was
followed in 1968 by the First Highway Project, Loan 542-IVC. A UNDP-financed
Transport Survey of the Ivory Coast, conducted concurrently and for which the
Bank was executing agent, recommended an extensive program of primary road im-
provements, improved road maintenance and the development of a better invest-
ment policy. The Survey also included feasibility studies for the highest
priority roads and a study of highway administration and maintenance. The
basis for subsequent highway projects was provided by these studies, together
with the ones carried out under the First Highway Project (PCR rev.,
September 1976).
1.02     The Second Highway Project which was approved in 1971 (Ln 761-IVC),
provided for road construction (PCR rev., March 1981). The Third Highway
Project, following in 1972 (Ln 837-IVC), focused on maintenance, providing for
(a) a four-year maintenance and betterment program; (b) strengthening of 110
km of paved roads; and (c) bridge reconstruction. Although components (b) and
(c) were completed sucessfully, only about 50% of the maintenance program was
completed because of higher than anticipated costs. Overall, the project was
considered a success in winning Government support for the maintenance pro-
gram, and its expansion in t:he future, and for the establishment of a depart-
ment responsible for periodic road maintenance (PRC rev., March 1981). The
Fourth Highway Project, presented in 1972 (Cr. 406-IVC, US$7.5 million), was
relatively small. The main component, construction of the 70 km Yabayo-Gagnoa
Road, cost more than double the appraisal estimate due to Government's modifi-
cation of standards, an unusually long contract period and a one-year delay in
completion (PCR rev., March 1981). The Fifth Highway Project, was presented
to the Board in 1975.
1.03     During the 1965-75 decade when the five highway projects were pre-
pared/implemented, economic growth in the Ivory Coast was impressive despite
extreme fluctuations in world market prices for primary commodities. To sus-
tain this growth, the Government had embarked on a program of economic diver-
sification, especially in the agricultural sector. The success of this effort
was dependent on the availability of reliable and efficient transport. The
Government was also aiming to achieve a more even distribution of income among
various segments of the population by spreading the fruits of development to



-2-
the interior. New and better roads were expected to result in cheaper, safer,
and more reliable transport for part of the rural population.
1.04     The information for this report was obtained from the Appraisal and
President's Reports of a Fifth Highway Project (Report Numbers 750a-IVC of
July 31, 1975 and P-1680-IVC of August 7, 1975 respectively), the Loan Agree-
ment, supervision reports, Bank files and discussions with staff members.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Identification and Preparation
2.01     The UNDP Transport Survey had identified a program for pavement
strengthening of major trunk roads linking Abidjan with the economically
active regions in the north and west. These roads were built between 1957-63
with light pavements which began to fail under increasing traffic volumes.
The Department of Public Works (DPW) attempted to repair the roads through
normal maintenance operations, but this was costly and only a short-term
solution, as proved by the rapid pavement deterioration which later occur-
red. A more radical treatment was required to extend the service life of the
pavements. The works proposed by the consultants and agreed upon with the
Government and the Bank therefore consisted in reinforcing pavement edges,
reconstructing the base and bituminous surface courses on the most deterio-
rated sections, and providing a bituminous overlay on sections still in rela-
tively good condition. A first phase of the strengthening program was exe-
cuted under the Third Highway Project. Another phase of 200 km was proposed
for execution under the Fifth Highway Project.
2.02     The construction part of the project was prepared by consultants
under the First Highway Project, while a second firm of consultants reviewed
the recommended alignment and design standards with a view to reducing costs.
2.03     One of the principal institution-building recommendations of the UNDP
Transport Survey involved the establishment of a Planning and Research Unit in
the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) to make proposals to the
Minister on investment priorities, and to coordinate investments with general
policy, particularly concerning the modal split between road and rail in the
north-south corridor. The Unit would also serve as a liaison between the
Ministries of Public Works and Planning. In addition, it was considered
necessary to update the knowledge of secondary and feeder road requirements,
as well as engineering and technical manpower requirements for both private
and public sectors.
Appraisal
2.04     The project was appraised in May/June 1974.   In the Issues Paper
dated June 28, 1974, the mission indicated that while most of the highway in-
vestments completed or underway were in line with the UNDP Transport Survey as
agreed with the Bank Group, recent decisions by the Government represented a
significant departure from this policy. These involved plans to construct an



- 3 -
economically unjustifiable expressway, double the capacity of a two-lane
bridge already under construction, and construct a major road by a contractor
selected without competitive bidding, who would do the detailed design in the
course of execution. The mission also raised issues concerning delays pro-
posed by the Government in setting up the Planning and Research Unit within
the MPWT until Ivorian personnel were available to staff it, and the financing
of cost overruns. The above issues were satisfactorily resolved in subsequent
meetings with the Government.
Loan Negotiations
2.05     During negotiations, one year after appraisal, it was agreed that:
(a) an updating of the UNDP Transport Study would not be included in the pro-
ject as recommended by the appraisal mission and that UNDP financing would be
requested; and (b) a study for the reorganization of the National Soils
Laboratory would be added to the project. The final appraisal cost estimate
was more than double that proposed at the time of the Issues Paper. The
reasons included some increase in project scope, upgrading of design stan-
dards, a revision in the CFAF exchange rate, and the application of higher
inflation rates than proposed earlier. The project was approved by the Board
on August 21, 1975; there were no major comments. The Loan was signed on
September 5 and became effective on November 4, 1975.
Project Description
2.06     During negotiations, the Bank and the Government agreed to the
following project:
Part A  Strengthening the pavement of about 200 km of roads between
Pakobo-Toumodi, Toumodi-Yamoussoukro, N'Douci-Divo, Divo-Lakota
and Lakota-Gagnoa;
Part B  Realignment of a 27 km section of the Azaguie-Adzope Road, and
construction of the Anyama-Agboville Road (about 45 km);
Part C  Purchase and utilization of equipment for traffic counting,
vehicle weight control and pavement surveys;
Part D  Establishment of a planning and research unit within MPWT;
Part E  Provision of fellowships for the training of MPWT staff;
Part F  1. Feasibility studies and detailed engineering for the
Mankono-Tenigboue Road (about 66km), and for about 300 km of
secondary roads determined by the Borrower on the basis of the
findings of the Transport Plan Study and which the Bank agrees
to finance;
2. Study to determine the Borrower's feeder road requirements
including institutional arrangements for administration of
feeder roads;



-4-
3. Study to determine:
(a) total manpower requirements for civil engineers and other
technicians in both private and public construction sectors;
(b) the measures needed to fulfill such manpower requirements;
(c) the capacity of the civil engineering school in Abidjan to
meet such manpower requirements;
(d) improvements needed in the curriculum of such school to
achieve adequate level of instruction; and
(e) housing and equipment requirements of such school.
4. Study on the reorganization of the National Soils Laboratory of
MPWT.
2.07     Pavement Strengthening and Road Construction.   Two road sections
totalling about 200 km were to be strengthened: Pakobo-Yamoussoukro on the
north/south axis and N'Douci-Gagnoa on the road from Abidjan to the west of
the country. The link from Abidjan to the northeast region near the Ghanaian
border was a paved road through Adzope, of which the 70 km section
Agnibilekrou-Abengourou was built to a two-lane standard under the First
Highway Project. The Azaguie-Adzope section of the road was one lane, badly
deteriorated, and had some tortuous curves. Studies had indicated that the
most economic route from Abidjan to Abengourou should also serve Agboville, a
city of increasing economic importance, which was connected to the capital by
a poorly aligned earth road to Azaguie (42 km) continued by a one-lane paved
road (7.5 km) to the junction with Abidjan-Adzope, 16 km from Anyama. The
project provided for the construction of a more direct alignment from Anyama
to Agboville (45 km), reducing the distance by about 20 km, and for a 27 km
section starting 8 km from Anyama in the direction of Adzope, in accordance
with feasibility studies prepared under the First Highway Project.
2.08     Equipment Purchases.  To help the Engineering Division of DPW collect
and analyze information concerning traffic, and the use and condition of the
roads, the project provided for the purchase of traffic counters, mobile
scales, and other equipment. Such information was intended to provide a basis
for preparing annual maintenance and betterment programsv and for planning and
research.
2.09     Technical Assistance.  An important institution-building recommenda-
tion of the Transport Survey was the establishment of a Planning and Research
Unit in the MPWT, to make proposals for investment priorities and to coordi-
nate the various transport modes. The project provided for the services of
two technical assistance experts over a three-year period to establish the
unit and train local staff. To reduce the acute shortage of technically skil-
led personnel, the project provided for technical assistance to study manpower
requirements for civil engineers and other skilled workers in the private and
public construction sectors and measures needed to produce the required



- 5 -
personnel and help alleviate the shortage of high and middle-level local
personnel in DPW; the project also provided for overseas fellowships for
training highway engineers and technicians beginning in 1976. To cope with
the increasing demand for the services of the National Soils Laboratory, reor-
ganization of the Laboratory had become necessary and a study for this purpose
was included in the project.
2.10     Pre-investment Studies.   The project provided for a feasibility study
of one of the most important secondary roads in the north, although then only
a mere track (Mankono-Tenigboue--66 km), to determine the most suitable stan-
dards and alignment for itr, improvement. It also provided for economic and
feasibility studies and detailed engineering of about 300 km of secondary
roads, to be selected upon the completion of the updating of the 1969 UNDP
Transport Study, and for a feeder road study.
Project Cost
2.11     Estimated dates and costs for project execution are shown in
Table 1. The total project cost was estimated at US$69 million, of which
US$43 million was in foreign exchange and US$26 million local costs, including
US$13.4 million equivalent in taxes. The Bank Loan of US$43 million was to
cover the estimated foreign exchange cost, and represented 62% of total cost
or 77% net of taxes. The cost of civil works was estimated on the basis of
the detailed engineering estimates and adjusted to reflect bid results for
similar works in 1974. The physical contingency was 10% for civil works.
Price contingencies for both local and foreign costs were calculated to take
into account the following inflation rates: (a) for construction items 16% in
1975, 14% in 1976 and 12% annually thereafter; and (b) for other items--12% in
1975, 10% in 1976 and 8% annually thereafter.
Execution and Procurement
2.12     The MPWT was to be responsible for execution of the project, assisted
by consultants for construction supervision, technical assistance, and feasi-
bility and detailed engineering studies. Procurement was to be on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guide-
lines. Bidding documents for civil works had been prepared by DPW assisted by
the consultants with the works divided into two packages -- pavement streng-
thening and new construction; each package was divided into separate contracts
for the supplying of crushed stone and for construction. Bids for the con-
struction of the Anyama-Agboville and Azaguie-Adzope Roads were to be called
only after the review of design standards by the consultants had been com-
pleted and standards were in accordance with those indicated in Schedule 5 of
the Loan Agreement.
Disbursements
2.13     The Bank Loan was to be disbursed as follows:   60% of expenditures
for civil work contracts,, 80% of expenditures for consulting services and
technical assistance, and 100% of the foreign cost of equipment and fellow-
ships. The schedule of disbursements is shown as Table 2; June 30, 1979 was
the original closing date.



-6-
Important Covenants
2.14     The Loan Agreement contained a number of covenants which were impor-
tant to the sector and inter alia anticipated institutional development which
would provide a framework for sector lending:
(a)   the establishment of a planning and research unit by June 30,
1976, with the responsibility to prepare proposals for the
elaboration of general policy in the transport sector, and to
coordinate the carrying out of such a policy, and assignment of
qualified staff (Section 3.04 (a), (b));
(b)   Bank review and comment on proposed investment plans and modi-
fications thereto and, annually, on the provisions of the draft
Loi-Programme (the law whereby the Five-Year Plan is annually
updated) relating to the transport sector (Section 4.04);
(c)   updating of the Transport Plan for 1976-84, by December 31,
1976 (Section 4.05);
(d)   Bank review and comment, by December 31, 1976, on the recom-
mendations to be made in the road user tax study and the
program of action on such recommendations, and its prompt
implementation (Section 4.07).
2.15     The Agreement also foresaw that the consultants were to prepare the
feeder road program in small bid packages to allow local contractors to
execute such works (Section 3.03).
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     The placing of contracts for pavement strengthening and for road
construction proceeded expeditiously and by mid-1976 all had been awarded or
committed. The construction parts were satisfactorily completed, although the
construction component experienced some delay and a cost overrun. Only poor
results were achieved in institution building, but good results were achieved
in reorganizing the National Soils Laboratory and in encouraging DPW's adop-
tion of the quantitative methods of measuring in-situ pavement strength, thus
providing a basis for determining strengthening needs.
Pavement Strengthening
3.02     The contract for pavement strengthening was awarded after interna-
tional competitive bidding to a joint French/Ivorian venture, while another
French firm was given a separate contract for supplying the aggregates for
concrete and paving works. A French consulting firm was awarded the contract
for construction supervision. Work commenced in March 1976 and was satis-
factorily completed in November 1978, on schedule and without undue problems.
3.03     The original contract was amended at the outset, without the know-
ledge of the Bank, to include the construction of a four-lane, 11 km



expressway between N'Zi and Singrobo Hill, forming part of the Abidjan-
Yamoussoukro Expressway. The Government wanted the Bank to finance this work
but the Bank objected, not only on the grounds of violation of the Loan
Agreement but also because the expected traffic did not justify four lanes.
The Government eventually financed the expressway itself.
3.04     Two developments in conjunction with the road strengthening work are
of particular interest: one, a useful compromise was reached on shoulder
width and the other, the savings realized on overall road costs by strengthen-
ing pavements before they became seriously damaged. In the course of streng-
thening, pavements had been widened from about 6 m to a standard width of
6.7-7 m, so as to accommodate oversized commercial vehicles including 2.6 m
wide timber trucks which use the roads. This widening was accomplished within
the existing formation width which is normally between 9 and 9.5 m and the
width of the shoulders was thereby reduced to between 1 and 1.5 m. Through
villages, a paved strip about 2.5 m wide was provided on each side of the
strengthened pavement to provide space for parking and other roadside activi-
ties which would otherwise encroach on the roadway. It is apparent that the
decision to widen the pavement width from 6 m to 7 m was sound.
3.05     Considerable savings were realized by the timely strengthening works
which avoided a much heavier expenditure later, in repairing or replacing
pavements that would have been badly damaged by traffic. A further feature
was that the thickness of the strengthening layers was determined after a
deflection survey undertaken by consultants showed that, in some places, the
thickness of strengtheninlg layers needed was less than originally expected.
Subsequently, the MPWT acquired a deflectograph which is employed to measure
and record the strength of all paved roads and thus to indicate when and by
how much the bituminous pavements in the road network need to be strengthened.
3.06     The actual cost in dollars was US$3 million less than the appraisal
estimate including contingencies because dollar appreciation from CFAF 200 to
CFAF 250 more than compensated for the CFAF cost increase, and 11 km were
excluded from the project (para. 3.03).
Construction of the Anyama-Agboville and Azaguie-Adzope Roads
3.07     The contract for construction was awarded to the same French/Ivorian
joint venture that obtained the pavement strengthening contract, with a se-
parate contract for the supply of aggregates awarded to SONAGECI, a Govern-
ment-owned company.  A German/Ivorian consultant group was awarded the con-
tract for construction supervision. The main contract included provision for
a 20 km extension of the project road, Anyama to Niangom (towards Abidjan),
which was not included in the Loan Agreement.
3.08     Construction began in February 1976.   During the rainy season in May-
June, culverts, which had been constructed on a 10 km section on which earth
works had been completed, could not handle the high flows and it was apparent
the culvert capacity was undersized. Additional culverts were consequently
constructed on this section, and larger culverts were used for the remaining



- 8 -
section. At the suggestion of the supervising consultants, a sub-base course
was added on some road sections because of the lower than anticipated quality
of the existing soils material.
3.09     The most serious problem which arose was the delay in the supply of
aggregates by SONAGECI, on which the progress on placing the base and surface
courses was contingent. By the end of 1976, the supply of aggregates was
three months behind schedule due to the difficulty in finding adequate quarry
sites and the slow mobilization of crushing equipment. By March 1977, this
had been corrected but the Government then diverted the output of the quarry
to reconstruction of the Abidjan Airport Expressway. The supplying of crushed
rock from the quarry to the project was resumed in early 1978, but more slowly
than required. It may be pointed out that subsequently SONAGECI went
bankrupt.
3.10     The job was finally completed in April 1979, seven months behind
schedule and at a cost about 10% above the dollar appraisal estimate, and 39%
above the CFAF estimate. The 20 km Anyama-Niangom section, (para. 3.07) was
also financed with the loan balance.
Planning and Research Unit
3.11     The new law which provided for the unit to be incorporated into the
Ministry was formulated in December 1976, but it was not until October 1978
that the unit, called the Road Planning Unit, was created within the National
Bureau of Transport Studies. The two-year delay was due to slowness in the
Government, the need to prepare terms of reference for the unit, and to diffi-
culties in recruiting expertise. At the Government's request, the Bank pre-
pared a comprehensive TOR in September 1976. However, difficulties were ex-
perienced in staffing the unit and an expatriate transport expert was not
hired until 1978, followed by an Ivorian economist and an expatriate economist
in 1980. Also, only one economist took advantage of the scholarship component
and studied abroad for a year. Above all, the Government was ambivalent about
the desirability of the unit and reluctant to take action.
3.12     Once organized, the research unit prepared proposals on transport
policy, supervised a railroad coordination study, updated vehicle operating
costs and elaborated the transport component of the five-year plan. Much of
this activity was, however, in conjunction with the then proposed Highway
Sector Loan. However, following the national elections in November 1980,
there was a Government reorganization in which the MPWT was split, with its
Construction and Urbanism Departments being established as a new Ministry, and
the unit was attached to the latter. Discussions are underway under the
Sector Loan to re-establish planning capacity in MPWT.
Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering
3.13     Inasmuch as funding for the updating of the UNDP Transport Study was
not forthcoming from the UNDP (para. 2.05), this work was included under the
project and cost US$600,000. The updating was completed early in 1977 and the



- 9 -
results indicated that improvement of the Mankono-Tenigboue Road would have an
economic rate of return of about 5%. In view of the prospective poor return,
the Government and Bank agreed not to proceed with the detailed study of this
road which was a project component, notwithstanding that proposals had been
invited.
3.14     The Government short-listed consultants in December 1976 for feasi-
bility studies of 300 km of secondary roads to be selected from the updated
UNDP Transport Sector Survey. Four roads were selected late in 1977 and
proposals from consultants were invited. However, in 1979, the Government
decided not to proceed with the feasibility studies. Instead, with the
agreement of the Bank, it decided to use the funds to carry out a feasibility
study and detailed engineering for the rehabilitation of about 350 km of paved
roads which were deteriorating rapidly, including Man-Issia (220 km),
Akoupe-Abengourou (68 km) and Akoupe-Boungouanou (58 km), employing a French
firm for this purpose. In fact, with the agreement of the Bank, by the end of
1979 the funds for the above work were being expended by the consultants to
subcontract laboratory tests and geotechnical surveys on the roads selected
for the first tranche of the proposed Highway Sector Loan.
3.15     A study of feeder road requirements was completed in December 1976
and served as a basis for a Feeder Road Project (Loan 1501-IVC) which was
signed in December 1977. Government executed some of the studies with its own
staff, thus reducing considerably the need for financing under the Loan; the
total cost of studies under the project was US$1.2 million, as compared to an
expected US$4.6 million.
Study of Technical Education
3.16     In August 1976, the same French consulting firm, which did the feeder
road study, completed satisfactorily studies on manpower requirements for
technical personnel in the construction sector and ways to improve the cur-
riculum of the local civil engineering school.
Study of the National Soils Laboratory
3.17     A study on the reorganization of the National Soils Laboratory in-
cluding provision of soils testing equipment was carried out by the same
French consultant. Following the study recommendations, the staffing of the
Laboratory was reinforced by technical assistance provided by France, which
also provided a catalog of soil characteristics, road-making materials, and
designs and construction techniques of pavements appropriate to the Ivory
Coast. The Laboratory is making an increasingly effective contribution to the
planning, design and execution of road works in the Ivory Coast and has pub-
lished a series of manuals to guide road designers and builders.
Procurement of Equipment
3.18     Despite the fact that the Loan Agreement, Exhibit 1, listed the
equipment to be ordered, a new list was agreed in mid-1978, following consul-
tant recommendations. This list called for substantially higher costs, and to



- 10 -
accommodate this need the Loan Agreement was amended on August 10, 1979 to
reduce the allocation for technical assistance and increase it for equip-
ment. In any event, only about 60% of the original allocation was spent,
mainly for traffic counting equipment. The Government processed the procure-
ment documents for other items very slowly and submitted a bid evaluation for
approval in early 1982, too late for financing under the project; it will
eventually finance the estimated US$2 million cost with its own resources.
Project Cost
3.19     The dollar equivalent cost of the project was nearly the appraisal
estimate (US$69 million), while the CFAF cost was about 30% more than the
appraisal estimate, with the caveat that these figures are not strictly com-
parable because of several additions and deletions to the project scope as
noted above. The construction component, which experienced some implementa-
tion delay, accounted for the entire overrun (Table 1).
Procurement and Disbursements
3.20     The contracts for supervising consultants for pavement strengthening
and construction components were both signed without prior review and approval
of the Bank. The Bank considered the level of fees high, but these were
subsequently reduced. Ex-post review indicated that the Bank would have
approved the appointments. The Government gave the Bank an opportunity to
comment on the remaining consultants' contracts.
3.21     As noted in para. 3.03, early in project implementation (unbeknown to
the Bank), the Government added to the pavement strengthening contract about
11 km of four-lane expressway construction. The Government wanted the Bank to
finance it, but the Bank declined. However, disbursement requests, without
reference to corresponding sections of the contract, were submitted by the
Government and were honored by the Bank. It was only in September 1979, near-
ly three years later, that, at the Bank's suggestion and with the intervention
of the Minister of Finance, the situation was straightened out and appropriate
compensation was made in the Bank's loan account.
3.22     Disbursements lagged behind the appraisal estimate by about two years
on average (Table 2). In January 1980, the closing date of June 30, 1979 was
extended to December 1981. Repeatedly, the Bank urged the Government to sub-
mit disbursement requests for the US$3.3 million remaining funds outstanding;
the Government submitted further invoices for the road construction contract,
which were honored, although it meant financing the 20 km Anyama-Niangom sec-
tion which in the meantime had been found justified. The project description
was then amended ex-post to include this component, while the Government would
procure with its own resources the laboratory equipment which was to use the
loan balance but due to delays could not do so. The last withdrawal was made
on May 13, 1982 without extending the closing date; expected and actual
disbursements per loan category are shown in Table 3.



Consultant Performance
3.23     Performance of the three consulting firms engaged under the project
can be considered satisfactory.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
4.01     The Government's obligations under the covenants, which, although
very appropriate were only partially met:   (a) a planning and research unit
was established by the Government more than two years later than agreed and
for practical purposes it no longer exists for transport planning and research
activities (para. 3.12); (b) the provision allowing the Bank to comment, prior
to completion, on proposed investment plans under the annual draft
Loi-Programme was not respected; (c) the UNDP Transport Study was updated and
provided a basis for a transportation plan; and (d) a road user tax study re-
commending changes was completed but the system was not modified, which may
have been appropriate inasmuch as a subsequent study found the former's con-
clusions to be distorted and the charge system quite adequate.
4.02     The project included a substantial institutional development com-
ponent on which only fair success was achieved overall. The Bank's view,
necessarily in the context of the history of lending activities in the Ivory
Coast, continued to be a mixture of optimism and skepticism, measuring the
difficulties over the years surrounding institutional development and micro
(project) and macro (sector and national) planning.
V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.01     At appraisal the overall rate of return of the project was estimated
at 19% based on savings in vehicle operating costs and road maintenance expen-
ditures in the with and without project cases. Using the same approach in the
re-evaluation of the project, and including construction of a 20 km road sec-
tion between Niangom and Anyama, not included at appraisal, the rate of return
is 15% (Table 4).
5.02     All costs and benefits were expressed in 1975 prices.    For the
period 1976 to 1982, act:ual traffic data, derived from the 1975, 1979 and 1982
traffic surveys, were applied. For the remaining life of the investments,
traffic has been assumed to grow at an average rate of 5% per annum, compared
to projected rates at appraisal of between 5% and 9%, based on a more favor-
able economic outlook at the time. Available traffic data allowed the dis-
tinction between four categories of vehicles in the analysis: light vehicles,
buses, light/medium-sized trucks and heavy trucks (Table 5).
Pavement Strengthening Program
5.03     The road sections included in the strengthening program are located
along the two principal north-south and east-west trunk roads carrying traffic
volumes ranging betweea 750 and 1400 vpd in 1975. The strengthening works on



- 12 -
200 km of roads under the project formed the continuation of an initial 95 km
strengthening program executed under the Third Highway Project (Ln 837-IVC).
The objective of the investment was to arrest in a timely manner the progres-
sive pavement deterioration, thereby avoiding the high cost of eventual major
reconstruction and reducing road user operating costs and Government main-
tenance outlays. At the time of appraisal the rate of return on the streng-
thening program was estimated at 15% with rates for individual sections
varying between 13% and 21%.
5.04     Traffic data collected by MPWT in 1979 and 1982 indicate that between
1975-79 traffic grew rapidly (16% p.a. on the N'douci-Yamoussoukro section and
21% p.a. on the N'douci-Lakota-Gagnoa section), but between 1979 and 1982 was
stagnant or significantly declined (2% p.a. on the N'douci-Yamoussoukro
section; 14% p.a. on the N'douci-Lakota-Gagnoa section). This development can
be explained by the slowdown in overall economic activity in recent years. In
the analysis, the "at appraisal" assumed life expectancies of 10 years for the
N'douci-Yamoussoukro section and 20 years for the N'douci-Gagnoa section have
been retained. Maintenance expenditures and vehicle operating costs were
calculated as a function of road condition and traffic levels (Table 6). The
re-evaluated rate of return for the strengthening program is 18%.
Road Construction Program
5.05     The project envisaged reconstruction of the most deteriorated 29 km
of the Anyama-Adzope Road and construction of a new road between Anyama and
Agboville. The Anyama-Adzope Road forms part of the south-northeast axis
linking Abidjan with the economically active eastern part of the country,
reducing the Abidjan-Agboville distance by about 13 km. In 1975 the road
carried about 1,200 vpd. The old connection between Agboville and Anyama
consisted of a circuitous 42 km gravel road and a poor 7.5 km one lane paved
road. Benefits would accrue from reduced vehicle operating costs due to a
distance savings realignment and improved road condition, and maintenance cost
savings. At appraisal the rate of return for the Anyama-Adzope Road was
estimated at 27.8% and for the Anyama-Agboville Road at 21.9%.
5.06     Traffic counts by MPWT in 1982 showed that traffic on the two roads
fell below appraisal expectations in line with the country's overall decline
in traffic growth trends. Between 1975 and 1982 traffic increased only by
about 1% per annum on the Anyama-Adzope Road and by about 5% p.a. on the
Anyama-Agboville Road. For the re-evaluation, the above actual growth rates
have been retained and from 1983 until the end of the expected 20 year eco-
nomic life of the roads, a growth rate of 5% p.a. was applied. The reesti-
mated rate of return for the two roads combined is about 13%, compared to 25%
at appraisal. The decrease is primarily due to lower traffic levels and
higher construction costs.
5.07     A new road link of 20 km between Anyama and the western part of
Abidjan, parallel to an existing road from Anyama to the eastern part of
Abidjan was in the end added to the project. The new road section diverts
traffic away from the existing Anyama-Abidjan Road which over a 6.5 km stretch
follows a poor alignment, has a badly deteriorated pavement, and passes



- 13 -
through a densely populated area with an inadequate right of way, but which is
slightly shorter for some traffic. MPWT traffic counts in 1982 at two loca-
tions on the new road give levels of 2,130 vpd and 1,450 vpd, and on the old
road, of 5,080 vpd. Assuming average traffic growth of 5% per annum, ex-post
evaluation of the additional investment, quantifying benefits accruing to the
new road from lower vehicle operating costs due to better pavement condition,
reduced congestion and distance savings for traffic destined or originating in
the western part of Abidjan, give a rate of return of 14%.
VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE BANK
The Government
6.01     The infrastructure components were satisfactorily implemented with
only minor delays and cost overruns, but the inclusion in the contracts of
major construction additions that were not Bank financed (paras. 3.03-3.06)
was a lack of compliance to the agreement. Progress on institution building
was also limited; especially as the planning unit has been transferred and a
new one should be established.
The Bank
6.02     The Bank's performance on the project level was good and implementa-
tion was well supervised. However, some supervision reports, particularly in
the last years of implementation, did not effectively report on the institu-
tion-building and technical assistance activities. The Bank, in view of the
economic justification of the road section, following the project section,
agreed to finance it with the loan balance and the Loan Agreement was
amended accordingly.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01     Overall, the project was successful.   The pavement strengthening
component was completed on schedule and within the cost estimates, while the
construction component was expanded, and completed with some delay and a cost
overrun. Recalculated after project completion, the economic rates of return
for the two components, 18% and 13% respectively, show that the project was
justified.
7.02     Performance on the institution-building components and covenants was
fair; the institutional impact is difficult to judge and is better assessed in
the context of the stream of highway projects the Bank has assisted in financ-
ing, taken together with other Bank institutional development initiatives and
the fact that following this project a Highway Sector Loan was approved.
