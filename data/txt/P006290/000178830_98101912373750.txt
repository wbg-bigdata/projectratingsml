BRAZIL
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SOUTH-SOUTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
CHAPTER 1
THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The principal source of energy in Brazil is petroleum, which in
1976 accyinted for about 44% of total energy consumption, estimated to be
105 x 10   kcal; 29% of consumption was in the form of wood products and
wastes, 24% was of hydraulic origin and about 3% was in the form of coal
and natural gas.
1.02      Brazil's proven oil reserves are limited.  Present domestic produc-
tion of crude covers only 18% of the country's oil requirements. The country's
main producing fields of oil and natural gas are located in the Northeast
region. To increase domestic production, the Government is accelerating
exploration. To this end, the Government is seeking to attract the participa-
tion of foreign firms in the exploration and possible exploitation of the oil
reserves in certain areas and has already signed several risk contracts.
1.03      Bituminous and sub-bituminous coal reserves, which are located in
the South, are estimated at 3200 million tons. Coal extraction is rather
costly because shaft mining is predominantly required. This notwithstanding,
coal has played an important role in the South, providing base generation
to the power system.
1.04      Brazil is endowed with one of the largest hydro potentials in the
world, estimated at about 150,000 MW of which only about             W have already
been utilized and 30,000 MW more are under construction or are planned to be
installed by 1990. Approximately 50% of the potential is located in the
Southern, Southeastern and Northeastern regions, and has been surveyed in
some detail. The remainder, which has been estimated on the basis of topo-
graphical characteristics, stream flow, and rainfall is located in the Amazon
region. The hydro potential remaining to be used in the South and Southeast
is relatively costly since most of the cheap potential in those areas has
already been used or is in the process of being tapped. Further economic
utilization of these resources would require construction of long transmission
lines and a proportion of non-hydro generating capacity to firm up existing
hydroelectric generating capacity.
1.05      Brazil has a high ratio of electricity consumption to consumption
of commercial fuel. This high ratio is partly due to its warm climate which
eliminates the need for space heating. Another reason is the scarcity and
high price of petroleum products and availability of cheap hydroelectric
power. Brazil's ratio 1/ of 2.0, compared to 1.2 for Argentina, 1.0 for
Mexico, and 0.9 for Venezuela, displays the importance of primary electricity
1/   In kWh of electricity per kg of oil equivalent of all commercial
fuels, excluding that used for power generation.

in supplying the energy requirements of the country. Production of electric
energy, which in 1976 was 88,381 GWh, has increased at a rate of 12. p.a.
from 1970 to 1976; per capita consumption increased during the same period
from 481 to 705 kWh. These data compare with those pertaining to Mexico
(10.5% p.a. growth and 764 kWh per capita in 1976) and Argentina (8% p.a.
growth from 1970 to 1976 and 1,156 kWh per capita in 1975).
1.06      Nuclear power is expected to play a major role in power generation
after 1990. By 1985, about 3,000 MW of nuclear generating capacity is
expected to be in operation in the Southeastern region, the largest demand
center of the country.  The first unit of 600 MW, constructed by Westinghouse
2%1:ov   (USA), is expected to be in operation in 1979.  An additional 2400 MW have
been contracted for under the Brazil-West G`many Nuclear Agreement of
June 27, 1975 which also gives Brazil an option to purchase six additional
1200 MW units.
1.07      Other fuels used include firewood, charcoal and sugar cane bagasse.
Firewood is used only in some small industries and for domestic consumption
in rural areas. Charcoal is used domestically and in blast furnaces and small
steel mills. Sugar cane bagasse is used as fuel to produce steam for the
processing of sugar. The above three fuels now contribute about a quarter of
Brazil's energy but their usage is expected to remain stable and thus they
will represent,a rapidly decreasing proportion of the total.
1.08      Other types of energy are of insignificant importance at the moment.
Known reserves of natural gas are modest, the main producing fields and utili-
zation being located in the Northeast.  Few sites for tidal energy can be
found along the Brazilian coast and there are no known sources of geothermal
energy.
Energy Use in the Southern and Southeastern Regions
1.09      The Southern region, with 18% of Brazil's population, accounted
for about 12% of the total electric energy consumption of the country in 1976.
The Southeastern region, with 42% of the country's population consumed 74%
of the total electric energy in 1976. The two regions, where most of the
country's economic and industrial activities are located have 60% of the
population, and consumed in 1976 about 78% of all energy and 86% of electric
energy. Electric energy consumption in the Southern region has grown at
a rate of 15.2% p.a. in the last five years, while the annual consumption
per capita was about 650 kWh in 1976.  The region's consumption is expected
to grow at an average rate of 12.7% p.a. through 1985 and the per capita
consumption should reach 1,375 kWh by that year. In the Southeastern region,
consumption has been growing at a rate of 11.2% p.a. in the last 5 years,
and consumption per capita was about 1,650 kWh in 1976. Consumption there
is expected to grow at 9.6% p.a. and per capita consumption is expected to
reach 2,700 kWh in 1985.
The Role of the Sector in the Economy
1.10      The provision of an adequate and reliable electric service is
essential for the development of the country's industries, which in 1975
used 55% of all electric energy consumed while accounting for about 39%



- 3 -
of Brazil's GDP, contributing about 35% of export earnings and providing
for about: 33% of all non-agricultural employment. The growth of the energy
sector in general, and its rapidly growing power subsector in particular,
have more than kept pace with Brazil's dynamic economic development. Since
1962 a very good correlation has existed between electric energy consumption
and GDP; the rate of growth of electricity consumption was 1.2 times that of
GDP for the period 1962-1975 while from 1970 to 1975, it was 1.28 times that
of GDP. From 1974 through 1977, electricity consumption grew at about 12% p.a.
while GDP grew at 7% p.a., reflecting a ratio of growth of electricity consump-
tion to GDP growth of 1.7, and a trend for its substitution for other forms of
energy.
History of Bank Group Involvement with Sector
1.11      Since 1949, the Bank has made 30 loans to the Brazilian power sector,
mostly for hydroelectric generation projects in the Southern and Southeastern
regions. This lending has helped strengthen sector organization and planning,
contributed to the building of efficient power enterprises and facilitated
foreign capital inflows to the sector. Bank lending has assisted the Govern-
ment in its efforts to maintain tariff policies that have enabled the sector
to generate a substantial proportion of the funds needed to meet its invest-
ment requirements. Project performance audit reports have been distributed
to the Executive Directors on both power distribution 1/ and generation
projects. 2/ These reports conclude that, despite delays and cost overruns
in their execution, the projects supported by Bank loans were basically
successful.
1.12      The Bank's most recent involvement in financing distribution invest-
ment in Brazil was in the Northeast Power Distribution Project (Loan 1300-BR).
That project consisted of the distribution program of three State-owned North-
eastern utilities. The US$50 million loan was made to Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras S. A. (ELETROBRAS) and relent by that entity to the three utilities.
Besides providing financial support, the project is helping strengthen the
management and planning of the companies.
1.13      The proposed loan, which would be the second operation in the Bank
with ELETROBRAS for the distribution subsector, would seek much the same objec-
tives as the previous one with respect to the two smaller beneficiaries -
Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina S. A. (CELESC) and Espirito Santo Centrais
Eletricas S. A. (ESCELSA) - and would provide valuable financial support to the
larger one - Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais S. A. (CEMIG).
Sector Organization and Regulation
1.14      The Brazilian power sector, though large and complex, is well organized

administrative foundations of the present sector organization were established
by Decree 68,204 dated June 7, 1967. According to this degree, the structure
consists of the National Department of Water and Electric Energy (DNAEE),
ELETROBRAS and the various federal, state, municipal and private concessionaires
all under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).
1.15      DNAEE performs the regulatory functions.  It is a powerful instru-
ment for implementation of national policy as it grants licenses for hydro-
electric sites, assigns concession areas, sets tariffs and approves expansion
plans. However, until recently DNAEE had played a relatively passive role.
In February 1974, through a Ministerial decision, the structure of DNAEE was
expanded for the purposes of allowing it to take a more aggressive and posi-
tive regulatory role. The principal responsibilities of DNAEE remain the
same but the specific activities undertaken by it in meeting those responsi-
bilities have now been considerably enhanced. Some positive results are
already in evidence through its efforts to promote operating and administrative
efficiency wbhen determining which operating costs are recognized as such for
tariff-setting purposes.
1.16      ELETROBRAS (see paras. 2.01-2.09) performs the function of:  (a) a
holding company for those utilities in which the Federal Government has acquired
financial control, (b) a financial institution administering and allocating
public funds among its subsidiaries and electric utilities owned by state
governments and coordinating sector borrowings from abroad, and (c) a coordi-
nating and consulting group with planning functions which assists the develop-
ment of the country's electrification programs by providing technical,
managerial and training services.
1.17      In accordance with government policy, the construction and operation
of the majority of new power generation facilities is entrusted to ELETROBRAS'
four principal subsidiaries. These bulk suppliers are Centrais Eletricas do
Norte do Brasil (ELETRONORTE) covering the North and part of the Center-West;
Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sa'o Francisco (CHESF) covering the Northeast;
Furnas - Centrais Eletricas (FURNAS) covering the Southeast and part of
the Center-West; and Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil (ELETROSUL) covering
the South. A joint Brazilian-Paraguayan entity, Itaipu Binacional, is
responsible for the Itaipu hydroelectric project located on the Parana river
on the border with Paraguay.
1.18      The transmission function in Brazil is presently shared between
the federally-owned bulk suppliers and state-owned utilities. Extra high
voltage transmission (500 kV and above) is for the most part the responsi-
bility of the federal utilities, medium voltage subtransmission (69 to 138 kV)
is largely handled by the state utilities, while responsibility for high
voltage transmission (230 kV) is shared.
1.19      To maximize the economic benefits to the country from operation
of the generating and transmission facilities and to attain the maximum
operating and financial efficiency for the system as a whole, the Federal
Government established in November 1973, regional coordinating groups (Grupos
Coordenadores para Operapgo I5~tegaa-GCOI), in which ELETROBRAS and the



operating utilities participate. The GCOI were charged with coordinating and
directing the operations of the individual generating plants and transmission
systems. There are now two such groups: a large and very well organized group
for the Southeastern and Southern regions (which has become very successful in
directing the operations of the interconnected system) and a smaller group for
the Northeastern region.
1.20      In accordance with government policy, the power distribution
function at the state level is carried out mainly by utilities controlled
by the state governments. In line with this policy, there have been in
recent years a number of acquisitions and mergers of smaller municipally-
and privately-owned distribution companies by state-owned utilities as
well as transfers to them of some of ELETROBRAS' subsidiaries engaged in
distribution. Today, with the exception of the Rio de Janeiro and SaEo
Paulo areas which are served principally by Light - Servi;os de Eletricidade,
S. A. (LIGHT), a privately-owned enterprise, most of the power distribution
is made through one company in each state. The main distribution companies
(those with annual sales over 500 GWh p.a.) are: CESP and CPFL in SAo Paulo,
CEMIG (Minas Gerais), LIGHT (Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo), ESCELSA (Espirito
Santo), CBEE/CELF (Rio de Janeiro), CELG (Goias) and CEB (Brasilia) in the
Southeastern region; COPEL (Parana), CELESC (Santa Catarina) and CEEE (Rio
Grande do Sul) in the Southern region; CELPA (Para) in the Northern region;
and COELBA (Bahia), COELCE (Ceara) and CELPE (Pernambuco) in the Northeastern
region.
Power Tariffs
1.21      Bills rendered to consumers of electricity include the following
charges:
A.   The basic tariffs (shown in Annex B, T-1 for CEMIG, CELESC and
ESCELSA).  On a nation-wide basis, basic tariffs provide 77% of
the revenues collected from consumers.  According to law, these
basic charges should be set at levels which cover:
(a)  operating, maintenance and administrative expenses;
(b)  taxes other than on income (mainly property taxes);
(c)  foreign exchange losses arising from the service of
borrowings in foreign exchange;
(d)  straight line depreciation of estimated average gross
fixed assets in operation (land excluded);
(e)  reversion, which is a tax levied by the Federal Government
of up to 5% of assets in operation to secure funds to:
(i) lend to the concessionaries for expansion of their
respective services; (ii) compensate private concessionaires
for the purchase of assets; and (iii) finance the Global
Guarantee Fund (para. 1.22);
(f)  a legal return (normally between 10 and 12%) on remunerable
investment. The latter consists of net average utility plant
in service plus an allowance for working capital.



- 6 -
B.   The sole tax (imposto unico) on residential and commercial
electricity consumption, which provides 12% of the revenues,
imposed since 1954 at different rates for different levels of
consumption and types of consumers to provide additional
financial resources to the sector. 40% of the proceeds from
this tax goes to Federal agencies (ELETROBRAS, DNAEE, MME and
the NDF), 50% to the states and federal district, and 10% to
the municipalities; and
C.   The Compulsory Loan (10% of the revenues), which is a forced
investment scheme through which industrial consumers with
mofthlly consumption in excess of 2,000 kWh are required to
purchase ELETROBRAS' 20-year, 6% interest bearing bonds which
are subject to monetary correction.
1.22      ic-, 1973, the tariff authorities began implementing a government
policy intenided to reduce regional inequalities and to promote geographically
balanced economic growth. In 1976, the average tariff level to final con-
sumers was equalized for the whole country, with minor exceptions. Thus,
returns on remunerable assets for the utilities with relatively higher costs
may be below the 10% minumum established by law. The Global Guarantee Fund
is a redistributive mechanism established to harmonize the rate equalization
effort with the service at cost principle. It is financed by a surcharge
of up to 2% on assets in operation of the financially more efficient utilities
(those earning more than the maximum allowed to them by DNAEE). These funds
are then channelled to those utilities which achieve a return of less than
10% in order to compensate for their shortfalls.
1.23      The beneficiaries have agreed to maintaining their earnings (includ-
ing transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund) at levels consistent with
sound financial and public utility practices and in accordance with existing
legislation. They have also agreed that, in the event they require transfers
from the Fund, they will attain targets established by DNAEE. The Federal
Governmernt has agreed that DNAEE will take timely action on the beneficiaries'
requests for tariff adjustment and transfers. Finally, the Federal Government
has confirmed the Bank's understanding that DNAEE will exercise its statutory
powers to adllow the beneficiaries a return on remunerable assets of at least
10%. Any change in legislation which would materially and adversely affect
the beneficiaries' financial position, would be an event of default.
1.24      The tariff levels dictated by the system summarized in the preceeding
paragraphs, have up to now been adequate for allowing a reasonable return on
invested capital and sector contributions to capital investments. The ques-
tion whether this will continue to be so in the future is currently under
study by DNAEE (para. 1.36). Several characteristics of present tariff
structures, such as the lack of differentiation between consumption during
peak and off-peak hours, and the rate equalization effort require examination.
The tariff structure does contain generally desirable features such as separate
demand and energy charges for industrial and commercial consumers, discounts
to encourage large industrial consumers to accept supply at higher voltages,
and a special treatment for low income consumers based on social considera-
tions. A study is now being undertaken under the direction of DNAEE, with



- 7 -
assistaince from Electricite de France to analyze, inter alia, the above
features and to provide additional information for evaluating the economic
impact of pricing policy. Under Loan 1300-BR. the Government agreed to
present  the  results  of  this  study  (expected  to  be  completed  by  mid-1979)
to  the  :Bank. 
Electricity Consumption

Access to Service
1.28      It is estimated that virtually 100% of the urban population of the
country has access to electric service while some 80% of the total urban
population in Brazil and about 87% of the urban population of the Southern and
Southeastern regions are actually receiving electric service. Service in rural
areas (with 41% of the total population) appears to be extremely low, judging from
partial data from the Northeastern region in which 98% of the farmers and a large
proportion of the villages are without electricity. The Government expects to
further increase the provision of electric service both in urban and rural
areas. The proposed programs of the beneficiaries would directly assist the
implementation of this policy by expanding the capacity of lines and substa-
tions that would feed rural areas and low income urban areas (see paras. 4.07
and 4.08).
Rural Electrification
1.29      Rural electrification on a national level was started in 1970 when
the Instituto Nacional de Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria, a self-governing
agency attached to the Ministry of Agriculture, was made responsible for the
planning, promotion and control of rural electrification. Progress, however,
was slow (4 to 5 thousand customers/year) and in 1974, ELETROBRAS created a
rural electrification department to complement the activities carried out by
the Ministry of Agriculture. ELETROBRAS' approach to rural electrification
has been that of financing distribution networks in rural areas close to
existing lines. It does not finance household wiring or connection fees.
ELETROBRAS provides 50-80% of the cost of individual rural electrification
projects (the overall average for 1976 was 58%), with the rest being supplied
by the utilities. ELETROBRAS' loan terms are 15 years, including 5 years
grace, and 12% interest on the principal (which is not subject to monetary
correction).
1.30      About 17,000 rural customers (defined as rural cooperatives, or
agricultural or agro-industrial producers) were connected in 1976 through
ELETROBRAS-assisted programs, with a total cost of about US$40million. Of these
new customers, 5826 were located in the Southeastern region and 7856 in the
Southern region. Over the period 1978-1980, ELETROBRAS expects to participate
in projects costing a total of about US$540 million, or close to half of the
total planned investments for distribution and connect about 200,000 rural
consumers. About 1% of these connections would be in the North, 15% in the
Northeast, 50% in the Southeast, 29% in the South and 5% in the Center West.

Sector Manrower
1.33      In general, the sector is well staffed with qualified persons in
responsible positions.  126,638 persons were employed in the sector at the
end of 1976, of which 67,893 (54%) were in the Southeastern region and 22,641
(18%) in the Southern region. Training and development of the staff, at all
levels, is accomplished by ELETROBRAS and the utilities in 27 training centers.
About US$12 million were spent to train 41,000 people (32% of the total
employees of the sector) in 1976. The training programs have been judged by
the Bank to be comprehensive, well-managed and effective. Through a US$15.4
million program (of which US$4.3 million is being financed by the Bank under
Loan 1343-BR), ELETROBRAS expects to meet the advanced, specialized training
requirements of the sector during the next four years.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.34      There are no organizational constraints that might impede sector
development. The high level of investment required in the power sector,
about 8 to 9% of gross capital formation, and the Government's present policy
of limiting public sector investment as a part of its program to control
inflation, may result in insufficient availability of funds in the future.
The proposed master plan (para. 2.09) should reveal any problems in this area
in time for corrective action to be taken.



- 11 -
1.35      The Government has been moving away from the previous automatic
reinvestment in the power sector of funds generated by the sector. A growing
proportion of sector funds are now channelled through the National Development
Fund (NDF).  The NDF mechanism is potentially effective in assisting the
Federal Government to exercise control over sectoral investment programs.
However, for the power sector, the NDF implies a curtailment of ELETROBRAS'
role in allocating resources.  Since the sector's net cash generation is
unlikely to exceed its minimum net financial requirements (at least through
completion of Itaipu in the late 1980s), NDF's intervention may simply result
in additional administrative complications. Any constraints for the power
sector, however, are likely to be offset by the benefits obtained in the
economy as a whole as a result of the discipline associated with NDF review
of investments.
1.36      More serious constraints could originate in the long run from the
inability of key utilities (including CEMIG, one of the beneficiaries of the
proposed project) to generate sufficient funds internally to make a reasonable
contribution to the financing of their expansion programs. This concern has
prompted DNAEE to undertake a review of sector financial requirements and
the adequacy of tariff levels.  This stua !`r9-trently under way, together
with a review of tariff structure previously agreed with the Bank (para. 1.24).
DNAEE intends to present the results of its review (including a financial
forecast for the sector as a whole through 1985) to the Bank by December 30,
1979.

CHAPTER 2
THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARIES
The Borrower
2.01      T'he borrower is ELETROBRAS (paras. 1.14, 1.16), an open stock
corporation established in 1961 and almost entirely (99.6% as of December
31, 1976) owned by the Federal Government.
2.02      ELETROBRAS acts as the Government's financing agency for the electric
power sector in Brazil and may be compared to a development bank in allocat-
ing and channelling the funds necessary to support the sector's growth. It
channels funds to various parts of the sector by means of loans, investment in
additional shares of common stock of the recipients and direct grants. In
allocating funds, ELETROBRAS maintains tight financial and technical control
and borrowers are required to present detailed financial and engineering
information on any project for which financing is sought.
2.03      E:LETROBRAS' role in the project consists of coordinating its devel-
opment locally, and serving as a channel for on-lending the proceeds of the
proposed Bank loan to the beneficiaries. ELETROBRAS has also agreed to review
on a regular basis progress of the project during construction and start of
operations and on the beneficiaries' performance and submit reports to the
Bank every six months. ELETROBRAS would provide part of the local currency
financing for the project through its normal loan and equity channels.
2.04      The proposed Bank loan of US$130 million is not large in relation
to ELETROBRAS' total gross assets, which at year-end 1976 amounted to about
Cr$67 billion (US$5.4 billion). Since the financial appraisal shows that
the beneficiiaries will be in a generally sound condition and should not
encounter diLfficulty in servicing their portion of the proposed loan, it was
not considered necessary, as under loan 1300-BR, to conduct an appraisal of
ELETROBRAS' future finances. ELETROBRAS' financial statements are summarized
in Annex A. As shown therein, ELETROBRAS' outstanding capital amounted to Cr$22
billion at year-end 1976. Its resources consist of net internal cash generation
(dividends received, interest on its loan portfolio, loan amortization receipts
and miscellaneous other income, less debt service and less net dividend payments)
which in the period 1971-76 averaged 34% of total resources; sole tax (para.
1.21), 8%; reversion reserve (para. 1.21), 22%; compulsory loans (para. 1.21),
21%; federal budgetary appropriations, 3%; and borrowings, 12%. Outstanding long
term borrowings (45% of long-term capitalization) at year-end 1976 totalled Cr$
28.3 billion (about US$2.3 billion equivalent), of which 40% was in the form
of debentures arising from the compulsory loans, 29% represented reversion
accruals to the Federal Government, 20% came from foreign borrowings (IDB,
bilateral agencies, commercial banks and utility holding companies) and 11%
from domestic loans. ELETROBRAS' large and growing sources of funds constitute
a broad base for expanding its borrowings, and it is becoming increasingly
active in foreign financial markets.



- 13 -
2.05      ELETROBRAS is managed by a Board and an Executive Directorate.  The
Board is composed of a Chairman appointed by the President of the Republic,
five Directors and two to four Advisers appointed by the Shareholders'General
Assembly for a three-year term, and two Advisers appointed by those share-
holders which are also legal entities. The Executive Directorate is composed
of the Chairman and five Directors. The Board has been entrusted with the
responsibility for devising fundamental policies. The Executive Directorate
has all top-level management functions according to the Board's general guide-
lines.
2.06      In its role as the planning and coordinating agency for the electric
power sector, ELETROBRAS is responsible for carrying out the policy established
by the MME for the sector's long-term development. In this role ELETROBRAS is
also involved in coordinating regional development plans and undertaking
studies for joint development projects with neighboring countries.
2.07      In establishing development plans ELETROBRAS relies principally
on five-year budgets which it prepares in conjunction with other sector
entities. These budgets have the purpose of assisting ELETROBRAS and the
Government in selecting those projects which will meet projected power demand
and in providing adequate financial support. The budgets are updated and
revised annually; however ELETROBRAS has not been entirely successful in this
function and the 1976-1981 budget was not issued until December 1977.
2.08      ELETROBRAS has built up a large, competent organization with a staff
of about 1,600. Through the leverage obtained from its financing role,
ELETROBRAS has been able to supervise operations of the utilities for economical
and orderly sector growth. Among its coordinating responsibilities, ELETROBRAS
assists in the transfer of hydroelectric power among the country's regions to
minimize operation of thermal  Sants, and will gradually increase its involve-
ment in power allocation between'''utilities as the national grid system becomes
fully developed by the mid-eighties.
2.09      With the expected completion of the interconnection of the South,
Southeast, North and Northeast in the early-eighties, inter-regional transfers
would take place throughout almost the entire country. This requires that
the development of the country's power sources and the system expansion plans
be based on an integrated perspective of the country's long-term power require-
ments and available power resources. Such an overall country analysis would
enable power sector expansion plans to be based on the least cost alternative
program. Moreover, such an analysis should examine a 20 to 25-year horizon.
Present planning methods, while reasonably satisfactory for the relatively
short-term regional exercises conducted in the past (covering 11 years in the
case of the South-Southeast and 6 years in that of the Northeast) are not
suitable to meet the need outlined above. The Bank has offered to assist
ELETROBRAS in developing improved planning methods. ELETROBRAS has indicated
that by December 31, 1979 it will prepare a master plan for power sector
expansion for the whole country through the year 2000. ELETROBRAS would ex-
change views with the Bank regarding the methodology, scope of work and terms
of reference to be followed in such planning and would make available the plan
to the Bank as and when needed in support of the appraisal of future power
projects in Brazil.

The Beneficiaries
Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais S. A. (CEMIG)
2.10      CEMIG was created on May 22, 1952 and is governed by Minas Gerais
State Law No. 828 of December 14, 1951. CEMIG is managed by its ten member-
Board elected by the Shareholders' meeting for a 3 year period. The Executive
Directorate, composed of seven directors, is appointed by the Shareholders'
Meeting for a 3 year period; the meeting also chooses from among the Executive
Directors, one President and two Vice Presidents. The President is the Chief
Executive Officer. The organizational structure shown in Annex B, C-1 is well
designed and the company is capably staffed. CEMIG's staff numbers 8600 and
staff relations are good. The utility serves 1.1 million customers (about 131
customers per employee which is adequate considering the characteristics of
its service area). CEMIG's paid in capital as of December 31, 1976 amounted to
Cr$4.1 billion of which 68% was owned by the State of Minas Gerais, 16% by
ELETROBRAS and 16% by others (mostly private shareholders).
2.11     CEMIG has received four previous Bank loans for a total of US$142.9
million equivalent. The first three projects have been completed; the two
most important of these, the Jaguara and the Volta Grande hydroelectric schemes,
for which the Bank made loans in 1966 and 1968, were completed 5-1/2 years and
nine months, respectively, later than the appraisal estimate, with cost over-
runs amounting to US$61.4 million equivalent (68% of appraisal estimate) and
US$123.6 million equivalent (130% of appraisal estimate), respectively. The
cost overruns were due to local and foreign costs higher than expected at
appraisal which resulted from foundation problems, inflation and increasing
lag between rising local construction costs and exchange rate readjustments.
The fourth (the 1,000 MW SaTo Simao hydroelectric project, financed under loan
829-BR of June 14, 1972) is well advanced and the first units have started oper-
ation about three months before the date estimated at the time of appraisal.
Costs, now estimated at about US$750 million, are about 90% over the appraisal
estimate of US$396 million, due mostly to higher than expected inflation,
although changes in the number and size of the units and more excavation than
expected have also contributed to the overrun.  The overruns did not affect the
feasibility of the projects as fuel prices increased even more than the projects.
2.12     CEMIG has established a fully owned subsidiary - Eletrificapao Rural
de Minas Gerais, S. A. (ERMIG) with a paid-in capital, as of the end of 1976, of
Cr$ 80.4 million.  Its purpose is to build rural electrification facilities
financed by state rural cooperatives and other rural customers; once the
facilities are built, operating responsibilities are sometimes entrusted to
ERMIG under contracts with the cooperatives.
Training
2.13      CEMIG maintains a training center considered as one of the best in
the Latin American and Caribbean region. It provides training in the areas
of operation and maintenance of electrical systems to medium-level technical
personnel of CEMIG's own staff and to staff from other Brazilian electricity
companies.  CEMIG's annual training expenditures amounted to Cr$ 21 million in
1976, 3.5% of annual gross payroll.



- 15 -
Management Systems
2.14      CEMIG has very sophisticated financial systems for planning and
budgeting purposes. Annual budgets are prepared by the Financial Planning
Department which puts together all budgets and financial forecasts and pro-
jections, all of which are updated periodically. Management reports are
satisfactory.
Accounting and Audit
2.15      CEMIG's accounting system is satisfactory and well suited to the
utility's needs. Internal control functions are vested in the Internal Audit
Department which reports to the Financial Director. This arrangement, while
unusual, functions very well for CEMIG. Internal Audit carries out an adequate
program of financial and operational audits and follow-up on past recommenda-
tions.
2.16      CEMIG employs as its external auditors the international accounting
firm Arthur Andersen and Co., which is acceptable to the Bank. In addition,
the Fiscal Council, appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting, carries out
external control duties in accordance with Brazilian legislation.
Billings and Collections
2.17      CEMIG's billings are carried out by its data processing system, and
collections by the banking system. In case of non-payment, the service is
suspended between 15 and 30 days after due date; the suspension is triggered
by a control system which signals the date at which suspension of service
becomes economical; actual enforcement is very good.
Risk Management
2.18      CEMIG's assets have been insured against most common risks such as
fire, accident and civil liability, in accordance with accepted public utility
practices. Insurance is well administered.
Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina S.A. (CELESC)
2.19      CELESC was created on December 9, 1955, by Santa Catarina State
Decree No. 22. The company is managed by the General Assembly which appoints,
for a four year period, a Directorate composed of a President and four
Directors and which is in charge of the day-to-day management functions;
responsibility for objectives, policies, organization and direction of the
company is vested in the President. CELESC has about 3900 employees and
serves about 420,000 customers (a ratio of 107 customers per employee which is
adequate considering the characteristics of its service area).
2.20      The organizational structure (shown in Annex B, C-2) is well designed.
However, the company lacks effective coordination between departments and has
agreed to engage satisfactory consultants, under terms of reference acceptable
to the Bank, to make recommendations by June 30, 1979, for improving coordi-
nation as well as reporting, budgeting (para. 2.23), auditing, accounting (para
2.24) and assisting in training (para. 2.22). CELESC has agreed to present to



- 16 -
the Bank by June 30, 1979 the consultants' recommendations and CELESC's proposal
for their implementation. CELESC should implement such of its consultant's
recommendations as shall be acceptable to the Bank and to GELESC in accordance
with a timeitable to be agreed with the Bank. The engagement of these consult-
ants is a condition of disbursement of CELESC's portion of the loan.
2.21      CELESC's paid-in capital as of December 31, 1976 amounted to Cr$617
million of which 80% was owned by the Government of the State of Santa Catarina
and its agencies, 14% by ELETROBRAS, 3% by the municipalities and 3% by private
shareholders.
Training
2.22      CELESC maintains a training center for technical personnel in
operation and maintenance of electrical systems; it also provides training
for similar personnel from other Brazilian electricity companies. It has
recently lost several key members of its professional staff and is actively
recruiting new staff. It has, however, been forced to assign to these new
staff members responsibilities beyond their capabilities. It has agreed
to prepare with the assistance of the consultants mentioned in para. 2.20,
by June 30, 1979, a training program for its professional staff to enable it
to adequately carry out its tasks, and to implement such program as agreed
with the Bank.
Management Systems
2.23      CELESC's management systems are weak.  An annual operating budgeting
system has recently been designed and is in the process of implementation;
although the. system design appears adequate for the company's needs, its
operation lacks the necessary basic managerial orientation. Financial fore-
casts and projections are prepared without much regard for coordination among
the various areas that should be involved in the process. CELESC's reporting
system is weak and top management is inadequately apprised of developments in
most areas. To at least partly compensate for this deficiency and mainly to
improve communications, management has recently started a program of executive
meetings at various levels. The organizational consultants to be contracted
are also expected to make recommendations regarding the reporting system and
budgeting controls.
Accounting and Audit
2.24      Accounting is discharged without the proper coordination with the
needs of other departments of the utility and without the required knowledge
of existing sector rules and regulations. Internal audit, which reports
directly to the President of the company, is weak. The organizational
consultants to be contracted should also make recommendations regarding
accounting and auditing. The external auditors' report on internal control
points to a large number of trouble spots, some at the policy level. CELESC's
accounts have been audited by the firm of independent accountants MABAL, which
are acceptable to the Bank, and, in addition, in accordance with Brazilian
legislation, external control duties are carried out by the Fiscal Council,
appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting.



- 17 -
Billing and Collections
2.25      CELESC's procedures in this area are appropriate to the utility's
needs; reporting on billings and collections is adequate. Collection is
carried out through the banking system.
Risk Management
2.26      CELESC has insured its assets against most common risks such as
fire, accident and civil liability, in accordance with accepted public utility
practices. Insurance is well administered.
Espirito Santo Centrais Eletricas S.A. (ESCELSA)
2.27      ESCELSA was created in July 1, 1968, by merger of Companhia Central
Brasileira de Forqa Eletrica (CCBFE), previously acquired by ELETROBRAS from
American Foreign Power, with Espirito Santo Centrais Eletricas S.A. - ESCELSA,
the state-owned utility. The company is managed by a Board of Directors
appointed for a 3 year period by the Shareholders' Assembly; the Board is
composed of a President and five Directors who are in charge of the day-to-day
operations of the company. ESCELSA has about 1800 employees and serves 174,000
customers (87 customers per employee which is adequate considering the charac-
teristics of its service area).
2.28      The organizational structure (shown in Annex  B, C-3) is well designed.
However, the company lacks effective coordination between departments and
would engage satisfactory consultants, under terms of reference acceptable
to the Bank to make recommendations by June 30, 1979, for improving coordi-
nation as well as budgeting (para. 2.31), accounting and auditing (Para. 2.32),
and assisting in training (para. 2.30). ESCELSA has agreed to present to the
Bank by June 30, 1979 the consultants recommendations and ESCELSA's proposal for
their implementation. ESCELSA should implement such of its consultant's recom-
mendations as shall be acceptable to the Bank and to ESCELSA in accordance with
a timetable to be agreed with the Bank. The engagement of these consultants is
a condition of disbursement of ESCELSA's portion of the loan.
2.29      ESCELSA's paid in capital as of December 31, 1976, amounted to
Cr$488 million of which 92% were owned by ELETROBRAS, 6% by the Government
of the State of Espirito Santo, and 2% by the municipalities and other
minority shareholders.
Training
2.30      ESCELSA does not have a training center of its own but it provides,
internally as well as externally, courses in the technical and administrative
areas. It does not have enough qualified, experienced professional staff and
is actively recruiting new staff. It has, therefore, been forced to assign
to staff members responsibilities beyond their capabilities. It has agreed
to prepare with the assistance of the consultants mentioned in para. 2.28, by
June 30, 1979 a training program for its professional staff to enable it to
adequately carry out its tasks, and to implement such programs as agreed with
the Bank.



- 18 -
Management Systems
2.31      1'reparation and control of ESCELSA's annual budgets are entrusted to
the Economic-Financial Directorate. The budgeting system has been improved
over the lEast several years but further improvements are required. Financial
forecasting is new to ESCELSA and the company should improve its staff's knowledg
of the available techniques. The organization consultants should also make recor
mendations concerning budgeting and financial forecasting (para. 2.28).
Accounting and Audit
2.32      ESCELSA's Internal Auditor, who reports directly to the President,
is currently developing appropriate auditing programs and manuals. The
internal control report of the external auditors calls the attention to
deficiencies in the accounting and internal control systems and the organi-
zational consultants to be contracted should also make recommendations
regarding accounting and auditing (para. 2.28).
2.33     IESCELSA contracts the services of the independent external audit-
ing firm Boucinhas, Campos, Claro S/C Ltda., which are acceptable to the
Bank. In addition, because of the Federal Government's interests (through
ELETROBRAS) in ESCELSA, the Tribunal de Contas da Uniao of the Ministry of
Mines and Elnergy carries out periodic audits of ESCELSA's accounts. The
Fiscal Council appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting, also carries out external
control duties in accordance with Brazilian legislation.
Billings and Collections
2.34      ESCELSA's billings and collections seem very efficient since the
company has less than 40 days' billings outstanding. Some of the meters
are read by an outside company; collections are carried out through the
banking system. After ten days' delay in payment of bills, ESCELSA starts
charging penalty interest.
Risk Management
2.35      ESCELSA insures its assets against most common risks such as fire,
accident and civil liability, in accordance with accepted public utility
practices. The utility hires the risk management consulting services of
Servicos Tecnicos de Levantamento e Inspecao Ltda (SERTEC), a privately-owned
consulting company. In accordance with Brazilian Government practices,
ESCELSA insures its assets with the insurance company designated annually, by
drawing, by the Instituto do Reaseguros do Brasil (IRB), the Brazilian Govern-
ment agency which regulates insurance.

CHAPTER 3
THE MARKET AND THE MEANS TO MEET IT
Historical Market
3.01      Public-service electricity consumption in the areas served by CEMIG,
CELESC and ESCELSA grew at an average annual rate of about 14, 23 and 22%,
respectively, during the period 1972-1976. The growth in the average consump-
tion per customer was about 6, 11 and 7% and in the number of customers, about
8, 12 and 14%. As may be seen in Table 3-1, the power market of all three
companies has been increasingly dominated by the industrial market (76, 59 and
67% of all sales to the ultimate consumers in 1976, up from 72, 52 and 61% in
1972).
The Forecast
3.02      The forecast of energy sales to the industrial sector is based on a
detailed analysis made by the companies and reviewed by ELETROBRAS, regarding
the status of implementation of major industrial projects. In most cases,
these major industries commit themselves contractually to purchase energy by
a certain date, or pay demand charges even if their need for power is post-
poned. The utilities' analyses cover both these firmly committed loads and
other, generally smaller prospective customers. All three companies update
their analyses periodically and generally keep abreast of events which may
affect their forecasts. The lesser industries as well as the residential,
rural and commercial sectors have been forecast on the basis of the recent
trends. The resulting forecasts (Table 3-1) indicate that the three power
markets will maintain high average growth rates through the project con-
struction period. The average annual rate of growth of sales from 1976 to
1982 is forecast to be 16.5% for CEMIG, 17.3% for CELESC and 29% for ESCELSA.
3.03      The 1978-1981 construction program of the three beneficiaries, of
which the project is part, would be instrumental in increasing both the
absolute and relative numbers of households served with public service elec-
tricity. It is expected that the emphasis placed on connecting low income
consumers (see para. 4.07) will contribute to achieving this goal (See Annex B,
T-2).
The Energy and Capacity Balance
3.04      The requirements for electricity generation by the beneficiaries and
energy purchases by them from FURNAS and ELETROSUL, the regional bulk-suppliers,
have been forecast under the assumption that the beneficiaries would be able
to maintain their losses and unaccounted-for usage of electricity at their
present value of about 9% or less. The three utilities would be capable of
meeting their energy and power requirements on the basis of their own plants
plus purchases from FURNAS or ELETROSUL under average hydrological conditions
(see Annex B, T-3 and T-4). Both bulk suppliers are aware of the projected
demands by their customers and are willing to enter into contractual arrange-
ments to supply their requirements. However, the capacity of FURNAS and



- 20 -
ELETROSUL to meet their contractual commitments or of the utilities to increase
their purchases from these suppliers or neighboring utilities depends upon
the combined behavior of the system which serves the Southern and Southeastern
region of the country and which are expected to be fully interconnected by
1981. It is therefore necessary to analyze the system's requirements and avail-
abilities as a whole. ELETROBRAS, jointly with all of the utilities operating
in the region, performed this analysis (see Annex B, T-5) in early 1977 on the
basis of late 1976 projections. In the case of CEMIG, CELESC and ESCELSA, these
are between 11 and 15% higher than those resulting from the present forecast
(Table 3-1). It may be seen that if generating stations now under construction
are not unreasonably delayed, the system will, in general, be capable of supply-
ing the requirements throughout the project construction period even under ad-
verse hydrological conditions. It may also be seen that if Itaipu and/or the
next unit at: Angra are delayed and if adverse hydrological conditions occur in
1982 or 1983, there may be curtailments in the supply. This analysis, however,
is somewhat outdated as after these studies were carried out, a new, lower energy
requirements forecast has been prepared and the installation program for new
generating units has changed (i.e., CEMIG now plans to install Nova Ponte and
Igarapava - para. 4.03 - and Salto da Divisa and Itapebi have been postponed
beyond 1987). ELETROBRAS is currently making a new analysis based on the revised
forecast and program. ELETROBRAS and the utilities normally review and update
these studies every year and are thus likely to anticipate the possible conse-
quences of a coincidence of delays and adverse hydrological conditions so that
they may mitigate the effects of such occurrences.

CHAPTER 4
PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Background and Oblectives
4.01      CEMIG, CELESC and ESCELSA are faced with a prospective rapid growth
in electricity demands in their respective service areas. Their construction
program through 1981, of which the project is part, proposes to provide the
facilities required to serve the anticipated loads, mostly related to indus-
trial growth. Failure to provide these facilities would lead to excessively
costly curtailments of supply or installation of fuel-based captive generation.
The program would also be instrumental in making public service electricity
available to low-income customers and for rural electrification.
Generation
4.02      Of the three project beneficiaries, only CEMIG has a program for
installing generating facilities. The program to be executed during the
project construction period has, for the most part, been carefully studied
by CEMIG and has been properly coordinated with ELETROBRAS and neighboring
utilities to ensure that the soon to be interconnected system is expanded
and operated in an optimum manner. CEMIG's program through 1981 includes
the completion, in 1979, of the first phase (1800 MW) of the Sro Simxo
hydro station (partially financed by Loan 829-BR) and the start of construc-
tion of the 1,000 MW Emborca9ao hydro station (partially financed by IDB),
the first units of which are expected to be commissioned by late 1981.
4.03      CEMIG's program also includes the start of construction of hydro
stations at Igarapava (150 MW) and Nova Ponte (320 MW), to be commissioned by
1983. However, CEMIG is now considering deferring their commissioning until
about 1987 or 1988. CEMIG has not yet demonstrated that capacity additions
of this magnitude would be the least cost solution to the problem of adding
capacity to the interconnected system, either in 1983 or in the latter dates.
The Bank would have an opportunity to review the justification of Igarapava
and Nova Ponte under the limitation on major expansion projects (para. 5.09).
Transmission
4.04      The proposed expansion plans for transmission lines and substations
would allow the utilities to transmit the energy to be generated by existing
and future plants to meet their anticipated load growth without reducing the
quality of their services. Between the beginning of 1978 and the end of 1981,
CEMIG is expected to increase the total length of its lines (34.5 kV to 500
kV) from about 12,500 km to 16,700 km and its substation capacity from about
7,000 MVA to about 12,600 MVA; CELESC would increase its lines (34.5 to 138
kV) from about 2,900 km to 3,500 km and its substation capacity from about 800
MVA to about 1,600 MVA while ESCELSA would increase its lines (34.5 to 138 kV)
from 1,700 km to about 1,940 km and its substation capacity from about 275
MVA to 440 MVA.

Distribution
4.06      The distribution expansion programs to be carried out by the utilities
during the period 1978-81 focus on the following objectives:
(a) providing adequate capacity at appropriate points of the
system for the expected increases in loads;
(b) ensuring the continued high reliability of service to all
customers; and



- 24 -
(c) expanding service to low-income and rural areas of the
respective states.
In order to meet these objectives, the utilities' programs include the follow-
ing items:
CEMIG                CELESC              ESCELSA
Increase             Increase             Increase

at 13 kV and below       10,000       37%       6,430   available   4,000        40%

transformers                866       57%         143      52%          84       52%
Meters                  450,000       45%    226,000        54%     85,000       49%
4.C7      During the project construction period the utilities will give
emphasis to the connection of low income households, particularly to those
whc at the present time have access to service by virtue of being near exist-
ing distribution lines but are not connected to the system.  These prospective
customers can be connected with a minimum of investment. The three utilities
will be offering such consumers the financing, over a period of at least 18
montns, of the hcusehold wiring and other items necessary for connection.
The monthly payments, which would include the cost of 30 kWh of
electricity, are not likely to exceed the equivalent of US$5.00 in CEMIG's
area, US$3.50 in CELESC's area and US$3.00 in ESCELSA's area. These amounts
are expected not to exceed 5% of the average total monthly household income of
the lower 40% income group in the respective states. On this basis, the utili-
ties expect to be able to connect between 1978 and 1981 a total of about 60,000
low income customers, of which, 30,000 would be CEMIG's, 20,000 CELESC's and
10,000 ESCELSA's.
4.08      In addition to the expansion of the urban systems, the utilities
have on-going rural electrification projects being carried out with financial
assistance from ELETROBRAS (para. 1.29). These projects envisage the installa-
tion of about 25,700 circuit km of lines by CEMIG and 3,000 each by CELESC and
ESCELSA as well as the respective connection of about 15,000, 30,000 and 3,400
new rural customers, between 1978 and 1981, which are realistic goals.
Miscellaneous Items
4.0'9     The utilities' programs also includes purchase of laboratory, shop,
control, communication and transportation equipment.

These costs (which do not include price contingencies) were estimated by
each utility on the basis of generally prevailing prices as of mid-1977 and
are considered reasonable by the Bank.
The Project
4.11      The project to be financed by the proposed loan consists of items
which:
(i) have been identified as of high priority;
(ii) are scheduled to be started not earlier than July 1, 1978,
and finished not later than December 31, 1981;
(iii) already have the required technical and economic
justification; and
(iv) are to be built at voltages no higher than 230 kV.



- 26 -
The project will consequently be focused on the subtransmission-distribution
subsector. In the case of CEMIG, acquisition of communications and control
equipment will also be included. The subtransmission-distribution subsector
is characterized by special difficulties in the process of identification of
individual projects and therefore the beneficiaries have not obtained and are
not likely to obtain alternate financing on reasonable terms.
4.12      The individual project components are indicated in Annex B, T-6 and

(iii)  DiLstribution
The project includes the equivalent of about half of CEMIG's distri-
bution program, and CELESC's and ESCELSA's full four-year program.
CEMIG will have to arrange financing for the balance of its distri-
bution program by the end of 1979. The sources of this financing
would be identified in the proposed mid-1979 review of CEMIG's
fiLnances (para. 5.12). The distribution component of the project
includes the following:

The base costs were estimated by each utility on the basis of generally
prevailing prices as of mid-1977 and found reasonable by the Bank. The
engineering and administration costs for the project as well as applicable
taxes and duties, estimated at about 10% of total base costs are included in
the base estimates. The cost of consulting services to be required by CELESC
and ESCELSA (para. 4.14) has been estimated on the basis of about 80 man-
months each at a cost of US$6,000 per man-month, excluding subsistence and
travel expenses and is included as part of the cost of the 138 kV facilities.
Physical contingencies have been estimated as 8 to 20% of the base estimates
of the individual components of the program, depending on the status of the
engineering; the overall average is about 12%. The price contingencies have
been calculated on the basis of assumed annual rates of inflation of 7.5% from
1977 to 1979 and 7% thereafter for foreign costs and 9% from 1977 to 1980 and
8% thereafter for local costs, assuming a constant exchange rate.   The latter
were estimated on the basis of the projected construction cost indexes for
Brazil which in the past, have provided a suitable basis for estimating such
costs.   The proposed Bank loan of US$130 million equivalent would finance the
estimated foreign component of the project, of which US$58.1,  43.8, and 28.1
million correspond to CEMIG, CELESC and ESCELSA, respectively. The remainder
of the project, together with the rest of the beneficiaries' programs would be
financed as detailed in para. 5.05.

Implementation
4.14      The utilities' own staff will carry out most of the necessary
engineering and supervision of construction for the project:. This is accept-
able as the utilities have proven experience in similar works completed
recently or still under construction. However, CELESC and ESCELSA have staff
limitations and will require assistance for engineering and supervision of
construction for 138 kV facilities and have therefore agreed to employ
consultants satisfactory to the Bank for these purposes. I]n view of the
limited experience of these two utilities with international procurement,
consultants should also assist them in the preparation of t:he general contract
documents and evaluation procedures. It is most likely that these consultants
will be Brazilian consultants. The utilities' staff personnel would install
the distribution equipment and build short distribution extensions. Local
contractors are expected to install substations and build all 230, 138 and 69
kV lines and major distribution lines.
4.15      The project implementation schedule envisages completion by December
31, 1981, which is reasonable. The detailed schedule (Annex B, T-7) would be
used to monitor progress during the project construction period.
Procurement
4.16      Procurement of the equipment to be financed by the Bank will be
through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. Manufacturers of equipment financed by the proposed loan, whose
bids contain components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the
value of the bid would be given a margin of preference of 15%, or the applicable
import duties, whichever is lower. Brazilian suppliers of the items included
in the project are reasonably competitive. Foreign cost estimates assume that:
(i) about US$130 million equivalent of equipment and materials will be acquired
through ICB :Ln accordance with Bank guidelines, under the proposed loan; and
(ii) Brazilian suppliers would be awarded up to two-thirds of the value of
the contracts placed through such bidding.
4.17      Any equipment and materials to be used in the project which would
not be financed under the proposed loan, such as line supports and low voltage
equipment, w:Lll be procured locally under the beneficiaries' normal procedures
as Brazilian legislation precludes ICB for items that can be produced locally
and that are not financed by long-term foreign loans. However, as noted above,
such locally produced items are reasonably competitive in price with imported
products and project cost should not increase significantly over the estimate
as a result of these restrictions.
Disbursement
4.18      Disbursements from the loan account would be made for 100% of
foreign expenditures for imported equipment and materials or the ex-factory
cost of locally manufactured equipment and materials. The following table
shows estimated loan disbursements, assuming loan effectiveness to be June 30,
1978:

Disbursements will be fully documented.  The closing date would be December 31,
1982 to allow for the payment of retentions.
Environment
4.19      The utilities intend to route their lines, most of which will be
overhead, and locate their substations so as to minimize their visual impact
in a manner consistent with economic and financial considerations.
Project Risks
4.20      The project faces no major risks, other than those resulting from
the relative weakness of two of the beneficiary utilities. The construction
schedule assumed for the project is reasonable and takes into consideration
normal engineering, administrative and construction procedures but it contains
no provision for unusual delays. CEMIG is not expected to have any difficulties
in meeting the schedules. However, timely completion of the project by CELESC
and ESCELSA will depend greatly on the appropriate use of consultants to assist
them with the 138 kV facilities and in the preparation of the contract docu-
ments for ICB. A condition of disbursement of the respective portion of the
loan for which CELESC and ESCELSA are the beneficiaries, is the hiring by
these utilities of consultants for those services on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank to minimize the risks of not meeting the schedule and/or
the project objectives.

CHAPTER 5
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Summary
5.01      The beneficiaries are quite different as to size of operations,
financial performance and management sophistication. CEMIG's performance
has in the past been very good; however, its finances have deteriorated as a
result of the high rate of growth of its market and the consequent large
investment requirements. It is expected that this negative trend will be
reversed as a result of the upcoming review of CEMIG's finances (para. 5.12).
CELESC's performance has been rather unsatisfactory reflecting mainly faulty
financial decisions but its financial position should improve as a result
of improved management and increased capital contributions from the State
Government. ESCELSA has in the past been a net recipient of funds from
the tariff equalization scheme and has been undercapitalized; it has, there-
fore, experienced some financial tightness which should be overcome by
increased equity capital investments from ELETROBRAS. The Government,
ELETROBRAS and the beneficiaries have agreed to financial provisions which
would allow continued monitoring of the financial viability of the benefi-
ciaries. The financial experience of the beneficiaries over the last several
years and their estimated future finances are shown in Tables 5-1 through 5-3.
Earnings History and Financial Position
.5.02     CEMIG earned a rate of return on its remunerable investment (para.
1.21) of about 10.5% on average in 1974-76 which was equivalent to a financial
rate of return 1/ of about 17% (Table 5-1). These returns have allowed CEMIG
to comfortabl,y cover its operating expenses (49% average operating ratio for
1974-76), and to generate internally funds which covered its net debt service
with an accepitable margin (1.7 times average for 1974-76). CEMIG's construc-
tion outlays in real terms during 1974-76 were on average twice as high as
those of the previous six years. This increase coupled with the long construc-
tion period of the projects resulted in a decrease in the proportion of con-
struction expenditures which were financed with internally generated funds.
Consequently, debt financing of CEMIG's investments increased from an average
56% for 1968-,73 to 78% in 1974-76 2/. As a consequence of the increased
reliance on borrowing, CEMIG's debt service coverage has declined from 1.8 in
1974 to 1.6 in 1976 and the proportion of debt in its capital structure
increased fromi 48% in 1974 to 55% by the end of 1976. Even though this debt
proportion is still acceptable, the short maturity of CEMIG's debt (12 years
average repaynment period) may cause financial difficulties to the company in
the near future.
1/   The financial rate of return excludes receipts from (or payments to)
the GlobaLl Guarantee Fund and is calculated before deduction of
reversion (see paras. 1.21-1.22).
2/   As explained in para. 5.06, a sizeable proportion of the borrowed funds
represent resources originating in charges to CEMIG's consumers; these
are used by ELETROBRAS to support investments by CEMIG or other utilities
as required.

5.03      CELESC earned an average 10.7% return on remunerable investment
in 1974-76 which was equivalent to a 16% financial return (Table 5-2). This
satisfactory remuneration combined with a relatively low debt service burden
enabled CELESC to keep its net internal contribution to investments at an
average level of 26% over 1974-1976, which is adequate. CELESC's debt service
coverage ratio declined from 3.2 in 1974 to 2.1 in 1976, but remained within an
acceptable margin. CELESC's financial management has in the past been deficient
and the company is currently negotiating with ELETROBRAS short-term financial
assistance that would allow it to settle its overdue payables with ELETROSUL
(which amounted to over 5 months' energy purchases at the end of 1976).
CELESC's financial projections include the capitalization by end of 1978
of Cr$80.9 million debt due to ELETROBRAS in 1977 and 1978, and of Cr$42.9
million interest due in 1977 to 1981. ELETROBRAS has confirmed its intention
to act accordingly.
5.04      ESCELSA earned an average 11% return on remunerable investment in
1974-76. However, in the last two years of this period, it only achieved this
return as a result of transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund (Table 5-3, II).
As a result, ESCELSA's financial rate of return decreased from 20% in 1974 to
to 12% in 1976 (para. 1.22). ESCELSA's indebtedness has been high with a conse-
quent high debt service, which has exceeded the utility's internally generated
funds. Despite its deteriorating returns, the utility has been able to (i) in-
crease the coverage of its debt service burden by gross internally generated
funds (from 0.7 in 1974 up to 1.0 in 1976); (ii) decrease the proportion of its
borrowings to its investments from 117% in 1974 to 77% in 1976; and (iii) de-
crease the proportion of debt in its capital structure (from 71% in 1974 to 64%
in 1976). This improvement has been due mainly to conversion to equity of part
of its debt to ELETROBRAS, and ELETROBRAS' additional capital investments. How-
ever, ESCELSA's 1976 finances still reflect an unsatisfactory coverage of its
debt service with internal cash generation and a relatively low self-financing
of its investment expenditures.
Investment and Financing Plans
5.05      The beneficiaries' financing plans for their 1978-81 investment
program are reasonable. Total consumer direct contributions (defined as
internal cash generation net of debt service, dividends and taxes, plus
capital contributions originating from reinvestment of consumer-based
resources) would amount to 20% of requirements in the case of CEMIG, 41% for
CELESC and 46% for ESCELSA. Existing and proposed loans from ELETROBRAS, IDB,
IBRD and other borrowings would provide 76% of CEMIG's requirements, 48% of
CELESC's and 54% of ESCELSA's. CEMIG and CELESC would receive a small amount
of additional equity contributions (not derived from consumer charges and
expected to be mostly from the respective states). The investment programs
and financing plans are summarized below and shown in more detail in Tables
5-1, 5-2 and 5-3. Financial projections were prepared in constant June 1977
Cruzeiros to ensure consistency with financial projections made by Brazilian
authorities for the electric power sector:

5.06      While a high proportion (72%) of the beneficiaries' total financial
requirements would come from borrowings, ELETROBRAS would provide about
49% of these funds, the bulk of which it would collect from power sector
consumers. Over the period 1978-81, about one-fourth of ELETROBRAS' loans
to the three beneficiaries would be offset by their reversion payments and
the balance of ELETROBRAS' loans would be more than offset by the companies'
collections from consumers on account of the sole tax and the compulsory loan.
The Bank has offered to assist ELETROBRAS in securing additional financing for
the project through cofinancing arrangements similar to those already approved
for Loan 1343-BR (ELETROSUL project), provided this would result in better
terms for ELETROBRAS than it would otherwise obtain.
5.07      The beneficiaries' financing programs also include loan financing
by suppliers and financial institutions (46% of borrowings) and drawdowns
of the existing IBRD loan to CEMIG and of the proposed loan (5% of borrowings).
The proposed US$130 million Bank loan would be made to ELETROBRAS for a term
of 15 years including 3 years grace. Of this amount US$58.1 million will
be on-lent to CEMIG, US$43.8 million to CELESC and US$28.1 million to
ESCELSA. The on-lending conditions provide for the same maturity, grace
period and repayment schedule as on the Bank loan; the interest rate to the
beneficiaries was assumed in the projections to be 8.5%. ELETROBRAS will
charge the beneficiaries a one-time commission of 1/2 of 1% on the loan
amounts, and service fees of 1/4 of 1% p.a. on the disbursed amount during
the disbursement period and 1/8% of 1% p.a. thereafter 1/. The beneficiaries
will assume the foreign exchange risks on the amounts outstanding. These
conditions are acceptable to the Bank. The terms assumed for all other
borrowings are in line with those customary for Brazilian power utilities
(Annex B T-8 to T-22).
5.08      The states of Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina, and Espirito Santo, and
their corresponding municipalities are required, by law, to invest in the
power sector 100% of the proceeds of the sole tax accruing to them. The
states of Santa Catarina and Minas Gerais have agreed to invest these funds in
CELESC and CEMIG respectively, while the State of Espirito Santo has agreed to
invest 90% of these funds in ESCELSA; in addition, the state of Santa Catarina
has agreed to reinvest in CELESC all the dividends it may receive from the
utility while the states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo to reinvest in CEMIG
and ESCELSA, respectively, 90% of the dividends they may receive from the re-
spective utilities. CEMIG's financing plan assumes that a relatively small
proportion (4%) of its requirements would be covered by equity contributions
by the state government and private investors. CEMIG has had no difficulty
in raising equity to finance a similar share of its investments in the past.
CELESC is assuming (proportionately) much larger equity investments by the
Santa Catarina State government 2/, and the latter has agreed to pay in equal
quarterly installments, these equity investments (over and above amounts in-
vested from the proceeds of the sole tax and reinvestment of CELESC dividends).

a condition of the first disbursement of the CELESC portion of the loan. In
addition, the States of Minas Gerais and Santa Catarina have agreed that if
their respective beneficiary (CEMIG and CELESC) would not have sufficient funds
to assure the timely completion of the Bank project, they will provide such funds
as may be required in a form satisfactory to the Bank. ELETROBRAS has assumed a
similar obligation with regard to ESCELSA. The Federal Government has also
agreed to make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for providing funds to
complete the project if the funds available to any of the beneficiaries are
insufficient for this purpose.
5.09      The investment programs shown in para. 5.05 include sizeable expendi-
tures for projects which have yet to be justified in detail and for which
financing has not yet been obtained.  To ensure that the Bank is given an
adequate opportunity to review these projects prior to their being firmly
committed, the beneficiaries have agreed that they will not undertake any
maijor projects until the completion of the proposed distribution project,
unless they have provided evidence satisfactory to the Bank that the project
is economically justified; that the beneficiary has adequate financial resources
to carry it out: and that: (a) in the case of generation and major transmission
projects, it is in accordance with plans for power generation and transmission
approved by ELETROBRAS for the Southeast and South regions of Brazil; and
(ti) in other cases, that it has been approved by DNAEE. A major expansion
project would be defined as one costing more than 2% of the beneficiary's gross
revalued fixed assets in operation plus works in progress in the case of genera-
tion and transmission and 1% in the case of distribution.
Financial Outlook
5.10      CEMIG has prepared its financial projections under the conservative
assumption of a 10% return on remunerable investment. In the past DNAEE
has been responsive to CEMIG's needs and has allowed it to earn average
returns above the 10% minimum (12% in 1977). A 10% return is expected to
generate revenue levels which will cover comfortably the utility's operating
expenses with an improving trend.
5.11      As a result of increasing borrowing needs, CEMIG's debt service
load is expected to absorb a growing proportion of its resources; thus, debt
service coverage is expected to decline from 1.4 times in 1977 to 1.2 times
by 1980. CEMIG's increasing borrowing needs are expected to bring a con-
curent decrease in equity as a proportion of long-term capitalization, and
in net internally generated funds as a proportion of financing requirements.
The situation is now expected to be unsatisfactory in 1980-81, when debt
service will increase at a much faster rate than gross internal cash genera-
tion, largely because of the need to start repaying ELETROBRAS loans for
the Sao Simao project. CEMIG's future finances would improve if DNAEE
continues to authorize tariffs designed to provide a 12% return on remuner-
able assets; another positive factor would be deferral of the Igarapava
and Nova Ponte hydro projects (para. 4.03). The trend in CEMIG's financial
indicators is a matter of concern and the Bank will continue to monitor
closely the utility's financial position over the project construction period.
In addition to the review of CEMIG's plans for future capital expenditures



- 37 -
(para. 5.09), CEMIG has agreed to be bound by a debt limitation covenant
which provides that the Bank's agreement must be obtained before the
utility incurs long-term borrowings whenever its annual internal cash
generation is less than 1.5 times its maximum future debt service require-
ment. In view of the large number of loan contracts entered into annually
by CEMIG, the Bank and CEMIG have agreed on a simplified procedure for the
administration of this covenant, which provides for the Bank's review and
approval of the company's borrowing on an annual basis rather than contract
by contract.
5.12      CEMIG  has agreed to provide to the Bank for comment by June 30, 1979,
A review of its investment and financing plans for the remainder of the project
construction period, which will include proposals for achieving an annual debt
service coverage of at least 1.5 times in those years. The Federal Government,
the State of Minas Gerais and ELETROBRAS have agreed to cooperate in the
review. CEMIG, the State and Federal Governments and ELETROBRAS would make
their best efforts to implement the proposals developed in the course of the
review.
5.13      As in the case of the other beneficiaries, CELESC has prepared
its financial projections (Table 5-2) assuming a 10% return on remunerable
investment; this implies that CELESC would obtain an average
financial return of 15.5% over 1977-81. This return, aided by an increase in
the average maturity of its borrowing portfolio (from 8.3 years in 1976 up
to 9.6 years by 1982) which results in part from the terms of the proposed
Bank loan, would allow CELESC to (i) finance an increasing proportion of
its investment program with consumer direct contributions (from 28% in 1977
to 51% by 1981) with a 1977-81 average of 38% which is acceptable, and
(ii) decrease the debt portion of its capital from 46% in 1977 to 39% by 1981.
The increased internal generation of funds implies an acceptable coverage of
debt service which improves from 1.5 in 1977 to 1.7 by 1981. CELESC has
agreed to a debt limitation covenant similar to the one described in para.
5.11 for CEMIG.
5.14      The financial forecasts for ESCELSA (Table 5-3) are based on the
assumption that ELETROBRAS would convert enough of its existing loans to
ESCELSA into equity 1/, to enable the company to achieve an annual debt service
coverage ratio of at least 1.5 . ELETROBRAS would furnish to the
Bank, as a condition of disbursement on ESCELSA's part of the project a plan
of action to enable ESCELSA to achieve this ratio. ELETROBRAS and ESCELSA
agreed to take the necessary action to achieve this ratio annually during the
project construction period,should the Bank request such action. The action
could take the form of additional equity investments and/or conversion of a
portion of ESCELSA's debt into equity.
5.15      ESCELSA's forecasts show that it would be able to decrease its reliance
on borrowings and by 1981 would be able to finance 36% of its total requirements
with internally generated funds, and 52% with consumer direct contributions (a
1977-81 average of 42%). As a result, the proportion of debt in its capitaliza-
tion would decrease from 72% in 1977 to 53% in 1981. ESCELSA has agreed to a
debt limitation covenant similar to the one described in para. 5.11 for CEMIG.

Performance Indicators and Reporting
5.16      The 1978-81 investment program is expected to make electricity
available to industrial customers as well as rural and low income urban
dwellers. The organization studies and training are expected to assist in
strengthening CELESC's and ESCELSA's management and to provide them with a
solid institutional base to carry out their role in the development of their
respective states. The targets indicated in Annex B, T-23 will be used to
monitor the utilities' performance toward meeting these objectives during the
project construction period.
5.17      ELEITROBRAS and the beneficiaries have agreed:
(a) to provide financial statements audited by independent
accountants acceptable to the Bank together with a report
on the audit, not later than four months after the end of
each fiscal year; and
(b) to prepare such other reports as the Bank may reasonably request,
including project completion reports.

CHAPTER 6
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      The expansion program of the subtransmission and distribution
facilities is commensurate with the expected growth rate of sales on
different parts of the systems, and duly takes into account the concen-
tration of loads, the state of existing facilities and the particular re-
quirements of specific customers. For some of the equipment included in the
program, such as transformers or meters, no reasonable alternative exists.
Where alternatives do exist, e.g. in routing, sizing or voltage of transmission
lines and location and reserve capacities of substations, the utilities have
selected the least-cost solution which is compatible with safety and environ-
mental considerations. The use of underground high voltage lines is limited
to those cases where urban congestion makes it impractical to build aerial
lines. The use of double circuits is limited to feeding the most important
substations. Spare capacity at substations is normally limited to about 20%
over peak loading.
Return on Investment
6.02      The return on investment was estimated as the discount rate which
equates the present values of the benefits and costs stemming from the com-
bined 1978-1981 investment program of the three utilities as well as those
of each individual program. Benefits were measured by the forecast revenues
from the sales of electricity at the retail levels, using the tariffs in effect
as at December 1976 plus the sole tax. CEMIG's investment program for the
period is a balanced one and includes sizable investments for generation
and transmission. CELESC's and ESCELSA's programs include only distribution
items; however, the related generation and transmission investments are
included in the cost of energy purchased from their bulk suppliers. The
equalizing discount rate for the combined program is about 17% as are the
equalizing rates for CEMIG's and ESCELSA's individual programs, while that
pertaining to CELESC's program is about 15%. These discount rates compare
favorably with the opportunity cost of capital for Brazil, estimated to be
11%. The equalizing rates obtained understate the real economic rate of
return of the programs, as revenues from the sales of electricity do not fully
measure some of the benefits to society, such as social benefits of residential
and public uses, or the indirect benefits to industry and commerce, whose
production and employment depend on a reliable electricity supply. Table T-24
of Annex B contains the cost and benefit streams used in the calculations; the
underlying assumptions appear as footnotes to the table.
6.03      These results are based on economic efficiency prices for all inputs
except labor and foreign exchange. The use of efficiency prices for labor
would increase the rate of return. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to
determine whether any rate of exchange, other than US$1 = Cr$ 14.35, which was
the official rate as of June 30, 1977, would materially change the results.
The results of this analysis, reproduced below, indicate that the rate of
return is not significantly affected by changes in the foreign exchange rate.

6.04      Sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the effect on
the rate of return of variations in the following parameters: (a) the
cost of the program; (b) operating costs; (c) time required to start obtain-
ing the expected benefits; (d) average tariff to consumers; and (e) the amount
of energy sold1 due to facilities built under the program--either because of
variations in the rate of growth of the market, the number of years in which
the new facilities reach their capacity or in the percentage of sales made
through these facilities or a combination of these variables. Factors (a), (b)
and (c) reflect risks which are, to some extent, subject to control by the
beneficiaries, while (d) depends on Government tariff regulation and (e) -
aLnd to some extent (c) - is related to the accuracy of demand forecasts.
The results, which indicate rates of return which compare favorably with
the opportunity cost of capital for all likely variations in these parameters,
are shown in the graphs of Figure 6.1. It may be noted, however, that the
return on CELESC's and ESCELSA's components of the project is highly sensitive
to variations in the price of purchased energy. As noted in Chapter 2 and
paras. 4.14 and 4.20, CELESC and ESCELSA will engage consultants to assist
with project implementation and with the strengthening of their organization,
thus reducing the incidence of risk factors under their control. The other
risks are believed to be within acceptable limits. Any increase in the cost
of purchased energy would be analyzed by the Brazilian authorities in the
ciontext of the applicable legislation and would be most likely offset by
corresponding increases in the level of retail rates.
6,05      From all of the above, it may be concluded that the rate of return
oni investment :Ln the combined program, of which the project is part, and on
the individual program of each utility is adequate and that it is not signif-
icantly affected by possible misjudgements of the basic parameters which
determine it.

CHAPTER 7
SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached with the Federal and
State Governments, ELETROBRAS and the Beneficiaries, as applicable, on the
following principal points:
(a)  the beneficiaries will maintain their earnings at levels
consistent with sound financial and utility practices and in
accordance with existing legislation and will maintain their
e].&ibility for transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund;
the Federal Government will cause DNAEE to take timely action
on the beneficiaries' requests for tariff adjustments and
transfers and DNAEE will exercise its statutory powers to
allow the beneficiaries a return on remunerable assets of
at least 10%; any change in legislation which would materially
and adversely affect the beneficiaries' financial position
would be an event of default (para. 1.23);
(b)  ELETROBRAS will review regularly and report every six months on
progress of the project and on the beneficiaries' performance
(para. 2.03);
(c)  CELESC and ESCELSA will prepare an improvement program, with the
assistance of consultants, by June 30, 1979 and implement it
thereafter (paras. 2.20 and 2.28);
(d)  the beneficiaries will offer financing to low income consumers
who have access to service but are not currently connected
(para. 4.07);
(e)  ELETROBRAS will onlend the proceeds of the loan to the bene-
ficiaries under satisfactory terms and conditions (para. 5.07);
(f)  the states of Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina and Espirito Santo
will invest, in CEMIG, CELESC and ESCELSA, respectively, at least
90% of the proceeds of the sole tax and reinvest in the beneficiaries
at least 90% of the dividends they may receive from the beneficiaries
(para. 5.08);
(g)  the state of Santa Catarina will make equity contributions to
CELESC (para. 5.08);
(h)  the states of Minas Gerais and Santa Catarina and ELETROBRAS will
provide CEMIG, CELESC and ESCELSA, respectively, with such funds
as may be required to assure the timely completion of the project
(para. 5.08);



- 49 -
(i)  the beneficiaries will not undertake any major project, unless
they provide evidence satisfactory to the Bank that such con-
struction is justified technically and economically and that they
have secured the necessary financial resources (para. 5.09);
(j)  the beneficiaries agreed not to incur any long-term debt without
consulting the Bank unless their gross internal cash generation
cover their maximum future debt service at least 1.5 times
(paras. 5.11, 5.13 and 5.15);
(k)  CEMIG will provide to the Bank a review of its investment and
financing plans; ELETROBRAS- and the Federal and State Governments
will participate in this review (para. 5.12); and
(1)  ELETROBRAS will, at the Bank's request, maintain ESCELSA's annual
debt service coverage at 1.5 (para. 5.14).
7.02      Before declaring the loan effective, the Bank should receive satis-
factory evidence that at least one Project Agreement between the Bank and a
beneficiary, the related Shareholder Agreement with the State, and the related
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between ELETROBRAS and such beneficiary, are effective
and legally binding upon the parties thereto.
7.03      The following are disbursement conditions in respect of the several
portions of the loan allocated to the respective beneficiary:
(a)  receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Bank that the'respective
Project Agreement, Shareholder Agreement, and Subsidiary Loan
Agreement related to each beneficiary is effective and legally
binding;
(b)  in relation to the CELESC and ESCELSA portions, that they have
engaged consultants to conduct studies regarding their respective
organizations and to assist them with 138 kV facilities (paras.
2.20, 2.28 and 4.14);
(c)  in relation to the CELESC portion, that payments from the State
of Santa Catarina of its equity contribution to CELESC have been
kept current (para. 5.08); and
(d)  -in relation to the ESCELSA portion, that ELETROBRAS has furnished
the Bank a plan of action satisfactory to the Bank to enable
ESCELSA to achieve for 1978 and thereafter, until completion of
its portion of the project an annual debt service coverage ratio
of 1.5 (para. 5.14).
7.04      With the above agreements, the project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$130 million equivalent. The loan would
be paid over a period of 15 years including 3 years of grace.
March 10, 1978

ELETROBRAS' Financial Statements
1.        This annex contains the following summarized tables, each covering
the years 1971 to 1976:
T-1: Balance Sheets
T-2: Statement of Income
T-3:  Sources and Application of Funds
2.        On December 31, 1976, ELETROBRAS' share capital was represented by
21,665,120,511 common shares and 334,879,489 preferred shares, with a par value
of Cr$1.00 each. The preferred shares have no voting rights and are not con-
vertible into common shares. The preferred shares Class A (subscribed up to
June 23, 1969) have the right to a minimum dividend of 2% per year plus the
legal rate o:E remuneration of investments in electricity companies. The pre-
ferred shares Class B (subscribed after June 23, 1969) have priority to a
minimum dividend of 6% per year. During recent years a 12% dividend has been
paid on preferred shares and 9% dividend on common shares based on the par
value of Cr$1.00. The Federal Government owns 99.6% of all the shares.
3.        The balance sheets (Table 1) indicate a consistently high capital/
total debt ratio which, together with a 20-year average remaining repayment
period of its debt reflect a satisfactory long-term liquidity situation.
4.        The statements of income (Table 2) indicate sustained low operating
costs (ranging from 5% to 10% including depreciation and taxes) and a satis-
factory interest coverage, which has exceeded five times the annual interest
charges over 1971-1975 (4.3 times in 1976). Net income of Cr$4,340 million
in 1976 (about US$300 million equivalent 1/) represent a 14.6% return on
average equity.
5.        The Source and Applications of Funds Statements (Table 3) show a
satisfactory debt service coverage. ELETROBRAS' total requirements were
covered as follows in the period 1971-1976:
1/   As of June 30, 1977:  Cr$14.35 = US$1.

6.        ELETROBRAS is supposed to receive a declining proportion of the
proceeds of the sole tax (from 36% in 1974 down to 18% in 1979) but is seeking
to be permitted to continue to utilize a high proportion of the Federal
Government's share of this resource.  Its other sources of funds should
increase in line with the growth of power sales and are protected against
inflation by the provisions of the Brazilian power legislation.
