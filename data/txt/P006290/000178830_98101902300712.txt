7.45% per annum.
Relending Terms to
Beneficiaries:    ELETRtOBRAS would relend the proceeds of the loan to the
beneficiaries with the same interest rate, maturity and
grace period as the Bank loan; the beneficiaries would
pay to ELETROBRAS a one-time commission of 1/2 of 1% on
the principal amount, and service fees of 1/4 of 1% per

Project
Description:       The project is part of the program for the expansion of
the power subtransmission and distribution systems during
the years 1978 through 1981 of three public electric power
utilities in the South and Southeast of Brazil: Centrais
Eletricas de Minas Gerais S.A. (CEMIG), Centrais Eletricas
de Santa Catarina S.A. (CELESC), and Espirito Santo
Centrais Eletricas S.A. (ESCELSA). The utilities' overall
program, of which the project forms a part, will provide
the facilities required to serve the expected loads in
the respective utilities' service areas, mostly related
to industrial growth. The program will also be instru-
mental in making public service electricity available to
about 62,000 new low-income urban consumers and in connect-
ing about 48,000 new rural consumers.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS S.A. - ELETROBRAS
FOR A SOUTH-SOUTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. - ELETROBRAS with the guarantee of the
Federative Republic of BraLzil for the equivalent of US$130.0 million to help
finance a power distribution project.  The loan would have a term of 15 years,
including 3 years of grace, with interest at 7.45% per annum. ELETROBRAS
would relend the proceeds of the loan, on the same terms plus commissions (see
para. 65), to three state utility companies in the South and Southeast of
Brazil, Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais S.A. (CEMIG), Centrais Eletricas de
Santa Catarina S.A. (CELESC), and Espirito Santo Centrais Eletricas S.A.
(ESCELSA).
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report, entitled "Economic Memorandum on Brazil" (1665a-BR), dated
October 13, 1977, was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 21,
1977. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I to this report.
3.        The late 1960s and early 1970s were years of remarkable economic
growth and development for Brazil. The 10% average annual rate of growth
in GDP during this period was accompanied by a strong balance-of-payments
performance. The dollar value of exports rose by 300% from 1967 to 1973 and a
process of export diversification significantly reduced Brazil's dependence
upon coffee as the single primary source of foreign exchange earnings. At the
same time, inflation was brought progressively under control. During the
early 1970s prices rose aLt less than 20% per annum on average -- a considerable
improvement upon the inflation of a decade earlier. The crawling peg exchange
rate combined with widespread monetary correction and indexation of financial
instruments helped to minimize the distortions which often accompany inflation
(although indexing makes it more difficult to reduce the level of inflation).
4.        The world economic crisis of 1974 marked a turning point in the
recent economic performance of Brazil. Although growth continued at 9.5% in
that year, it proved impossible to maintain the good balance-of-payments
performance that had accompanied growth in previous years. The continuation
of expansionary policies during 1974 in the context of a sharp deterioration
in the terms of trade resulted in a trade deficit amounting to US$4.7 billion.
The elimination of that deficit has been a major objective of economic policy
since that time. To this end the Government fortified simultaneously its
policies of export promoltion and of import substitution. As a result of these
policies, the trade gap closed progressively year by year. In 1977 excep-
tionally high coffee prices contributed towards a strong increase of export
1/   This section is substantially unchanged from the section on the economy
in the President's Report on the Sao Paulo Sewage Collection and Treat-
ment Project (No. P-2208-BR) distributed to the Executive Directors on
February 15, 1978, except that paragraph 8 has been added.

revenues and the trade gap was eliminated entirely in that year. It is pro-
jected that the trade gap will remain closed even though coffee prices have
already rolled back significantly from the high levels prevailing in early
1977. This expectation is predicated on a major effort to expand other
exports, particularly of manufactured goods.
5.        Inflation is another problem that has become a focus of attention
in recent years. Sharp rises in the prices of petroleum and other imported
goods in 1974 gave an added impetus to inflationary pressures which were
already building up in the Brazilian economy even prior to the world economic
crisis. Inflation increased in 1974 and continued to accelerate in the sub-
sequent two years reaching a peak of 46% in 1976. The Government has employed
a wide range of monetary and fiscal instruments to combat inflation. Partic-
ularly significant is the much greater control now exercised by the Federal
Government over the investment programs of public sector decentralized agencies.
There is evidence that these policies are having effect. Inflation for 1977
was some 39%, and in the second half of 1977 inflation slowed to a rate of
some 30% on an annual basis. If the Government continues to exercise careful
control over monetary and fiscal policy, further headway against inflation
is likely.
6.        Brazil's economic performance since 1974 has been deeply affected
by balance-of-payments constraints. Growth fluctuated sharply from 4.2% in
1975 to 8.7% in 1976 and down again to 6% in 1977 as the Government searched
for an appropriate balance between expansion on the one hand and, on the other
hand, the need to resolve difficulties in the balance of payments and in the
domestic inflationary situation. The Government recognizes the need for con-
tinued moderation in growth during the next two or three years if inflation
is to be kept under control, the balance of payments is to be further improved
and a sound basis for longer term development is to be preserved. It is
projected that growth may average little more than 6% during the remaining
years of the decade. Beyond that, however, there is every indication that
Brazil has the potential to sustain higher levels of growth provided (a) that
reasonable expansion of output and trade takes place in the industrial coun-
tries, and (b) that sound economic policies are consistently pursued in Brazil.
In this respect the Government's development strategy provides a sound frame-
work for future development.
7.        The second National Development Plan (1975-79) was published in the
wake of the world petroleum crisis and incorporates a sectoral development
strategy which focuses sharply upon relieving Brazil's balance-of-payments
constraints in the longer term. The export potential of agriculture received
explicit recognition in the development plan and the results achieved over
the past several years (particularly in soya production) justify the priority
given to this sector. Agriculture constitutes a vehicle for raising the
living standards of the rural poor and for developing the vast frontier lands
of Brazil's interior. In the case of industry, sophisticated incentive schemes
have been introduced to encourage exports. However, Brazil's industrial devel-
opment strategy now concentrates upon import-substitution programs in steel,
non-ferrous metals, petrochemicals, fertilizers and capital goods. Brazil
aims at self-sufficiency in many of these products by the early 1980s. Beyond
that point these same industries may develop a good export potential.



8.        Public sector investment accounts for more than half of total
fixed investment in the IBrazilian economy. Federal investment is heavily
concentrated in infrastructure and basic industry. These two areas together
account for about 70% of total investment by federal Government agencies and
enterprises. Regional development and social programs absorb most of the
remaining 30 percent. Until 1975, the rapid expansion of public investment
reflected a heavy emphasLs on road construction and regional development. The
2nd National Development Plan (1975-79) added a massive program of import
substitution in basic industrial inputs, and an acceleration in the pace of
social programs. Since 1977, however, severe restraints have been placed on
public investment, in order to reduce a growing public sector savings gap and
the accompanying balance of payments deficit. The sectors most affected are
road and rail transport, whose ambitious expansion plans have been cut back
sharply. Investments in eletric power, on the other hand, are maintained at
a high level, and in basic industries such as steel, non-ferrous metals and
petroleum, are being stepped up considerably. The share of regional develop-
ment programs in total federal investment has now stabilized at about 7%. The
percentage allocated to social investment is increasing gradually, reflecting
continued expansion of federal investment in housing, water supply and sewer-
age, and other urban development programs. State and municipal governments
also devote a substantial portion of their resources to health, education,
welfare and other social services.
9.        Despite its impressive growth performance and vast future potential,
Brazil is still a country with extensive poverty. The present Government
acknowledges the country's poverty problem and accepts responsibility for its
alleviation. While, like the previous Government, it believes that a high
rate of growth is necessary to increase the incomes of the poor, it does not
believe that the "trickle down" effects of rapid growth are enough and has
formulated a new policy which could be labeled as "redistribution with growth."
To implement this policy, in addition to pursuing some of the social programs
initiated by its predecessor, the Government is taking new measures in three
broad areas: (a) regional development; (b) provision of social services; and
(c) wage policy. In addLition, recent tax changes have tended to have a
favorable, albeit marginal, impact on income distribution.
10.       As one of its measures to help promote development in poorer regions,
the Government has formtulated a program known as POLONORDESTE for rural devel-
opment in the Northeast. The program which covers the 1975-79 period is
designed to raise the productivity and incomes of small farmers through inter
alia, formulation and execution of integrated rural development projects,
which in some cases inc]Lude changes in land tenure. POLONORDESTE is based
on the assumption that the rural Northeast cannot be regarded as a homogeneous
whole. Therefore, the Government has identified 31 sub-regions covering large
portions of the Northeast on which POLONORDESTE funds would be used initially.
The Bank has made loans for integrated rural development in two of these sub-
regions, a third is presently before the Executive Directors, and others are
in preparation.
11.       In the area of social services, the Government has created a new
Ministry of Social Security in order to consolidate its social benefit pro-
grams and to extend these programs to a larger share of the population. The
Government is also strengthening the nutrition program which, under the



- 4 -
previous Government, got off to a slow start. Greater emphasis is being given
by the National Housing Bank to low-income housing, the beneficiaries of which
will enjoy better financial terms than in the past. The Housing Bank is also
developing a site and services program to encourage construction of self-help
housing by families that cannot afford builder-constructed units. In agri-
culture, the recently reorganized rural extension agency will expand and
strengthen its activities directed specifically toward the small-scale farmer;
and the new federal agriculture research institution is defining its program
to include a selection of crops and farming systems which will ensure that
small-scale farms benefit from research efforts. In November 1974, the
Government revised the formula governing the adjustment of the union wage
scale and real minimum wage was increased in 1975 and again in 1976. While
in 1977 the Government restricted wage increases as part of a policy package
designed to control overall demand and to combat inflation, this does not
signify any basic change in its longer term goal of improving income distri-
bution.
12.       In order to achieve the twin goals of high growth and an improved
distribution of income, Brazil will continue to require large inflows of
capital in the medium-term future. These inflows should be less than in the
recent past, however. Compared with a US$6 billion annual average for 1974-76,
it is estimated that the annual net inflow of medium- and long-term capital
(that is, direct foreign investment and net disbursements from official and
private sources) may be in the order of US$4.5 billion for 1977-80. This
projection assumes that it will be possible to sustain and subsequently
improve upon the trade balance achieved in 1977, with export volume rising
at an average rate of 11.5% annually in 1977-80, and import growth held down
to only 2.8% a year in real terms during this period. The outlook for
Brazil's principal export commodities is quite favorable for the next several
years, and it is expected that the good overall export performance projected
here can be achieved, provided that the country continues to follow present
exchange rate policies to ensure the competitiveness of manufactured exports.
On the import side, several major import-substitution programs are already
having a notable impact. The further development of these programs should
enable Brazil to continue to restrain imports without jeopardizing growth.
13.       On December 31, 1977, Brazil's estimated public external debt
amounted to about US$16.6 billion and the public debt service ratio for 1977
is estimated at some 19%. This is somewhat higher than the 15% average public
debt service ratio estimated for the first half of the 1970s and reflects a
higher proportion of medium-term financial credits within the overall debt
structure. Total external debt (both public and private) registered by the
Central Bank at end-1977 is estimated at US$29.5 billion and somewhat over
two-thirds of this debt (some US$20 billion) is in the form of financial
credits. The net debt service ratio on total external debt during 1977 was
about 41% compared with an average of 38% during the early 1970s. However,
net foreign exchange reserves at the end of 1977 were about US$7.0 billion,
equivalent to some six months' imports of goods and non-factor services and
sufficient to cover nearly one quarter of the total outstanding external debt.
Despite Brazil's heavy debt service burden the substantial level of foreign
exchange reserves ensure that the country will have the liquidity to meet its



debt service obligations in the short term. The breakdown between public and
private debt in the longer run can be projected only tentatively. Much will
depend upon the extent to which the Government will extend its guarantee to
loans contracted externally by non-government entities. Even assuming that
a government guarantee will be granted in an increasing number of cases, it
is projected tentatively that the public debt service ratio will peak in the
late 1970s at about 20%. Subsequently, a fall to about 16% by 1985 is
projected, assuming that Brazil can increase the value of its exports by an
average of 17% per annum over the period 1980-85 and that the average maturities
of new financial credits gradually improve from six to eight years. The
country's record of financial and economic management provides grounds for
confidence in the maintenance of creditworthiness over the longer run. Never-
theless, there can be no doubt that very careful management of the external
accounts will continue tc) be necessary.
PART II - BANK OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
14.       As of January 31, 1978 the Bank had approved 74 loans for Brazil,
amounting to US$3,199.4 million, of which 38 were not yet fully disbursed.
During FY65-69, disbursements averaged only US$10 million per year, increasing
to an average of US$136 million per year during FY70-74, reaching US$225 million
in FY74, US$248 million :in FY75 and US$202 million in FY76. US$267 million
was disbursed in FY77 and US$129.3 million in the first half of FY78. The
decline in disbursements in FY76 was due primarily to the reduced level of
lending in FY73-74. Disbursements are expected to increase during the next
few years. Annex II conitains a summary statement of Bank loans as of January
31, 1978 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
15.       Since FY75, new loans to Brazil have amounted to between US$400
and US$500 million per year. In FY75, five loans were made totalling US$426.5
million; and in FY76 ten loans totalling US$498 million. In FY77, seven loans
totalling US$425 million were approved: US$40 million for a second Minas
Gerais water supply and sewerage project, US$83 million for a second agro-
industries credit project, US$82 million for power transmission in the south
of Brazil, US$42 million for an integrated rural development project in the
State of Minas Gerais, US$64 million for a nitrogen fertilizer project, US$82
million for a phosphate fertilizer project, and US$32 million for a vocational
training project. So far in FY78, the Bank has approved a loan of US$17 mil-
lion for a rural development project in the State of Ceara, and a loan of
US$110 million for a sewage collection and treatment project for Sao Paulo.
At present, a loan of US$24 million for a rural development project in the
State of Paraiba is before the Executive Directors. Work is relatively
advanced on the preparation of a highways maintenance and rehabilitation
project, an urban transport project, a petrochemicals project, an agricultural
extension project, a rural development project in the State of Bahia, and an
aluminum project.
16.       Of Brazil's external public debt outstanding and disbursed at the
end of 1977, estimated at US$16.6 billion, the Bank held about 8.5%. The
Bank's share of the service on this debt was about 4.5%. If present trends



- 6 -
continue, as expected, the Bank's share of total external public debt out-
standing would increase to 12% by 1980. The Bank's share of public debt
service would rise in 1980 to about 6% while its share of Brazil's total
(public and private) external debt service would remain at the present level
of 2.8%.
17.       IFC has committed more financial resources to Brazil than to any
other country. As of January 31, 1978, IFC had made commitments to Brazil,
totalling US$332 million, of which US$203 million had been cancelled, repaid
or sold. Of the balance of US$129 million, US$102 million represents loans
and US$27 million equity. A summary of IFC's investments as of January 31,
1978, is given in Annex II.
Lending Strategy
18.       In its lending to Brazil, the Bank has sought to help the Government
achieve a number of important development objectives which are interdependent
and complementary. One of the Bank's lending objectives in Brazil is to
support institutional development and policy reform designed to develop
rational policies and procedures, establish adequate coordination and control,
and help maximize public savings and ensure that they are used economically.
The institution-building objective is one of the principal aims of the pro-
posed electric power distribution loan. It is also an important objective in
Bank assistance for vocational training, and for the transportation sector
where emphasis has been given to the rational selection of investments, the
strengthening of railway operations, and the improvement of the railways'
financial performance. Loans for industrial finance, highways, agricultural
research and extension, and urban development also have important institution-
building objectives.
19.       Another important lending objective in Brazil is to help to intensify
the efforts of the Government to identify and develop projects that will
increase productivity and incomes of the lowest income segment of the popula-
tion, to broaden the economic opportunities open to those groups, and to
improve their living conditions. The loans in preparation for integrated
rural development projects in the Northeast, including the proposed loan for
the Paraiba Rural Development Project presently before the Executive Directors,
are addressed to this objective. They would provide credit, productive
services, and social and physical infrastructure to low-income farmers and
small-scale enterprises. The recently approved loans for nutrition research
and development, vocational training, agricultural research and polders
construction in the Lower Sao Francisco Valley as well as for integrated rural
development in the states of Rio Grande do Norte, Minas Gerais and Ceara were
all designed to assist low-income groups in rural areas. The recently approved
loan for sewage collection and treatment in Sao Paulo will expand elementary
sanitation services for a low-income urban population. Additional projects
designed to assist low-income groups are in preparation, including an agricul-
tural extension project, a rural education project in the Northeast, additional
integrated rural development projects in the Northeast, and several projects
which will reach low-income groups in urban areas: an urban transport project,
a sites and services project, sewerage and water supply projects in several
northeastern states, and a medium-sized cities development project.



20.       Another lending objective is to ease the foreign exchange constraint
on development, a constraint that has become more critical since the increase
in petroleum prices, by supporting projects designed to increase Brazil's
export capacity and, where economical, to substitute domestic production for
imports. As a result of the deterioration in Brazil's terms of trade and
balance of payments which took place at the time of the 1974 energy crisis,
this objective was placed in the forefront of the Government's economic policy.
Lending for the electric power sector very much supports this objective,
since it is based primarily on hydroelectric energy, and its development
lessens the need for petroleum imports. Bank support of fertilizer projects
is assisting Brazil to substitute imports with large-scale efficient domestic
production and aid its balance-of-payments position. Bank lending for
agro-industries in the Center and South of Brazil is also supporting this
objective and much of the Bank-assisted investment in the transport sector --
railways, ports and highways -- is designed to facilitate the smooth and
economical flow of exports.  Support of the steel expansion program is
helping Brazil to expand domestic output of a traditional import commodity
which can be produced efficiently in Brazil due to the country's ample
supply of high-grade iron ore and the scale of its internal markets. A
similar objective would be achieved through the petrochemical and aluminum
projects now being prepared.
21.       A final objective which applies to all Bank lending to Brazil is
to provide part of the very large volume of medium- and long-term capital
inflows that Brazil has needed and will continue for some years to need in
order to sustain rapid growth and achieve its employment creation and
regional development objectives. Continued active lending by the Bank in
Brazil is regarded by the international financial community as an important
sign of confidence in Brazil and encourages them to continue their own
programs there. In some sectors, especially in electric power and industry,
Bank participation is helping Brazil obtain additional resources in greater
amounts and on more favorable terms from bilateral credit agencies and private
financial institutions. Five co-financing operations for Brazil, totalling
US$204 million, have been concluded since 1976 with private financial insti-
tutions and another three are in an advanced stage of preparation.
PART III - THE SECTOR
Energy Resources and Consumption
22.       The principal source of energy used in Brazil is petroleum, which in
1976 accounted for abouit 44% of total energy consumption (estimated to be
105 x 1013 kcal). Prestently about 82% of the country's petroleum requirements
are covered by imports. The sudden rise in world oil prices in 1973 and 1974
caused an increase of about US$2 billion in Brazil's annual import bill. In
response to this, petroLeum exploration has been intensified by the national
oil company, PETROBRAS, which has also enlisted the help of foreign oil
companies which are exploring under risk contracts. On a conservative
assumption as to future production Brazil's dependence on imported petroleum
may decline to around 6:3% by 1985.



- 8 -
23.       In 1976, 24% of all energy consumption was of hydraulic origin.
Brazil is endowed with one of the largest hydro potentials in the world,
estimated at about 150,000 MW of which only about 18,400 MW have been devel-
oped; plants with an additional capacity of 30,000 MW are under construction
or are planned to be installed by 1990. Further economic utilization of hydro
resources would require construction of long transmission lines. Nuclear
power is expected to play a major role in power generation after 1990. The
first unit of 600 MW is expected to be in operation in 1979, and an additional
2,400 MW is expected to be commissioned by 1985.
24.       Other fuels used include firewood, charcoal and sugar cane bagasse,
which contribute about 29% of Brazil's energy consumption. Their usage is
expected to remain stable and thus they will represent a rapidly decreasing
proportion of total energy consumption. Coal and gas accounted for 3% of
usage in 1976. Coal extraction is costly because shaft mining is necessary.
Other sources of energy are of insignificant importance at present. Known
reserves of natural gas are modest. Few sites for tidal energy can be found
along the Brazilian coast and there are no known sources of geothermal energy.
25.       The southern and southeastern regions combined, with 60% of Brazil's
population, consumed in 1976 about 78% of all energy and 85% of electric
energy. Electric energy consumption in these regions has grown at a rate of
about 11.7% p.a. in the last five years, mainly due to the rapid increase
of industrial use. Consumption is expected to grow at an average rate of
10% p.a. through 1985 and the per capita consumption should reach 2,300 kWh
by that year (compared to 1,350 kWh in 1976).
The Role of the Power Sector in the Economy
26.       The continued growth of reliable electric service is essential for
the development of the country's industries, which in 1977 used 57% of all
electric energy consumed while accounting for about 40% of Brazil's GDP,
contributing about 45% of export earnings and providing for about 33% of
all non-agricultural employment. The rate of growth of electricity consump-
tion was 1.20 times that of GDP for the period 1962-75 while from 1970-75, it
was 1.28 times that of GDP. From 1974 through 1977, electricity consumption
grew at about 12% p.a. while GDP grew at about 7% p.a., reflecting a trend of
substitution of eletricity for other forms of energy following the petroleum
price increases in 1973 and 1974 (see para. 22).
Sector Organization and Regulation
27.       The Brazilian power sector, though large and complex, is well
organized and its policies are generally well designed and implemented. The
sector is regulated by the National Department of Water and Electric Energy
(DNAEE), while operations and financing are in the hands of Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBRAS) and federal, state, municipal and private
utilities, all under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).



- 9 -
28.       DNAEE is a powerful instrument for implementation of national policy
since it grants licenses for hydroelectric sites, assigns concession areas,
sets tariffs (subject to approval by the Interministerial Price Commission)
and approves expansion plans. ELETROBRAS performs the functions of (a) a hold-
ing company for those utilities owned by the Federal Government; (b) a finan-
cial institution administering and allocating public funds among its subsid-
iaries and electric utilities owned by state governments, and coordinating
sector borrowings from abroad; (c) a planning body responsible for the overall
planning of sector development; and (d) a coordinating and consulting agency
assisting the development of the country's electrification programs by providing
technical, managerial and training services.
29.       The construction and operation of the majority of new power gener-
ation facilities is entrusted to ELETROBRAS' four principal subsidiaries, and
they share the transmission function with state-owned utilities. To maximize
the economic benefits to the country from operation of the generating and
transmission facilities and to attain the maximum operating and financial
efficiency for the system as a whole, the Federal Government established in
1973 two special coordinating groups (Grupos Coordenadores para Operacao
Interligada), one for the South and Southeast regions and one for the Northeast
region. ELETROBRAS and the operating utilities participate in these groups,
which are responsible for coordinating the operations of the individual
generating plants and traLnsmission systems within the respective regions. The
power distribution function is carried out mainly by utilities controlled by
the state governments (with the exception of the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo
metropolitan areas which are served principally by Light - Servicos de
Eletricidade, S.A., a privately owned enterprise). The three beneficiaries
of the proposed loan are the local utilities in the states of Santa Catarina
(Southern Region), Espirito Santo and Minas Gerais (Southeastern Region).
Electric Power Tariffs
30.       Brazilian legislation concerning the electric power sector assures
that electric utilities receive sufficient funds to cover their operating
expenses (excluding financial charges), depreciation, "reversion quota," 1/
and a reasonable return on investment. Since 1966, annual revaluation of the
assets against which tariLffs are calculated has been mandatory, and the tariff
law of 1971 required that: utilities earn a rate of return of not less than 10%
and not more than 12%. I]n addition to the tariff, residential and commercial
consumers pay the "sole l:ax" (imposto unico) which, since 1972, has been
assessed at the rate of about 25% and 30% of their respective tariffs (indus-
trial consumers are exempted). As a result, the electric bill paid by the
1/   The "reversion quota" is assessed at a rate of up to 5% on assets in oper-
ation; of this, 60% is lent by the Government to ELETROBRAS which uses the
funds to finance investments in the sector and the balance is the main
source of funds for the "Global Guarantee Fund" (see para. 32).



- 10 -
Brazilian residential and commercial consumers is among the highest in the
world. The proceeds from the imposto unico are used mostly for sector invest-
ments and are distributed as follows: 40% to Federal Agencies (ELETROBRAS,
DNAEE, MME and the National Development Fund), 50% to the states and 10% to
the municipalities. Industrial consumers are required to make a compulsory
loan to ELETROBRAS by purchasing 20-year 6% ELETROBRAS bonds (subject to
monetary correction). The amount of the compulsory loan is equivalent to
about 50% of the tariff for small industrial consumers and to 58% of the
tariff for large industrial consumers.
31.       While the tariff system has generated adequate revenues for the
electric power sector in the past, the high level of investments required in
the sector (8% of gross capital formation in 1975) and the Government's need
to limit public investments as,a means of controlling inflation may result in
financial constraints leading to less expansion of power sector facilities in
the future than would be desirable. Serious financial constraints could also
originate from the inability of key utilities to generate internally sufficient
funds so as to make a reasonable contribution to the financing of their
expansion program. This concern has prompted DNAEE to undertake a review of
sector financial requirements and the adequacy of tariff levels. This study
is currently under way, together with a review of tariff structures, a review
previously agreed with the Bank (under Loan 1300-BR). The Government has
confirmed that the results of DNAEE's review of tariff levels (including a
financial forecast for the sector as a whole through 1986) would be presented
to the Bank along with the results of the study on tariff structures. These
are expected to be completed by December 30, 1979.
32.       In 1974, DNAEE began to use its discretionary powers to effect
progressive equalization of customer rates throughout Brazil. One result
of this action was that rates of return for the comparatively higher cost
utilities fell below 10%. To meet this problem, a Global Guarantee Fund (GGF)
was created in December 1974, as a mechanism intended to assure qualifying
utilities a return of 10%. At the same time, in order to promote the effi-
ciency of those utilities supported by the GGF, DNAEE put into effect a number
of measures which restrict the utilities from increasing their operating costs,
undertaking investments, and expanding markets without DNAEE's prior approval.
33.       Consistent with the efforts of the Brazilian Government to equal-
ize electricity charges throughout the country, it would be agreed that, if
transfers from the GGF are required, they will be sufficient to bring the
beneficiaries' return to 10% (Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.02; Project
Agreement, Section 4.04; and Loan Agreement, Section 6.01(f).
Electricity Consumption
34.       Electricity consumption is linked with essential economic activity
in the country; consumption by industry (which accounted for about 57% of the
total in 1977) is the fastest growing category. Below is a summary of elec-
tricity consumption since 1965:

*    Preliminary figures.
35.       It is estimated that some 74% of the urban population of the country
and about 78% of that of the Southern and Southeastern regions receive electric
service at the present time and that virtually 100% of the country's urban
population has access to service. Judging from partial data from the North-
eastern region, service in the rural areas (with 41% of the total popula-
tion) appears to be extremely low. The proposed project would assist the
implementation of the Government's policy to increase electric service by
expanding the capacity of lines and substations that would feed both rural
areas and low-income urban areas.
Rural Electrification
36.       In 1974, ELETROBRAS created a rural electrification department to
complement the activities carried out since 1970 by the Ministry of Agriculture,
with financial assistance from the Inter-American Development Bank. Through
this department, ELETROEBRAS provides 50-80% of the cost of individual rural
electrification projects, the rest being supplied by the utilities serving
the respective areas. ELETROBRAS' loan terms are 15 years, including 5 years
grace, and 12% interest on the principal (which is not subject to monetary
correction). These ELETROBRAS-assisted programs were instrumental in connect-
ing, in 1976, about 17,000 rural customers (defined as rural cooperatives or
agricultural or agro-inclustrial producers), at a total cost of about US$40.0
million equivalent, and in 1977, about 22,600 rural customers at a total cost
of about US$55 million equivalent. ELETROBRAS 1978-80 program envisages
connecting about 200,000 rural customers at a total cost of about US$540
million equivalent. The Ministry of Agriculture program being assisted by
the IDB is providing rural electrification through rural electrification
cooperatives in the more remote areas of the country.
Sector Planning
37.       ELETROBRAS (as part of its coordinating function) is responsible
for overall power sector planning. It has carried out this function in a
generally satisfactory inanner in the past by preparing medium-term regional



- 12 -
development programs. However, ELETROBRAS' current planning methods are not
wholly suited to the increasing complexity of the system (which requires an
integrated approach, in view of the expected inter-connection of all major
regional markets by the mid-eighties). The Bank has offered to assist
ELETROBRAS in developing improved planning methods and a more comprehensive
approach to sector planning. The introduction of improved sector planning
models would permit plans to be continuously revised in light of changes in
underlying assumptions--e.g., costs of capital goods, relative prices of
fuels--and allow for the timely assessment of the impact of cuts in sector
investments (which is not possible under the planning methodologies currently
in use). ELETROBRAS has indicated that by December 31, 1979 it will prepare a
master plan for power sector expansion for the whole country through the year
2000, and that it will continue to exchange views with the Bank regarding the
methodology, scope of work and terms of reference to be followed in such
planning.
Bank Group Strategy in the Sector
38.       Since 1949, the Bank has made 30 loans to the Brazilian power sector,
mostly for hydroelectric generation projects in the Southern and Southeastern
regions. This lending has helped strengthen sector organization, contributed
to the building of efficient power enterprises and facilitated foreign capital
inflows to the sector. Bank lending has assisted the Government in its
efforts to maintain tariff policies that have enabled the sector to generate
a substantial proportion of the funds needed to meet its investment require-
ments. Project performance audit reports have been distributed to the
Executive Directors on both power distribution 1/ and generation projects. 2/
These reports conclude that, despite delays and cost overruns in their execu-
tion, the projects supported by Bank loans were basically successful. The
most recent loans for power distribution (1257-BR and 1300-BR) included pilot
programs for extending service to low-income urban consumers in the states of
Parana, Bahia, Ceara and Pernambuco. These programs would be extended under
the proposed loan to three more states in the Southern and Southeastern regions.
The loan would be similar to Loan 1300-BR (Northeast Power Distribution Project)
in concept. It would be made to ELETROBRAS, which would relend the proceeds
to the three beneficiaries--Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais, S.A. (CEMIG),
Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina, S.A. (CELESC) and Espirito Santo Centrais
Eletricas, S.A. (ESCELSA). In addition to financing the distribution facili-
ties needed to support the rapid industrial, commercial and social development
of the three states served by the beneficiaries, the project would seek to
strengthen the management and planning of the two smaller beneficiaries,
CELESC and ESCELSA, and would assist CEMIG (a highly competent utility which
has received four Bank loans) in addressing the financial problems resulting
from its heavy expansion program.
1/   Loans 475/476/477/478/BR (Sec M 75-646 of September 4, 1975).
2/   Loan 404-BR (Sec M 77-532 of June 28, 1977); Loans 442-BR and 566-BR
(Sec. M78-34 of January 16, 1978).



-13 -
39.       Over the recent past, Bank lending for power in Brazil has given
particular emphasis to powier distribution loans because this subsector is the
least attractive to other Eoreign sources of finance, as it involves a large
number of relatively small and scattered works, while it has enabled the Bank
to continue to provide teclhnical assistance for the sector as a whole. To
complement its efforts in lpower distribution, the Bank has continued to
support power transmission projects designed to improve the utilization of
hydroelectric resources. The most recent loan for power in Brazil (1343-BR
in FY1977) supported construction of 500 kV transmission facilities in the
Southern system (including the interconnection with the Southeastern system).
A similar project is currently being prepared which would link the Northeastern
system to the interconnected South-Southeastern system. While the Bank has
not lent recently for power generation, it may be requested to resume opera-
tions in this subsector (which would provide an excellent vehicle for major
co-financing operations) in the next two or three years.
40.       A major aspect of the Bank's participation in the power sector has
been the provision of a portion of the very heavy financial requirements of
the sector directly and through co-financing operations. A co-financing
operation with a group of private commercial banks has been successfully
concluded in connection with the recent Bank loan for the ELETROSUL Trans-
mission Project 1/, and a second such operation is expected to be concluded
shortly in connection with Loan No. 1257-BR for the COPEL Power Distribution
Project. The Bank has also maintained a fruitful policy dialogue with the
various sector entities and has supported a series of major initiatives.
These have included preparation of a master plan for expansion of the electric
power sector (para. 37), initiation of a tariff structure study (para. 31),
increased attention to low-income urban consumers (para. 38) and inclusion in
Loan 1343-BR of a major training program for high-level sector staff.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background and Objectives
41.       CEMIG, CELESC and ESCELSA are faced with rapid growth in electricity
demands in their respective service areas. Their construction program through
1981, of which the project is a part, would provide the facilities required to
serve the expected loads, mostly related to industrial growth. Failure to
provide these facilities would lead to costly curtailments of supply or instal-
lation of fuel-based captive generation. The program would also be instrumental
in making public service electricity available to low-income customers and
for rural electrification. The proposed project was appraised in July 1977.
Negotiations took place in Washington from February 13-22, 1978. The Brazilian
delegation was headed by Mr. Jose Augusto Vieira de Carvalho, Attorney for
ELETROBRAS, and included, among others, Mr. Oscar Pimentel, Finance Director,
1/   Loan 1343-BR of February 23, 1977.  See President's Memorandum R77-308
of December 15, 1977.

DNAEE, and Mr. Luiz Machado Fracarolli, Attorney, Ministry of Finance. A
supplemental project data sheet, including a timetable of key events and a
summary of special conditions, is presented in Annex III. A report entitled
"Staff Appraisal Report - Brazil - South-Southeast Power Distribution Project,"
No. 1846-BR, dated March 10, 1978, is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors.
Areas to be Served
42.       The State of Minas Gerais (served by CEMIG) is one of the larger
states of Brazil, and the largest in the Southeast region, with an area
of about 490,000 km2 (representing about 6.9% of the total land area) and
a 1977 population of about 13 million of which 61% is estimated to be urban
and 39% rural, about the same as for Brazil as a whole. While containing
relatively developed and rapidly growing mining and industrial sectors, Minas
Gerais also has some very poor agricultural zones, including the northern part
of the state which is included in the Northeast "drought polygon." The 1976
GDP per capita for Minas Gerais is estimated at about US$810. The state is
the most important producer of mining products, iron and steel, and cement in
Brazil. The state of Santa Catarina (served by CELESC), with an area of about
95,000 km2 (about 1.1% of the total), and a population of about 3.5 million,
is the smallest and least-developed of the three states making up the Southern
region (the other two are Parana and Rio Grande do Sul). Its estimated 1976
per capita income, however, is the highest of the states which would benefit
from this loan, about US$1050. This may be attributed to its relatively
prosperous smallholder agricultural sector, characterized by mixed farming,
and an expanding light industry. The population is 48% urban and 52% rural.
The state of Espirito Santo (served by ESCELSA) is the smallest of the three
states included in the project, and the least developed. It has an area of
about 46,000 km2 (about .5% of the total), and a population of about 1.8 mil-
lion, of which 56% is estimated to be urban and 44% rural. Its 1976 GDP per
capita is estimated at US$800 or 67% of the national average. Espirito Santo
has the second largest beef and dairy cattle herd in Brazil and it also
produces a wide variety of crops including coffee, cocoa, bananas, manioc,
corn, and beans.
The Borrower
43.       The borrower would be ELETROBRAS, a corporation in which the Federal
Government has a 99.6% interest. ELETROBRAS acts, inter alia, as the Govern-
ment's financing agency for the electric power sector in Brazil and may be
compared to a development bank in allocating and channelling the funds neces-
sary to support the sector's growth (see para. 28).
44.       ELETROBRAS' role in the project consists of coordinating and super-
vising its implementation, and serving as a channel for on-lending the proceeds
of the proposed Bank loan to the beneficiaries. It would agree to review and
report to the Bank every six months on progress of the project and on perform-
ance of the beneficiaries during construction and start of operations (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.02).

45.       ELETROBRAS is managed by a Board and an Executive Directorate.  The
Board is composed of a President appointed by the President of the Republic,
and 9 to 13 other members., The Executive Directorate is composed of the
President and five Directors. The Board has been entrusted with the respon-
sibility for devising fundamental policies. The Executive Directorate has all
top-level management functions. ELETROBRAS has built up a large, competent
organization with a staff of about 1,600. Through the leverage obtained from
its financing role, ELETROBRAS has been able to supervise operations of the
utilities and coordinate system expansion and in general has provided the
necessary guidance for economical and orderly sector growth.
46.       ELETROBRAS' outstanding capital at year-end 1976 amounted to Cr$22
billion (about US$1.5 bilLion equivalent). Its resources consist of net
internal cash generation (dividends received, interest on its loan portfolio,
loan amortization receipts and miscellaneous other income, less debt service
and less net dividend payment) which in the period 1971-76 averaged 34% of
total resources; sole tax (para. 30), 8%; reversion reserve (para. 30), 22%;
compulsory loans (para. 30), 21%; federal budgetary appropriations, 3%; and
borrowings, 12%. Outstanding long term borrowings at year-end 1976 totalled
Cr$28.3 billion (about US$2.3 billion equivalent), of which 40% was in the
form of debentures arising from the compulsory loans, 29% represented reversion
accruals to the Federal Government, 20% came from foreign borrowings (IDB,
bilateral agencies, commercial banks and utility holding companies) and 11%
from domestic loans. ELETROBRAS' large and growing sources of funds constitute
a broad base for expanding its borrowings, and it is becoming increasingly
active in foreign financial markets.
47.       The proposed Bank loan of US$130 million is not large in relation
to ELETROBRAS' total resources which at year end 1976 amounted to about
Cr$67 billion (US$5.4 billion). As in the case of the Northeast Power
Distribution Project (Loan No. 1300-BR), the financial appraisal of the
beneficiaries shows they should not encounter difficulty in servicing their
respective portions of the proposed loan. It was therefore not considered
necessary to conduct an appraisal of ELETROBRAS' future finances.
The Beneficiaries
CEMIG
48.       Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais S.A. (CEMIG) is the utility
responsible for power distribution in the state of Minas Gerais. It also has
a fairly large role in power generation. CEMIG is controlled by the Minas
Gerais State Government (which owns 68% of its shares, with the rest being
held by ELETROBRAS (16%) and the public (16%)). It is managed by its ten-
member Board and an Executive Directorate, composed of seven Directors elected
by the Shareholders' meeting for a three-year period. The President of the
Board is the Chief Executive Officer. CEMIG has a properly designed organiza-
tion and is capably staffed. CEMIG's staff numbers 8,600 and staff relations
are good. The utility serves 1.1 million customers (about 131 customers per
employee which is adequate considering the characteristics of its service
area).



- 16 -
49.       CEMIG has received four previous Bank loans for a total of US$142.9
million equivalent. The first three projects have been completed. The two
major projects, the Jaguara and the Volta Grande hydroelectric schemes, for
-which the Bank made loans in 1966 and 1968, were completed 5-1/2 years and
nine months, respectively, later than the appraisal estimate, with cost over-
runs amounting to US$61.4 million equivalent (68% of appraisal estimate)
and US$123.6 million equivalent (130% of appraisal estimate), respectively.
The cost overruns were due to local and foreign costs higher than expected at
appraisal which resulted from foundation problems, inflation and increasing
lag between rising local construction costs and exchange rate readjustments.
The fourth (the 1,000 MW Sao Simao hydroelectric project, financed under
Loan 829-BR of June 14, 1972) is well advanced and the first units have
started operation about three months before the date estimated at the time of
appraisal. Costs, now estimated, at about US$750 million, are about 90% over
the appraisal estimate of US$396 million, due mostly to higher than expected
inflation, although changes in the number and size of the units and more
excavation than expected have also contributed to the overrun. The cost over-
runs on the above projects did not affect their justification.
CELESC and ESCELSA
50.       Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina S.A. (CELESC) is the utility
responsible for power distribution in the state of Santa Catarina. CELESC is
controlled by the Santa Catarina state government (which owns 80% of its
shares). It is guided by a General Assembly which appoints, for a four-year
period, a Directorate which is composed of a President and four Directors and
which is in charge of the day-to-day management functions. Responsibility for
objectives, policies, organization and direction of the company is vested in
the President. CELESC has about 3,900 employees and serves about 420,000
customers (a ratio of 107 customers per employee which is adequate considering
the characteristics of its service area).
51.       Espirito Santo Centrais Eletricas S.A. (ESCELSA) is the utility
responsible for electricity distribution in the state of Espirito Santo.
ESCELSA is controlled by ELETROBRAS (which owns 92% of its shares). It is
managed by a Board of Directors appointed for a three-year period by the
Shareholders' Assembly. The Board is composed of a President and five
Directors who are in charge of the day-to-day operations. ESCELSA has about
1,800 employees and serves 174,000 customers (87 customers per employee which
is also adequate).
52.       Both CELESC's and ESCELSA's organizational structures are well
designed. However, in each company there is a lack of effective coordination
among departments. CELESC and ESCELSA would engage organization/management
consultants, having qualifications and experience and upon terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Bank, to make recommendations by March 31, 1979
for improving coordination among their respective departments as well as
financial forecasting, budgeting controls, auditing, accounting and manage-
ment information system, and in preparing training program for their respec-
tive professional staffs. The consultants' recommendations and the companies'
proposals for implementing appropriate corrective programs would be presented
to the Bank by June 30, 1979 (Sections 2.09 of CELESC's and ESCELSA's Project



- 17 -
Agreements). Employment of these consultants would be conditions of disburse-
ment respectively for CELESC's and ESCELSA's portions of the loan (Loan Agree-
ment, Schedule 1, paragraphs 3(d)(i) and 3 (e)(i))).
Earnings and Financial Position
53.       The three benefiLciaries face financial problems arising from the
rapid growth of their markets and the need to make investments which exceed
their capacity to generate funds internally (despite a satisfactory level of
tariffs). They have had to rely to an increasing extent on borrowed funds
adversely affecting their debt service coverage in the case of CEMIG and
ESCELSA; CELESC's financial problems have manifested themselves largely
in the form of an unsatisfactory current position. The problems of CEMIG
should receive especially close attention in view of the utility's important
role in the development of- one of Brazil's most dynamic industrial areas.
If CEMIG will be allowed to earn only the minimum 10% return on remunerable
investment provided under the tariff system (see paras. 30 to 32), CEMIG's
financial projections show that its borrowing needs will continue to grow
rapidly, with a concurrent: decrease in equity as a proportion of long-term
capitalization, and in nel: internally generated funds as a proportion of
financing requirements. In the past DNAEE has been responsive to CEMIG's
needs and has allowed it to earn returns above the 10% minimum (12% in 1976
and 1977). Without careful management (including such measures as the provi-
sion of new equity, continuing to allow a higher return on assets, or deferral
of major new projects), the situation would be unsatisfactory in 1980-81, when
debt service will increase at a much faster rate than gross internal cash
generation. The trend in CEMIG's financial indicators is a matter of concern
and the Bank will continue to monitor the utility's financial position and
borrowings closely over the project construction period. CEMIG would continue
to be bound by the existing debt limitation covenant in the Loan Agreement for
Loan 829-BR (Sao Simao Hydroelectric Project), which requires the Bank's
agreement before the utilLty incurs long-term borrowings whenever its annual
internal cash generation Ls less than 1.5 times its maximum future debt
service requirement (CEMIG's Project Agreement, Section 4.05), and the Bank
would review CEMIG's borrowing program annually under this covenant. Addition-
ally, CEMIG would submit ito the Bank by June 30, 1979 a review of its invest-
ment and financing plans Eor the remainder of the project construction period,
which would include proposals for achieving an annual debt service coverage of
at least 1.5 times in those years (CEMIG's Project Agreement, Section 4.05).
The Federal Government, the State of Minas Gerais and ELETROBRAS would coop-
erate in the review and would use their best efforts, in accordance with their
overall policies, to assist CEMIG in achieving an annual debt service coverage
of at least 1.5 during thes remainder of the project construction period
(Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.03; Minas Gerais Shareholder Agreement,
Section 4; and Loan Agreement, Section 3.05).
54.       The financial outlook of the other two beneficiaries, CELESC and
ESCELSA, is relatively favorable, provided measures are taken by their princi-
pal shareholders (the state of Santa Catarina and ELETROBRAS, respectively)
to provide them with an adequate equity capitalization. As part of the
financing plan, CELESC expects relatively large equity contributions (US$26.7



- 18 -
million in constant mid-1977 prices) from the Santa Catarina State Government,
which the latter would pay according to an agreed schedule (State of Santa
Catarina Shareholder Agreement, Section 5). Presentation of evidence that the
State's quarterly payments are current would be a condition of the first
disbursement of CELESC's portion of the loan (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1,
paragraph 3(d)(ii)). ESCELSA's debt service burden as projected is excessive,
and ELETROBRAS would maintain ESCELSA's annual debt service coverage at 1.5
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.04). The submission by ELETROBRAS to the Bank of a
plan of action satisfactory to the Bank to enable ESCELSA to achieve a current
debt service coverage of 1.5 to 1 for 1978 and thereafter until the completion
of its part of the project would be a disbursement condition for ESCELSA's
portion of the loan (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, paragraph 3(e)(ii)). CELESC
and ESCELSA would also be subject to a debt limitation covenant similar to
that proposed for CEMIG (CELESC's and ESCELSA's Project Agreements, Section
4.05).
55.       If CEMIG or CELESC proved not to have sufficient funds to assure
the timely completion of the Bank project, the states of Minas Gerais or Santa
Catarina, respectively, would provide them in a form satisfactory to the
Bank (Minas Gerais and Santa Catarina Shareholder Agreements, Section 3).
ELETROBRAS would assume a similar obligation with regard to ESCELSA (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.01(a)). The Federal Government would make arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank for providing funds to complete the project if
the funds available to any of the beneficiaries are insufficient for this
purpose (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.02).
Demand Forecast
56.       Public-service electricity consumption in the areas served by CEMIG,
CELESC and ESCELSA grew at an average annual rate of about 14%, 23%, and 22%,
respectively, during the period 1972-1976. The growth in the average consump-
tion per customer was about 6%, 11% and 7% and in the number of customers
about 8%, 12% and 14%. The power market of all three companies has been
increasingly dominated by the industrial market (76%, 59% and 67% of all sales
to the ultimate consumers in 1976, up from 72%, 52% and 61% in 1972).
57.       The forecast of energy sales to the industrial sector is based on
a detailed analysis made by the companies and reviewed by ELETROBRAS, regard-
ing the status of implementation of major industrial projects. Demand of
smaller industries as well as residential, rural and commercial consumers has
been forecast on the basis of past trends. The resulting sales forecasts,
highlighted in the table below, indicate that the three power markets will
maintain high average growth rates through the project construction period.
The average annual rate of growth of sales from 1976 to 1982 is forecast to
be 16.5% for CEMIG, 17.3% for CELESC and 29% for ESCELSA.

The Beneficiaries' Programs
58.       Of the three project beneficiaries, only CEMIG has a program for
installing generating facilities. The program to be executed between 1978
and 1981 has, for the most part, been carefully studied by CEMIG and has been
properly coordinated withL ELETROBRAS and neighboring utilities to ensure that
the interconnected system is expanded and operated in an optimum manner.
CEMIG's program includes the completion of the first phase (1,800 MW) of the
Sao Simao hydro station (partially financed by Loan 829-BR) and the start of
construction of the 1,000 MW Emborcacao hydro station (partially financed by
IDB), the first units of which are expected to be commissioned by late 1981.
CEMIG has also proposed to start during this period the construction of other
hydro stations, but it has not yet demonstrated that these additions to
capacity would be the least cost alternatives for adding capacity to the
interconnected system. The Bank would have an opportunity to review these
planned investments under the limitation on major investments outside the
project recommended in para. 66.
59.       The proposed expansion plans for transmission lines and substations
would allow the utilities; to transmit the energy to be generated by existing
and future plants to meet their anticipated load growth without reducing the
quality of their services. The utilities are expected to increase the total
length of their transmission lines (34.5 kV to 500 kV) from about 17,100 km
at the beginning of 1978 to 22,140 km at the end of 1981.
60.       The distribution expansion program to be carried out by the utilities
during the project construction period would provide adequate capacity at



- 20 -
appropriate points of the system for the expected increases in loads while
ensuring the continued high reliability of service to all customers. The
program would allow connection of low-income households, particularly those
which presently have access to service by virtue of being near existing
distribution lines but are not connected to the system. These prospective
customers can be connected with a minimum of investment. The utilities expect
to connect a total of about 62,000 new low-income customers in the period
1978-81. Household connections would be financed by the utilities over not
less than 18 months and on terms which would enable low-income customers to
meet monthly charges (Section 2.10 of respective Project Agreements).
61.       In addition to the expansion of the urban systems, the utilities
have on-going rural electrification projects with ELETROBRAS' assistance
(para. 36). These projects envisage the installation of about 32,000 circuit
km of lines and the connection of about 48,000 new rural customers between
1978 and 1981.
Project Components
62.       The project to be financed by the proposed loan would focus on the
subtransmission-distribution sub-sector. In the case of CEMIG, acquisition
of communications and control equipment would also be included. The individ-
ual project components are summarized in the project summary above (see p. ii).
Expansion of the subtransmission and distribution facilities would be commen-
surate with the expected growth rate of sales on different parts of the
systems, and duly takes into account the concentration of loads, the state of
existing facilities and the particular requirements of specific customers.
For some of the equipment included in the program, such as transformers
or meters, no reasonable alternative exists. Where alternatives do exist,
e.g., in routing, sizing or voltage of transmission lines and location and
reserve capacities of substations, the utilities have selected or will select
the least-cost solution which is compatible with safety and environmental
considerations.
Project Cost
63.       The total cost of the project has been estimated at US$427.0 million
(Cr$6,126.8 million) of which US$129.8 million (Cr$1,863.2 million) is the
foreign component. A summary of project costs is set out in the project
summary above (see p. ii). The base costs were estimated by each utility on
the basis of prevailing prices as of mid-1977 and are reasonable. The engineer-
ing and administration costs for the project, as well as applicable taxes and
duties (estimated at about 10% of base costs), are included in the base cost
estimates. The cost of consulting services to be required by CELESC and
ESCELSA (para. 68) has been estimated at about US$6,000 per man-month, exclud-
ing subsistence and travel expenses, and is included as part of the cost of
the 138 kV facilities. Physical contingencies have been estimated at 8% to
20% of the base cost estimates of the individual components of the program,
depending on the status of the engineering; the overall average is about 12%.
The price contingencies have been calculated on the basis of assumed annual
rates of inflation of 7.5% from 1977 to 1979 and 7% thereafter for foreign



- 21 -
costs and 9% from 1977 to 1980 and 8% thereafter for local costs, in U.S.
dollar terms. The use of different escalation factors for foreign and local
costs is appropriate because the foreign costs relate mainly to equipment and
materials for which the price variations have normally followed world-wide
inflation and the local costs relate mainly to materials, labor, and activities
for which the inflation rate has been somewhat higher.
Financing Plan
64.       The project accounts for 14% of the utilities' 1978-81 investment
requirements of US$2,346.8 million equivalent (excluding price contingencies).
The proposed Bank loan would cover the full foreign exchange component (32%
of project cost). Local costs would be covered by the utilities' internal
cash generation, equity contributions and borrowings from ELETROBRAS, and
equity contributions from the states. The Bank would assist ELETROBRAS in
securing funds through appropriate co-financing arrangements, similar to those
recently approved for the ELETROSUL Transmission Project (see para. 40). A
summary of the beneficiaries' financing plans for their 1978-81 programs (in
the course of which most of the loan is expected to be disbursed) is contained
in the project summary above (see p. iii). Financial projections were prepared
in constant June 1977 Cruzeiros to ensure consistency with financial projec-
tions made by Brazilian authorities for the eletric power sector. They have
been converted into US dollars at the exchange rate on June 30, 1977 (US$1=
Cr$14.35).
65.       The proposed US$130 million Bank loan would be made to ELETROBRAS
for a term of 15 years including 3 years grace. The interest rate to the
beneficiaries was assumed in the projections to be 8.5%. The proceeds of the
loan would be on-lent to the three beneficiaries under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank, which are expected to provide for the same maturity,
grace period and repayment schedules as on the Bank loan, plus commissions
(a one-time commission of 1/2 of 1% on the loan amounts, and service fees
of 1/4 of 1% p.a. on the disbursed amount during the disbursement period
and 1/8 of 1% p.a. thereafter); the beneficiaries would assume the foreign
exchange risk.
66.       The beneficiaries' investment programs include sizable expenditures
for projects which have yet to be justified in detail and for which financing
has not yet been obtained. The beneficiaries would agree that they would not
undertake any major new investments outside the project until completion of
the project, unless they had provided evidence satisfactory to the Bank that
such investment was economically justified; that the beneficiary had adequate
financial resources to carry it out and that it was in accordance with plans
for power generation and transmission approved by ELETROBRAS for the Southeast
and South regions of Brazil or, in the case of an investment in the distribu-
tion subsector, that it has been approved by DNAEE (Project Agreements, Section
4.06).



- 22 -
Execution
67.       The utilities' own personnel would carry out most of the necessary
engineering and supervision of construction for the project. This is accept-
able as the utilities have proven experience in similar works completed
recently or still under construction. However, CELESC and ESCELSA have staff
limitations and would require assistance for engineering and supervision of
construction for 138 kV facilities, and would therefore employ consultants
for these purposes. In view of the limited experience of these two utilities
with international procurement, consultants would also assist them in the
preparation of the general contract documents and in bid evaluation (see
CELESC's and ESCELSA's Project Agreements, Section 2.09). The employment of
these consultants would be conditions of disbursement respectively of CELESC's
and ESCELSA's portions of the loan (see Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, paragraphs
3(d)(i) and 3(e)(i). The utilities' own personnel would install the distribu-
tion equipment and build short distribution extensions. Local contractors are
expected to install substations and build all 230 kV, 138 kV and 69 kV lines
and major distribution lines. Procurement of equipment for the project is
scheduled to start in June 1978 and the expected project completion date is
December 31, 1981.
Procurement
68.       Procurement of the equipment to be financed by the Bank would be
through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. Manufacturers of equipment financed by the proposed loan, whose
bids contain components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the
value of the bid would be given a margin of preference of 15%, or the appli-
cable import duties, whichever is lower. Brazilian suppliers of the items
included in the project are reasonably competitive. Foreign cost estimates
assume that: (i) about US$130 million equivalent of equipment and materials
would be acquired through ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines; and
(ii) Brazilian suppliers would be awarded up to two-thirds of the value of
the contracts placed through such bidding. The equipment component of the
project which would not be financed under the proposed loan, such as line
supports and low voltage equipment, would be procured locally under the
beneficiaries' normal procedures, as Brazilian legislation precludes ICB for
items that can be produced locally and are not financed by long-term foreign
loans. However, as noted above, the locally produced items for this project
(such as concrete poles) are reasonably competitive in price with imported
products and project cost should not increase significantly over the estimate
as a result of that restriction.
Disbursement
69.       Disbursements would be for 100% of the foreign expenditures for
imported equipment and materials (including, where applicable, installation
and erection) or the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment and
materials.



- 23 -
Return on Investment
70.       The return cn investment was estimated as the discount rate which
equates the present values of the benefits and costs stemming from the combined
1978-1981 investment program of the three utilities as well as those of each
individual program. Benefits were measured by the forecast revenues from the
sales of electricity at the retail levels, using the tariffs in effect at
December 1976 plus the sole tax (see para. 30). The equalizing discount rate
for the combined program is about 16%, as are the equalizing rates for CEMIG's
and ESCELSA's individual programs, while that pertaining to CELESC's program
is about 15%. These discount rates compare favorably with the opportunity
cost of capital for Brazil, estimated to be around 11%. These equalizing
rates understate the real economic rate of return of the programs, as elec-
tricity tariffs, which are, administratively determined rather than established
through market forces, are probably lower than what consumers would be willing
to pay.
Risks
71.       The project faces no major technical risks, other than those result-
ing from the relative administrative weakness of CELESC and ESCELSA. The
construction schedule assumed for the project is reasonable and takes into
consideration normal engineering, administative and construction procedures
but it contains no provision for unusual delays. CEMIG is not expected to
have any difficulties in meeting the schedules. However, timely completion
of the project by CELESC and ESCELSA will depend on the appropriate use of
consultants to assist them with the 138 kV facilities and in the preparation
of the contract documents for ICB. It is more difficult to assess the impact
of the uncertainty relating to the financial outlook of CEMIG (para. 53).
However, the competence of the Brazilian authorities in the past management
of the power sector supports the view that CEMIG will be able to surmount its
problems in this area.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
72.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras S.A. - ELETROBRAS, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Federative Republic of Brazil and the Bank, the draft Project Agreements
between the Bank and CEMIG, CELESC and ESCELSA, the draft Shareholder Agree-
ments between the Bank and the states of Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina and
Espirito Santo, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii), of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
73.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.



- 24 -
74.       Conditions of disbursement of CELESC's and ESCELSA's portions of
the loan respectively are that they have employed organization consultants
and consultants to assist with 138 kV facilities (see paras. 52 and 67).
Additionally, it is a condition of the first disbursement of CELESC's portion
of the loan that the State of Santa Catarina is current in its quarterly
payments of its equity contribution to CELESC and a condition of disbursement
of ESCELSA's portion of the loan that ELETROBRAS has submitted to the Bank
a plan of action for enabling ESCELSA to maintain a current debt service
coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1 during the project construction period (see
para. 54).
75.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
76.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
There are now 34 effective Bank loans under disbursement:
Loan No.
677       Marimbondo Hydroelectric Project:  US$80 million loan of May 25,
1970; Effective Date: September 29, 1970; Closing Date:
August 31, 1978. The Marimbondo hydroelectric station and the
bulk of the related transmission lines were completed on schedule,
and the Marimbondo power plant (1440 MW) was inaugurated on May 28,
1976. The project has been successfully implemented by FURNAS, the
consultants and the contractors, in spite of a cost overrun of
about 43%. In part, the cost overrun resulted from an increase in
the scope of the transmission system component to allow for the
construction of a more economical and reliable system, and from
larger civil works as a result of unforeseen geological problems.
The cost overrun, however, does not affect the economic justif-
ication of the project.
728       Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project:  US$70 million loan of April 5,
1971; Effective Date: July 19, 1971; Closing Date: May 31, 1978.
The physical comlponents of the project have been successfully com-
pleted. Four of the six generating units are now in commercial
operation. A cost overrun of about US$120 million, 79% of the
original cost estimate, has not significantly affected the economic
justification of the project. This cost overrun was financed by
loans from ELETROBRAS and a commercial bank.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No.
755       Education Project:  US$8.4 million loan of June 21, 1971; Effective
Date: October 28, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978. Progress on
the construction and equipping of the project schools is now proceed-
ing satisfactorily, and 80% of the project has been completed. A
20% cost overrun, mainly for civil works, is being financed by the
Government. Project implementation is behind the original schedule
due to initial delays in establishing and staffing the project unit
and because of subsequent changes in project content.
756       Santos Port Project:  US$45 million loan of June 21, 1971; Effective
Date: October 29, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1979. After long
delays, project execution is now proceeding satisfactorily. Con-
struction of the railway access Paratinga-Pereque by FEPASA is
completed. The inability of RFFSA to pay its share of the costs for
the left bank rail access was overcome by PORTOBRAS which obtained a
loan from Banco do Brasil for this purpose. Because of insufficient
increases in tariffs to compensate for inflation, Santos port is
experiencing financial difficulties.
786       Railway Project - MBR:  US$46 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Effective Date: February 4, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1978.
The project is now completed, except for the construction and equip-
ping of the Borrower's main workshop at Jaceaba. The purchase of
equipment for this workshop was delayed because of a change in the
location of the workshop resulting from the Government's decision to
build a new railway line between the cities of Belo Horizonte and
Volta Redonda.
797       CSN Steel Expansion Project, Stage II:  US$64.5 million loan of
February 8, 1972; Effective Date: August 31, 1972; Closing Date:
March 31, 1978. Although one year behind schedule and with a
significant increase in cost, the project is now physically complete.
Final payments on equipment contracts are being made now and are
expected to be completed by March 31, 1978.
828       COSIPA Steel Expansion Project, Stage II:  US$64.5 million loan
of June 14, 1972; Effective Date: October 5, 1972; Closing
Date: June 15, 1978. The latest cost estimate is US$862
million, an increase of about 60% over the appraisal estimate
due primarily to increased local construction costs. This will
not significantly affect the economic justification of the project.
The project is now expected to be completed in June, 1978, about 24
months behind the original schedule.

September 30, 1979. Construction of the project is proceeding
according to schedule. An anticipated 50% cost overrun, which
does not affect the economic justification of the project, is being
covered by local and foreign borrowing.
853       Alto Turi Land Settlement Project:  US$6.7 million loan of July 24,
1972; Effective Date: February 15, 1973; Closing Date: December 1,
1978. The settlement agency, COLONE, has prepared revised farm
development plans whose credit component, to be financed by public
financial institutions, will be significantly higher than originally
estimated, although still low in comparison to other settlement
projects. Administrative delays in the release of public funds for
farm credit, roaLd construction and COLONE working capital require-
ments and difficulties in recruiting project staff delayed the start
of project execution. COLONE continues to be hampered by lack of
assured financing, and this problem is compounded by cost overruns
presently amounting to 130%.
923       Itumbiara Hydroelectric Project:  US$125 million loan of August 1,
1973; Effective Date; October 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1982. Construction of the earth-fill dam was delayed by about
nine months due to very heavy rains. However, construction of the
concrete dam and power house is ahead of schedule. FURNAS expects
to complete the power plant in December 1981, about four months
behind schedule. The present cost estimate is about 88% over the
appraisal cost iestimate, 13% of which is due to the need for
increased physical quantities due to geological problems. The rest
of the increase is due to a substantial increase in the size of the
transmission works and to an increase in the cost of civil works.
However, the project remains economically justified.
924       Agro-Industries Credit Project:  US$54 million loan of August 1,
1973; Effective Date: March 11, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1978. Disbursements for sub-loans totalling US$14.7 million were
made during 1975-76 under procedures which were not in accordance
with the Loan Agreement. These funds have now been prepaid by
the Government, reducing the effective loan amount to US$39.3
million. During the second half of 1977, the Government
restricted the funds available for sub-loans under this project
in line with its policy of restricting credit expansion to control
inflation. However, budgetary allocations for 1978 will allow
commitments to continue at the rate envisaged in earlier forecasts.

1008      Paulo Afonso IV Hydroelectric Power Project:  US$81 million loan of
June 17, 1974; Effective Date: April 15, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978. Resettlement of the 9,700 families being dis-
placed by the Sobradinho reservoir is nearly completed, and new
towns to house the urban portion of the population have been
constructed. The rural population is being offered the opportunity
of resettlement in a promising new agricultural area in the Corrente
River region in the western part of the State of Bahia. Those who
prefer to remain near their present houses are being resettled in
new villages on the edge of the future reservoir. The construction
of the Paulo Alonso IV underground power station and Sobradinho dam
is proceeding on schedule. Construction of the transmission lines
and sub-stations is about 12 months behind schedule.
1009      Minas Gerais Water Supply Project:  US$36 million loan of June 17,
1974; Effective Date: January 9, 1975; Closing Date: August 15,
1979. Difficulties in subproject preparation, which are now
resolved, caused disbursements to fall behind schedule. However,
the loan is now fully committed to 41 subprojects of which 29 are
under construction and 12 completed.
1067      Second Education Project:  US$23.5 million loan of December 27,
1974; Effective Date: April 17, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1979. Project execution is proceeding reasonably well, and is ex-
pected to be completed by the target date. Project implementation
units have been established in all eight project states and these,
together with the main project unit, PREMEN, are working well. The
pre-investment studies in the Northeast, financed under the loan,
have been completed and have yielded useful information for future
sector investment planning.
1074      Second Railway Project:  US$175 million loan of January 17, 1975;
Effective Date: June 17, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Project execution is progressing satisfactorily and appropriate
steps are being taken to strengthen project management and control.
Cost estimates for the Investment Plan, of which the project is a
part, have increased substantially on several items. Therefore,
the Plan has been revised and several items have been deleted or
postponed. This revision is not expected to affect significantly
the items included under Bank financing. Although the financial
situation of the borrower improved in the first nine months of
1977, further improvement is necessary for it to be able to effec-
tively carry out its investment program. The Government recently
decided to deregulate most freight tariffs. Beginning in 1978,
it will make payments to the railways to meet deficits on uneconomic
services which it wishes to remain in operation. These actions
should significantly improve the borrower's financial position.

1075      Fifth Highway Project:  US$110 million loan of January 17, 1975;
Effective Date: May 15, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily. Roadworks are
progressing well, and detailed engineering studies for road con-
struction and road rehabilitation are now completed. Implementation
of the road maintenance component is making progress.
1151      CSN Steel Expansion Project - Stage III:  US$95.0 million loan of
August 4, 1975; Effective Date: April 30, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982. The latest cost estimate is US$3,025 million, an
increase of about 67% over the appraisal estimate due to a slower
than expected start of project implementation, higher than expected
construction costs, difficulties in holding the scope of the project
to its essentials and some problems in the management of the expan-
sion program. At the request of the Bank, a thorough review of the
project was made. Substantial changes were made resulting in better
management and control of the project. The project is now progress-
ing satisfactorily in line with the revised cost estimate and
schedule.
1152      COSIPA Steel Expansion Project - Stage III:  US$60.0 million loan
of August 4, 1975; Effective Date: March 4, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980. The project is about two years behind schedule. The
cold mill has been deleted from the project due to changes in
forecast demand., The effect of this change on the economic justif-
ication of the project and its financial implications is presently
being investigated.
1153      Lower Sao FranciLsco Polders Project:  US$23.0 million loan of
August 4, 1975; Effective Date: November 25, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979. CODEVASF made only limited progress on
construction for this project during 1977 because of heavy rains
in the project area. Physical completion of the project will
probably extend to 1980, and postponement of the closing date may
be required. Cujrrent cost estimates show an 80% increase over
the appraisal estimate of US$56.5 million. These increases have
resulted from design changes, rapid increases in the costs of
civil works and equipment, and in the cost of land expropriation.
Modifications in the design of emergency and irrigation works are
being studied by CODEVASF and its consultants with a view to
limiting further cost increases. Project implementation has
encountered certain opposition from the population of the Project
area, which disagreed with the principles and procedures for land
expropriation, settlement, future land tenure and the structure of
the proposed cooperative system. The implementing agency CODEVASF
is revising the social strategy to the followed under the project
by improving communication and relations with the area population.

1171      Third Railway Project (FEPASA):  US$75.0 million loan of November 12,
1975; Effective Date: March 24, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily. The Transport
Master Plan Study for Sao Paulo is presently under way and the first
results are expected shortly. The technical assistance program
which is intended to improve FEPASA's operations, marketing and data
processing systems is showing results. Although FEPASA's financial
position has improved, it is still not satisfactory. The Government
recently deregulated most freight tariffs. Beginning in 1978, the
state government will make payments to the railways to meet deficits
on uneconomic services which it wishes to remain in operation.
These actions should assist in significantly improving FEPASA's
financial position.
1195      Rio Grande do Norte Rural Development Project:  US$12.0 million loan
of March 1, 1976; Effective Date: July 30, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981. Progress is being adversely affected by funding
delays and marketing problems in the principal project crop, peren-
nial cotton. Means of resolving the problem are under discussion.
Implementation of the research and credit components of the project
has been particularly successful. Disbursements are behind the
original appraisal schedule, partially because of funding delays.
1206      Development Banking Project:  US$85.0 million loan of March 1, 1976;
Effective Date: August 26, 1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1979.
Project implementation is behind schedule. The major reasons are:
(i) an initial delay in the commitment of funds under this project
because of differences between the relending terms of the agencies
concerned and those required under the Loan Agreement. These
differences are now resolved; (ii) a leveling off of the industry's
demand for investment financing; and (iii) resource constraints of
the National Development Bank (BNDE). Measures to accelerate
commitment of the loan are under study.
1207      Secondary and Feeder Roads Project:  US$55.0 million loan of
March 1, 1976; Effective Date: July 13, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981. After some initial delays, project execution
is now progressing satisfactorily. Three sub-loans totalling
US$12.6 million of Bank financing have been approved and two more
are expected to be approved soon.
1249      Agricultural Research I Project:  US$40.0 million loan of April 27,
1976; Effective Date: September 21, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981. The project is progressing well and in some
areas ahead of schedule. Implementation of the civil works program
is actively in progress at 21 research stations. Facilities and
research programs at seven experiment stations in the three priority
regions (North, Northeast and Central-West) are proceeding in
accordance with project goals. Staffing is in advance of project
goals.

1256      Araucaria Fertilizer Project:  US$52.0 million loan of May 19, 1976;
Effective Date: July 20, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The project is proceeding according to schedule.
1257      COPEL Power Distribution Project:  US$52.0 million loan of May 19,
1976; Effective Date: August 17, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1979. Project execution is on schedule and about 30% completed.
Disbursements are considerably behind appraisal forecast, mainly
because of delays in procurement of major subtransmission equipment.
The Borrower is updating the 1976-79 distribution expansion program,
and the adjusted program should bring disbursements closer to the
original schedule by year-end 1978.
1300      Northeast Power Distribution:  US$50.0 million loan of August 27.
1976; Effective Date: January 31. 1977; Closing Date: June 30,
1980. Project implementation is about 12 months behind schedule
due to initial difficulties in obtaining a Government definition
regarding participation by Brazilian suppliers. Procurement is
now progressing satisfactorily.
1302      Nutrition Research and Development:  US$19.0 million loan of
October 1, 1976; Effective Date: December 30, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980. Disagreements, now resolved, on nutri-
tional and technical criteria have delayed BNDE participation in
the project. The INAN project unit is staffed with seven pro-
fessionals out of the ten needed. The nutrition delivery system's
field tests are proceeding reasonably well. The other components
of the project are proceeding on schedule.
1309      Second Minas Gerais Water Supply and Sewerage Project:  US$40.0
million loan of August 27, 1976; Effective Date: January 31, 1977;
Closing Date: September 30, 1980. The Bank has approved
sub-loans for 75 sub-projects in cities of less than 5,000
inhabitants, 14 sub-project in cities of between 5,000 and 20,000
inhabitants and 3 sub-projects in cities of more than 20,000
inhabitants. Several additional sub-projects are being reviewed.
1317      Second Agro-Industries Credit Project:  US$83.0 million loan of
September 22, 1976; Effective Date: March 25, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982. Because of commitment delays under the First
Agro-Industries Credit Project, commitments for the second loan
are not expected to begin until later in 1978. Budgetary allocations
for 1978 will allow commitments to continue at the rate envisaged
in earlier forecast.

1343      ELETROSUL Transmission Project:  US$82.0 million loan of February
23, 1977; Effective Date: June 13, 1977; Closing Date: December
31, 1981. Procurement and construction are now underway and pro-
ceeding according to schedule, with no major problems encountered.
Disbursements are lagging behind the appraisal forecast because of
delays in preparing bidding documents which resulted in delays of
contract awards. However, disbursements are expected to be on
schedule by year-end 1978.
1362      Minas Gerais Rural Development Project:  US$42.0 million loan of
February 23, 1977; Effective Date: June 29, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981. Organization of this project is progressing
well. However, because of the agricultural credit restrictions
imposed by the Government during the second half of 1976 and in
early 1977, as part of its program to control inflation, credit
for this project was delayed. However, Banco do Brasil has recently
agreed to release the necessary funds, and the credit program is
expected to resume according to the agreed schedule. Due mainly to
administrative difficulties, participation in this project by land-
less producers is significantly lower than originally envisaged,
but the Government and the participating banks have given assurances
that this would be corrected in the future. Both the health and
education components have advanced significantly.
1406      Sergipe Fertilizer Project:  US$64.0 million loan of April 29. 1977;
Effective Date: August 31, 1977; Closing Date: November 30, 1981.
The Project is proceeding according to schedule.
1411      VALEFERTIL Phosphate Fertilizer Project;  US$82.0 million loan of
April 29, 1977; Effective Date: July 29, 1977; Closing Date:
