PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SOUTH-SOUTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (LOAN 1538-BR)
Preface
1.      This Is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the South-
Southeast Power Distribution Project, which was partially financed by Loan
1538-BR (US$130.0 million equivalent). The Borrower was Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS), which reloaned the proceeds to the
distribution companies serving the states of Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina,
and Espirito Santo. The PCR was prepared by the Energy Division of the
Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office based on information in the
Bank files, final project reports prepared by the Beneficiaries, and
discussions with staff of the Bank, the Borrower, and the Beneficiaries.
2.       In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OlD). but the project was not audited by OED staff.
OED sent copies of the draft report to the Borrower for comments. The
comments received have been taken into account in preparing the final
report and they are reproduced as an Attachmnt to the Report.

BRAZIL
PROJECT COHPLETION REPORT
SOUTH-SOUTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (LOAN 1538-BR)
Highlights
1.       The Project was successful in achieving its technical and
organizational objectives.
2.       This sucess materialized in spite of substantial delay
characterizing the processing and implementation of a comparatively complex
transmission/distribution project. In order to process the proposed
Project, the Bank needed decisions which were slow in coming from Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS) and various agencies of the
Brazilian Government; it took almost two years of preparation before
appraisal could occur.  ELETROBRAS' capacity to process
transmissionldistribution projects has improved.
3.       Implementation of the Project started almost a year late because
of the need to adjust the scope of the Project to changes in demand. There
was no action available to the Bank which could have avoided this delay.
Further delay occurred because of additional changes in the scope of the
Project, to which the Bank agreed, due to the economic difficulties in the
country.
4.       The declining financial performance of the power sector during the
period 1978-1982 was the main cause of Bank concern and the central subject
of dialogue between Brazilian power authorities and Bank staff. To address
this situation, the Bank and the Government negotiated in 1981 an agreement
on tariff increases for the sector which superseded existing revenue
covenants. This agreement represented an easing of revenue targets as
originally covenanted. In 1983, the Bank and the Government negotiated a
new agreement which specified realistic rate-of-remuneration targets.
However, the sector did not comply with the terms of these two agreements,
making it necessary to address the problem again under the Power Sector
Loan of 1986.
Failure to increase rates in real terms, as required, has weakened
the sector which has also been affected by the recession and sequences of
devaluation that occurred in recent years. Despite this development, the
Brazilian power sector continues to be well managed, with a better than
average performance in satisfying an extremely rapid market growth, and
with good investment planning.



BRAZIL
CENTRAIS ELSTRICAS BRASILEIRAS S.A. (ELETROBRAS)
SOUTH-SOWUTHEST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (LOAN 1538-BR)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1      Bank Participation In Sector Finacina
1.1.1   Since 1949, Bank loan to the Brazilian power sector have amounted
to about US$4.3 billion. Initially, most loans were for hydroelectric
plants and associated transmission facilities in the Southeastern and
Southern regions. More recently, loans have been msinly for tranamiasion
and distribution projects, including beneficiaries outside these two
regions. In 1986, the Bank provided a first power sector loan centered on
efforts to improve the sector's finances. Besides financing high priority
projects, Bank lending in the sector has sought to promote rational tariff
policies, to monitor sector finances, and to help strengthen sector
coordination and planning. The Bank has also acted as catalyst for the
mobilization of funding from external sources.
1.1.2   Between 1976 and 1985, Bank lending was oriented to support
transmission and distribution projects in all regions of Brazil.  In
connection with such projects, the Bank has provided the power sector with
fourteen loans, amounting to US$2.58 billion, including eight loans to
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBRAS), amounting to US$1.60
billion. In all cases but two, proceeds of the loans to ELETROBRAS have
been relent to state power companies to help support their distribution and
rural electrification expansion programs. The first exception was a loan
to finance the purchase of supervision and control equipment at ELETROBRAS
and at interconnected companies (federal and state) with major generating
plants. This loan also helped to finance studies of the marginal cost of
electricity supply. The second exception was a loan to finance
transmission facilities of two subsidiaries of BLETROBRAS, CHESF and
FURNAS.
1.1.3    The first Bank loan to ELETROBRAS (1300-BR; US$50.0 million; 1976)
helped to finance the Northeast Distribution Project   ELETROBRAS relent
the bulk of the proceeds of Loan 1300-BR to the state power companies of
Bahia, Pernambuco, and Ceara, and employed a modest portion of the proceeds
of the loan for training and various consulting services.
1.1.4    The second Bank loan to ELETROBRAS (1538-BR; US$130.0 million,
1978) financed In part the South-Southeast Power Distribution Project, the
subject of this report. ELETROBRAS onlent the proceeds of the loan to the
state power companies of Hinas Gerais, Santa Catarina and Espirito Santo -
Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais S.A. (CEMIG), Centrais Eletricas de
Santa Catarina S.A. (CELESC), and Espirito Santo Centrais Eletries S.A.
(ESCELSA) - for the expansion of their transmission/distribution systems.



-2-
1.1.5    Four more loans to ELETROBRAS have been helping to support the
distribution programs of other state power companies. Two of these
projects are facing serious delays because of counterpart funding
difficulties. One Bank loan to ELETROBRAS has been helping to finance the
purchase and installation of supervision and control equipment (para.
1.1.2). This project is expected to be completed three years late (June
1988) mainly due to procurement problems. The second loan that was not
channelled to distribution companies, but to two subsidiaries of
ELETROBRAS, CHESF and FURNAS, for transmission installations, is on
schedule. Annex 1.1 sets forth details on Bank loans to ELETROBRAS.
1.1.6    In addition to helping with the financing of generation,
transmission, and distribution works, Bank participation in the power
sector has also contributed to the efforts of the Brazilian authorities to
improve sector organization and planning. Bank participation has also
facilitated access to foreign financing (comercial and bilateral)
benefitting the power sector.
1.2      Sector Ortanization
1.2.1    The institutional development of the Brazilian power sector over
the last 50 years has been characterized by progressive nationalization and
growing centralization, resulting in the consolidation of a few large and
hundreds of small utilities into a relatively compact structure of state
and federally-owned utilities. The power sector is under the jurisdiction
of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) created in 1960. Since then,
there has been a trend towards increasing sector efficiency and
coordination with the establishment of Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A.
,ELETROBRAS) in 1962, and the strengthening of the Departmento Nacional de
Aguas e Energia Eletrica (DNAEE), within ME, as regulatory agency. The
aim has been to combine, as much as possible, regionalization of operations
with country-wide optimization of resources.
1.2.2    Though complex, and one of the largest in the world, the electric
power sector is well organized. Decree 60,824 of June 7, 1967, established
the current sector organization under which DNAEE performs regulatory
fumctions, grants licenses for generating plants, assigns concessions,
approves expansion plans and sets tariffs, after approval by the Ministry
of Planning, under the principle of service-at-cost plus an adequate return
on capital. ELETROBRAS serves as a holding company and as a sector
development bank. ELETROBRAS also is responsible for sector planning of
major generating and transmission facilities and coordinates and supervises
the public power system.
1.2.3    At the operating level, the sector consists of federal, state,
municipal, and private concessionaires. Since 1974, in accordance with
Government policy, construction and operation of major new power generating
facilities and related high voltage transmission systems are reserved
largely to four ELETROBRAS subsidiaries which cover Brazil's five geo-
economic regions. These companies are Centrais Eletricas do Norte do
Brasil (ELETRONORTE), Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF),
Furnas Centrais Eletricas (FURNAS), and Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil
(ELETROSUL). Also some state companies construct and operate generation
and transmission facilities. The distribution function is carried out at



- 3 -
the state level mainly by utilities controlled by state goverrnents,
although ELETROBRAS has also been Investing In distribution companies.
1.2.4    The Federal Government takea most of the lmportant decisions
affecting the powor sectors it approves investment programs, sets tariffs,
authorizes external borrowiags, and sets constraints on wage policies.
This decision making process is carried out In a centralised fashion and
reflects broader macroeconomic concerns. In the past, such process hs
meant that tariff adjustments have been inadequate to meet r- l cost
increas*es subsidized tariffs have been approved to promote exports and to
*timulate the substitution of electricity for imported oil products; and
the borrowing capacity of the sector has been used beyond prudent limits,
taking advautage of the sector's access to foreign financing. The result
of all this has been adverse to sector finances.
1.3      The Beneficiaries
1.3.1    CEMIG was founded in 1952 as a stock corporation.  The state of
Mines Gerais is its main shareholder (68Z). Unlike many other state
companies which only purchase energy from the subsidiaries of SLITROBRAS,
CEKIG owns and operates considerable generation capacity (1986: 4,460 MV)
which is sufficient to generate most of the energy required (1986s 802 of
27,419 GWh) by its 2.6 million customers which represent about 70S of the
population.
1.3.2    CELESC was created in 1955 as a stock corporation, the state of
Santa Catartna is its main shareholder (802). It covers most ene:gy
requirements (1986: 92Z of 5,771 GWh) of its 870,000 customers through
purchases from ELETROSUL. The respective access-to-service ratio is quite
high (1986: approximately 872).
1.3.3    ESCELSA, which was founded in 1968, is al8o a stock corporation,
but the main shareholder (852) is not the state (Espirito Santo) but
ELETROBRAS More than two thirds of the energy requirements (1986s 71S of
3,U40 GWh) are covered by purchases frow FURNAS. Its 420,000 customers
represent about 752 of the population.



II.  PROJECT PREPATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1      Project Origin and Rationale
2.1.1    The South-Southeast Power Distribution Project had its origin in
preliminary discussions with ELETROBRAS in November 1975 about the
possibility of a Bank loan to ELETROBRAS to expand the distribution network
in the states of Minas Gerals, Espirito Santo and Rio de Janeiro, following
the scheme already established in the previous year for Loan 1300-BR, i.e.
ELETROBRAS as Borrower and the state companies as Beneficiaries.
2.1.2    In addition to the normal technical and economic benefits, the
project, from the point of view of the Bank, was initially expected to
help strengthen the management and planning of ESCELSA, Companhia
Brasileira de Energia Eletrica (CBEE), and Centrais Eletricas Fluminenses
S.A. (CELF), would provide valuable financial support for CEMIG, and would
offer some social benefits by including a component for low-income urban
consumers.
2.2      Proiect Preparatlon and Appraisal
2.2.1    Bank preparation (October and December 1976), preappraisal (March
and June 1977) and appraisal missions (July 1977) focussed on the Issue of
selection of beneficiaries, project definition, project cost, loan size,
procurement arrangements, Implementation periods, uniform distribution
standards, and financing schemes for low-income urban consumers.
ELETROBRAS, after having initially selected two power companies of the
state of Rio de Janeirop CBEE and CELF, as two of the Beneficiaries, in the
course of the preparation excluded them as they were In the state of
merging with each other which absorbed their available staff time and would
not have allowed them to prepare their project components according to Bank
standards. Inastead, Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina S.A. (CELESC),
the state company for Santa Catarina in the south of the country, was
proposed in November 1976 and the project was consequently renamed from
Southeast Power Distribution Project to South-Southeast Power Distribution
Project. Initially, the amount of the loan considered was US$80 million.
During preparation and appraisal it was increased to US$130 million because
the Bank decided to cover the total foreign exchange cost of the modified
project scope. Even so, while the sub-projects of CELESC and ESCELSA
included their total subtransmission (138 kV and below) program between
711978 and 1211981, for CEMIG only about 35Z of the subtransmission program
was considered. Due to slow decision-msking by ELETROBRAS, the allocation
of loan proceeds among the three beneficiaries was only determined at
appraisal.



2.2.2    At appraisal, it was expected that the project cost and sub-loans
would be allocated among the Beneficiaries as follows:

2.3      Negotiations. Presentation. and Effectiveness
2.3.1    No problems delayed negotiations (February 13-22, 1978).  Board
approval occurred on March 28, 1978. Representatives of the Bank,
ELETROBRAS, CEM4IG, CELESC, ESCELSA, and the national and state governments
signed Loan, Project, Shareholder and Guarantee Agreements on May 8, 1978.
Loan 1538-BR amounted to US$130.0 milliong the ternm was 15 years, Including
3.5 years grace. The interest rate was 7.45Z, the committuent fee 3/4 of
1Z. Effectiveness of the Loan Agreement was delayed to September 14, 1978,
because of slow action on part of the Government in providing legal
opinions.

2.4      iasor Covenants of the Loan. Guarantee. Prolect and
Shareholder Agreements
2.4.1    Annex 2.1 sets forth major covenants of the Loan, Guarantee,
Project, and Shareholder Agrements. Brazilian authorities complied with
their respective major covenants, except in the areas of tariffs and
revenue and capital Increases. After 1979, Government tariff decislons
reulted In low revenue levels for the Beneficiaries *nd non-compliance
with respoet to their covenanted rate of remuneration.l Chapter 5 sets
forth details on the tariff policy of the Government and its impact on the
finances of the sector and the Beneficiaries.
1/ Under Brazilian legislation, the remunerable rate base includes
elements either different from or additional to those defined in Bank
loan agreements for power projects. Those elements includes (i)
average net fixed assets in operation established on a time-weighted
basis (rather than an arithmetic average based on values at the
beginning and end of the year); (ii) an allowance for working capitall
and (iLL) the accumulated revenue shortfall of prior years.



III. PROJECT EXECUTION AND COST
3.1      Forecast and Actual Data on Proiect Execution and Cost
3.1.1    Annex 3.1 compares forecast and actual completed works and
completion dates for components of sub-projects A, B, and C. Annex 3.2
sets forth the indices and exchange rates used for converting current cost
into constant cost. Annex 3.3 compares forecasts and actual project cost
and sources of financing. Annexes 3.4 and 3.5 compare, respectively,
forecast and actual allocations of the loan proceeds and forecast and
actual annual disbursements. The following paragraphs discuss the,
information contained in the above annexes.
3.2      Timetable. Chanies and Supervision
3.2.1    Physical execution of the transmission/distribution works began in
January 1978, about 12 months late. CEMIG completed its subproject by July
1986 or 4.5 years later than the SAR had assumed. CELESC and ESCELSA
finished their subprojects by December 1986, 5 years behind the SAR
schedule.
3.2.2   The major factor responsible for the delayed beginning of project
ekecution was the need to adapt the scope of the project to changes in
demand caused especially by several major industrial consumers. In the
case of CEMIG contributing to the delay was also the fact that it took 15
months to sign the on-lending agreement with ELETROBRAS. Supervisions also
showed that during appraisal there had not been enough time to explain Bank
procurement procedures to CELESC and ESCELSA-who were first-time Bank
Beneficiaries-and that ELETROBRAS was not very helpful in this respect.
3.2.3    The late completion date of the project (overall, 5 years behind
schedule, i.e., December 1986 instead of December 1981) was due to a
variety of factors. The SAR estimate was too optimistic; the standard Bank
profile for power projects in Brazil is 9 years compared to the 5 years
shown in the SAR. In addition, the most important other factors which
contributed to delays were the late initial start of physical execution,
the worsening financial situation of the sector, which required stretching
of capital investments, and the necessary adaptation to changes in the
pattern of demand which increased with the stretched execution of the
project. There were three changes, with Bank agreement, of the various
sub-categories of the project, the first in 1979, the second in 1981 and
the third in 1985. These changes had the effect of increasing the total
scope of the project. Other factors causing delay were the longer than
expected processing time of six months for approval of import licenses by
Carteira do Comercio Exterior, CACEX, of the Banco do Brasil, and lack of
counterpart funding by ELETROBRAS and the state governments. On the other
hand, in the course of project execution, CELESC and ESCELSA became
familiar and adept in the preparation of technical specifications and in
complying with the various procedural requirements established by the Bank.

A comparison of total forecast versus actual works Indicates no
clear trend to higher or lower voltage levels.  The extent of the changes
should not be considered unusual, as heterogeneous transmission/
distribution projects must be flexibly tmplemented to adapt to evolving
market conditions. Further, there is no obvious method for
differentiating project and non-project works if they are connected. In
addition, as the project was initially defined as the time slice between
7/1978 and 12/1981 of the capital investments in subtransmission and
distribution, with the change in execution period this definition lost its
meaning. The project objectives, however, remained unchanged.
3.2.5    Between June 1978 and May 1985, Bank staff carried out several
technical supervision missions of the subtranamissionldistribution works
constituting the three subprojects. Bank staff took an understanding view
of the initial delays of project execution. By stimulating action to
correct the design according to new market developments and quick action
on requested proje±t changes, Bank staff contributed to successful
lmplementation of the sub-projects of CELESC and ESCELSA. As discussed In
Chapter 5, the other main focus of Bank supervision related to remedying
the financial difficulties of the sector.

However, comparing the performance of the Beneficiaries on the basis of
these figuros alone would be misleading. They all have continued to extend
their service to low-income customers outside of the project, especially
CEMIG whose Bank-financod capital investment program was the smalleat
portion of its overall investment program.
3.4      Performance of Consultants. Contractors and Suppliers. and
Procurement Issues
tach-   3.4.1   The SAR roquire4 CELESC and ESCELSA to employ consultants for
CuLzSC design, procurement, and supervision of 134 kV equipment. Consultants
md its helped with the project design and Companhia Auxiliar de Empresas Eletricas
fica-   Brs ileiras, CAlEB, with procurement. CELESC also retained consultants for
to     project supervision, while ESCELSA was considered sufficiently qualified to
-Fine   supervise execution.  In general, the two companies wete satisfied with the
services of the consultanto albeit some problems experienced with
procurement procedures. There the basic problem was that CAEBB wes acting
as an agent followlng the instructions of the Beneficiaries in spite of the
faet that In some cases these Instructions did not comply with procurement
provisions of the Loan Agreement. These problems were solved in
discussions with the Borrower and the Beneficiaries. No major proble_
with contractors/suppliers arose. In 1983, CELESC ordered huge quantities
of equipment in order to use the funds of the loan while they were still
available. These had to be stored in its warehouses for an extended period
of tine, as insufficient counterpart funds were available to finance the
cost of local contractors. However, initially poor storage conditions were
improved at the Bank's suggestion and prevented any serious damage to the
equipment stored until it could be utilized for the purposes of the
project.
3.4.2    In two cases, reserved procurement wva declared. Secretaria
Especial de Informatica, SEI, did not permit external acquisiton of the
equipment required for a regional control and supervision center for CDIIG
(approximately US$2.6 million), and CACEK did not authorize Importation
of hot line maintenance equipment for CELESC. The corresponding mounts
were therefore cancelled. In general, the Beneficiaries tended to split



-10 -
the goods and services to be procured into too many single operations,
which caused an ecessivew ork load both for them and for the Bank. For
example, ESCELSA, Beneficlary of a loan amount of US$27.6 million, had a
total of 53 bids, 73 limited price quotations and 196 purchase order which
results in an average value per operation of only US$85,400.
3.5      Pro1ect Costs and Financing
3.5.1   Expenditures for the project a*ounted to US$427.4 million, or 0.12
more than the cost estimate prepared at appraisal. Summarizing Annex 3.3,
the table below compares forecast and actual project costs.

The above cost comparison is of only limited value because of the changes
in the scope of the project. Although one wmuld have expected a
considerable difference between forecast and actual cost because of the
longer than initially foreseen implementation period the Beneficiaries were
able to offset this partly by getting better prices through ICB than they
were used to from national bidding only. Also contributing was the higher
devaluation of the Cruzeiro than the price adjustments due to price
escalation clauses in contracts with Brazilian suppliers/contractors and
keen competition among local suppliers/contractors due to the economic
slump.
3.5.2   At appraisal, the Bank was expected to supply US$130.0 million for
financing, with the balance, US$297.0 million, to be supplied by the
Beneficiaries and ELETROBRAS. As shown in the table below, actual project
financing Included US$125.0 million from Loan 1538-BR, with the balance,
US$304.5 million, furnished by the Beneficiaries, ELETROBRAS and others.

3.6      Chanstes to the Closing Date. Allocation of Loan Proceeds and
TWmitn of Disburement
3.6.1   As a result of changes and delays in the project, the Closing Date
and allocation of loan proceeds differed considerably from what ws"
expected at appraisal. In response to requests by ELETROBRAS, the Bank
agreod to extend the Closing Date from the original December 31, 1982, to
December 31, 1984, then further to December 31, 1985. Annexes 3.4 and 3.5
compare forecast and actual data on allocation of loan proceeds and the
timing of disbursements. On April 24, 1987 the Bank cancelled the
undisbursed balance of the loan which could not be utilized for project-
related expenditures. Cancellation was made effective retroactively to tho
date of final disburment, October 10, 1986.

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.1      Forecast end Actual Data on Justification of the Proiect
4.1.1   Annox 4.1 compares forec-t and actual sales levels of CEMIG,
CELESC and ESCELSA for the years 1978-1982 and sets forth actual sales
levels for 1983, 1984 and 1985 end an estimate for 1986. Annex 4.2 gives a
comparison of forecast end actual rates of return.
4.2      Economic Justification of the Proiect
4.2.1   At appraisal, Bank staff end Brazilian power authorities expected
the Project to contribute to the economic growth of the states concerned,
mostly related to industrial growth, and to the improvement of the standard
of living of the population, especially through the low-income consumers
component. To reach these objectives and to provide for expected load
growth, the Project was designed as part of a least-cost transmission/
distribution investment program.
4.2.2    During the period up to 1982, the actual level of sales of the
three companies remained well below the forecast, as Brazil in the
beginning of the eighties started to face economic difficulties. CEMIG
reached the sales projected for 1982 in the year 1984, or two years later
than estimated in the SAR, CELESC in 1985 or 3 years later, while ESCELSA
in 1986 still remained 232 below the amount forecast in the SAR for 1982.
One may conclude that for CEMIG and CELESC, sales fo_ecasts were
satisfactory, as the economic slowdown could not reasonably have been
assumed at the time of project appraisal.
4 3      Return on Investment
4 3 1   An ex-post comparison of forecast with actual rates of return has
to be based on the much longer actual execution period and has to include
other capital investments during the same period, since a distinction
between incremental sales revenues and operating costs due to the project
and those due to other capital investments would go much beyond the scope
of a PCR. The calculation is based on actual data for the years 1979-1985
and a projection until 2014. Generally speaking, rates of return remained
below the expectations at the appraisal stage as the financial performance
of the Brazilian power sector since the late seventies constantly
deteriorated, for which the decreasing rates of remuneration (para. 5.2.5)
are one indicator.  The following table     about forecast and actual rates
of return summarizes Annex 4.2:
---------Rate of Return--------
Appraisal
Forecast            Actual
CEMIG                             16.7               10.9
CELESC                            15.3                3.4
ESCELSA                           17.0               13.0
TOTAL                        16.6               10.3
Since tariffs are used as a proxy for benefits, real benefits for the
economy will be above the level resulting from this calculation.

5.2 Government Tariff and Financing Policies for the Sector 1964-1985:
Revenue Covenants: and Tariff Agreements of the Early 1980'.
5.2.1    Under the present sector org.nization (paras. 1.2.1 to 1.2.4), the
Government takes the most significant financial decisions, particularly
with respect to the setting of tariffs, with little participation on the
part of the state governments and power utilities. In such a situation,
the financial performance of the Beneficiaries of Loan 1538-BR paralleled
that of the sector, which in turn reflected tariff policies established by
the Government. Between 1978 and 1982, the average rate of remuneration of
the sector declined from 8.6S to 6.1S, and then later to 3.42 in 1985.
There was a corresponding decline for CEMIG, CELESC and ESCELSA. As an
understanding of Government policy with respect to tariffs and financing
for the power sector is fundamental to an understanding of the financial
performance of the individual power utility, the following sets forth a
brief description of Government policy over the last twenty years. There
is also a discussion of the revenue covenants of the Project Agreements and
the various tariff agreements negotiated with the Bank since 1980.
1 5.2.2    In the early 1960's, by establishing ELETROBRAS, and later in the
early 1970's, by delineating the responsibilities of the Federal and state
power companies, the Government created a new structure for sector
organization to make the power sector an important contributing factor to
the economic development of Brazil. To provide adequate levels of funding
for the ambitious sector investment program, the Government contributed
high levels of equity funding and set tariffs at realistic levels - that
is, at levels sufficient to earn the legal rate of remuneration (10-12S) on
annually revalued remunerable assets.
5.2.3    As a result of these tariff policies, the contribution of
consumer-based funding to the growing investment program increased steadily
throughout the mid 1970's, at which time the sector reached a peak of
financial soundness. In 1973, the net (after debt service) consumer-based
funding provided 562 of the sector's funding mix, whereas borrowing had a
share of only 302. Equity contributions composed the balance of the
funding mix.
5.2.4    The oil crisis of the mid 1970's created a new set of financial
conditions for the power sector: (i) inflation affected substantially the
unit costs of the investment program of the sector; and (ii) the
Government's fight against inflation resulted in a deterioration of real
tariff levels and of the consumer-based contribution to the investment
program. As a consequence of these conditions, the sector became



- 14 -
Increasingly dependent on borrowings, resulting in a heavy debt service
burden In the late 1970's and early 1980's. Also, as a consequence of
these conditions, many Brasilian power companies were no longer able to
meet the rev*nu requirements covenanted with the Bank.
5.2.5    Section 4.04 (a) of the Project Agreements and Section 3.02 (a)
of the Guarantee Agreement for Loan 1538-BR requireI, respectively:
(i) CDIG, CELESC ane ISCILSA to take all action necessary for tariffs to
be set at levels to produce revenues as provided by Brazilian lawg and
(ii) the Government to take all reasonable action necessary to enable the
Beneficiaries to comply with obligations contained in the Project
Agreements. Brazilian law called for a rate of return of 10-12S on
remnmerable assets, which level of remuneration the sector failed to earn
subsequent to 1978. The following table compares, for the period 1978-
1985, the forecast and actual rates of remuneration of the sector and the
Beneficiaries:

5.2.6    In 1980, having experienced increasingly disappointing results in
obtaining compliance on the part of the power sector with existing revenue
covenants, the Bank reached an understanding whereby the Government would
increase tariff levels to achieve a rate of remuneration of 102 in 1981 and
future years and the recovery of revenue shortfalls of prior years over a
three-year period. The table above shows a substantial improvement in the
rate of remuneration of the sector in 1981, as compared with the previous
year, but a rate of remuneration which still fell short of the level agreed
in 1980. In 1981, sales growth fell short of projected levels because of
macroeconomic conditions, consideration of which further inhibited the
Government from raising power tariffs sufficiently to earn a rate of return
of 101. This unwillingness to raise tariff levels led to additional
discussions with the Bank and the formulation of a new revenue agreement.
This agreement represented an easing of revenue targets as originally
covenanted.
5.2.7    In October 1981, the Bank and the Government agreed that the
latter would increase tariff levels by 31 in real terms in 1982 and 52
annually thereafter, until the sector achieved a 102 rate of return and



- 15 -
past shortfalls wer- recovered. Having accepted this new approach, the
Bank formally a8gred not to require compliance on the port of Brazilian
power borrowers with *xisting revenue covenants. In November 1983, this
approach ws amended to reflect new financial conditions: both parties
agreed on a program of tariff action and other measures to increase the
sector rate of remuneration by one percentage point each yer until 1989,
when the sector shouwld earn a return of 102. The various agreements
referred to above did not lead to an amandment of the revenue covenants
under LoaL 1538-BR. Rather, the Bank comimtted itself not to seek
enforcement of these covenants as long as tariff levels were increased as
agreed.
5.2.8    The succesaive revenue agreements after 1980 reflected the efforts
on the part of the Bank and Brazilian power suthorities to establish tariff
levels under adverse and trying circumstances. With respect to the 1983
revenue agreement, the financial performance of the sector in 1984 was
satisfactory, but deteriorated again in 1985. The restoration of sector
finances will not be achieved in the near term.
5.3 Sales. Tariff Levels, and Finances of the Beneficiaries. 1978-1982
5.3.1    The table below summarizes, on an aggregate basis, the financial
data of CEMIG, CELESC and ESCELSA for the period 1978-1982, the period of
project implementation originally expected at appraisal.

5.3.2    The above table shows that for the group a  & whole, the actual
level of aggregate sales, overage revenue per kWh sold, and operating
revenues, all rmalned well below the levels expected at appraisal, while
generation expenses per kWh were not reduced. Therefore, the Beneficlries
as a group experienced a shortfall of net operating income by nearly 502
and bad to reduce capital investuents more than twice as much as compared
to the lower than expected sales. Consequently, gross interual cash
generation fell approxIintely one third short of the $AR level, and not
internal cash generation by two thirds.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1 The Borrower
6.1.1    During 1978-1982, ELETROBRAS coordinated the following groups,
which have made a significant contribution to improving the functioning of
the sector including the distribution function: (i) the Committee for
Distribution (CODI); (ii) the Coordinating Group for System Planning
(GCPS); and (iii) the Center for Electric Research (CEPEL). In addition to
establishing technical, operational, and commercial standards for
distribution companies, CODI provided ELETROBRAS with the capacity to
coordinate sector distribution planning in an improved fashion. GCPS has
developed a set of mathematical planning models and programs specially
suited to the size and complexity of the power sector. GCPS has elaborated
a satisfactory methodology for annually updating generation and
transmission planning, taking into account the different needs of federal
and state power companies. CEPEL has cozziod out useful research on
various metals (such as aluminum for wiring r.sidential structures) and
corrosion.  By converting debt into equity. EI'ETROBRAS helped to alleviate
the tight financial position of CELESC to tome extent.  The experience it
gained during the preparation of this project was helpful to ELETROBRAS for
preparing subsequent projects (ELETROBRAS I and II-Power Distribution).
6.2 The Beneficiaries
6.2.1    Annex 6.1 compares, for the years 1978 to 1982, forecast and
actual indicators of performance, and provides actual values for the period
1983 to 1985. On balance, the Bank was satisfied with the performance of
CEMIG and ESCELSA, which showed increasing efficiency and administrative
expertise as the implementation of the project progressed. While CELESC
also improved its project execution capabilities, the state Government
continued to control and direct its activities to a much greater degree
than those of other states, and the company responded to these wishes to an
undue degree. Despite considerable efforts by the Bank, the situation
remained basically unchanged during the period under review.
6.2.2    Part of the Bank loan was also used to finance the cost of
management consultants for a diagnosis of the organizational improvements
required, both at CELESC and ESCELSA. ESCELSA was receptive to their
recommendations and together with ELETROBRAS implemented on its own
initiative further management system improvements, with highly satisfactory
results. CELESC's personnel at first were very reluctant to make use of the
services of management consultants, but changed its attitude somewhat, such
that some major problems, especially in accounting, were overcome; however,
problems with its contracted data processor were not resolved, although the
Bank provided an individual consultant.
6.3 The Bank
6.3.1    Bank participation in the sector encouraged the development of co-
ordinated sector operations and planning, and facilitated access to foreign
financing (commercial and bilateral). Bank staff successfully aided
implementation of the Project by stimulating action to correct design flaws
aad by responding quickly to requested changes.



- 19 -
6.3.2    By informally suspending disbursements for CEKIG's portion during
1981 and by threatening to suspend disbursements on CELESC's part, the Bank
wa  able to help improve the finahcial situation of both Beneficiaries in
the short run.
6.3.3    In the late 1970's and early 1980's, as part of its effort to
combat inflation, and taking Into account economic and political
considerations, the Government did not adjust tariff levels in the amounts
required by the original revenue covenants   Faced with the fact of non-
compliance, the Bank was willing to take an uaderstanding attitude toward
the changed conditions of the Brazilian economy, and accordingly
negotiated, in 1981 and 1983, new sector revenue agreements. However,
subsequent financial performance of the sector was not in conformity with
these agreements. The Bank, in its recent power sector operations, had to
deal with these issues again.
6 4  The Government
6.4.1    By failing to increase tariff as required, the Government has
weakened the sector's financial autonomy, which has also been affected by
recession and sequences of devaluation that occurred in recent years.
Despite this development, the Brazilian power sector continues to be well
managed, with better than average performance in satisfying an extremely
rapid market growth, and with good investment planning.

VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1 A Successful Proiect
7.1.1    On balance, the South-Southeast Power Distribution Project should
be judged successful In its technical results, while the financial results
fell short of expectations to a considerable extent. Increasing
supervision would not have helped *a the financial results of the
Beneficiaries were mainly determined by policy decision taken at the
national level.
7.2 Monitorinz Sector Policies
7 2.1    The sectoral developments during the execution of the South-
Southeast Power Distribution Project illustrate the need to pay continuing
attention to basic sectoral issues, even in relatively well-managed
national power sectors, such as that of Brazil. With their new focus on
sectoral adjustment, the Bank and the Brazilian Government are taking this
Into account.
7.3 Procurement
7.3.1   At appraisal the Bank did not seek an agreement on procurement
packaging, to llmit the number of contracts for review to manageable
levels. This resulted in a very large number of small contracts and,
consequently, in a very heavy procurement supervision effort for the Bank,
which was counterproductive to the Beneficiaries too, because of delays.
The Energy Projects Division is now focusing on this subject and, at
present, procurement packaging is agreed at the preparation/appraisal
stage.

WORLD BANK, WASHINGTON, DC, 20433, USA
RE. PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT - LOAN 1538-BR
WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING COMMENTSt
ITEM 3.4.1 - PG. 9 - CELESC WAS ALSO CONSIDERED SUFFICIENTLY QUALIFIED TO
SUPERVISE THE PROJECTS IN 138 KV.
THE CONTRIBUTION IN THE FORM OF COUNTERPART FINANCIAL RESOURCES FROM
ELETROBRAS WAS INSUFFICIENT, AS SHOWN IN ANNEX 3.3 - PG. 30 - ITEM 2,
SOURCES OF FINANCING. THIS REPRESENTED A LACK OF COORDINATION IN THE
EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAHS AND EXPANDED STOCKING OF EQUIPMENT PURCHASED WITH
RESOURCES OF THE WORLD BANK. THE TARIFF POLICY THEN IN FORCE ALSO AFFECTED
SLIGHTLY THE GENERATION OF INTERNAL RESOURCES ON THE PART OF CELESC.
ANNEX 2.1 - COMPLIANCE WITH LOAN CONDITIONS, PG. 23.
G.A./2.02/F COUNTERPART FUNDING - YES - CELESC AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT
GUARANTEED COUNTERPART RESOURCES AS SHOWN IN ANNEX 3.3. PG. 30.
G.A./5(A)/F THERE WAS A CONTRIBUTION OF USDLS 26.7 MILLIONS FROM THE STATE.
YES. THIS WAS DEMONSTRATED BY THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DIRECTORATE OF
CELESC IN THE REPORTS SENT TO THE WORLD BANK.
ANNEX 4.1, PG. 35: FORECAST AND ACTUAL MARRET DEVELOPMENT.  SET FORTH BELOW
IS THE DATA SENT TO THE WORLD BANK THROUGH THE STATISTICAL BULLETIN OF
CELESC.
