APPRAISAL OF A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a third education project in Thailand for
which an IDA credit of US$19.5 million is proposed. A first education loan
to Thailand, made by the Bank in 1966, provided US$6 million for improving
vocational education. The project will be satisfactorily completed in mid-
1973. A second Bank loan, signed in May, 1972, provides US$15.4 million
for expanding and relocating part of Kasetsart (Agricultural) University.
The proposed third project would concentrate upon qualitativ2 improvements
in the education syster and alle-iate shortages of qualifie, primary school
teacherr and scientists. Nith almost all the project institutions located
in the provinces, the project would also help to reduce the imbalance in
present educational opportunity between the regions.
ii.       The contents of previous Bank projects and cf the proposed new
project reflect the main thrust of the government's educational development
policy. Consistent with the Third National Economic and Social Development
Pla' (1972-1976) which stresses the development of human resources, this
policy aims at building a moder.a and nore relevant education system. The
strategy to support this policy was initiated during the 1960's and focuses
specifically on: (a) a general re-direction of the entire system by making
curricula more flexible and practical; (b) a moderate expansion of primary
and sezondary education; (c) training more and better qualified primary
school teachers; (d) improving the internal efficiency of the education
system: and (e) redressing the imbalance in educational opportunity between
urban and rural areas.
iii.      T'he government :'aces a major obstacle in implenenting this
strategy - namely, a fragmented approach to education planning, policy mak-
ing and administration. Responsibility for decision-making is scattered
among many agencies and their activities are not fully coordinated which
makes it difficult to design and implement a comprehensive education policy.
Government policy for 1972-76 includes improvement in planning and adminis-
trative procedures.
iv.       The proposed project would assist the government in implementing
its education strategy by: (a) improving curricula research and development
programs; (b) iv,n.roving secondary education; (c) expanding and upgrading
primary teacher training; (d) improving science education at a regional
university: and (e) providing technical assistance in support of various
project components and for feasibility studies in the areas of educational
radio and television and textbook production.
v.        Specifically, the project would finance:
(a) buildings, furniture and equipment for:



- ii -
-    seven new primary teacher training colleges (including
demonstration schools);
-    extensions to 21 rural secondary schools;
-    a National Curriculum Development Center;
-    expansion of the Faculty of Science at Songkhla University:
(b)  furniture and equipment for 11 existing secondary schools;
(c)  equipment for 3 primary teecher training colleges now being
built; and
(d)  the cost of 61-1/2 man-years of specialists' services and 184
man-years of fellowships for training abroad.
vi.       Project units to be established in the Ministry of Education and
at Songkhla University would be responsible 'or project implementation and
liaison with the Association. The design and supervision of civil works at
Songkhla University would be handled by consultant architects. Archltectural
services for all other project items would be undertaken by Ministry of
Education architects. Accommodation schefules are functional and econonical
and furniture and equipment estimates are reasonable; detailed lists will be
prepared during implementation and reviewed by the Association before pro-
curement.
vii.      The Project would be completed in about five and a half years.
Contracts for construction and for the procurement of furniture and equipment
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with IDA guidelin?s. It is expected that all construction and most
furniture contracts would be awarded to local firms and that almost all
equipment would be imported. Preferred domestic manufacturers of furniture
and equipment would be allowed a margin of preference equal to the existing
duties applicable to competing imports or 15% of the c.i.f. price, whichever
is the lower.
viii.     Total project cost is estimated at US$39 million.  The proposed
credit of USS19.5 million would meet 50% of total project costs. The
foreign exchange component of the project is estimated at USS16.3 million.
ix.       The project is suitable as a basis for an IDA credit of
USS19.5 million to the Kingdom of Thailand for a period of 50 years including
a grace period of 10 years.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A first Bank loan (No. 471-TH) for education, made to Thailand in
1966, provided US$6 million for equipment as part of a project to expand 14
trade and industrial schools, 10 agricultural schools and two industrial and
agricultural instructor training institutions. This project will be satisfac-
torily completed in mid-1973. A second loan (No. 822-TH), signed in May, 1972,
provides US$15.4 million for the expansion and relocation of part of Kasetsart
(Agricultural) University. This project will be implemented during 1972-77.
1.02      The possibility of further World Bank Group assistance to educa-
tionL was discussed with government authorities by various Bank/Unesco mis-
sicas during 1970-71. I. March/April 1972, a mission consisting of
Messrs. A. Cespedes (general educator), Man He You (economist), D. Lewis
(architect), J. McNown (university educator) and M. Krohn (tezhnical educator,
ILO), visited Thailand to complete preparation of a third education project
and to appraise it.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      At the heart of Southeast Asia, Thailand spreads about two-thirds
of the way down the Malay Peninsula and covers 200,000 square miles.  Its
population, having doubled in the last 20 years, is now 37.3 million and
is growing at 3.1% p.a. Urban population (cities of 10,000 inhabitants
or more) accounts for 15%-20% of the total and is growing (1965-71) at 3.9%
p.a. The metropolitan area of BangkoP-Thonburi is the main economic and
administrative center and accounts for 60% of total urban population; in
addit'on, nine cities have populations in excess of 45,OUL.  Most of the
rural population lives in scattered small towns and villages with poor com-
munications which make diffizult the provision of social services such as
education and public health. Of the total population, 30% is illiterate:
45% is ce'low 15 years of age. The spoken language and the medium of in-
struction is Thai except for some university courses that are tau 'it if
English. The dominant religion, playing a significant role in peoples'
life, is Buddhism and the culture is a mixture of Thai, Chinese, and Thai-
Lao traditions. A trend toward westernization is noticeable, particularly
in metropolitan Bangkok.
2.02      The economy grew at the rate of 7.5% p.a. during 1967-72 with an
increase in per capita income exceeding 4% a year. Although it appears
that the gains of growth have been evenly distributed between urban and
rural areas, the average income of rural families is about half that of
urban families and per capita income In Bangkok is estimated to be three
times that of the rest of the country. Per capita GDP is US$212.
Agriculture is the leading sector of the economy and is expected to continue
in this role in the 1970's. Agricultural production grew by more than 4.6% p.a.
during 1967-72 and accounted for about 28% of GDP in 1972. In 1972, agri-
cultural commodities accounted for about 65% of muer..nandise exports of which
rice accounted for 19% and maize 10%. The manufacturing sector increased its
production by 9.2% p.a. during 1967-72 and generated about 17% of GDP in 1972.



2.03      The development strategy, outlined in the Third National Economic
and Social Development Plan, 1972-76, (Third Plan), calls for considerable
investments ir human resource development to help meet the country's rJP
growth target of 7% p.a. The ?lan allocations to the social sectors (educa-
tion, public health, other social services an6 urban 'nd rural davelopment)
are higher than in the Second Development Plan (1967-71), increasing frc-i
50% to 57% of public development expenditurc. Thie increase will partic-
ularly benefit education, which will receive 33% of total public development
expenditure during che Third Plan as compared with 27% during the previous
plan.
III. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
General
3.01      The education system is in a stage of transition.  In 1960, the
government announced its new National Education Scheme (NES) which aimed at
changing the academically-oriented system into a more modern and practical
one. The NES has four objectives to be achieved by 1980, namely: (a) com-
pulsor.7 free education up to the age of fifteen; (b) better programs of
vocational secondary educat4on; (c) expanded and improved agricultural edu-
caticn at the secondary and higher levels; and (d) improved educationel
planning and administration.
3.02      The two education plans (1962-66 and 1967-71) designed to implement
the NES have been only partially successful. Enrollment expansion took place
mainly in the metropolitan area while educational opportunity in most rural
areas is still limited. Little has been achieved in the fields of educational
planning and administration. However, technical and agricultural education
have improved, partly with the aid of the two Bank education projects.
Edtzcation Policy and Strategy
3.n3      The policy for 1972-76, as outlined in the Third Plan, calls for a
more comprehensive approach to educational problems with emphasis given to:
(a) modernizing secondary curricula; (b) improving teacher quality; (c) improv-
ing internal efficiency; (d) reducing the inbalance in educational opportunity
between urban and rural areas; and (e) improving planning and administrative
procedures. As a part of the strategy to implement this policy, new faciliLies,
nainly in the provinces, are to be provided and new approaches to teacher
training, curriculum design and evaluation techniques will be introduced.
The government also intends to make more extensive use of radio and television
(ERTV) programs in formal and non-formal education, particularly as these
teachlng aids could add greatly to the effectiveness and relevance of primary
education and teacher training. It tnerefore plans to conduct a feasibility
studv on the use of these media. Funds for the study are included in the
present project which may thus lead to a later project to assist ERTV.



-3-
The Education System
3.04      The education system (Appendix 1 and Charts 1 and 2) comprises a
seven-year primary cycle (four-year lower, three-year upper) followed
by a three-year lower and a two-year (three in vocational schools) upper
secondary cycle. Higher education consists of two-year diploma courseE in
colleges and four-year degree and graduate programs in universities.
3.05      Administration is divided among several ministries and coordination
requires improvemnenit.  The Ministry of Interior is responsible for most
primary schools but professiunal supervision is entrusted to the Ministry of
Ediicatio. (MOE). The MOE administers adult education, teacher training, and
secondary and post-secondary technical education. The Bureau of Universities
(BOU) supervises the universities. Planning is the responsibility of three
separate agencies, the National Economic and Social Dnvelopment Board (NESDB),
the BOU and the MOE Educational Planning Division (EPD). As a consequence
of this dispersion of planning, the limited amount of educational research
carried out in Thailand has had little impact on education policy and decision
making.
3.06      Prinary education is compulsory between the ages of 7-13; this
measure is not enforced in the rjral areas because of the limited .Lumber of
upper primary schools. Consideration should be given to :ncreasing the
number of schuol days per year from 180 to about 210 (Asian average) and
reducing the primary cycle from 7 to 6 years. Enrollment (Annexes i and 2) is
now about 83% of the relevant age group. Standards are low, particularly in
rural areas, and many childzen lack textbooks and other materials. Repetition
and dropout rates are high and a large number of teachers are poorly qualified.
3.07      Secondary education enrolls about 1,% of the age group.  The sup-
ply of qualified teachers, particularly for science, mathematics and prac-
tical subjects, and of buildings and equipment has not matched the enroll[,'ent
expansion and the quality of education has suffered. About 60% of entrants
graduate. General secondary programs account for 84% of total enrollment
and have been traditionally oriented to college preparation. To alleviate
this situation, the government, with Canadian assistance, has establishied
two types of comprehensive schools: Type I schools which are rather large
and emphasize industrial arts and Type II schools which are smaller and
emphasize agriculture.
3.0O      Industrial trades schools are more evenly distributed throughout
the country than general secondary schools. Enrollment has doubled since
1963 to reach 58,300 in 1971-72.  Technician tra:'ning is offered in 1i
institutes which in 1971-72 enrolled 13,900 students. Students graduating
from the institutes have no problem in finding employment but only a propor-
tion of vocational school students enter the trad..s for which they have been
trained. Primary and some lower secondary schools in rural areas conduct
agricultural activities. Secondary agricultural schools offer a three-year
certificate course.  There is one agricultural teacher training colle,,e and
two agricultural schools for young farmers. In 1971-72, enrollment in voca-
tional agricultural schools reached 8,100 with an output of 2,400. Higher



- 4 -
level agricultur< eaucation is offered at Kasetsart, Khon Kaen and Chieng
Mai uniFTers.ties.
3.09      Primary teacher training is offered at 25 institutes in two- and
four-year courses. Since 1967, enrollment more than doubled to reach 35,400
in 1972 when the output was about 16,OOC teachers.  T.L addition, teacher
certificates can be earned through evening ani correspondence courses which
in 1970 had an output of 9,500.  The quAilty cf traiiing is low as the schemes
over-emphasize academic courses and rote learning. Quality is also adversely
affected by incdequate research on teacher training and the low utilization
of rodern educational technologies.
3.10      Secondary school teachers are trained at the Bangkok College of
Education and its seven branches in the provinces and at fi%e universities.
All these instituticns offer degree and post-graduate programs which in 1971-
72 enrolled 18,200 and graduated 5,000 teachers.
3.11      Non-formal education and training schemes for skilled and semi-
skilled workers are organized by government agencies and the private sector.
MIOi. conducts literacy, continuing education and vocational training courses
for adults. Training in a wide variety of skills is provided by 54 Mobile
Trale Training Schools. A UNDP/UNESCO assisted National Institute for Skill
Promotion in Bangkok gives pre-employment training to out-of-school youth
and trains foremen ani workers for industrv. The National Youth Promotion
Committec offers out-o -school vocational training programs in both urban
and rural areas.
3.12      In the 25 post-secondary instituti)ns, enrollment has doubled
since 1967 to reach 85,70o in 1971-72 (Annexes 3 and 4).  Until the early
19f0's almost all higher education was located in Bangkok btit at present
three universities (Chieng Mai, Rhon Kaen, and Songkhla) and a number of
technical institutes are located in the provinces.  Facilities in these
institutions require expansion and upgrading to meet regional development
neids. Some 5,000 Thai are studying abroaai.
Education Finance
3.23      Financial responsibility for education rests primarily with the
central government but local governmenits may prorIde land and labor for
construction of rew schools. In public schoolr, primary education is free
and a nominal fee of 200 Baht per year is charged for secor.dary education.
Scholarships are available to needy and able students. The Budget Bureau
(Pttme Minister's Office) allocates all public educational f'.nds. It con-
sul.s with NESDB, which is responsible for coordina :ing public develor-ent
programs, on overall allocations. However, the funds allocated to different
levels and types of education are usually the result of direct negotiations
between the Budget Bureau and individual departments of MOE, the Local
Administration Department of the Ministry of Interior, and the universities.
This methiod of allocation has led to unplanned and often unbalanced growth
of the edu ation system.

ment Expenditure         14.5%         19.4%                       18.8%
3.15      During 1967-72, public education expenditures increased at an aver.-
age annual rate of 17.8% as compared -,ich a 11.2% annual incr"ase in total gov-
ernment expendttures; consequently, the share of education in public funds
ir.creased frcm the low ratio of 14.5% to 19.4%. The latter is now about aver-
age by international standards but may be considered reasonable compared with
other Asian countries at a similar stage of development. The share of public
edu.-:ation expenditures in GDP was 3.7% (4.5% if private education funds are in-
cluded) in 1972, almost the median in Asia (Annex 1).
3.16      During this period, recurrent and capital expenditures increased
at 15.2% and 26.4% per annum respectively, partly due to the extensive construc-
tion program underway since 1968 to meet the rapid increases ir. teacher train-
ing and higher education (Annex 2). The major component of recurrent cost3
is teacher salaries. Not more than 2% of recurrent expenditures are allocated
to teaching materials. Vocational and comprehensive schools receive inadequate
funds for coasumable tea-hing materials, maintenance and repairs, which ad-
versely affect the quality of instruction.
3.17      Public education expenditure is expected to increase from 5.8
billion Baht in 1972 to 9.4 billion Baht in 1976, or by 13% p.a. (The Third
Plan budget does not indicate the breakdown between current and capital ex-
penditures.) In this period, secondary education and teacher training are
expected to receive emphasis. Since annual increases in total government
experditures and GDP are expected at 12% and 7%, respectively, the share of



-6-
education in government expenditure and GDP will increase to 18.8% and 4.6%
in 1976, respectively.
3.18      The Third Plan provides for small increases in teachers' salaries
and instructional materials which do not seem adequate. The recurrent cost
per student in 1976-7? is projected to be about the same or even lower than
that in 1971-72 which would appear to be inconsistent with the proposed
quality improvements tn the system.  In view of the planned enrollment
inzrease during the plan period, it is likely that the ratio between recurrent
and capltal expenditure will remain the same as in the Second Plan period:
about 75% for current costs and the remainder for capital expenditures.  The
development expenditure in education would then be substantial, at about 33
billion Baht for the Third Plan period, representing about 33% of the total
government development budget, as compared with 27% in the Second Plan
(about 17 billion Baht).
3.19      Private education expenditures account for approximately 25% of
tctal education expenditures. Governmert subsidies to private schools have
been insignificanit, representing only 2% of the government edTucation budget
in 1971; this percentage is expected to remain constant during the Third Plan
period. The share of the private sector in total education expenditure is
expected to decline as the public secondary school system expands.
3.20      Several multilateral, bilateral and private agencies are assisting
the government in its education development.  UNDP/UNESCO is assifting plan-
ning in the MOE and is also helping the Institute for the Promotion of the
Ieaching of Science and Technology (IPTST), now engaged in designing new
curricula for science and mathematics at the secondary level. Canada is
lielpfng the development of rcmprehensive education (para. 3.07). Other bile-
reral sourc- fllA,  1'W,. M- Zealand, Japan), through the Colombo Plan, are
providinng technical assistance to various parts of the system.
3.21      2xternal financing of education has been about 5% of total public
education expenditures.  In 1971, the government received about US$7 million
I!i -rantn (experts, fellowships, and equipment) from various private, bi-
lateral and multilateral sources. During the Third Plan period, the gov-
orn,ent will seek some USS82 million or 5.2% of the Plan development budget
fnr education, in grants and/or loans from foreign sources. This will re-
utrfe closer coordination between the government agencies which benefit
:rr,e external financing (para. 3.13).
IV.  MANPOWER REQE0IREMFNTS
41')1     Labor Force and Employment.  The Dopulation of working age in-
cre.used by about 3% p.a. in the 1960's to reach 17 million in 1971 of whom
77, were vinployed in agriculture (83% in 1960). In 1971, unem?loyment was
estimated at about 100,000, mainly among unskilled young workers (15-24 years)
in the urban centers and particularly in Bangkok.  Underemployment is wide-
spread in aEriculture and the service sectors.



- 7 -
4.02      A new laLor law, passed in March 1q72, aims at impraving working
conditions and wage rates.  Most unskilled workers receive less than USS1
per day while clerical workers with a secondary school certificate earn ahout
USS500 per year. Elemerntary teacher salaries are moderate but, if all the
fringe benefits envisaged (housing, scholarships, education benefits) are
provided, these salaries will become competitive with those in the private
sector. In 1971, the average annual salary for teazhers was: USS680 equiva-
lent in elementary, So45 in secondary, and $892 in vocational education.
4.03      The Third Plan foresees some 2.6 million new jobs to be generated
by economic growth during 1972-7fi, of which 60% in agriculture, 6.2! in
industry, and the remainder 'n the service sectors. Even if this employment
taroet is achieved, the numler of unemployed would increase by about 80,000
in 1972-76. Considering the present underemplovment ln agriculture, the
pro4ected emplovment capacity of this sector appears overestimated. To
.educe underemployment in rural areas, the government is accelerating its
public works program.
4.04      Although precise data are lacking, manpower shortages are apparent
for the following professions: scientists, engineers, qualified teachers,
paramredical personnel and experienced managers and administrators. The
shortage of scientists and engineers is most marked in the South where in-
dustrial and mining operations are expanding. Paramedical personnel short-
ages are particularly acute in the Northeast and the government is therefore
buildiing a medical training complex at Khon Kaen University.  It is esti-
matcd that there will be a need for 30,000 additional managers and adminis-
trators durirg the Third Plan; this shortfall will be met partly by univer-
sity grnduates including those of the Open Univerqity, established in 1971.
The need for enginecrs is estimated to increase by about 5,000 and the
sup7lv at about 4,700. There is, therefore, a limited need for expansion
of facilities but emphiasis is required on quality improvement by providing
appropriate acconmodation and equipment. The improvement and extension
proposed under the project for the Faculty of Science at Songkhla University
would also benefit engineering students who rake the basic science courses
offered by the Faculty of Science during their first two years.
4.05      Teachier Renuirerents.  In spite of the mult'nlicity of tcacher
training programs (para. 3.09) acute shortages of qualified teachers have
developed (Annex 6). During the period 1966-71, the teacher training
institutionc graduated some 55,POO primarv school teachers while the effec-
tive demand was about 25% higher.  Consequently, the government recruited
secondary school leavers and trained them in "crash" programs.
4.06      During 1972-81, about 181,000 new elementary school teachers would
be renuired to provide for replacement and permit a 5% annual increase in
primary enrollment (grades 1-7). The output of existing teacher colleges
and those under construction is estimated at about 123,000 during the same
period. If present facilities are not expanded, a shortage of some 5S,000
teachers will develop by the end of the decade. The government plans to
meet this shortage by establishing new teacher training institutions in-
cluding thcse in the proposed project. These new colleges are to be set up
in the provinces in order to correct regional inequalities 'n educational



opportunity. To improve the quality of training, the government plans to
revise the curriculum and rationalize the programs.
4.07      During 1972-81, about 44,000 new secondary teachers would be
required to provide for replacenent and permit the planned 9% annual increase
in enrollment. During this period, the expected output of the secondary
school teacher training institutions is estimated at 26,000 and a shortage
of some 18,000 teachers would develop by 1981. This shortage is to be met
by expanding the College of Education and the university faculties of
education and by increasing in-service programs.
4.08      Emplovment of Secondary School Leavers.  At present, about 80% of
general secondary school graduates continue into higher education and 20%
seek jobs. Most graduates of these schools are not prepared for jobs in
the modern economic sector; only 3% of graduates receive pre-vocational
education.  With the expansion of secondary education, the number of job
seekers would increase and secondary education curricula should be revised
to include pre-vocational subjects. This is of particular importance for
the secondary schools in rural areas where most of the graduates are expected
to seek employment locally uDon graduation. The proposed prolect would
assist 32 general secondary schools in rural areas to develop diversified
curricula.
4.09      Scientists.  The need for scientists during 1972-76, mainlv for
government, state enterprises and oducational institutions, is projected
to increase by 8,500 as compared with an increase in suppi" of 3,400 during
this period. To meet this need, the government is expandin!o science facul-
ties and is improving engineering education at regional universities, such
as Songkhla University.
V. THE PROJECT
5.01      Genernil.  The proposed project would assist the education
development policy of Thailand by:  (a) Improving and extending elementary
teacher training facilities in the provinces; (b) introducIng a diversified
program in existing rural secondary schools; (c) improving educational
research and curriculum design; and (d) extending science programs and
formulating a lor,g-range development plan at a regional university.  Sthile
the main purpose of the project is to assist in Improving curricula an,d
moderniizing facilities, partlcularly in the provinces, it would also contri-
bute to alleviating shortages of teachers and scientists.
5.02      The project would consist of:

/2   In-ser.ice training of school inspectors and administrators, in addi-
tion to research and production of educational materials.
/3   Including 3,440 existing places.
/4   Including 600 existing places.
5.03      Primary Teacher Training Colleges.  To help to meet the need for
qualified primary teachers (paras. 4.05 and 4.06), particularly in the
regions, the project would include the construction, furniture and equipment
of seven primary teacher training colleges (PTTCs) to be located in Chieng
Rai, Kam Phang Phet, Loey, Surin, Phetchaboon, Chantaburi and Surat Thani.
Three PTTCs now being built in Lampang, Buriram and Phuket would be provided
with the necessary equipment. The ten co-educational colleges would enroll



- 10 -
a total of 20,000 students and by 1980-61 would graduate about 8,000 teach-
ers per annum. HIousing shortages and the regional character of the seven
new colleges would require provision of boarding facilities for about 60Z of
the students and 62 staff houses at each college. Each of the seven new
colleges would include a 500 student primary school for practice teaching.
5.04      The government intends to make these colleges the forerunners
of a broader scheme to improve and rationalize teacher training generally.
Each college would have sufficient autonomy to enable it to develop
curricula and innovative programs adapted to local conditions. The new
curricula would include agriculture, animal husbandry and rural sociology
courses and so prepare teachers for an active role in community development
in rural areas. One-fourth of class time will be taken by these courses,
another fourth by education methods and the remainder by science, mathematics
and general education courses.
5.05      By 1980-81 the teacher trainers needed to staff these PTTCs would
be about 1,400. To overcome the present shortage, the technical assistance
component of the proposed project provides for specialists to assist in
organizing accelerated in-service training programs to train and improve
teacher trainers.  The government has agreed that within nine months of the
signing of the Credit Agreement MOE would establish an accelerated training
program for teacher trainers at the College of Education and prepare and
send to the Association for comment its plan for such a training program.
5.06      Rural General Secondarv Schools.  The project would incltde
furniture and equipment for 32 existing secondary schools; for 21 )r these
it would also comprise the construction of extensions.  When completed
(1977/78), the schools would have a total enrollment of about 46,00 W and
an annual output oi about 11,000 at the lower and 2,700 at the upper levels.
In accordance with governmeut policy of reducing the imbalance of educational
opportunities between urban and rural areas (para. 3.03), all the s_-Iools
to be assisted by the project are located in the provinces. Some 130 housing
units for staff would be provided under the project due to housing shortages
and the regional cnaracter of the projecc schools.
5.07      An effective pattern of diversified secondary education would
be developed in the project schools.  in addition to the usual academic
subjects, the project schools would offer pre-vocational courses in agricul-
tLLre, home economics, commerce and farm mechanics, starting at grade 10
(imstedd of grade 3 as at present), when students would have an adequate
background in science, mathematics, languages and social sciences.  These
schools would not only offer broader secondaL., education suited to rural
areas but would also supply students betLer prepared to enter some of the
teacher training colleges included in the proposed project.
5.08      About 300 teachers in science and practical subjects would be
needed to ensure the success of this project item. They are ncrmally
trained at the College of Education but, since at present there is a
shortage of this type of teacher (para. 3.07), the proposed project includes
the cost of specialists' services co help the government train the teachers



- 1 1 -
needed thrGugh special pre-service and in-service courses. The government
has agreed that wLthin nine months of the signing of the Credit Agreement
the HOE will organize at the university faculties of education and the
College of Education pre-service and in-service courses to train and upgrade
science and practical subjects teachers for the project schools and will
prepare and send to the Association for comment its pinns for such training
schemes.
5.09      The National Curriculum Development Center.  The need for curricu-
lun revision to improve the quality and relevance of education isi appreciated
by the authorities and considerabLe efforts, though somewhat unsystematic
and uncoordinated, are beir.,: made. The proje_t would provide the facilities
for a new National Curricu.'um Development Center (NCDC) in Bangkok for
educational research and the continuous development and evaluation of curricu-
la for primary and secondary education. Although the NCDC would coordinate
curriculum development efforts in all fields, it would concentrate on areas
somewhat neglected in the past, such as social sciences, practical subjects
and languages. The teaching of science and mathematics is already being
improved by the IPTST, presently assisted by a UNDP/UNESCO project.  This
project will phase o0" by 1975-76 and the IPTST and NCDC should then be
merged into a more comprehensive institution to provide coordination in the
work of curriculum development and avoid duplication of effort.
5.10      In addition to curriculum development the NCDC would:  (a) design,
publish and distribute textbooks and other teaching and learning aids; (b)
develop better student evaluation techniques; (c) offer in-service training
for school administrators, school inspectors, education planners, teachers
and teacher trainers; and (d) study the feasibility of reducing the primary
cycle from 7 to 6 years and increasing the number of effective school days
per year (para 3.06). The NCDC would have an in-service training capacity
of 150. The staff of the NCDC would come from departments and agencies
engaged in activities similar to those envisaged for the center.
5.11      The NCDC would operate under the MOE which has already prepared
a draft outline for its operation; this outline was reviewed during appraisal
and found it reasonable. The government has agreed that: (a) a plan of
operations for the NCDC, including proposals for textbook publication and
distribution and a study of the possibility of increasing the number of
school days and shortening the primary cycle, will be finalized and sent
to the Association for comment within one year of the signing of the Credit
Agreement; and (b) by December, 1977, the NCDC and the IPTST wtill be
merged into one institution.
5.12      The Prince of Songkhla University, Haddyai.  The project would
assist in expanding and improving the science programs at the recently
esLablished Songkhla University. It would include construction, furniture
and equipment of additional academic and communal facilities for the
Science Faculty (a faculty library and a faculty administrative offices
and premises for the Department of Mathematics including a Computer Center).



- 12 -
5.13      The Science Faculty would provide the initial two years of
science courses for students in the fields of engineering, basic medical
science and agriculture. It vould also offer courses for science teachers.
Total enrollment is estimated to be about 2,500 by 1977/78.
5.14       The staffing of provincial universities has proved to be difficult.
At Songkhla University, the staff is comparatively inexperienced and the pro-
posed project inc'.udes the provision of: (a) a development coordinator who
would assist in the preparation of the long-range university development plan;
(b) specialists in science curricula; and (c) fellowships for graduate
studies abroad by faculty members. The government has agreed that within
12 months of signing the Credit Agreement it will prepare a suitable plan
for the development of the University and send it to the Association for
comment.
5.15       Technical Assistance.  The project would include the cost of
61-1/2 man-years of specialists' services and 184 man-years of fellowships
for overseas training, for the purposes set out in para. 5.16 below. During
negotiations the government agreed that a detailed plan for the implementation
of this part of the project will be drawn up by the Pro:ect Units of the
MOE and Songkhla University and sent to the Association for comment, and
that qualified counterparts will be assigned to work with the foreign
specialists who will be appointed on terms and conditions agreeable to the
Association.
5.16      The techrnical assistance component of the project is s'm-marized
below (numbers in parentheses indicate man-years) and given in greater
detail In Appendix 2:

the teacher training colleges, $50.5 per m2 for the secondary school exten-
sions, $66 per m2 for the National Curriculum Development Center and $67.'
for the extensions LO Songkhla University, are reasonable. The cost of
architectural services is included only in the case of Songkhla University
since all other project buildings will be designed by MOE architects.
5.20      Furniture and equipment costs were estimated by Thai authorities
and reviewed during appraisal. Detailed lists will be prepared during the
design stage of building and reviewed by the Association prior to procure-
ment. It is expected that most furniture contracts would be awarded to
local manufacturers and that almost all equipment would be imported. Local
currency cost estimates for equipment include import duties, local taxes,
port, warehousing and handling charges and transportation to sites which
together are equivalent to about 50% of the c.i.f. prices.



- 16 -
5.21      The foreign exchange component of US$16.3 million, representing
41.7% of the total project cost, has been calculated as follows: equipment,
100% of the c.i.f. price or 65% of the cost at the point of installation;
construction, 33%; site development, 20%; furniture, 20%; professional
services, 1J%; and technical assistance, 80% (specialists, 70% and fellowships,
100%).
5.22      The project cost includes contingency allowances for:  (a) price
increases estimated at 5% p.a. for imported goods and services and at 3.5%
p.a. for domestic goods and services; and (b) unforeseen factors equal to
10% of the estimated costs of site development, construction, furniture and
equipment (Annex 8). All contingencies account for 14.8% of total project
cost and 17.3% of the project cost before adding contingencies.
5.23      Faci1ities provided at Songkhla University and at secondary schools
would be expansions of existing premises and, like those for the National
Curriculum Development Center, are not suitable for student place cost
calculz-ions. Estimated costs per student place at the entirely new teacher
training colleges, excluding contingency allowances, are as follows:
Costs per Student Place or Living Unit in US$
m2 per Student
Type of      Place or         Site
Facilities  Living Unit  Development  Buildings  Furniture  Equipment  Total
Academic &
Communal         7.5           61          440          49         80       630
Students'
goarding        10             83          585          72         -         740
Staff
liousir.g       80            540        3,880          -          _      4,420
Wlhile thiese unit costs are not readily comparable with those for teacher
training institutions in other Bank-Group financed projects due to differences
in thte courses, they are reasonable for the accommodation to be provided.  For
instance, academic and communal costs for the teacher training institutions
in Iran (Loan No. 718-IRN) are expected to amount to $851 per student place
and $4,486 per boarding place.
5.24      As the project would entail only minimal expansion in enrollments,
the recurrent costs ic would generate, are estimated at only about 1.5% of all
public recurrent expenditures on education in 1977/78. The government
should be able to meet these costs and its share of the capital costs
witt1out curtailing expenditures for other on-going education activities
and witlhout over-burdening the education budget.

VI.  IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBIRSEMENT
6.01      Administration.  Separace project units would be established within
the MOE and at Songkhla University, each to coordinate implementation of one
of the two parts of the project and to provide liaison with the Association.
The functions of both units would include: (a) the engagement, briefing, and
coordination of the specialists to be employed under the technica. assistance
provisions of the project; (b) the briefing of the architects and the coor-
dination of their services including the review and approval of all archi-
tectural designs; (c) the preparation of master lists of furniture and
equipment; (d) the organization of international competitive bidding for
civil works, furniture and equipment including the preparation of bidding
and contract documents and the subsequent evaluation of bids; (e) the overs.ll
supervision of constructioa and procurement; (f) the organization and ad-
ministration of fellowship programs; (g) the preparation of withdrawal appli-
cations; and (h) coordination with government ministries and other agencies
concerned with the project.
6.02      Each unit would be headed by a Project Director and would include
a Project Architect.  In the ceise of the MOE unit, the Project Architect
would be employed on a full time basis, as also would be a Procurement
Officer.  The Songkhla University unit would be strengthened by an advisor
to be provided under technical assistance. Each unit would also include an
accountant and adequate supporting staff.
6.03      Professional Services.  A local consultant architect retained by
the government for the physical development at the Songkhla University campus
and responsible for the design of existing buildings as well as the original
campus plan would handle the design anid supervision of the proposed university
extensions. The design of premt!es for other projects would be carried out
by the MOE architects.
6.04      Sites.  Land is available on the Songkhla University campus and
at secondary schools for the extensions which would be carried out under
the project. Sufficient land is to be allocated on the "Planetarium site"
in Bangkok to accommodate the Natior.al Curriculum Development Center and new
premises for the existing Institute for the Promotion of Science and Tech-
nology. Suitable sites have been selected for the seven new teacher training
colleges and the government has agreed that all sites would be acquired in
good timz to avoid delays in construction.
6.05       Construction.  Construction contracts would be awarded on the basis
of intermational competitive bidding to pre-qualified contractors in accord-
ance with IDA guidelines. It is expected, however, that the contracts would
be awarded to local firms as the country has a competitive construction
industry capable of carrying out the proposed project.
6.06      Procurement of Furniture and Equipment.  Contracts for the supply
of furniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines. Preferred domestic



- 18 -
manufacturers would be accorded a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f.
price of competing imports or the rate of customs duty applicable, whicFever
is the lower.  It iB expected that all furniture contracts would be awarde'd
to local manufacturers and most equipment contracts to foreign manufacturer;.
Thailand does not participate in any regional ac'rangement which gives import
duties preference to certain foreign suppliers.
6.07      Maintenance.  Budgetary allocations for the maintenance of educa-
tion buildings and equipment have been unsystematic and sometimes inadequate.
Assurances have been given by the government that effective procedures for
regular maintenance of the project schooLs will be established.
6.08      Disbursement.  The proposed credit of US$19.5 million would be
equivalent to 50% of the estimated total project cost and finance the
estimated foreign exchange comp nent of the project (US$16.3 million), the
local currency portion of the ex-factory cost of furniture and equipment
whicth would be procured locally after international competitive bidding
.And about 12% or the local currency portion of the estimated cost of civil
works including architectural services. It would be disbursed to meet:
(a) 100% of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported instructional
equipment and furniture and of the ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured furniture and equipment;
(b) 65% of the total expenditure on imported but locally pro-
cured furniture and equipment;
(c)  100% of the foreign exchange costs of technical assistance
specialists and fellowshiips; and
(d) 40%. cf the total cost of construction and site development
and of architectural fees, this percentage representing the
average of the estimated foreign exchange components.
The percentage of (d) above would be adjusted as necessary to spread
disbursement over the estimated project implementation period of about
five and a half years (Chart 3).
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
matters:
(a)  the establishment of ac:elerated programs for teacher
trainers and for teachers of science ari practical
subjects (paras. 5.05 and 5.08);



- 19 -
(b)  the preparation of a plan of operation for the NCDC,
including proposals for the preparation, publication
and distribution of textbooks, and a study of the
possibility of increasing the number of school days
and shortening the primary cycle (para. 5.11);
(c) the integration of NCDC and IPTST into one institution
(paras. 5.09 and 5.11); and
(d)  the preparation ot a plan for the long-range development
of the Songkhla University (para. 5.14).
1.02      In addition to the customary conditions, a condition of effective-
ness of the Credit would be the establishment of the Project Units (ptra.
6.02).
7.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA
credit of US$19.5 million to the Kingdom of Thailand for a period of
50 years including a grace period of 10 years.

TIE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
1.        General.  During 1960-72, considerable progress was achieved in edu-
cation in Thailand. A National Education Scheme (NES), aimed at making educa-
tion more relevant to Thai needs, was announced in 1960. This emphasizes
inter alia: (a) the importance of vocational education; (b) the need for
education planning; and (c) the government's comuitment to extend compul-
sory free education through the age of fifteen. tfforts to implement these
objectives were made during the First (1962-66) and Second (1967-71) Education
Development Plans, which resulted in a rapid enrollment growth as the follow-
ing table shows:
Enrollments (in '000s)           Index 1971-72

/1   Includes 5,000 full-time equivalent students.
/2   Includes enrollment in the Open University (Ramkhamhaeng University)
which at present has about 8,000 full-time equivalent students.
2.        Although a grent increase was achieved in enrollments, the educa-
tional system still has the following shortcomings: (a) insufficient educa-
tional planning and a fragmented administration; (b) considerable wastage
of resources because of high drop-out and repetitJon rates (in 1967, 18%
and 23.2% in the first primary grade respectively); (c) a high percentage of



APPENDIX 1
Page 2
unqualified teachers (in 1971-72, 30% of the primary and 15% of the secondary
teaching force were unqualified by government standards); (d) outmoded
curricula at the secondary level, placing excessive emphasis on academic
courses; and (e) marked imbalance in educational opportunity between urban
and rural areas.
3.        Since the First and Second Development Plans gave priority to
expansion rather than to quality improvement, the government is now imple-
menting a Third Five Year Education Plan, 1972-76, which aims at:  (a)
strengthening aducation planning and administration; (b) improving the
internal efficiency of the system, including upgrading the quality of
teaching; (c) making curricula more relevant to Thai needs; and (d) decreas-
ing regional disparities in educational opportunity.
4.        To achieve these objectives, the government intends to: (a)
improve teacher traiaing; (b) modernize curricula and evaluation methods;
(c) expand the use of diversified programs in rural secondary schools; (d)
employ educational radio and television; (e) increase the production and
improve the distribution of teaching/learning materials; and (f) expand
university facilities at provincial centers.
5.        Structure.  The education system comprises seven-year primary
(4 years lower and 3 years upper) and five or six-year secondary (3 years
lower and 2 years upper or 3 years upper level in vocational schools).
Iligher education includes two-year diploma courses in colleges and four-year
degree and graduate programs in universities. Primary and secondary schools
use the Thai language as medium of instruction; university courses are
taught in Thai and in English. In 1971-1972, enrollments in primary educa-
tion represented about 83% of the 7-13 age group and in secondary about 13%
of the 14-18 age group.  At the secondary level, private schools play a
-ajor role with 45' of totai. secondary enrollment in 1971-72.
b.        Education Administration and Management are divided among several
government agencies but characterized by poor coordination of their activi-
ties. The Ministry of Interior is responsible for primary education 1/;
the MOr. supervises the professional aspects of primary education and admi-
nisters adult education, teacher training, vocational/technical and general
secondary education and the private education sector; and the Bureau of
Universities supervises the universities.
7.        At the provincial or "changwat" level, administrative responsi-
bilitv for ttie primary schocls is located in 71 offices of education of the
Mdnistry of InLerior. With respect to the MDE's responsibilities, the
countrv is divided into 12 education regions (5-6 provinces each), headed
by regional education officers who report directly to MOE and super-
vise teachers, organize examinations and distribute teaching/learning mate-
rials .
a' ThNe MOE is responsible for about 1,000 primary schools.



APPENDIX 1
Page 3
8.        Planning.  Education planning is uncoordinated and, therefore,
has had little impact on education policy and decision making. Responsibilit3
for preparing tbe education part of the Third Plan was divided, in an unco-
ordinated fashion, among the National Economic and Social Development Board
(NESDB) along with the National Education Council and MOE Educational
Planning Division. Implementation of the plan is also divided among various
ministries without any coordinating scheme to ensure consistency and avoid
overlapping.
9.        This fragmentation of responsibiliti., for administration, manage-
ment and planning leaves MOE in a weak position to implement fully comprehen-
sive educational changes. Its effectiveness is further limited by insuffi-
cient coordination among its departments which have an unusual degree of
autonomy.
10.       Primary Education starts at seven years of age and is free.
The majority of the school age population receives only a four-year formal
education. The proportion of fourth-grade leavers who proceed to the fifth
grade is increasing (1955-56: 11.8 percent; 1968-69: 35.5 percent) but the
ratio varies widely between urban and rural areas: e.g., about 85% in Bangkok
and only 15% in the Northeast region. In 1971, it was estimated that less
than 600 out of a total of 4,300 local communities had facilities for grades
5-7. Some 60% of the pupils in rural areas do not possess textbooks and 30%
of the teachers may not have a syllabus from which to work.
11.       It is estimated that 95% of seven-year old children enroll in the
first grade. Repetition rates in grades 1-4, although decreasing, are still
high. In 1961, for example, some 32% of the first grade pupils were re-
peaters; by 1969, the proportion had dropped to 23%. The drop-out rate in
grades 5-7 is estimated at 30% while some 85% of those that complete grade
7 proceed to secondary education.
12.       Primar" education suffers from shortages of teachers, classrooms
and textbooks and otaer teaching materials; currently, about 15% of the
classes are without a teacher. Although progress has been made in teacher
training and the proportion of unqualified teachers has decreased from 50%
in 1967 to 30Z at present, further expansion of teacher training is needed if
full primary education (grades 1-7) is to be extended to the entire age
group as intended by the government.  Greater government effort in textbook
distribution is desirable. The economies and the rczultant possibility of
expanding full primary education attainable from a reduction in the primary
cycle from 7 to 6 years deserve consideration.
13.       Although primary education is said to be compulsory, opportunity
is very unevenly distributed. Urban schools are more efficient, offering
relatively good basic education to a large percentage of the relevant age
group, whereas children in rural areas, and particularly in the Northeast,
find quality and even the availability of education very limited. To solve
these problems, the Third Plan provides for considerable expansion and im-
provement of education in the rural areas.



APPENDIX 1
Page 4
14.       Primary school curricula are mainly designed to prepare students
for the next level of education. At the lower level one-fourth of the
school time (25 hours per week) is allocated to science and mathematics,
another fourth to the Thai language and the rest to social sciences, religion,
sports and arts. The upper level curricula are basically a continuation of
those in the lower school with English and handicrafts edded. At this level,
the school time is 30 hours per week. The curricula were prepared by ad hoc
committees working at the MOE and at the Regional Offices of Education. The
primary curriculum is based on little education research and does not relate
to the socio-economic needs of the regions. The government expects to alle-
viate these problems through the establishment of a National Curriculum
Development Center (NCDC).
15.       General Secona.ry Education is divided into two cycles of three
and two years. In 1971-7i, there were 495,400 students attending lower
and 64,900 upper secondary ,chools. The regional distribution of enroll-
ments is more uneven than in primary schools. In 1967, Bangkok had about
36 secondary students per 1,000 inhabitants whereas the Northeast had 5
and the other regions 10. Although most teachers in the city schools are
qualified, some 15% of the national total are unqualified.
16.       Progression rates from lower to upper secondary general education
(including teacher training) have slightly decreased from about 62% in 1965
to 60% in 1969. However, enrollments in vocational schools increased
rapidly so that overall progression from lower to all types of upper sec-
condary school increased from 73.7Z to 76.4% during the same period. Be-
tween 1965-66 and 1971-72 an average of 80% of secondary school leavers
enrolled in higher education institutions.
17.       About 40% of the students who enter secondary schools (grade 8)
do not complete the course. These students, as well as those terminating
at the end of the lower or upper cycle, are generally inadequately prepared
to enter the labor market because of the academic curricula they had fol-
lowed. In an attempt to remedy this situation and to provide education
better suited to local conditions, secondary schools offering diversified
curricula includin,, agricultural and other practical subjects are being es-
tablished; at present, they enroll about 20,000 students. There are two
types of comprehensive schools.  Type I schools offer a general education
c!rrizulum and electives outside the regular curriculum give a comprehensive
charazter to these schools.  Type II schools, primarily intended for rural
dreas, offer a conmplete general education curriculum and include practical
arts in one sLream and vocational agriculture in a second stream. A new
pro;rain for expansion of Type II schools is now being proposed. Additional
facilities are to be provided in 32 existing general secondary schools as
a first step in enabling all sucil schools to include agriculture and prac-
tical subjects in their curricula.
13.       The comprehensive schools do not have enough qualified teachers
mor special subjects. Tney are short of materials for adequate teaching and
practical work and their curricula are not sufficiently integrated to be
realiy comprehensive. Perhaps the most serious shortcoming is the parallel



APPENDIX 1
Page 5
development of three different types of general secondary education which,
although at the same level, lead students to only nominally equivalent final
qualifications. The scheme, in fact, widens the discrepancies between rural
and urban education in terms of quality of education received and further
education opportunities. Hence, parents prefer to send their children to
general academic schools in urban areas instead of the Type II comprehensive
schools in rural areas.
19.       In sum, geineral secondary education has grown rapidly since 1965,
in terms of enrollments, , achers and expenditure. However, the growth was
unevenly distributed between the regions, the highly selective character of
curricula and examinations rema&is.ed. and contents and teaching methods con-
tinued to be predominantl-z Loward university admission rather than the labor
market.
20.       Vocational and Technical Education.  Since the beginning of the
First Plan (1962-66) the development of vocational and technical education
has been given first priority. Vocational courses are offered in lower
(grades 8-10) and upper (grades 11-13) secondary level. With the introduc-
tion of comprehensive schools, icaer cycle vocational schools are being
phased out while enrolluent in the upper cycle vocational schools ircreased
by almost 10% p.a., from 28,300 in 1963 to 58,300 in 1971-72, of which 38%
were girls. In 1972 the output from the lower level was 1,183 and 13,598
from the upper.
21.       The vocational schools are more evenly distributed over the coun-
try than the general secondary schools. Curricula and trair.ing methods are
being revised and adapted to the needs of Thailand's industry and agriculture.
This is particularly true of the schools assisted by the first Bank education
loan (No. 471-TH).  Present shortages of instructors will be alleviated when
the vocational and agriculturali teacher training colleges, also assisted by
that loan, operate at full capacity, provided that the movement of competent
teachers to the private sector is not excessive.
22.       Technician training (grades 13-15) is oftered at 11 technical
institutes with an output of 1,183 technicians in 1971-72; these institutes
also offer upper secondary vocational courses. Although the buildings of
these institutions are adequate, thry need additional equipment and to this
end the government has approached the Asian Development Bank for financial
assistance.
23.       Agricultural Education and Training is offered at all levels of
the education system.  Primary schools in the rural areas conduct agricul-
tural pre-vocational activities at the upper level (grades 5-7). Agri-
culture is also part of the curriculum of some lower secondary schools
(grades 8-10). There are 26 vocational agricultural schools of which 23
offer a three-year certificate course (grades 11-13) while another three
provide a two-year diploma program (grades 14-15) to certificate holders.
In addition, there is one agricultural teacher training college at diploma
level and two agricultural schools offer a three-year course for young
farmers. In 1971-72, enrollment in vocational agricultural schools reached
8,100 and the output was 2,400.



APPENDZX 1
Page 6
24.       Three universities (Kasetsart, Khon Kaen and Chieng Mai) have agri-
culture and related faculties, with 3,200 students in 1969-70, producing some
400 graduates annually in agriculture, agricultural engineering, agricultural
economics and agricultural education, 100 graduates in forestry, 50 in fish-
eries and 30 in veterinary science in 1969.
25.       Agricultural education institutions in general, including the
universities, are short of adequately trained staff, their curricula are
not sufficiently practical and instructors have limited expexience in modern
agricultural techniques. Efforts are being made to alleviate these problems.
The first Bank education loan assisted the expansion and upgrading of 10 of
the vocational agricultural schools and the Agricultural Teacher Training
College at Bang Phra. A second Bank education loan, signed in May 1972,
aims at the expansion, modermization and relocation of part of the Kaset-irt
Agricultural University (No. 822-TH). It also provides for a compre-
hensive study of agricultural and veterinary education and research which
will enable the government to plan expansion and improvements in those areas.
26.       Non-Formal Education and Trainin  programs are offered by several
government and private agencies. The most important are the following:
(a)  the MOE offers skill training in Mobile Trade Training
Schools (MTTSs), short-term vocational courses in
polytechnic schools, and in mobile centers of the Divi-
sion of Adult Education. The most significant of these is
the MTTSs program, initiated in 1960, that offers short-
term, vocational courses for rural out-of-school youth.
There are now 54 such schools offering part-time courses
of fi'-e months duration to about 28,000 young people per
year;
(b)  the Department of T.abor, with UNDP assistance, established
a National Institute for Skill Promotion in Bangkok in
1969 which offers upgrading courses to foremen and workers
in industry and short-term pre-employment training to
o.t-of-schooi youth; some 2,600 are einrolled in these
rogrnt.s. In additicn, the center is establishing national
trade standards;
(c)  the Ministry of Defense runs 10 centers offering two to
eig.t-month courses in vocational skills for rural popula-
tion living in politically "sensitive" areas; and
(d)  the National Youth Promotion Committee is planning out-of-
school vocational training programs in both urban and rural
areas.
About 19 otihi- government and paragovernmental organizations, such as the
Prisons Department, State Railways, Post and Telecommunications Department
aud certain mnunicipalities, operate pre-service and in-service training
courses for enmp'oyees.



APPENDIX 1
Page 7
27.       The Department of General Education of the MOE administers literacy
programs for adults and also some continuing educatiou and vocational train-
ing programs. In 1970, the former enrolled 22,000 adults in evening classes
and the latter provided secondary level evening courses to 9,000 adults.
28.       Teacher Training is offered at the secondary and higher education
levels for primary and secondary education respectively; it is the fastest
growing sector of the education system. Enrollment of full-time students
increased from 24,600 in 1966-67 to about 53,600 in 1971-72 or by 16.8% p.a.
In the latter year the output was about 21,000 teachers.
29.       Some 25 teachers colleges, the College of Education (with seven
branches in various parts of the country) and five university faculties of
education, offer teacher training at four levels: (a) lower certificate
(grades 11-12) for primary school teachers; (b, diploma or higher certifi-
cate (grades 13-14) for primary and lower secondary school teachers; (c)
degree (grades 13-16) for teachers in primary, secondary ani higher education
institutions; and (d) post-graduate (grades 17-18). In 1970 the combined
enrollment in these courses had reached 24,000. In addition, 8,000 students
were enrolled in evening and correspondence courses. In the same year all
teacher training courses graduated some 9,500 teachers. Altogether, there
are 38 different ways to become a teacher in general education and nine ways
to become a vocational school instructor. The quality of many courses, in-
cluding regular courses, is low and although the shortage of teachers may
diminish, low qualification is likely to persist until curricula and train-
ing methods have been substantially improved. Furthermore, the best teach-
ers find employment in urban areas, leaving village schools with the least
qualified teachers.
30.       Teachers in technical, agricultural and industrial subjects are
trained in special institutions and at universities. A great number of
graduates prefer well paid jobs in the private sector to a teaching post
and those who become teachers are not always well prepared because of in-
adequate practical training.
31.       The staff for the PTTCs is trained at the College of Education
and at university faculties of education. In 1970, the total PTTCs staff
was 2,330 of which 12% with Masters' and 65% with Bachelors' degrees, while
some 550 or 23% of the total were unqualified by government standards.
Recruitment of qualified staff for the regional PTTCs is a serious problem.
Qualified teacher trainers prefer to work in the Bangkok area where extra
curricular employment opportunities are available.

32.       The teacher training turricula should be revised and improved.
Major shortcomings are: (a) inadequ-ate links between the little education
research now conducted and curriculum development; (b) a considerable du-
plication of effort and wastage of resources because many of the 38 teacher
training programs were organized as "emergency and temporary" schemes; and
(c) inadequate class time and resources for subjects such as socio-economic
needs and education evaluation systems. An ad hoc commitL-e is now working
on a new curriculum following guideLines provided by a Unesco team which
visited the country in 1970. It is expected that the committee will recom-
mend the elimination of the lower certificate program (grades 11-12) and some
restraint on the evening and correspondence courses in teacher training.
33.       Higher Education in the early 1960's was offered almost exclusively
in Bangkok. In 1965 the government began to decentralize higher education
by establishing regional universities in the provinces. At present, there
are three such universities: Chieng Mai in the North, Khon E.aen in the
Northteast, and Songkhla in the South. Facilities in these universities,
however, are still inadequate fcr needed enrollment expansion and quality
improvement of the programs offered.
34.       In 1971-72 the eight universities of the country and the National
Institute for Development Administration (operating under the Bureau of
Universities) had a combined enrollment of 45,000. 1/ Over the past five
years total enrollment growth has been satisfactory at 13.6% p.a., including
a comparable growth in the important fields of engineering, science, medi-
cine and agriculture. Enrollments in other institutes of higher learning,
such as the College of Education, military and police acadenies and the
Asian Institute of Technology (a regional institution for Southeast Asian
Countries) are also increasing. In 1970-71, an "Open University" (Ramkham-
haeng University) was established in Bangkok with an initial enrollment of
40,000 or about 8,000 full-time equivalent students. Sixteen of the 25
higher education institutions are located in Bangkok but the College of
Edlucation  has sevon branches in other parts of the country. The three
regional universities account for less than 15% of the total university
enrollnent and more than one half of their students come from the Bangkok
area.
35.       The quality of university education varies widely, mainly because
of a serious shortage of qualified staff. This, in turn, is due to inade-
quate post-graduate programs.  Curricula in such fields as agriculture,
business adiminiistration, engineering and science are not sufficiently
adapted to the needs of Thailand but efforts at improvement are being made;
the Bank-assisted project for the Kasetsart University is an example of
these efforts.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
1.        The proposed project includes the cost of 61-1/2 man-years of
specialists' services and 184 man-years of fellowships for training
educators and administrators abroad. Total cost is estimated at US$3.26
million (US$2.15 mrllion for specialists, and US$1.11 million for fellow-
ships); the impl-mentation period would be about four years.
2.        The distribution of specialists and fellows would be as follows:
Man-Years
Specialists Fellows
(a)  Project Unit Support                            3          -
(b)  Educational Radio and Television (ERTV)        5-1/2        5
(c)  Teacher Training Colleges                     20           80
(d)  Diversified Secondary Education                6           44
(e)  National Curriculum Development Center        10-1/2       25
(f)  Songkhla University                           16-1/2       30
Total                                    61-1/2      184
The oroject units in the MOE and Songkhla University would, however, have
some flexibility in allocating specialists' services within the ceiling of
the total funds allocated for each project item. The fellowship committee
(para. 6.02) would also have some flexibility in the award of fellowships.
3.        The project unit directors at the MOE and Songkhla University
would coordinate the activities of the specialists provided under the
project and would also assist the fellowship committee which will administer
the fellowships program.
4.        The ERIV study group would be attached to the Department of Educa-
tion Techniques in the MOE but their work will be coordinated by the Under-
Secretary of State for Education. The government will designate two local
counterparts to work with each ERTV specialist.
5.        The teacher training group would be attached to the Teacher
Training Department of the MOE. The chief of the group will coordinate the
activities of these specialists, who will function in the MOE and at the
teacher training institutions. The group will help the PTTC directors to
introduce the new teacher training curriculum and assist the Teacher Training
Department in matters concerning teacher training in general and in-service
training in particular.
6.        The curriculum development planner and his group will be attacned
to the Department of Education Techniques of the MOE and advise the Director
General and the staff of that department in matters related to educational
research, curriculum design and evaluation techniques.  All the specialists
will assist in-service training programs for school inspectors, administrators
and teachers.



APPENDIX 2
Page 2
7.        One hundred eighty-four local educators and school administrators
would each receive training overseas at the graduate level in the fields
of teacher training, curriculum development, educational research educa-
tional planning, school administration, education economics, ERTV and
sciences. Upon their return they would work at the MOE or in the project
institutions. They would collaborate closely with the foreign specialists
in planning and implementing the envisaged changes in the educational
system.
8.        The schedule for implementation of the technical assistance com-
ponent is presented in Chart 3.
