INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
TIE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of US$19.5
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a third education project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report on the economy of Thailand, based on the findings of
a mission which visited the country in September 1972, will be distributed
to the Executive Directors on March 5, 1973. This will update the basic
economic report which was distributed to the Executive Directors under cover
of a memorandum from the Secretary (R72-12 of January 18, 1972). The
following is a summary of the mission's findings and conclusions.
3.        When Thailand's Third Plan (1972-76) began in October 1971, the
rate of economic growth had slowed from the average of 8 percent a year in
the 1960's to around 6 percent. The balance of payments which had been
in surplus was in deficit and there was concern that the capacity to finance
imports would become a constraint on future expansion. Since then exports
have risen steeply and this has triggered an economic recovery. Exports
of goods and non-factor services increased by 10 percent in 1971 and 29
percent in 1972. At the same time imports grew slowly; this combination
reduced the external resource deficit and raised foreign exchange reserves.
However, much of the improvement in the balance of payments has been due to
factors that may not recur, such as abrupt shifts in external demand for
some of Thailand's main exports (rice, kenaf and sugar) and the revival of
services to the US military since mid-1971.
4.        Government spending and investment by state enterprises have
continued to rise more rapidly than GDP, thus sustaining the growth of
the economy. However, despite rising tax revenues, the current surplus
of the Central Government has diminished because of even more rapid increases
in current spending on security, education and debt service. The Government
will have to reverse the declining trend of its current surplus, to generate
enough resources for its program of capital expenditure.
Development Policies and Problems
5.        The development objectives of the Third Five-Year Plan, which
was reviewed in detail in the basic economic report are: first, the
revival of the economic growth at or near 7 percent a year while maintaining
price and external stability; second, the expansion of agricultural and
industrial export capabilities supported by effective export promotion
programs; third, a larger share of the public development effort for agri-
culture, education and other programs of social improvement; fourth, a



better regional distribution of development gains with concern for the
Northeast; fifth, programs to develop institutions designed to channel
official external capital into private sector investment as a means of
improving external debt management; and sixth, improvements in Thailand's
economic management, particularly in the formulation of projects and
regional programs.
6.        In 1972, the Government began to introduce the improvements in
economic management, development policies and project preparation which are
called for in the Plan. Perhaps the most important improvements concern
economic management; an administrative reorganization was effected in
October 1972 with the aim of improving the administration and coordination
of economic and social services, and was accompanied by strengthening of
staff in such ministries as agriculture, industry and commerce. The
reorganization was followed by Cabinet appointments under an interim
Constitution promulgated in December 1972. The regrouping of all agricul-
tural services in one ministry should make it easier in future to formulate
and implement agricultural policies and programs. The same applies to
trade promotion, transport anzd communications. However, further efforts
are needed to turn these reforms at the top into lasting improvements at
the departmental and local levels. The Government, in addition, introduced
legislation and policy changes to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing,
particularly for export, and to improve the functioning of the capital
market. Finally, progress was made in project preparation and the Plan
program of external borrowing is on schedule.
7.        The Government is allocating more resources to agriculture and
its services dealing with the sector have just been reorganized; policy-
making and the dissemination of new knowledge are expected to improve as
a result. Three main obstacles to the expansion of agricultural production
for export exist and require government action if the ambitious Third Plan
target of a 30 percent increase in agricultural exports is to be achieved.
The first is the price of fertilizer to the farmer which is kept high by
import restrictions designed to protect high-cost domestic production.
The second is a premium charged on rice exports, which had been eliminated
in April 1971 but was reimposed in September 1972 because of a steep
increase in rice prices. The premium depresses the price paid to the
farmer and should be lifted when external demand conditions warrant it.
The third obstacle to expansion consists of unsatisfactory institutional
arrangements for credit, extension services, land tenure and land settlement.
8.        In manufacturing, export prospects look more promising.    Fiscal
incentives to exporters have been introduced and are being used. An indus-
trial estates authority has been established recently and duty-free zones
for export may also be established soon. There is room for further improve-
ments in Government support for private industrialists, but even so it
is expected that the ambitious Plan targets for the export of manufactures
will be exceeded.
9.        In the area of financial management, there is a need to expand
domestic financial institutions which would mobilize long-term savings
domestically and abroad for the financing of private investment. The



- 3 -
Government has already introduced changes in taxation and regulations that
will help contractual savings institutions to expand. A start has also
been made in strengthening institutions specializing in the financing of
agriculture, small industries and residential construction which could
help raise the level of investment in these sectors by offering more suitable
terms and services to borrowers. There is also a need for the Government
to continue encouraging the expansion of domestic institutions which borrow
on favorable terms from official sources of external capital for onlending
to private investors to finance equipment imports. These institutions in
part replace foreign suppliers' credit and thus help reduce the growth of
Thailand's external debt service liabilities.
10.       The Government's population policy aims at reducing population
growth to 2.5 percent by 1976, and the dissemination of modern birth control
techiques has made quick progr'ess; but this is a recent development and
Thailand will have to contend with a rapid increase in the working-age
population until the mid-1980's. Unemployment is frictional and seasonal
at present, since Thailand still has virgin land which is being opened up
by many who would otherwise be unemployed.   Most new entrants to the labor
force become farmers because of the limited job opportunities in other
sectors.  However, the supply of cultivable land may be exhausted as early
as the 1980's and it is therefore essential to implement policies to increase
farm employment per unit of land against this eventuality. These include
measures to raise crop yields, expand irrigation, and promote other farm
activities (livestock, fishing, silk, etc.).
11.       Differences in income between urban and rural families are large
and tend to widen. However, the progress made by rural families during the
1960's was quite considerable. the policies prescribed for agriculture
would make for a more equal distribution of income between town and country.
The outlying regions, which are predominantly agricultural, have lagged
behind the Bangkok area in development and income growth. Government
programs dealing with the special problems of the less developed regions
are furthest advanced in the Northeast and are under preparation for the
North and the South.
The Outlook in 1973
12.       The recovery, which began in 1972 as a result of the steep rise
in export earnings, is expected to gain further momentum in 1973. With
anticipated increases in private investment and consumer demand, import
growth should be rapid.   At the same time, however, exports will probably
stagnate because a drought in the summer of 1972 has reduced the availa-
bility of rice, kenaf and especially maize for export. The resource gap
will therefore begin to widen again, but an increased inflow of long-term
private and public capital is expected to prevent a significant loss of
reserves.
Third Plan Prospects
13.       The recent improvement in Thailand's economic situation and the
outlook for 1973 indicate that the Third Plan target for real GDP growth



- 4 -
of 7 percent a year during 1972-76 is realistic, while foreign exchange
reserves will probably stay above the Plan forecast. However, the depressive
effect that the 1973 setback in agricultural output and exports may exercise
on subsequent economic expansion points to the need for a more active devel-
opment policy during the remainder of the Plan period. Policies and
programs designed to promote production for export should receive first
priority, considering the importance of exports as a determinant of GDP and
private investment growth and the trends in the balance of payments.
14.       The deficit on goods and non-factor services will increase.
Commodity exports will start rising again after 1973, and the anticipated
rapid growth of tourist receipts should make up for possible declines in
receipts from the US military which are a major source of uncertainty.
However, the growth of imports which depends largely on the saving effort,
the growth of investment and the speed at which import substitution is
promoted, is expected to lead to a current account deficit of nearly $1.3
billion in 1973-76.
15.       To finance this deficit, an increase in external capital inflows
is needed and the Government's policy is to rely more heavily than in the
past on public, as opposed to private, external borrowing. The Third Plan
target of about $900 million in new commitments of official loans during
1972-76 was accepted as a reasonable estimate of Thailand's requirements
by the last meeting of the Consultative Group for Thailand. This target
implies a major effort in project preparation, which the Government has
begun to make with help from bilateral aid sources and our Regional Mission.
It is also Government policy to maintain the private sector's freedom of
access to private credit sources abroad and in consequence private capital
inflows are expected to rise f'or financing private equipment imports.
Since reserves are still at a high level and there is a need to facilitate
private investment, this policy appears appropriate at this juncture.
However, in order to prevent an excessive rise in private external borrowing
on hard terms, it is important that the Government continue to promote the
use of official credit lines by domestic financial institutions for
financing an increasing share of private equipment imports. External public
and private borrowing during the Third Plan are expected to cause debt
service to rise to 19.2 percent of exports by 1976. This would be a heavy
but manageable burden on the balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves
are projected to decline from $969 million a- the end of 1972 to about
$750 million by the end of 197T, which would represent about four months
of goods and non-factor services imports at that time.
16.       Beyond 1976, however, if the predicted trends in exports, imports
and capital inflows continue, reserves would decline further and the growth
of Thailand's debt service burden would become a serious problem for the
balance of payments. The burden of debt service could be mitigated by a
further increase in the share of official capital in total external borrow-
ings, and by an acceleration of export growth over and above the rate
assumed for the Third Plan period. There is little doubt that the former
could be achieved, but a further acceleration Df exports would depend on
both Thailand's own efforts and external factors. If this acceleration
could not be realized, the country would face the prospect of a rather



- 5 -
heavy debt burden in the 1980's and the Government might be forced in the
late 1970's to slow down the economy, unless it were able to obtaia more of
its public borrowings on significantly improved terms. Thus, Thailand's
long-term debt prospects are sufficiently difficult to justify some
financing on1 concessicnal terms. In view of this the members of the
Consultative Group have agreed to a substantial improvement in the terms
of their capital assistance to Thailand.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
17.       The proposed credit would be the first IDA operation in Thailand.
As indicated in my report on a proposed loan for the Kasetsart University
project (R72-86 of April 20, 1972), I have reviewed the case for IDA lending
to Thailand, and concluded that a minor part of our program should be financed
with IDA funds. Thailand qualifies for IDA assistance on the grounds of
poverty, economic performance. and need to ease the long run burden of debt
service. Average income per capita is $212. The dynamism of the private
sector has resulted in high rates of output growth, investment and saving;
we expect this to continue. The Government has displayed a capacity for
prudent financial management; there are signs that it will add to this more
active economic management. Despite all this, Thailand faces the prospect
of an increasing external resource deficit which could eventually force
the government to slow the pace of growth, if external financing on softer
terms is not available.
18.       Since 1950 Thailand has received 26 Bank loans amounting to $464.6
million, net of cancellations. Most of these have been for transportation
($179.1 million), irrigation ($69.2 million) and power ($91 million), with,
in addition, one for a dual-purpose power and irrigation project ($65.9
million). The remaining loans have been made for education ($21.4 million),
industry ($1.0 million) and telecommunications ($37 million). Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments
as of December 31, 1972, and notes on the execution of on-going projects. In
general, Bank-financed projects have been carried out in accordance with
expectations. Construction of the Third Bangkok Port project, financed
under Loan 702-TH, began 18 months behind schedule. The delay was mainly
caused by the time taken by the Port Authority of Thailand and its consul-
tants to pre-qualify bidders, amend tender documents and evaluate bids which
were complicated by currency realignments.
19.       For the next few years, about half the Bank's lending program for
Thailand will be directed to projects in transport, power, water supply
and communications. Irrigation development will also be a major feature.
But projects in education, family planning, agricultural credit, industry
and tourism will broaden the spectrum of the program although they will
account for lesser amounts. Both Bank and IDA projects are increasingly
selected to achieve a wider geographical spread for development benefits.
One of the main functions of the Regional Mission recently established in
Bangkok is to assist the Government in developing projects which will con-
tribute to tlhis. The Bank's readiness to finance some local costs in



- 6 -
appropriate cases will enable it to participate more fully in base-level
projects in agriculture and the social sector. A Consultative Group for
Thailand, which is chaired by the Bank, met last in February 1972 and will
meet again in April 1973.
20.       During the balance of the current fiscal year, I expect to present
for your consideration a credit of $5 million for the Chao Phya irrigation
project, a loan of $14.6 million for the fourth railway project, and a
further loan of about $42 million for the Bangkok water supply project for
which the Asian Development Bank is also consiLdering a loan of $17 million.
A Northeast crop improvement project, the Pitsanuloke irrigation project,
and the multi-purpose Quae Yai project, all of which are being appraised,
should be ready for your consideration in 1974. Other projects under
consideration for FY 1974 include seed multiplication, industrial finance,
industrial estates, port development and urban infrastructure in northeast
Thailand. The Government of Japan, which in April 1972 signed a V 64 billion
equivalent credit agreement with the Government of Thailand, has expressed
an interest in participating in the financing of the Bangkok water supply
project, the Pitsanuloke irrigation project, and the Quae Yai project. This
should be facilitated by the decision recently announced by the Japanese
Government that it will fully untie loans extended to Thailand for develop-
ment projects. Other lenders to Thailand are planning to increase their
coimnitments under the Third Plan.
21.       On December 31, 1972 Bank loans disbursed and outstanding to
Thailand amounted to $195 million, representing 22 percent of the country's
total external debt of $893 million. The level of Bank/IDA commitments
is expected to increase substantially over the next five years, but loans
and credits disbursed and outstanding are not expected to exceed 30 percent
of the projected external debt by 1978.
22.       Prospects for IFC operations in Thailand look reasonably good and
investments in a pulp project and aluminum sheet and foil manufacturing are
under consideration.
PART III - EDUCATION IN THAILAND
An Overviewv of the Sector
23.       Formal education for most Thais begins and ends with primary
school; 83 percent of the re:Levant age group attend primary school, whereas
only 13 percent attend secondary school. A majority of Thai children attain
literacy but not all stay in school long enough to ensure that their literacy
becomes permanent.
24.       The character of Thailand's educational system has been changing
in the past decade from one with highly academic curricula and an overwhelming
concentration of learning institutions in the Bangkok area, to one in which
curricula are more related to work skills and actual conditions in Thailand,
and institutions are geographically more dispersed. Foreign aid to the



-7-
these changes. Much remains to be done along these same lines and along
others which will be indicated below.
The Main Problems
25.       There is an imbalance of educational opportunity as between
Bangkok and the rest of the country: the Bangkok area still enjoys a
very high concentration of resources at all levels except lower elementary.
This is illustrated by the following facts which a Bank Sector Study Mission
reported in 1971:
-    the pass rate from lower to upper primary was about 85
percent in Bangkok and 15 percent in the Northeast;
-    Bangkok, in 1970, had about 40 secondary students per 1,000
inhabitants, the Northeast 5 and the other regions 10;
-    16 of the 25 higher education establishments were located in
Bangkok and the three regional universities accounted for
less than 15 percent of total university enrollments.
Technical institutes, upper vocational schools and the newly established
comprehensive schools are distributed more evenly through the country. The
same is true of teacher training colleges; and of the three regional univer-
sities one, Chieng Mai, is already well established.
26.       The administration of education is complicated by divisions of
responsibility between ministries and within ministries. The Ministry of
the Interior has responsibility for the administration of primary education,
but the Ministry of Education retains responsibility for its technical and
pedagogical aspects. Departments of the Ministry of Education have customarily
exercised considerable autonomy and negotiated directly with the Budget Bureau.
So too have some university faculties. A reorganization of the Government,
announced in October 1972, left the division of authority between the
Ministries of the Interior and Education unaltered, and an internal
reorganization in the Ministry of Education made at the same time did little
to facilitate coordination. The disadvantages of these arrangements have
been discussed with the government, and the Ministry of Education is
endeavouring to improve the situation.
27.       The Bank's Sector Study, referred to above, drew attention to
the following needs of the system:
-    more teachers:   15 percent of primary classes had no
teacher;
-    better qualified teachers:   30 percent of primary teachers
had no formal qualifications;



- 8 -
more textbooks:   primary school students outside Bangkok
were very short of textbooks in 1971; since then the situation
has improved sharply but much remains to be done;
curriculum reform - to relate education more closely to
labour market needs;
-    better educational planning and administration;
-    greater educational opportunity outside the Bangkok area;
-    more efficient use of resources:    the number of school days
per annum, which was only 150 in 1971, was raised in 1972
to 180 but this is still below the Asian average of about
210.
Educational Objectives and Progress Towards Them
28.       The National Education Scheme, introduced by the Government in
1960, gives priority to the following objectives: compulsory, free
education up to the age of 15 by 1980; better vocational education; improved
and expanded agricultural education at tlle secondary and higher levels; and
better educational planning and administration. Under this scheme, the
Government has made some progress in tackling problem areas. Since 1966,
-    enrollment for teacher training has grown by about 17
percent per annum;
-    repeater rates in primary grades have been steadily reduced,
vocational and technical school enrollments have been expanded
by almost 6 percent and 22 percent per annum respectively, and
comprehensive schc,ols have been established; by 1971 20,000
children were attending schools offering diversified curricula;
-    the number of children in primary schools has risen by almost
a million to reach 5.66 million, an annual increase of 3.3
per cent.   Secondary school places have increased by 270,000
to reach 662,000, an annual increase of 11 per cent;
-    enrollment in university faculties has increased by 13.6
percent per annum;
-    annual public education expenditures have increased at a
higher annual rate (17.6 percent) than total Government
expenditures (12.6 percent).
The Next Four Years
29.       The education policy of the Third National Economic and Social
Development Plan (1972-76) has a dual emphasis: first, to increase enrollment
in line with economic development needs; and second, to improve the quality
of education. The Plan calls for an increase in education expenditure rela-
tive to the public budget and GNP to a level where educational development



- 9 -
expenditure on education would account for one third of all development
expenditure, as compared with 27 percent in the Second Plan. The amount
for the Plan period would be 33 billion Baht ($1.6 billion). Quantitatively,
the Plan calls for a major effort to expand enrollment at the secondary
and upper primary levels (annual increase of 14 and 12.6 percent respectively),
and in teacher training.
30.       Qualitatively, the Third Plan proposes measures to reduce
dropout and repeater rates, to improve teacher training and to expand
the number of diversified secondary schools. It also proposes to increase
the provision of textbooks and to introduce incentives to attract teachers to
village schools; also of importance are its proposals for curriculum and text-
book revision.
Bank Lending to the Sector
31.       The Bank has made two loans to Thailand for the education sector.
The first, 471-TH signed in 1966, is financing the expansion and improvement
of facilities at 14 trades and industries schools, 10 agricultural schools
and 2 institutions for training technical and agricultural instructors,
situated in various parts of the country. The second, 822-TII signed in 1972,
is financing the expansion and improvement of Thailand's major agricultural
university, which is located in the Bangkok area. Bank lending has therefore
played a role in developing work-skills in the country. Major components of
present project would continue this theme but expand it into the broader task
of relating school curricula more closely to life in rural Thailand.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
32.       Some components of this project were identified by a UNESCO
identification mission which visited Thailand in January 1970; this was
followed up by a joint Bank/UNESCO reconnaissance mission and a UNESCO
preparation mission later that year. Appraisal was originally scheduled
for March 1971 but the government then decided to seek financing from
the Asian Development Bank's Special Fund for some of the items originally
identified. As a result it was agreed to postpone appraisal until the Bank
Education Sector Study mentioned in para 13 above had reviewed the country's
educational development needs. After completion of this study further
discussions were held with the Government in December 1971, as a result of
which a preparation/appraisal mission visited Thailand in M1arch/April 1972.
The proposed credit was negotiated in Washington from January 8 to 18, 1973.
The Government delegation was led by H. E. Ambassador Anand Panyarachun
assisted by Khunying Ambhorn Meesok, Deputy Under-Secretary, Ministry of
Education.

Scope of Project
33.       This project is designed to help the Thai education system move
toward the objectives proposed by the National Education Scheme and the
Third National Economic and Social Development Plan, referred to above. It
would do this in various ways but most importantly by directing project
benefits to institutions which, for the most part, are located in less
developed areas away from Bangkok; this is in line with the Third Plan's
major objective of reducing the imbalance of resource allocation between
Bangkok and the regions. Equally important is the emphasis which this
project puts on reform of the curricula to increase the teaching of science
and practical subjects, and to relate primary and secondary education
more closely to life in Thailand. Details are in the report entitled
"Appraisal of a Third Education Project in Thailand" (No. la-TH of
February 16, 1973) which is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. A credit and project summary is provided in Annex III.
34.       The project would aid the following institutions:
(a) 10 primary teacher training colleges: site development for,
and construction, furnishing and equipping of 7 of these,
equipment only for the remaining 3 (which are already under
construction).
(b) 32 existing general secondary schools: furniture and
equipment for all 32, and, in addition, building extensions
at 21 of these. The technical assistance component of the
credit would finance fellowships for senior staff from
each school to obtain experience with diversified secondary
schools overseas. It would also provide experts in the
field of diversified secondary education;
(c)  National Curriculum Development Center:   site development
for, and construction, furnishing and equipping of the
Center; provision of specialists to participate in its work.
This is a new institution whiich is intended to play a
leading role in curriculum reform;
(d) Faculty of Science at the Prince of Songkhla University:
site developmernt for, and construction, equipping and
furnishing of extensions; fellowships for overseas study
by faculty members and the provision of expatriate academic
and other specialist staff. A development coordinator would
be provided to he:Lp the university formulate its long-range
development plans.
35.       In order to provide sufficient primary teacher trainers and
teachers of science and practical subjects at secondary level to staff
institutions included in the project, accelerated training programs would
be organized. For the purpose of producing better-qualified instructors
for these programs fellowsh:Lps for graduate study overseas would be made



will be organized. The services of specialists who would help organize
these programs would be financed out of the proposed credit.
36.       The credit would finance a study of how Thailand might best
expand the use of radio and television for education; it would also
provide fellowships for overseas study in this field.
37.       The primary teacher training colleges included in the project
would teach agriculture, animal husbandry and rural sociology in addition
to the standard subjects.   Student places at these colleges would total 20,000.
38.       The credit would enable 32 general secondary schools to offer pre-
vocational courses in agriculture, home economics, commerce and farm mechanics,
starting at grade 10, by which time students should have an adequate background
in science, mathematics, languages and social sciences. The total number of
student places in these schools, including existing places, would be about
46,000.
39.       The services of the specialists to be provided to the National
Curriculum Development Center under the project would include work on the
design and implementation of new curricula, improvements in the system of
textbook production and distribution, and studies of the possibility of
further increasing the number of school days and of shortening the primary
cycle. An additional function of this center would be in-service training
for school administrators, school inspectors, education planners and teacher
trainers.
40.       The Faculty of Science at the Prince of Songkhla University
provides the initial two years of science courses for students in the
fields of engineering, medicine, education and agriculture: improvements
in this faculty would therefore raise standards in several faculties.
The university is acutely short of staff with academic qualifications above
tite first degree level.
41.        Educational institutions outside Bangkok have difficulty in
attracting high-quality staff. The provision of housing for staff partially
eases this problem and therefore the Ministry of Education project institu-
tions outside Bangkok would provide some staff and student housing.
Cost Estimates
42.       The cost of the project (including import duties and taxes) was
estimated prior to the recent devaluation of the ITS dollar at $39.0 million
equivalent. This estimate, which included a provision of $2.75 million for
price contingencies, has not been revised. The proposed credit was intended
to finance 50 percent of the total project costs including $16.3 million of
foreign costs and $3.2 million of local currency expenditure, the balance
of the funds required to be provided by the Government. As a consequence
of the recent currency changes, the credit would finance somewhat less,
and the Governmnent somewhat more, than 50 percent of total project costs,
but this is not expecte(I to create any problem.



Project Implementation
43.       Twio project units would be set up to execute this project, one at
the Ministry of Education and one at Songkhla University: two units are
required because the University does not fall within the jurisdiction of the
Mlinistry of Education. The Ministry of Education Project Unit would consist
of a director, an architect and a procurement officer and would be supported
by specialists on equipment procurement, who would be financedi by the Credit.
The Unit's architect and procurement officer would be full-time appointments.
The University Project Unit wqould consist of a director, an architect and an
adviser to the director; the university development coordinator who would
be provided under the technical assistance component of the project would
occupy the post of adviser to the project director.
44.       The construction work at Songkihla University would be designed
and supervised by a local architect who is responsible for the existing
buildings there and is currently retained for the University by the
Government. The design of premises for all other items in the project
would be done by Ministry of Education arclhitects.
Procurement and Disbursement
45.       Construction contracts would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding.  It is expected that these contracts will be awarded
to local firms. Contracts for the supply of furniture and equipment would
also be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. It is
expected that all furniture contracts would go to local manufacturers and
most equipment contracts to foreign manufacturers. Preferrecl domestic
manufacturers would be accorded a preferential margin of 15 percent of the
c.i.f. price of competinS imports or the rate of customs duties applicable,
whichever is the lower.   Thailand does no.t participate in any regional
arrangement which gives import duties preference to certain foreigi
suppliers.
46.       As negotiated, the credit documents provide that the credit would
be disbursed on the folloving basis:   40 percent of the total cost of civil
worls and professional fees; the forcig,r. exchange costs of equipment and
furniture imported directly: the ex-factory cost of equipment and furniture
mianufactured locally: 65 percent of the cost of equipmetnt and furniture
imported but locally procured; and the foreign exchange costs of specialists
services and fellowships.  As a consequence of the dollar devaluation, it may
be necessary to disburse a smaller percentage of the cost of civil works and
professional fees in order to spread disbursements over the whole of the
construction period.  As a result, the amount of local expeniditure financing
originally envisaged ($3.2 million) would be somewhat reduced.
PART V - LEGAI INSTRUMENTS AND) AUT1HORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the International
Development Association and the Kin-gdom of Thailand, the Recommendation



- 13 -
of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of the Resolution approving the proposed credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
agreement conforms to the normal pattern for credits for education projects.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - PECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan 471-TIl, First Education Project (Vocational Education)
Closing date: August 31, 1973
1.        The original closing date, June 30, 1970, was postponed to
February 22, 1972 due to delays in appointing experts under bilateral assist-
ance. A further postponement was necessary as a result of incomplete
bidding for tools and scientific equipment. It is expected that the project
will be satisfactorily completed by mid-1973.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the programs of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 4
Loan 514-TH, Sirikit Dam Project
Closing date: June 30, 1973
2.        The work on the project has been practically completed. The
closure of the dam was carried out on schedule in June 1971. The reservoir
is expected to be filled to full retention capacity this month. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$78 million, as against US$76 million
at appraisal (+2.5%). Substantial increases in the principal civil works
contract (+41%), which resulted from unforeseen adverse foundation conditions,
have been largely compensated by savings on other items.
Loan 535-TBl, Third lighways Project
Closing date: March 31, 1973
3.        The project has been largely completed. At the request of the
Highways Department the closing date of the loan has been extended by a
period of six months until March 31, 1973, to allow for the completion of
work, the settlement of outstanding payments on construction contracts
already carried out and the payment of consultants costs for completing the
design of feeder roads to be constructed under the proposed 5th highways
project. $4.0 million has been cancelled, at the request of the Government,
from the unallocated category of this loan.
Loan 626-TBI, 4th Highway Project
Closing date: December 31, 1973
4.        Construction of the project is on schedule and within the cost
estimates. At the request of the Government $3.0 million has been cancelled
from the unallocated category of this loan.
Loan 655-TH, First EGAT Power Project
Closing date: December 31, 1974
5.        Three months behind schedule but otherwise proceeding as expected.
Foreign exchange expenditures are likely to exceed estimates made during
appraisal due mainly to revaluation of the Yen.
Loan 702-TH, Third Bangkok Port Project
Closing date: July 31, 1974
6.        Construction of this project began 18 months behind schedule.
The delay was mainly caused by the time taken by the Port Authority of
Thailand and its consultants to pre-qualify bidders, amend tender documents
and evaluate bids which were complicated by currency realignments.
Loan 790-TBI, South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project
Closing date: November 30, 1976
7.        Two months behind schedule, but otherwise proceeding as expected.

Loan 822-7I, Second Education Project (Kasetsart University)
Closing date: June 30, 1978
8.        The loan was declared effective on August 22, 1972.    The appointment
of campus planners took six months longer than was anticipated in the
Appraisal Report, but otherwise the project is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 864-TH, Telecommunications Project
Closing date: December 31, 1977
9.        The loan is due to become effective on March 8, 1973.
