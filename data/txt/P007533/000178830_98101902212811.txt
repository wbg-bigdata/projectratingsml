REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A0
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR THE SEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Nacional Financiera, S.A., with the guarantee of the United
Mexican States for the equivalent of US$90.0 million to help finance a
project for highways. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including
5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        "The Economy of Mexico:  A Basic Report" (192-ME) was dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors on June 26, 1973. It was designed
to provide a long term perspective and a framework for the assessment of
short run trends in the Mexican economy. An updating report will be
prepared this spring and is scheduled to be distributed to the Exec-
utive Directors in mid-1974. Country Data sheets are provided in Annex I.
3.        For the three most recent of the six decades since the Revolution
of 1910, the success of the Mexican system, measured in terms of GDP
growth, has been outstanding. Since 1940, the annual average growth rate
has exceeded 6 percent. And from the mid-1950's to 1972 Mexico was among
the few countries in the developing world to combine a sustained high rate
of growth with monetary and balance of payments stability. The average
annual rate of inflation was less than 5 percent and the dollar value of
the peso was maintained at the level fixed in 1954.
4.        Rapid and sustained growth was the product of successful policies
affecting the mobilization and use of both private and public sector re-
sources. The role of goverrment in promoting economic growth was concerned
on one hand with the development of strategic infrastructure and major
utility industries and on the other with development policies which featured,
in the agricultural sector, the development of price support, import control
and agrarian reform measures, and in the industrial sector external pro-
tection and the provision of fiscal incentives.
5.        The sectoral allocation of public and private investment was
reflected in a changing structure of output and employment. This featured
the growth of manufacturing industry and the relative decline of agri-
culture, although agriculture remained the chief source of employment,
accounting in 1970 for 39 percent of the economically active population.



- 2 -
6.        Rapid economic growth has not generated sufficient opportun-
ities to create employment for the labor force which has recently been
growing at about 3.5 percent per year.   In 1970 it was estimated that
40 percent of the labor force was either engaged in marginal occupations
- relatively unproductive and hence poorly paid - or totally unemployed.
Partly as a consequence of rapid population growth, but also as a result
of the distribution of incomes and assets in the Mexican economy, the
strategy which succeeded in promoting rapid growth was not comparably suc-
cessful in spreading its benefits.  The incidence of poverty had by 1970
been much reduced from the level of 1940. But the differentials between
rich and poor, both between people and between places, had probably increased.
7.        There was, until recently, little evidence (apart from the con-
tinuation of the land reform program begun in earnest during the Cardenas
regime in the 1930's) that Government policies were much concerned with
these problems. By 1970, however, it was apparent that a revised economic
strategy - one which would focus on the improvement of the living conditions
of the poor - was required. It seemed to be understood that this goal
should not be pursued at the expense of rapid growth or of the monetary
and balance of payments stability which appeared to be a sine qua non of
sustained economic expansion. The events and trends of the last three years
have demonstrated the Government's determination to develop such a strategy.
They have also revealed some of the constraints to doing so.
8.        There are several types of distributive measures which do not
depend heavily on the growth of budgetary expenditures. Among those
introduced since 1970 are a new Agrarian Reform Law (1971), a new Water
Law (1971) and a revision of instructions concerning the allocation of bank
credit (designed to increase the flow of resources to low income farmers
and ejidatarios). 1/ These measures are all responsive to the needs of the
rural sector and demonstrate the Government's concern to confront them.
Another recent initiative is the introduction (1972) of a 5 percent payroll
tax 2/ to finance a new housing program for workers in the lower-middle
income groups. It is clear, however, in the light of the experience of the
last three years, that neither the needs of the poor nor those of the public
sector industries (on which the growth of the economy as a whole partly
depends) can be met unless the Government takes new measures to mobilize
additional public sector resources.
9.        In 1971 the Government acted to restrain the growth of the economy
in order to preserve stability and, partly as a result, the growth rate fell
from the 1960 - 1970 decade average of 7.1 percent to only 3.7 percent,
while prices increased by 4.8 percent. In 1972 renewed expansion was
stimulated by public sector expenditures and the GDP growth rate rose to
7.5 percent, while prices increased (in terms of the GDP deflator) by
slightly more than 5 percent. In 1973 there was a further substantial
1/ The ejido is a form of collective land tenure based on usufruct rather
than ownership.

purposes of public finance analysis.

increase in public expenditures which was largely financed by recourse
to increased internal and external borrowing. This expansion coincided
with and was partially responsible for an acceleration in the rate of
domestic price increases. These increases are also, however, a con-
sequence of imported inflation (the impact of which was especially
serious because of the poor harvest in 1972 and the resulting need to
import basic foodstuffs in a year of high commodity prices). Prices
increased by roughly 20 percent during 1973 - somewhat more in the case
of wholesale prices and somewhat less in the case of consumer prices.
10.       In the light of these trends, the Government is introducing
substantial new resource mobilization measures to generate the funds
required to support the growth of public expenditures. Following some
changes in the tax structure in 1972 and 1973, it is understood that there
will be a more substantial increase in taxation in 1974. The action which
was taken in October 1973 to adjust electricity rates (by an average of
almost 30 percent) was followed by substantial increases in hydrocarbons
prices in December 1973. The total of the revenue measures which have been
taken or are under consideration is expected to yield the equivalent of
approximately 2 percent of 1974 GDP.
11.       These measures to increase public sector revenues are clearly
needed and they will permit a reduction in the public sector deficit as
well as a moderate increase in expenditure in 1974. The rate of increase
in the latter, however, is likely to be slower than in 1973. There
should be some deceleration in the rate of inflation in 1974 compared to
1973, but the rate will still be higher than in other recent years, both
because of further expected increases in international prices and because
the inflationary trends of 1973 have resulted in substantial wage adjust-
ments which are likely to be reflected in higher costs and prices.
12.       It is unlikely that the rate of economic growth in 1974 will be
as high as the level of between 7 and 8 percent which is estimated for
1973. Growth will almost certainly be restrained by the capacity limit-
ations derived from the low level of private investment in the last three
years and because the Government recognizes the need to limit imports in
order to contain the balance of payments deficit to an acceptable level.
It is quite probable, therefore, that 1974 will be a year of fiscal and
financial retrenchment and of moderate growth.
13.       The events of recent months have illustrated the dangers inherent
in large scale deficit financing, but also the willingness of the Government
to take the kinds of corrective action which become necessary. The record of
the Mexican authorities in economic management over the past two decades is
such that there is reason to give credence to the Government's assurances
that it will act to restore the relative price and balance of payments
stability which, in terms of the recent experience of the Mexican economy,
appear to be necessary conditions of sustained growth. The Bank, as well
as the Fund, is in a continuing dialogue with the Government regarding these
issues.i

114.      As of December 31, 1972, Mexico's outstanding disbursed
external public debt was US$4.0 billion as compared with a total of
US$3.5 billion a year earlier. The IBRD share in the former total was
US$723 million as compared with a level of US$659 million a year be-
fore. For 1973, net public medium and long-term external borrowing is
estimated at about US$1,300 million. This represents a sharp increase
over the 1972 level ($451 million), and reflects the larger public
sector deficit in 1973, a greater reliance upon external rather than
domestic borrowing to finance the deficit and some borrowing undertaken
to offset short-term capital movements. The substantial revenue meas-
ures recently taken will reduce the public sector's needs to borrow in
1974.
15.       Annex I, Page 4 shows that 41.3 percent of public external
capital contracted in the period 1968-1972 was obtained from private
banks - the largest single source and that international organizations
accounted for the next :Largest share (22.2 percent). The World Bank
accounted for 14.7 percent of total commitments.   Annex I, Page 4 also
shows the sectoral allocation of public external capital and reveals
that power, transport and manufacturing were the dominant sectors. The
terms of recent public external borrowing have continued to improve in
the light of (a) the availability of capital in international markets
and (b) Mexico's reputation as a creditworthy borrower.
16.       During 1974, assuming normal private capital movements, it is
expected that the level of net external borrowing by the public sector
(or guaranteed by the public sector) will decline to around US$950 -
US$1,000 million. Net borrowing of this magnitude is consistent with
Mexico's debt service capacity. As a result, particularly of longer
maturities on borrowings from financial institutions, Mexico's external
public debt service ratio has declined over the last several years and
was 18.2 percent in 1973. Assuming that the average terms in the future
are about the same as those which have been recently obtained, the debt
service ratio is expected to remain in the 18 to 20 percent range during
the remainder of the 1970's. The Bank's share in public debt outstanding
and disbursed is presently about 14 percent while its share in the corres-
ponding debt service is about 10 percent. These ratios are not expected
to change significantly during the remainder of the 1970's.
17.       Mexico thus continues to be creditworthy   for borrowing
on conventional terms, always provided that the additional public
savings measures are taken without undue delay.    The rate increases
recently enacted by the publicly owned electric power sector and the
recent increase in the prices of the publicly owned hydrocarbons industry,
suggest that the Government will continue to handle its financial affairs
prudently.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
18.          The Bank has made 33 loans, for a total of US$1,599 million
net of cancellations, of which at the end of December 1973 the Bank held
US$ 1.3   billion, including US$ 0.5 billion not yet disbursed. Most of
these loans have been made for power, roads and agriculture. Execution
of Bank-financed projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory. However,
disbursements on the US$125 million loan for the Fourth Power Sector
Program were delayed because the Government found it impossible to effect
necessary power tariff changes on schedule. The problem was resolved when
tariffs were increased on October 16, 1973.
19.          IFC has made eleven investment commitments in Mexico amounting
to US$53.1 million, of which as of December 31, 1973, US$35.4 million had
been sold, terminated or cancelled. The US$17-7 million held by the
Corporation consists of US$15.9 million in loans and US$1.8 million in equity.
Annex II contains a summary of Bank loans and IFC investments as of December
31, 1973, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.          Bank lending to Mexico in FY73 consisted of two loans, for
agriculture and water supply, totalling US$200 million. The FY74 program
includes, in addition to the Las Truchas Steel Project which you approved
last September and the proposed project, two irrigation projects - on the
Sinaloa and Panuco Rivers. In addition, work is under way on rural develop-
ment, irrigation, forest industries and transport projects for possible
consideration by the Executive Directors during the next two years.
219          In lending to Mexico, the Bank tries to assist the Government
in achieving four major objectives. These objectives are interdependent
and complementary; hence it is not possible to rank them in order of priority
or importance. One objective is to spread the benefits of growth more
widely than before and, more particularly, to begin to address the problem
of rural poverty. A second objective is to help Mexico continue to achieve
the remarkable growth of output of the past two decades, both by investing
in projects that directly or indirectly make large contributions to prod-
uction and employment, and by supporting changes that will make existing
institutions function more effectively or by creating new ones that will
perform presently neglected functions. A third objective is to contribute
with funds and expertise to the solution of critical adjustment problems
that are themselves a result of Mexico's continued growth; noteworthy among
these are the problems attendant on a rapid urban expansion, and the emerging
need to exploit scarce water resources more efficiently. A fourth object-
ive is to transfer sufficient external resources to complement Mexico's
quite appreciable domestic savings and provide the necessary funds for
sufficient economic and social investments in a framework of sound domestic
finances and a viable balance of payments.



22.          Wnile the last objective primarily influences the magnit-
ude of the Bank's program in Mexico, the other three jointly determine
its structure. Naturally, many operations serve more than one of the
ends listed and may, moreover, support more specific government object-
ives. Thus the irrigation projects are designed not only to help provide
a rapidly growing population with its food, fiber, and foreign exchange
requirements, but also to support the Government's policies on income
redistribution as expressed in the Land Reform and Water Laws, both of
1971. Concern with the vital issue of better water management also
induced the Government, the Bank and UNDP to organize, jointly, a national
water study; the Bank serves as Executing Agency for the UNDP. Loans
in the transport and power sectors are designed explicitly both to transfer
resources to Mexico and t;o help improve institutional structures and
policies in sectors that play a vital role in industrial and agricultural
production and in the generation and utilization of public sector resources.
At the same time, the Government, together with the Bank, is attempting
to prepare integrated rural investment projects in regions in which income
levels are low but where some productive potential can be identified. The
project before you is a good illustration of the complementarity of the
various objectives listed: most importantly, it will serve as a means for
transferring sufficient external resources to complement domestic savings
and will assist in meeting the need for expanded infrastructure;   in
addition, by including four roads improving access to or opening up new
agricultural areas, it will support the Government's rural development
programs.
1/
PART III - TRANSPORT IN MEXICO
23.          The rugged topography of Mexico, as well as the wide dispersion
of its population, have made transportation a particularly crucial element
in the development of the economy. During the period 1965-72, transport
infrastructure has absorbed 23 percent of public investment expenditures,2/
and, as the location, composition and destination of commodity production
shifts over time, further large investment needs in the sector will have to
be met if development is to proceed smoothly.
24.          Railroads were the main transportation element during Mexico's
first big push toward becoming a modern economy, during the late nineteenth
century. They were instrumental in making Mexico a large exporter of
primary commodities and thus, indirectly, also had profound effects on
agriculture and industry.  Between 1880 and 1916 the network grew from
1,100 to 19,000 km, i.e., almost reached its present extension of about
25,000 km. During the decade of civil wars following the revolution of
1910, the system deteriorated badly. Much of subsequent investments was
devoted merely to making up the losses of that period.
1/ For details, see "The Economy of Mexico: A Basic Report" (192-ME,
June 27, 1973), Volume III.
2/ Of these, over one-half was for roads and one-quarter for railways.



- 7 -
25.      The process of nationalization of the railways was completed
in 1965, and by the late sixties the system, which had been composed of
11 separate companies, had been consolidated into five government railways.
The most important of these, the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico (N de M),
an autonomous public enterprise, is presently engaged, with the help of a
Bank loan, in a long-term program of modernization and rehabilitation,
with a view to reducing costs, rationalizing services and improving overall
performance.
26.      The major problems of the railway subsector are financial and
refer primarily to the fact that tariffs have been held constant since
1958, while costs have steadily increased at a speed which has not been
compensated by increasing revenues or by economies in operations. To help
solve its financial problems, the railways have requested rate increases
which are now under consideration by the Government.
27.      The long border with the United States has meant that much of
the country's foreign trade is shipped overland. Thus sea trade in recent
decades has been of secondary importance for foreign commerce, but Mexico's
ports do play a significant role in domestic trade, which provides for 55
percent of all port activity. Mexico has 36 deep water ports, five of
which - Veracruz, Tampico, Guaymas, Mazatlan and Manzanillo - handle 80
percent of the total traffic. At present there is under way a long term
program of expansion and modernization of these five ports, for which a
Bank loan was obtained in 1972.
28.      Air transport is one of the fastest growing modes of passenger
traffic in Mexico. The two principal Mexican airlines have increased their
traffic from 1.0 to 4.5 billion passengers/km between 1962 and 1972. Moreover,
the country's size and difficult terrain also make air traffic advantageous
for many types of rapidly expanding freight movements, and the Bank is at
present considering supporting an expansion program of several regional
airports.
29.      In recent decades highways have become the prime transport mode.
Details on the highway subsector are given in paras. 34 to 41 below.
30.      The Bank has been associated with the development of the transport
sector in Mexico for the past twenty years; it has financed six highway
projects totalling US$177 million; two railway projects totalling US$136
million, and one port project for US$20 million. Through its transport
projects the Bank has provided the much needed financing for expanding and
improving the transport system and has assisted in the planning and
execution of investments in the sector. The Bank has also stimulated the
introduction of a number of institutional improvements in the sector.
Transport Policy and Coordination
31       The framework of sectoral policy-making is complex. It includes
on the one hand three secretariats with responsibility for different aspects
of policy making and, on the other, a number of public enterprises respons-
ible for the operation of modal services. The Secretariat of Communications



- 8 -
and Transport (SCT) is in charge of licences and tariffs; the Secre-
tariat  of Public Works (SOP) is responsible for road, railroad and
airport construction and maintenance, and for programming of invest-
ments in these subsectors; the Secretariat of the Presidency (Presi-
dencia) and Navy are responsible for port development. Presidencia
approves all investments in the transport sector. The most important
public enterprises engaged in provision of transport facilities are
the National Railways, the Airports and Auri.liary Services, and the
Toll Roads and Bridges Authority.   A 1970 Bank sector mission made a
number of recommendations designed to improve the planning and operation
of the transport sector. Many of the recommendations have been put into
effect, although the mission's recommendation that all departments deal-
ing with transport be merged into one Secretariat was not accepted by
the Government.
32.         SCT is responsible for advising on transport coordination but,
in practice, the work is distributed among various secretariats. The
three main secretariats dealing with the formulation of policies and in-
vestment programs - SOP, SCT and Presidencia - recognize the need for
improved transport coordination, and a high level inter-agency commission
responsible for coordinating policies and investments in the transport
sector was recently created under Presidencia. Also, the Government agreed
under the loan for the Second Railway Project to strengthen the planning
department of SCT so that it can assist in coordinating long-range trans-
port policy as well as comment on projects in the transport sector.
33.         All investments for roads, railways and airports are directly
carried out by SOP, which has just updated a six-year (1971-1976) invest-
ment program. The revised program for 1973-1977, totalling about US$2.9
billion, allocates 51 percent for Federal and State roads; 35 percent for
feeder roads and related rural development, investments; 7 percent for
railway construction, and 7 percent for airports.   This allocation of
investments among modes seems generally consistent with the identifiable
needs of the economy.
The Highway Subsector
34.         The network of paved roads has risen from about 1,000 km in 1929
to over 46,0OO in 1972.   More than the railroads, the highways have led
to a balanced expansion of foreign and domestic trade, and to opening up
previously inaccessible areas of Mexico. The principal emphasis in the
last few decades has been on the completion of the primary highway network -
some 15,000 km - so as to provide road connections between Mexico City,
state capitals, border crossings and sea ports. The primary network is a
responsibility of the Federal Government. The secondary network - which has
grown from l,200 km in 19h0 to 35,000 km in 1972 - is the joint responsibility
of the Federal and State Governments.   The standards of construction are
lower than those of the Federal roads, but are well above those of compar-
able roads in many other developing countries.



- 9 -
35.          The present Administration has greatly expanded the con-
struction of feeder roads and has launched a program of constructing
them by highly labor-intensive methods, so as to alleviate the pervasive
rural underemployment. During 1973 the program - together with some
other rural public works - gave employment to 250,000-300,000 people
and is expected to employ 500,000 during the next few years, if fiscal
resources are available.
36.          In 1961-1971 there was a 10 percent per year increase in
the road transport fleet. Road transport is in the hands of owner
drivers and is competitive, despite government regulations (including
route licencing and tariffs). Each truck requires a licence which
establishes the road on which it can operate, the type of freight it
can carry, the maximum weight to be transported, and the tariff to be
charged. The Government has agreed on the need for a study to examine
the economic consequences of the current transport regulation system.
Highway Planning and Financing
37.          SOP has prepared a highway investment program as part of its
transport program. The program's objectives are fourfold: (1) satis-
factory maintenance of existing roads; (2) construction of rural infra-
structure to incorporate small villages into the economic and social life
of the nation; (3) construction of a network of feeder roads to increase
production and obtain better use of the main network; and (4) construction
of the missing links of the main (Federal) network. The program for the
1973-1976 period, which amounts to US$2.5 billion, places heavy emphasis
on the rural development and feeder road construction programs which
account for about 45 percent of total highway expenditures. The bulk of
the financing for the 1973-1976 highway construction program will come
from domestic resources. It is expected, however, that about 45 percent
of expenditures for the main (Federal) network will be financed from
external sources.
38.          Road user charges cover all the maintenance costs plus a
large proportion of investment outlays. It is uncertain whether the
distribution of charges amoung users is appropriate, and the Government will
soon begin a study in order to determine whether distortions exist as a
result of the present charge structure.
Highway Engineering, Construction and Maintenance
39.          Highway and bridge engineering is the responsibility of
the Directorate of Federal Highways in SOP and is done efficiently
using up-to-date techniques. The same Directorate is responsible for
construction and supervision of construction of Federal highways. The
Directorate is well staffed and organized, and carries out its functions
properly.



_10 -
40.          Contracts for highway construction are awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding. The local construction industry is strong,
well equipped and well organized.   Competition among local contractors is
intense, and this may have discouraged foreign firms from bidding for
highway contracts in Mexico.
41.          SOP, through its Directorate of General Maintenance, is
responsible for maintenance of the highway system. Routine maintenance
is carried out by the Government's own forces and is generally satisfactory.
Only major betterment works are carried out by contract.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
42.          A Report entitled "Mexico - Appraisal of a Seventh Highway
Project"t (No. 278a-ME) dated January 21, 1974, is being distributed
separately. The main features of the loan and project are summarized in
Annex III. Technical and economic studies for the proposed project were
carried out by SOP. The project was appraised in the field in May/June
1973. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington in
December 1973. Negotiators were Messrs. Fernando Torres and German
Sandoval of Nacional Financiera; Mr. Carlos Vidali of the Secretariat of
Finance; and Messrs. Juan Duran Romano and Daniel Diaz Diaz of the
Secretariat of Public Works.
Project Description
43.          The project represents about 4o percent of SOP's Federal
highway construction program for 1973-1976, and consists of the construc-
tion of sixteen roads, totalling 1875 km, of three types, as follows:
(a)    Widening, including paving, from two to four lanes of
four major highways (201 km).

4hh.          The project highways, whose location is given in the annexed
map, have been selected according to their priority within the Federal
highway system. Some of the highways- Nos. (1), (2), (5), (7), (9), (10),
(12), (13) and(16)- are extensions of highways financed under previous
Bank loans,and the others are connections between highways also financed
by previous highway loans. The standards of design of each group of
highways listed in para 43 above vary according to traffic, topography
and weather conditions in the affected regions.
Project Execution
45.           Execution of project works will be the responsibility of
SOP through the Directorate of Federal Highways. In addition, the Control
Office under the Directorate-General for Programming, which was established
in 1967 to ensure that Bank projects are carried out according to the
agreed schedule, will continue its function for works under the present
project. The project is expected to be carried out during 1974-1978.
Cost Estimates and Financing
46.           The total cost of the project is estimated at US$241.4 million,
including contingency allowances; a detailed breakdown of costs is given
in Annex III. The proposed loan of US$90 million equivalent would finance
the estimated foreign exchange component of construction works. The bal-
ance would be financed by the Government out of the budget.
Procurement and Disbursement
h7.           Contracts for all highways will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.
So far, foreign participation for highway works in Mexico has been very
limited and most works under Bank-financed highway projects have been carried
out by local firms. Several measures were taken in previous loans to
encourage foreign participation and to maximize competition, and will con-
tinue under the present project. For example, (a) contracts will be
awarded for complete road sections, that is, earthworks, pavement and
drainage (in earlier projects, road works had been contracted "horizontally",
that is, separate contracts for (i) earthworks and drainage and (ii) pave-
ment); and (b) invitations to bid will be made on the basis of "packaging"
of contracts, whereby contractors may bid for one or several sections of a
road as a package. Contracts would be awarded to the lowest evaluated bid



- 12 -
for the entire road or to the lowest evaluated combination of bids for
its sections. The estimated value of the works in the packages would
range from about US$1.2 million to about $7.2 million.
L8.         Construction of bridges over 15 meters span, traffic
signals and other minor specialized works will not be included in the
highway contracts since Mexico's experience is that because of the exist-
ence of firms engaged exclusively in these kinds of works, major bridge
construction, installation of traffic signals and other minor specialized
works tend to be cheaper if bid directly rather than as part of a road
contract. Hence, contracts for these works, together accounting for about
10 percent of the project cost (about US$24 million equivalent) will be
bid separately from the road contracts. Because these works are unlikely
to attract firms not already established in the country, the bids will be
advertised locally only. This procedure would not exclude participation
by foreign bidders, although it is unlikely that they would show interest.
lL9.        The loan would be disbursed against 40 percent of the expend-
itures for civil works contracts. Annex III includes the disbursement
schedule for the proposed loan.
Economic Benefits
50.         The economic rate of return on the project as a whole is
about 20 percent if passenger time savings on the four highways to be
widened are excluded. If they are included, the rate of return for the
entire project increases to 23 percent. The economic rate of return on
individual roads ranges from 10 percent to 41 percent. The main benefits
from the four roads to be widened and eight roads linking major cities/
areas will be road user savings resulting from improved riding surfaces
and shorter routes. The main benefits from construction of the agricul-
tural roads will be increased agricultural production in the areas of
influence. The Government has confirmed that it intends to make the
investments in minor irrigation works that will be necessary after com-
pletion of the roads in order to realize their full economic benefits.
51.         It is possible that much of the direct benefits resulting from
widening of the four major roads from two to four lanes will go to the
vehicle owners, in particular to the truckers, because the present road
regulation system does not provide for official tariff reductions when
the quality of the road is improved. Nevertheless, since minimum tariffs
are difficult to enforce, and there is competition among truckers, some
of the benefits are likely in practice to be passed on to the shippers and
eventually to consumers. The Government has agreed in this connection
to undertake a study to determine the economic consequences of the present
regulatory system. The direct benefits of the construction of the other
roads will be split between the vehicle owners, the shippers and the local
workers. Shippers will benefit from a reduction in tariffs for freight,
as a result of considerable shortening of distances of transport. Local



- 13 -
workers will benefit indirectly from increased wages since studies
carried out by SOP show that in areas served by all-weather roads the
minimum wage actually paid is appreciably higher than in areas not so
served. The eight linking roads included in the proposed project will
serve approximately 1.1 million people, of whom at least 100,000 are
salaried workers. The agricultural roads will help some 10,000 to
12,000 independent farmers who own the land in the areas of influence
of the roads; some 85,000 inhabitants of the area will also be benefited
by the construction of the proposed roads.
52.         Final cost estimates based on detailed engineering are avail-
able for ten of the sixteen roads, for which $40 million has been allocated
out of the loan. For the remaining six roads estimates have been based
on preliminary engineering; experience in Mexico indicates that final
engineering tends to confirm the preliminary figures. Nevertheless, the
economic justification for these six roads where the detailed engineering
has not been completed will be reviewed when cost estimates based on com-
pleted detailed engineering are available. Agreement by the Bank and the
Government that they are each economically justified is a condition of
disbursement for these roads. If any of these roads is not economically
justified, the Bank has agreed to sympathetically consider the substitution
of another road or roads of equivalent cost which can be shown to be
economically justified.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.         The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Nacional
Financiera, S.A., the draft Guarantee Agreement between United Mexican
States and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
54.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
55.         In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to
take full account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum
prices. However, available information indicates that the proposed loan
remains fully justified.
56.         I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln. No. 450    Third Irrigltion Project: $19 Million Loan of May 25, 1966
Closina Date: December 31. 1973.
The revised project costs are about 33 percent higher than
estimated, but the project rate of return will not be affected
because of higher than anticipated returns. The Closing Date has
been extended by one year to December 1973. In spite of delays in
construction and land levelling, agricultural development has pro-
gressed satisfactorily; net farm incomes have risen by 38-45 percent,
and over two-thirds of farm population benefiting are ejidatarios.
Ln. No. 527    Fourth Irrigation Project: $25 Milion Loan of January 26
1968; Closing Date: June 30. 1976.
Estimated project costs have risen by about 36 percent.
Project benefits will be higher than estimated at appraisal, but
probably not enough to fully offset the cost increases. Civil works
are about 50 percent complete. The original Closing Date (June 30,
1975) has been extended by one year to enable completion of works.
Ln. No. 528    Third Road ProJect: $27.5      ion Loan of Jaua
Closing Date: December 31. 1973.
The project, initially delayed by incressed earthworks, the need for
additional drainage structures and heavy rains, was completed in early 1973.
The original 'Clos'7r-Date7ofTMarch1 31, 1972 -has been extended to December 31,
1973 to permit completion of disbursements.
Ln. No. 695    Fourth Road Project:  $21.8 Million Loan of June 26, 1970.
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The project is slightly behind schedule because of initial delays in
budgetary allocations. This problem has now been resolved, and dis-
bursements have accelerated during 1973.
Ln. No. 747    Third Livestock and Agriculture Project: $75 Million Loan of
June 9, 1971; Closing Date: September 30. 1975.
Progress continues-at a satisfactory rate.  Loan funds
are expected to be _fully committed by the end of June- 1974' and
fully disbursed by the e'nd 'of September 197h, ahead of schedule.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 793   Zihuatanejo Tourism Project:   $22 Million Loan of January 22,
1972. Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
Though the loan became effective only on March 31, 1973,
the physical performance under the project is satisfactory.
Ln. No. 820   Ports Project:  $20 Million Loan of May 17, 1972;   Closing
Date: June 30, 1976.
The execution of the project is proceeding satisfactorily,
despite some delays in the preparation of tender documents. The
operations consultants financed under the loan have completed much
of their work, although an extension of their contract will be
necessary in order to allow time to implement their recommendations
and to complete tariff studies. The National Ports Development
Study, carried out as part of the project, is progressing satis-
factorily.
Ln. No. 824   Industrial Equipment Fund (FONEl) Project:   $35 Million Loan
of June 2, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The loan became effective on October 12, 1972. FONEI had a
slow start because of problems in organization and promotion, but
operations have picked up and several sub-loans have been approved
recently.
Ln. No. 825   Second Railway Project:   $75 Million Loan of June 2. 1972;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1275.
The new management of the railways, appointed in May 1973,
is capable,_and recent changes in operating practices are expected
to improve operations. Significant progress has been made in pro-
curement and orders have been placed for most of the major items.
Recent wage awards and fuel price increases caused deterioration
in the financial position of the railways and a tariff increase
is urgently needed.
Ln. No. 834   Fourth Power Sector Program: $125 Million Loan of June 23,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
The loan became effective on April 13, 1973. Increase in
power tariffs by December 31, 1972 was originally a condition of
effectiveness of the loan. In December 1972, however, the Govern-
ment and the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), the Borrower,
informed the Bank that for reasons of domestic economic policy it
would not be possible to effect the electricity rate increase by
December 31. The loan included $35 million for payments due on
orders placed before December 31, 1971, and which were being jointly
financed with other creditors   With the approval of Executive
Directors (R73-23 of February 1, 1973) the Loan Agreement was
amended to separate this $35 million from the remainder of the loan.

Ln. No. 834   (cont'd)
The loan was made effective, although the $90 million which were
not being used for joint financing with other creditors were
not eligible for disbursement until the power tariffs were in-
creased consistent with the requirement that the Government and
CFE take measures to improve the company's financial position.
Power rates were increased on October 17, 1973.
Ln. No. 909    Mexico City Water Supply ProJect: $90 Million Loan of June
18. 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Effectiveness of this loan has been delayed because of dif-
ficulties in establishing contractual arrangements between the
Water Commission and the State of Mexico. The Commission has
already constructed facilities to provide 700,000 inhabitants
in the Valley of Mexico with water. Slow progress has been made
in engaging the management consultants required under the project
and in starting the recommended studies.
Ln. No. 910    Fourth Livestock and Agriculture Project: $110 Million Loan
of June 18, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
The loan became effective in October 1973 and the Government
has begun implementing the Low Income Producers' Sub-Project, a
new departure initiated under this loan. It is proceeding satis-
factorily. Lending under the General Sub-Project, the other
component of Loan 910-ME, will have to await full commitment of
Loan 747-ME.
Ln. No. 93h    Las Truchas Steel Project:  $70 Million Loan of September 12,
1973; Closing Date: December 31. 1977.
The loan became effective on October 29, 1973.

Procurement
Arrangements:   Contracts for all highways will be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding, in accordance with
Bank guidelines. Contracts for large bridges (over 15
meter span), traffic signals and other minor specialized
works, totalling about 10 percent of project costs, will
be bid separately from the road contracts because in
Mexico's experience these works tend to be cheaper if bid
directly rather than as part of a road contract. Because
these works are unlikely to attract firms not already
established in the country, the bids will be advertised
locally only. This procedure would not exclude particip-
ation of interested foreign bidders, although it is
unlikely that they would show an interest.
Rate of
Return:         The economic rate of return for all roads averages 20
percent. The return for individual roads ranges from
10 to 41 percent.
Appraisal
Report:         Report No. 278a-ME, dated January 21, 1973.
