MEXICO
SEVENTH HIGBRAY PROJECT (LOAN 968-ME)
HIGELIGHTS
1.        Loan 968-ME for US$90 million supported widening and construction
of about 1,245 km of Mexico's highway network.  Of these, three main highways
4           were widened to four lanes (127.5 km) and seven major new roads were constructed
(1,118 km).
2.        The project had originally included four roads (201 km) to be
widened to four lanes a-d twelve new roads (1,674 km) to be constructed, a
contemplated total of 1,875 km. Due to long dElays, calused by a shortage of
local funds, in beginning implementation of the project, estimated project
costs increased by a factor of three. By April 1966, almost three years
after loan signature, when the Government proposed a major reduction in
project scope, no work had yet begun on any of the portions of the project to
be deleted. Progress on other project roads had reached about 25Z of
completion.
3.        Despite the delays and increases in costs, the project was generally
successful in achieving its objective of assisting in modernizing and
constructing key sections of Mexico's road network. Economic returns on
the investments were satisfactory because cost increases were offset by
increases, in real terms, in vehicle operating cost savings and time savings.
4.        The following points may be of particular interest:-
(a) increases in costs, reasons therefore and action
taken (paras. 3.01 to 3.06); and
(b) effects of inflation, design changes and shortages
of local funds (paras. 4.01 and 4.02).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO SEVWNTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (WAN 968-ME)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      mexico's large size, rugged topography and dispersed population
have made transport a crucial element of the country's development policy.
In the highway subsector, the main emphasis from the mid-1950s to 1970 was on
completing the primary radial network from the central region to important
state capitals and toward key border points. In the early 1970s, this effort
was continued, and major new highways were built to open up the Baja
California peninsula and link the regions along the Pacific and Gulf of
Mexico coasts respectively. Emphasis then shifted to rural roads invest-
ments, and 73,000 km of feeder roads were built over the period 1971-1976
(corresponding to one fifth of new investment expenditures), bringing some
6.4 million people living in 7,400 small and isolated localities into the
mainstream of economic life. The highway network now includes about 62,000
km of paved roads, 88,000 km of gravel roads, and 48,000 km of earth roads;
in general, the network is adequately maintained and of good standard.
1.02      Over a period of 18 years, since 1964, the Bank has made eight
highway loans to Mexico for a total of US$387 million equivalent. Out of a
total primary network of some 40,000 km, the Bank has assisted or is assist-
ing in the improvement or construction of about 14,000 km. In the course of
this long association, the Secretariat of Public Works (now the Secretariat
of Human Settlements and Public Works - SAHOP) 1/ has achieved considerable
progress in all aspects of highway planning, evaluation and execution.  The
quality of the works executed under past Bank projects has been satisfactory.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      In May 1972, a reconnaissance mission visited Mexico to identify a
possible Seventh Highway Project. Government officials originally presented
the mission members with a preliminary list of two roads needing widening
from two to four lanes (35 km) and four roads for reconstruction (685 km).
The list was subsequently extended, and, late in 1972, the Mexican Government
formally requested Bank assistance to finance the improvement or construction
of 18 main roads in several regions of the country. The economic information
and engineering studies for the proposed roads were being prepared by SAHOP
and were expected to be completed at various dates through the end of 1973.
The preliminary cost estimate of the project was about US$200 million.
2.02      Detailed engineering for six of the project roads 2/ was not going
to be completed by the assumed date of Board presentation, but the Mexican
Government requested that the package of 18 roads be appraised at one time.
The Bank agreed to include works on 16 roads, totaling about 1,875 km, in the
proposed project (Table 1). For those roads on which detailed engineering
was not completed, the evaluation would be based on preliminary cost fig res,
and disbursement would be conditional upon confirmation of the economic
justification based on the cost estimates after detailed engineering was
completed. Such confirmation was subsequently received.
1/ Throughout this report, the Secretariat is referred to as SAHOP.
2/ Items 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 in Table 1.



- 2 -
2.03      The project was appraised in April 1973. Most of the project roads
were justified on the basis of savings in vehicle operating costs and traffic
growth, but the economic justification of four of the roads was based largely
on agricultural development 3/. To achieve this development, the Bank
considered indispensable the carrying out of small irrigation works along
three of those roads 4/ at a total cost of about US$5 million. The
above-mentioned works were supposed to start six years later (in 1978);
therefore, the Bank requested and obtained Government assurances that the
works would be included In the long-term program of the Government and would
be carried out in a timely manner. The works were subsequently carried out
in the context of the large Mexican irrigation and rainfed agricultural
schemes.
2.04      The Issues Paper was circulated on June 7, 1973; its highlights
included.
(a) Foreign Exchange Component. The Mexican Government recalculated
the foreign exchange component of the proposed project and found it
to be about 40%, as compared to the 33% used in the previous one.
The reason presented for the increase was that standards, as well
as better specifications and their strict enforcement in highway
construction, had led to the use of additional and more sophis-
ticated imported equipment. The Bank, after reviewing the analysis
carried out by SAHOP, found the increase justified.
(b) Reserved Bidding for Part of Proposed Works. SAROP requested that
certain works, such as specific bridge works and signalization,
amounting to 12% of estimated project cost, be reserved for local
contractors although still awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding. The Bank recognized that, in practice, because of the
strength of the local industry, bidding for highway projects in
Mexico is virtually limited to the domestic contracting industry.
It thus agreed that the advertising of the above-mentioned works,
when not exceeding US$24.3 million, could be limited to newspapers
of general circulation in Mexico.
(c) Conditions for Board Presentation. The Second Railway Project
(Loan 825-ME) included provisions to carry out a road user charges
study. Since the start of the study was experiencing extensive
delays, the Bank decided to make the finalization of a contract
with the consultants for carrying out the study a condition for
Board presentation of the proposed Seventh Highway Project.
2.05      Negotiations took place in Washington between the 3rd and 5th of
December 1973. By the end of January 1974, substantial progress toward the
initiation of the above-mentioned road user charges study had been made.
The executing agency for the study (SCT) 5/ was negotiating the details of a

contract with the consultants who had made the best technical offer. The
Bank felt that there was little chance that those negotiations would not lead
to the signature of a contract and that the condition of such signature for
Board presentation would only delay the implementation of the project.
Therefore, the Bank agreed to waive that condition 6/,. A loan for the amount
of US$90 million equivalent was approved by the Executive Directors on
February 2, 1974, and the loan became effective on May 29, 1974.

III. PROJECT EXECUTION
3.01      Project implementation suffered substantial delays almost from the
start because of a sbortage of local funds due to a sudden change in the
economic performance of the country. Mexico, after a long period of price
stability, experienced, in 1973, the beginning of a strong and continuing inr
flationary process. During the initial period of project execution, SAHOP
found itself in a financial squeeze which left it with an eroded budget inr
sufficient to fulfill its commitments. Later on, the shortage of funds was
the result of Government stabilization policies which included not only a re-
duction in overall expenditures but also a concentration of available funds
in projects considered of the highest priority and expected to have a large               .9
and prompt impact upon the productive capacity of the country. During 1974,
1975, and 1976, budgetary allocations for the Seventh Highway Project were
Mex$ 14.8 million, Mex$ 270.0 million, and Mex$ 506.0 million respectively,
over a total original project cost of Mex$ 2,808.9 million and a scheduled
completion date of mid-1978. Furthermore, by mid-1975, SAHOP estimated
project cost increases of 53% and expected them to reach 88% by the tine that
the works were completed. In the fall of 1975, the Seventh Highway Project
was placed on the list of problem projects.
3.02      To enable broader international competition, roads were divided
into 33 bidding sections. Contractors could bid for one or more sections,
and contracts would be awarded on the basis of (a) the lowest evaluated bid
for the entire road or (b) the lowest evaluated combination of bids for its
sections. The shortage of funds (para 3.01) slowed the pace of bidding
considerably. Only three international bids were invited in 1974, 15 in 1975
and none in 1976.
3.03      Inflationary pressures were also the cause of bid proposals being
substantially higher than expected, with increases ranging from 0 to over
100% of the estimated bids. The problem was exacerbated by the lack of an
escalation clause in the contracts, which added to the bidders' uncertainties
regarding future prices. Early in 1975, SAHOP organized a working group
responsible for finding an adequate price escalation formula to be included
in subsequent contracts. A proposed clause was submitted for approval to a
high level committee comprising four Under-Secretaries and a representative
of the Chamber of the Construction Industry, and a final clause was approved
and implemented in early 1976, resulting in an evident reduction of the bid
prices. The escalation clause stated that, when the costs that were the
basis for estimating the bid unit prices underwent an increase of more than
5% of the works not yet carried out, the contractor could request the
adjustment of his unit prices providing a full justification for such action.
3.04      By mid-1975, progress on project implementation was minimum, and no
disbursements had been made. By that time, it was evident that measures to
tackle the problem of substantial cost increases, coupled with budgetary
constraints, were needed. The Bank and SAHOP started to study alternative
solutions, which included:



(a) reducing the scope of the project on the basis of a revised cost
estimate, deleting some of the project roads so that the Bank could
continue its participation at the same 40Z rate of disbursement;
(b) reducing Bank participation so that the original scope of the
project could be maintained; and
Cc) a combination of (a) and (b).
One year later, no decision had been reached, although both SABOP and the
Bank favored a reduction in the size of the project.  By then, the Mexican
authorities preferred to leave the final decision regarding changes in the
scope of the project to the new government that was going to be inaugurated
in December 1976.
3.05      On April 19, 1977, the Government formally proposed to the Bank a
program for implementing project works, which included the reduction of the
scope of the project by deleting five roads and part of a sixth road; the
project's original total length of roads, 1,875 km, was therefore reduced by
659 km to 1,216 km 7/.   Nb contracts had been awarded for works on any of
the roads to be deleted.
3.06      SAHOP's proposal included two important features:  (a) the total
loan amount would be maintained at US$90 million; and (b) the disbursement
percentage would be kept at 40%; in fact, the size of the project reduction
was tailored so that the disbursement rate would not be affected. The pro-
posal also included a yearly investment program, road by road, for the re-
duced project. The Bank, after confirming that the roads in the project were
still economically justified in spite of the increased costs, and satisfied
that the Government proposals were an important step toward the successful
(albeit delayed) completion of the now reduced project by June 30, 1981,
agreed to it. The Loan Agreement was changed accordingly on July 31, 1977.
3.07      The pace of civil works on the project roads improved substantially
after the reduction of the project scope, and, in early 1978, the Bank
deleted the loan from the list of problem projects. By the middle of 1979,
project completion was estimated at 73% as compared to the 17% progress on
the reduced project by the end of 1976 (two and a half years after loan
effectiveness).
3.08      In November 1979, the Mexican Government requested that the Coatza-
coalcos-Minatitlan road also be deleted from the project. The original pro-
posal was to widen the road from two- to four-lane to accommodate increasing
traffic between Coatzacoalcos and Minatitlan as well as between that area and
Tehuantepec, Veracruz, Mexico City and Villahermosa. What was not foreseen
then was the tremendous economic growth, based on the petroleum development
that had occurred in the region since 1975. As a result, traffic on the
critical Coatzacoalcos bridge, the only practical gateway between the left
bank of the Coatzacoalcos river and the State of Tabasco, had doubled to
14,000 vehicles a day, reaching capacity. Since the bridge, not the
Coatzacoalcos-Minatitlan road, had become the major transport bottleneck, the
71 Subsequent changes in the design of some of the roads brought the total
length of project roads to 1,245.5 km.



Mexican Government decided to build a new bridge, closer to Minatitlan, with
31 km of access roads (including a bypass of the town), at an estimated total
cost of US$60 million. The construction of the bridge would change the
traffic pattern in the area, making it possible to delay widening of the
project road. The Bank agreed to the deletion of the road from the project
and to the reallocation of the thus freed funds to the remaining works under
the loan.
3.09      The project continued to experience large cost increases, caused
mainly by inflation but exacerbated by design modifications due, in some
cases, to increased traffic projections, but mostly to unexpected works in
difficult mountainous areas. Revision of cost estimates performed in late
1979 showed the total costs of the reduced project to be Mex$ 6,000 million
rather than the Mex$ 4,500 estimated in June 1979. It was then clear that,
even with the deletion of the Coatzacoalcos-Minatitlan road, the US$90 mil-
lion of the loan were about US$27.6 million short to cover the foreign
exchange component of the project. The Bank started to consider alternative
actions that would enable it to participate until the end of the construction
works, but it was finally decided that the solution that would best corres-
pond to the spirit of the Sector Loan (Loan 1671-ME signed on August 23,
1979) would be to continue disbursements at the rate of 40X 8/ until funds
ran out, provided that the remainder of the road sections would not be
financed out of the Highway Sector Loan. This alternative would confirm the
basis on which the Sector Loan was made, i.e., that the Bank had confidence
in the programs carried out by SAHOP, on which there were periodic consulta-
tions, and that the Bank expected that road sections, once started, would be
completed. The provision of funds for completion of the works on three roads
that would remain after disbursement of all loan funds would be monitored
through the semi-annual consultations on budget and multi-year programs on
which the Bank was given opportunities to comment. The Mexican Government
agreed to this approach, and the loan was fully disbursed by July 1981.
3.10      Three of the project roads (Temascatelpec-Zihuatanejo, Playa Azul-
Coahuayana and Pochutla-Salina Cruz) are expected to be completed by the end
of 1982. The reasons for the slippage of these roads are: (a) unrealistic
schedule of complicated works and (b) low budget allocations triggered by a
shift of Government concerns toward modernizing the existing network.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      The outstanding characteristic of the project was the sharp in-
crease of final project costs in current Mexican pesos. Nominal construction
costs of the revised project increased more than 300Z over initial cost
estimates, when expressed in current Mexican pesos, and 126% in US dollars
(Table 3) . These Increases took place in an unprecedented period of infla-
tion which started in 1973 (para 3.01), but were exacerbated by the cost in-
8/ Actually 42% of 95Z (expenditures -5% retention) (para 4.03).



-7-
cr-eases resulting from changes in design (para 3.10).  SAROP carried out the
construction supervision (not Bank-financed) with its own staff, and the
costs incurred in this task are not available.
4.02      While construction prices were increasing rapidly, the public sec-
tor budget was not keeping pace as inflation control measures were taken.
The road budget was cut in real terms to reduce the impact of the public
sector deficit. The domestic component for completing the project on
schedule was not available, and Bank funds could not be disbursed. The Bank
insisted unsuccessfully that budget allocations be increased for the project
roads, and loan disbursements lagged far behind appraisal estimates, as sbown
below:

4.03      The Mexican Government retains 5% of payments under civil works
contracts, for a period of one year, as a guarantee that the contract has
been properly executed. After much discussion with Mexican autborities, the
Controller's Department decided that the Bank could not disburse against this
retention until it was actually disbursed to the contractor 9/. This led to
a considerable record-keeping problem for the Government and NAFINSA, and,
during the negotiations for the Small Scale Agricultural Infrastructure
Project (Loan 1643-ME) in November 1978, the Bank agreed to disburse against
the value of civil works contracts, less the amount retained, but the
disbursement rate-would he increased slightly in order to finance the same
portion of total project costs. NAFINSA, in a letter dated March 2, 1979,
requested that the Bank adopt the sme approach to several other loans,
includIng Loan 968-BE. The Bank agreed to NAFIRSA'Ws request, and, in August
1979, the loan agreement was amended: disbursement percentage for civil
works was increased to 42%, and guarantee retentions were excluded from the
disbursement base.
4.04      The allocation of proceeds of the loan wa revised once, as
follows:
9/ Contractors were given a bond, equivalent to the 5% retention, which was
discountable at commercial banks before the one year-period ended.

V ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      The Seventh pighway Project was justified at appraisal90, 0 inly on
the basis of quantifiable benefits accruiLng to road users from reduced vehi-
cle operating costs and travel time which would result from improwements in
road design and surface characteriLsticr. In the case of three of the project
roads 0II    benefits were derived from expected agricultural development.
The al;raisal estimate of the weighted economic rate of return (ERR) was 23%,
whiJle reevaluation, based on SAHOP' s Fn-al Report of February 1982 amnl on
composite savings In vehicle operating costs derived from simi1 r projects in
Mexico and other Latin Americau countries, resulted in a weighted ERK of
24%. Lack of relevant data precluded an economic analysis based on
agricultural development for the three above-mentioned roads.
5.02      For the purpose of the eronomic reevaluation, costs were expressed
In constant 1981 Mexican pesos using the construction industry price index
provided by the BRank of MAexico. W hen expressed in constant 1981 pesos, the
real total cost of the project increased by only 23Z, mainly due to design
changes justified by larger-thai-expected traffic growth rates and by dt-
planned extra works in difficult mutiosterrain. Whbat follows takes a
closer look at the economic performance of individual. project roads.
Highway Widened from Two to Four Lanes
5.03      As shown in Table 4, the three roads under this category -
Monterrey-Morelos, Mazatan-Aeropuerto and Los Reyes-Lecheria - have ERRs of
71Z, 84% and 68% respectively, substantially above the appraisal ERRs of
about 30%. Although not enough Information was available to reproduce the
appraisal analysis, the ofst likely reason for the important difference is
the appraisal underestimation of time saviengs in projects designed to avoid
or reduce congestion.
10/ Items 8, 9 and 10 in. Table 2.



9
5.04      In the case of the Mazatlan-Aeropuerto road, the real cost of civil
works was 92% above that estimated at appraisal. The reason was that a
bigher level of service was considered necessary for the level of traffic
which was occurring on the road, and design changes, such as overpasses and
service-roads, were thus incorporated. The real cost of the
Monterrey-Montemorelos road suffered an increase of 22% while that of Los
Reyes-Lecheria declined by 10%.
Construction of New Roads
5.05      The roads under this category show ex-post economic returns remark-
aoly close to appraisal expectations (Table 3). The four roads already com-
pleted - Ruixta-Comalapa, Mararatio-Zinapecuaro, Tlapa-Tecomatlan and
Cerrero-Nuevo Laredo - have satisfactory rates of return ranging from 10.5Z
to 36Z. 111. Of the remaining roads, Playa AzuIl-Coahanyana and Pochutla-
Santa Cruz show rates of return (and first year benefits) below the oppor-
tunity cost of capital, considered for this exercise to be 12%. The Mexican
Government, aware that investments in these roads might have been premature,
delayed their completion in favor of highly justified reconstruction
projects.
5.06      Table 3 shows that the real cost of the civil works of four of the
roads experienced increases ranging between 20% and 42%, whitle the real cost
of the other roads deelined. The four roads mentioned above cross very
difficult mountainous terrain, and construction required extra works that
were not contemplated at appraisal time.
5.07      Current traffic on the new roads, based on counts carried out by
SAROP, are, in general, somewhat below the very optimistic levels expected at
the time of appraisal (Table 3), mainly because most of the roads have only
recently been completed. In the case of the still uncompleted roads
(para 5.05), traffic estimations are the result of extrapolating current
traffic in already completed sections of the road, thus probably underesti-
mating traffic growth when the roads will be operational for soie time.
Conclusion
5.08      In spite of the financial problems encountered during project exe-
cution and the ensuing delays in project completion, the Seventh Highway Pro-
ject shows a satisfactory economic performance. Increases in costs, because
of design changes and delays in project implementation, have mostly been
offset by the increase in real terms of the value of vehicle operating costs
savings and the value of time savings.
11/ Excluding Guerrero-Nuevo Laredo, the remaining roads have ERRs equal or
above 13%. Guerrero-Nuevo Laredo was justified at appraisal on the
basis of agricultural development. The economic analysis in this PCR is
based on savings in time and vehicle operating costs.

VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWEI
6.01      Considering the serious economic problems experienced by Mexico
during the execution of the project, the Borrower's performance was generally
satisfactory. What follows discusses the major covenants of the Guarantee
Agreement and the Borrower's effort to comply with them.
6.02      Section 3.01. Prompt provision of funds as required for project
execution.' To cope with the inflationary process that started in 1973, the
Mexican Government drastically reduced public expenditures in real terms,
forcing SAHOP to limit anTal allocations for the project roads.  Such a
policy, although detrimental for the pace of project execution, served its
purpose of spreading the restricted funds among several projects, thus
satisfying the need to proceed in all regions of the country and allowing a
larger number of contractors to continue to work. Om the other hand, the
insufficient allocation of funds during the early 1980s and the consequent
slippage of the completion of three project roads to the end of 1982 were no
longer the result of macroeconomic stabilization policies but of the shift of
SAHOP's emphasis from new construction to the upgrading of the primary road
network. This shift was Justified by the extraordinary traffic growth
accompanying the country's economic recuperation that started in late 1977.
6.03      Section 3.06   -The guarantor shall undertake, or cause to be
undertaken, a study of the economic effects of the guarantor's road transport
regulations.- This study was not carried out as originally envisaged in the
Guarantee Agreement. However, the serious transport bottlenecks produced by
the reactivation of the economy (begun in 1977) required measures to relax
regulation controls in order to -temporarilyi increase the supply of road
transporters. These measures were adopted permanently in August 1980, when
the Government enacted a new Regulation for the use of roads under the
existing Highway Law, and are expected to be improved in the foreseeable
future with tbe implementation of the Federal Road Transport Development
Program. The Government's efforts in the area of transport regulations are
of a magnitude beyond what the Bank expected at the time of the loan
signature and fulfill, in spirit, the above covenant. The dialogue between
the Mexican Government and the Bank on this subject is currently being
carried out under the framework of the Highway Sector Loan (Loau 1671-ME).
6.04      Section 4.02  -The Guarantor shall continue to:  (i) cause all the
roads and bridges of its federal highway system to be adequately maintained,
and all necessary repairs thereof to be promptly made, all in accordance with
sound engineering practices; and (ii) take all reasonable steps (including
appropriate application of regulations on axle loading and vehicle size)
necessaxy to ensure the proper use of such roads and bridges.' The efforts
of the Borrower to comply with this covenant bave been satisfactory. Road
maintenance in Mexico is adequate. Regarding weight controls, SCr
established a working group in 1977 to study and propose new legislation for
the use of roads under the existing Highway Law. Under the leadership of
SCr, representatives of SAHOP, the Secretary of Industry, shippers such as
PEMEX, vehicle manufacturers and trucking asociations worked for three years
in drafting the new regulations, which were enacted by the President on
October 3, 1980. The main changes brought about by the new regulations are
in the areas of (a) the classification of vehicles and the roads on which



- 11 -
they can operate; (b) the maximum weight and dimensions allowed for each; and
(c) the special conditions for exceptions. The new regulations relate higher
axle weights to vehicle speeds, which are, therefore, given much emphasis.
The gist of the new regulations lies in the establishment of a new document
issued to each truck - the Certificate of Weight and Dimensions (and speed
limits) - which should be consulted by shippers and loaders; it serves as the
basis for enforcement of the law, carried out by the Highway Police. In
summary, the new regulations seek to put weight and dimension limits mDre in
line with the current technological developments in roads and vehicles.  As a
result, a more efficient operation of the fleet and a drastically reduced
incidence of overloading are expected. The new regulations are based on the
premise of bigher load limits, coupled with strict control on the manufac-
ture, reinforcement or enlargement of chassis, and on the use of vehicles
capable of carrying higher loads. The issuing of the new truck Certificate
of Weight and Dimensions is viewed as a deterrent for overloading as much as
a means for facilitating enforcement. There is still no information
available to the Bank to assess the impact of these new regulations.
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank contributed, during project preparation, through review
and comments on the feasibility and engineering studies. During execution,
the Bank showed the necessary degree of flexibility in agreeing to project
uodifications and, in the spirit of sector loan approach, to the full
disbursement of the loan before physical completion of all project roads.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The Seventh Highway Project has been successful, in spite of the
cost and time overruns, in meeting its main objective of mDdernizing and
constructing key sections of Mexico's road network with a satisfactory econo-
mic return on the investment.
8.02      The initial project scope and implementation schedule implied an
overall level of highway expenditures that was well above the Government's
financial capabilities. In order to pursue the project as originally
planned, SAHOP would have had to give it preferential budget treatment at the
expense of other highway expenditures of equal or greater priority.  Such
measures would certainly have improved the loan rating from the Bank's point
of view, but might not bave been the optimal policy for the country.
8.03      The problems encountered with the Seventh Highway Project illus-
trated the limitations of conventional project lending in Mexico, a country
with a highway infrastructure in the hands of mature and well developed ins-
titutions. With Bank funds tied to a few large projects, failure to allocate
domestic funds for these projects (for reasons of budget limitations or
changes in priorities after signing the loan agreement) leads to a slow dis-
bursing project about which there is little the Bank can do. The approach
followed in the Highway Sector Loan to Mexico (Loan 1671-ME) is intended to
overcome those limitations and to allow the Bank to better integrate its con-
tribution into SAHOP's planning and budgeting process.
