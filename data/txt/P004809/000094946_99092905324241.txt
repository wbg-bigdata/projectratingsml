IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Kingdom of Tonga
(CREDIT 2084-TON)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Tonga
Development Bank Project in the Kingdom of Tonga, for which Credit 2084-TON in the
amount of SDR 2.4 million (US$3 million equivalent) was approved on January 4, 1990
and made effective on August 9, 1990. The credit were closed on December 31, 1995.
Sixty six percent of them were disbursed, and the last disbursement took place on June 6,
1995.
The ICR is prepared by Xiaofeng Hua in the Financial Sector Development Sector
Unit of the East Asia and Pacific Region, and reviewed by Jacques Loubert, Sector
Manager, EASFS and Laurence Dunn, Country Officer, EACNI. It is based on the
Project Completion Report by the Asian Development Bank and the information in IDA's
project file.

KINGDOM OF TONGA
SECOND TONGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 2084-TON)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The economic development in Tonga, an economy with a population of less than
100, 000 people, depends on the growth in agriculture, manufacturing and tourism.
Tonga Development Bank (TDB), which is jointly owned by the government (90 percent)
and a local commercial bank (the Bank of Tonga, 10 percent), has been the primary source
of medium and long term financing of this growth. IT is also a major source of micro
credit for small, family-based subsistence agriculture and village service activities. The
development bank itself is funded by grants from bilateral donors, loans and grants from
international organizations; and to a lesser extent, deposits and issuance of promissory
notes and bonds. The Government has general control over TDB through the power to
appoint Board chairman and top management. TDB is also required to confirm with the
government economic policies set forth in the national development planning program.
2.    TDB enjoys a long history of funding and technical support from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB). Three credit lines were provided by ADB between 1978 -
1986, all of which were accompanied by technical assistance grants for TDB' s institutional
capacity building. IDA provided co-financing for the third ADB project under the first
Tonga Development Bank Project (Credit 1813-TON) in 1986. The Second Tonga
Development Bank Project in 1989 was also under a joint co-financing arrangement, with
ADB taking the lead in project administration, monitoring and supervision. This
conformed with the Bank Group's strategy of cost effective lending to the Pacific Islands
countries in the 1980s. The fourth ADB project was closed in December 1996 after three
extensions. The ADB Project Completion Report (PCR) was finalized in June 1998
(Annex C). This summary Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is based on the
ADB's PCR, as well as the information available in the project files.
Project Objectives
3.    The project was to (i) implement interest rate policy reform; (ii) assist the
government in increasing production capacity in the agricultural, industrial, services and
tourism sectors; and (iii) support TDB's institutional development. By design, the first
objective was part of the legal covenants under the Development Credit Agreement
(DCA). The second objective was to be achieved through providing long-term resources
for TDB to make term loans mainly to the private sector. The project did not have a
separate component focusing on the achievement of the third objective. The institutional
development of TDB was supported by an ADB technical assistance grant associated with
the fourth ADB project, which focused on loan portfolio and micro lending review,



-vi -
accounting and internal audit procedures preparation, IT system enhancement and staff
training.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.    The project was administered in accordance with the "Letter of Credit
Administration" between IDA and ADB dated August 29, 1990 (Attachment D). Under
the agreement, ADB would administer the IDA credit for and on behalf of IDA, together
with the ADB loan. The responsibilities of ADB included processing of subloans and
withdrawal applications, monitoring compliance with the legal and financial covenants,
undertaking supervision missions, providing supervision and progress reports, and
preparing project completion report. IDA fielded the appraisal mission concurrently with
ADB in June 1989, and conducted site visits in three joint supervision missions in
November 1993 and November 1994. The Project Appraisal Report was prepared by
ADB staff. Disbursements of the Credit proceeds were made based on tested telex from
ADB. Procurements were in compliance with ADB policies and procedures.
5.   In 1991 which was the first year of project implementation, the National Reserve
Bank of Tonga (NRB) adopted a market based interest rate structure to allow real deposit
and lending rates to be kept positive over the medium to long term. This was the
government commitment under the two legal covenants on interest rate reforms. From the
review of the ADB PCR and the project files, it is not clear if a third covenant requiring
the government to take the necessary measures to compensate TDB for all costs
associated with micro financing was in compliance.
6.    The Credit was on-lent by the government to TDB for 15 years including a grace
period of five years at a rate equivalent to ADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR) rate.
The government borne the direct foreign exchange risk on the Credit. The closing date of
the Credit was extended twice for a total of two years at the request of the government
and in conformation with ADB's decisions. The government's request for a third
extension was turned down by IDA after it consulted with ADB in January 1996. The
basis for the rejection was much slower utilization of the credit proceeds, and TDB's
violation of a number of key covenanted financial limits under the ADB project. When the
Credit was closed in December 1995, the disbursement ratio was 66 percent after two
cancellations. The last recovery of the Special Account balance took place in October
1996. ADB extended the closing date of its loan a third time to September 1996. The
disbursement ratio of the ADB loan was 79 percent.
7.    TDB was the project implementation agency. Its operational and financial
performance was found satisfactory at the time of Board approval, although it was noted
that the bank's profitability and portfolio quality might be overstated due to some
deficiencies in TDB's internal operating and accounting policies and procedures. IDA
received TDB confirmation before the negotiations that its Board had revised the income
recognition policy and the internal interest rate structure as remedies for the deficiencies.
At the time of the ADB project completion mission, however, TDB's financial position



- vii -
was found to be weak. The bank continued to accrue interest income until a borrower in
default became insolvent, or a legal action was filed. The collection ratio declined from 75
percent (ADB financial covenant limit) in 1989-90, to 65 percent in 1996. The hard-core
arrears, which included payments due when in arrears by 12 months or longer, amounted
to 14 percent as opposed to the 2.5 percent of the ADB covenanted limit. The loan loss
provisioning had been inadequate before 1997. There had also been reluctance to write
off the losses. TDB's operating costs were high due to the large share of micro financing
in the loan portfolio. All these became a persistent drain on the bank's profitability
especially in the latter part of the implementation period. The returns on equity
plummeted from 7 percent in 1989 to 1 percent in 1996, while the returns on total assets
from 2.6 percent to 0.3 percent. In 1997, TDB suffered a net loss after tax due to the
substantive increase in provisioning to make up for the previous shortfalls. TDB could
have difficulty meeting its short term obligations in the future, as the loan portfolio
deteriorated, the cash inflows from loans dropped, and most of the bank's external credit
lines closed.
8.    The PCR also attributed TDB's deteriorated financial performance to a number of
external factors. New Zealand and Australia, Tonga's main trade partners and donors,
experienced major recession/restructuring in the first part of the 1990s, leading to the
recession in Tonga. The expected high demand for squash in Japan did not materialize as
the Japanese economy remained dormant. The demand for tourism related services was
much weaker than projected in the government's 1986-90 five-year plan. The geographic
characters of Tonga also made the cost of tourism too high to allow a rapid growth of the
industry. Under these circumstances, many of TDB financed projects went sour. TDB's
difficulties were further compounded by the wide-spread practices of not honoring debt
services on time, and by the continued government interference in TDB's lending
decisions. TDB charged lowest rates on loans to government top priority sectors. The
practice of interest rate cross subsidies for micro lending was yet to be changed. TDB
was in violation of its own operations policies in the areas of sector exposure and foreign
exchange risk control due to government intervention.
9.    The estimated funding needs of TDB by ADB and IDA were based on the
government's 1986-90 five-year plan. As some of the major economic projections failed
to materialize, TDB had difficulty in fully utilizing the proceeds from the ADB loan and
the Credit. Under the credit administration arrangements, the Credit was to finance about
37 percent of a subloan. It co-financed a total of 2,105 subloans, of which only 8 was
above the free limit ofUS$50,000. The average subloan size was T$2,750 (US$2,100),
similar to the maximum size of micro loans TDB extended to small farmers (T$2,000) but
lower to that of micro loans to small village based businesses (T$5,000). Subloans with
maturity of up to one year accounted for 22 percent. The subloans financed projects for
building new or expanding existing production capacities, and those for technology
modernization and replacement. They were concentrated in agriculture (32 percent), and
services (55 percent) sectors, as opposed to the balanced sector distribution proposed in
the ADB Project Appraisal Report. This sectoral distribution was in line with that of
TDB's overall loan portfolio.



- viii -
10.   Among the 110 subloans (T$10,000 and above) reviewed by the ADB PCR
mission, 30 were in arrears and 4 subloans were rescheduled. Of the 47 fully repaid
subprojects, 37 remained operational. The ADB mission noted that the prevalent causes
for the financial difficulties were (i) lack of commitment by subborrowers including
inadequate equity contribution to the subprojects, (ii) absence of detailed market studies,
and (iii) lax supervision and monitoring. Detailed subloan characteristics and performance
can be found in Annex C. To evaluate the project impact on the real sector, the ADB
mission reviewed export sales of the first two years, incremental value, incremental
employment, and investment cost per job of the 110 subprojects. The project was said to
have generated sufficient economic benefits to the economy through incremental
employment and foreign exchange earnings, and assistance to women and outer islands
development.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
11.   The project achieved its first objective of implementing interest rate reforms as the
NRB adopted a market based interest rate structure shortly after the inception of the
project. The project implementation was partially satisfactory in providing long term
funding for the economic growth, especially in the outer islands. Viewed from the
perspective of subproject sustainability, the project performance was not satisfactory. The
long term viability of TDB was uncertain unless decisive actions were taken soon. The
government would need to adopt policies for a better economic and business environment
for commercial banking. It should increase private sector and banking specialists
presentation in TDB's Board, and grant TDB full autonomy in lending decisions. TDB
should overhaul its credit processing and risk control practices. It should also enforce
accounting and financial reporting systems that are compatible to the international
accounting standards. Except one delinquency in servicing IDA debt and several delays in
submitting project audit reports, the government was in compliance with its legal
obligations. TDB complied with the covenant on debt equity ratio and debt service rate,
but failed to fully honor the other covenants.
12.   IDA's performance was not satisfactory even though it authorized ADB to
monitor and supervise the project on its behalf The funding projections for the longer
term funding requirements of the Tonga economy in 1990s failed to consider the imminent
external shocks. The free limit of US$ 50,000 for the prior review of subprojects was too
high given the average size of the loans in TDB's portfolio. The inputs in the project
supervision were inadequate for a line of credit operation implemented by a development
bank. Some of the key information like covenants compliance some times were entered in
the management information systems 2-3 years later. On the positive side, the decision
not to extend the Credit for a third time was a good step once it became clear that the
demand for further funding was weak. The overall project outcomes were rated as
unsatisfactory.



- ix -
13.   As a typical financial intermediation lending (FIL) operation, the project offers the
following lessons:
(a)    A FIL operation may achieve limited sectoral policy objectives if the
borrower is committed to the specific objectives and does not have many
options for mobilizing long term funding sources.
(b)    FILs are ineffective in introducing commercial banking practices to
financial intermediaries which in nature are government policy banks.
(c)    Sound market analysis of potential long term funding demand in an
economy is essential in designing an effective FIL operation.
(d)   While technical assistance in the areas of credit manual, accounting
procedures and IT systems are necessary, the bottom line for a sound
subloan is market based, realistic sales/revenue projections.
(e)    Even as a non-leading co-lender, IDA should be more proactive in project
preparation and supervision to ensure the cost-effectiveness in terms of the
project's economic outcomes, as well as the staff inputs.

I.    BACKGROUND
A.    History
1.           The Tonga Development Bank (TDB) was established under the Tonga
Development Bank Act of 1977 and began operations on 1 September 1972.1 It is 96.3
prcent owned by the Govemment with the remainder owned by the Ffank of Tonga
(BOT), a commercial bank. The Govemmenfs equity contrbution to TDB was financed
mainly by grants from bilateral donors, primarily Australia and New Zealand (NZ)
Overseas Development Assistance (NZODA) (para. 9). TDB has an authorized capital
of T$14 million, of which T$9.8 million was paid up as of 31 December 1998.
2.           TDB  is govemed  by an eight-member Board - of Directors. The
Govemment has a close working relatonship with TDB, and TDB generally conforms to
the economic priorties set by the Govemment. Within this framework, TDB has some
degree of autonomy in its daily operations, including providing valuable contributions to
policy decisions, notably TDB's issuance of its promissory notes and bonds at market-
determined interest rates.
3,           Bank suppon to the pnvate sector in Tonga has been channeled
primarily through TDB. The Bank has provided three credit lines to TDB. The first loan,:
approved in 1978 was almost fully utilized. The loan was accompanied by a technical
assistance (TA) grant3 aimed at strengthening the institutional capability of TDB. The
Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) completed in March 1986 rated the project
as partly successful. The second and third Bank loans' were intended to support
industrial and agricultural development by providing foreign currency resources to
productive enterprises, and to strengthen TDB institutionally. Associated TA5 grants
were aimed at improving loan appraisal and administration, and accounting and
personnel management. Both projects were reporled to be effectively implemented,
and a PPAR completed in November 1991 rated them as generally successfully. In
September 1988, the Govemment requested the Bank for its fourth loan to help TDB
meet the increased demand for deveiopment finance in Tonga, and a TA grant of
USS328,000 to support institutional strengthening and projected expansion of TDO's
activities. A loan for USS5 million equivalent was approved on 21 November 1989 and
became effective on 20 July 1990.
4.           The Project, cofinanced by the Bank (USS5 million equivalent) and the
International Development Association (IDA) (US$3 million equivalent), was intended to
provide TOB with US$8 million equivalent, to finance eligible subprojects in agriculture,
manufacturing, tourism, and services. The basic objective of the Project was to promote
specific medium- and long-term development investments on a small and medium scale
I     The establishment of TOB was assisted under the Bank-funded TA No. 174-TON:Development
and Finance Corporation, for USS240,000. approved on 22 July 1978.
2     Loan No. 376-TON(SF): Tongs Deveiopment Bank, for USS1.5 million, approved on 7 December
1978. The loan was closed in June 1983.
TA No. 265-TON: Tonga Dovelopment Bank, for USS88,000, approved on 7 December 1978.
Loan No. 624-TON( SF): Second Tonga Development Bank, for USSI million, approved on 26 April
1983; and Loan No. 782,TON(SF): Third Tongs Development Bank, for USS1 million, approved on
19 June 1986. Loan No. 624 was closed in December 1987 and Loan No. 782 in June 1989.
TA No. 610-TON: Tonga Deveiopmeni Bank, for USS'3S,000, approved on 26 April 1983; and TA
No. 777.TON: Tonga Deveopment Bank, for US$160,000. approved on 19 June 1986.

that have economic and commercial merit, and contribute to the continued institutional
strengthening of TOB in fulfilling its developmental role. The Bank administered both
facilities, which have been disbursed at the ratio of 62.5 percent (Bank) and 37.5
percent (IDA Credit - 2084).
S.   Scop6 bf Operations
5.          The TDB Act of 1977 and TDB's Statement of Operating Policiees
empower TDB to undertake a full range of lending, advisory, and equity investment
activities normally associated with a development finance institution (DP-I). In addition,
other activities are permitted, including accepting deposits: issuing guarantees;
underwriting loans; and issuing, endorsing, and negotiating financial instruments. In
1993, TDB started to issue its own bonds and promissory notes to help finance squasri
production and exports to Japan. Since 1994, resources mobilized by this means have
become an increasingly imponant component on TDB's balance sheei.
6.          The introduction of the Financial lnstitutions Act in 1991 and the
consequent entry of two new commercial banks in 1993 dramatically changed the
scope and operating environment of TDB. Until 1993, there were only two lendin,
irmstitutions in Tonga: BOT and TMS. Traditionally the credit facility provided by the BOT
was for short-term financing in the pnvate sector, and that of TDB for medium to long-
term, risky development financing both in the private and public sector,' as well &a
microlending for the rural areas, women's groups, and disadvantaged groups. TDB, in
recognizing the emergence of this competitive environment and its financial impact on
TDB's future sustainability, developed appropriate strategies by raising funds through
issuance of its own short-term promissory notes and long-term Govemment-guaranteed
bonds, as well as launching a savings mobilization scheme for the Niuas in 1995. VI
1994, TDB ventured into commercial housing loans and provided an overdraft facility as
an incentive to retain its good customers and to increase its loan portfolio (para. 455
Although the market condibons and the preferences of the clients have been changing
rapidly in the recent past, TDB has not been able to initiate institutional reforms to be in
line with the new trends, partly because of (i) Govemment regulations goveming TOES:
(ii) lack of Govemment and aid funds to support TDB's expansion plans: and ( ii
uncertainty about TDB's capacity to expand and perform well in new areas. n
response, in September 1997 the Bank approved a TA2 to study the strategic
repositioning of TOB for the five years 1998-2002, in line with the reality of te,
condition of TOBs operating environment and to determine if TDB could be operated al
arm's length from the Govemment, and/or as one that is restructured along business
principles to undertake development and commercial banking simuitaneously.
7.          The provision of loan finance is the primary means by which TDB fulfili-
its role, with only seven equity investments made to date. In addition, business advice
is provided to individual borrowers as well as to the general public. This applies
particularly in the outer islands, where workshops for potental entrepreneurs and
borrowers is continuously being provided. In 1995, a nascent savings mobilization
scheme targeted at the outer islands was established. In 1996, a venture capital fund
Loan 990 financed one Government borrowing for the intemational Dateline Hotel.

scheme was established with Australian Goverment assistance, targeted at private
sector projects that cannot access equity funding from commercial sources, but are
considered financially sound to service their debts.
C.   Relationship with the Bank and Other Lender
8.          The Bank has a long and close association wvth TSD. The Bank
contributed to the original study that led to the establishment of TDB in 1977, and has
since provided it with four loans from the Asian Development Fund resources, totaling
US$8.5 million equivalent, and six TA grants including current TA No. 2855; totaling
US$1.2 million. The first loan by the Bank (US$1.5 million), was TDB's first intemationai
loan. The second and third loans of US$1 million each were combined vwith other Bank
projects and cofinanced by the Intematonal Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
of US$1 million, and IDA of US$2 million, respectively. Associated with the initial three
loans were TA provided for (i) establishment and initial operation of TDB; (ii) training in
economic evaluation; and (iii) computerizaton of the accounting, and review of
personnel management and management informaton systems. Overall, the Bank's
institutional strengthening and funding support to TDB has closely complemented, and
benefited from, the other bilateral and aid agencies' assistance.
9.         Australia and NZODA have provided significant support for private sector
activity through TDB. NZODA has injected 49 percent of TDB's total equity, Australia 32
percent, and the Govemment 15 percent through borrowing from the European
Investment Bank (EI9). Australian and NZODA assistance have effectively
compiemented the Bank's loan funding to TDB and include staffing, and support to
TDB's outer island activities, growth of its lending operations, women in development,
venture capital financing, and financing of computer equipment and software. TDB also

Forum Secretariat, Australian Executive Service Overseas Program, American Peace
Corps, British Overseas Development Assistance, and the Association of Development
Financing Institutions in the Pacific. Accordingly, close coordination between aid
agencies has been appropriate and effective in supporting TSB.
10.        The Bank loan was made to the Govemment of Tonga, with an
amortization peniod of 40 years, a grace period of 10 years. and a service charge of I
percent per annum. The loan was relent by the Govemment to TOB at an interest rate
equivalent to the Bank's prevailing ordinary capital resources - -unded up to the nearest
0.5 percent for 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years. , he foreign exchange risk
on the loan is bonme by the Govemment. TOB is one of the few Pacific DFIs to have
access to several altemative extemal official sources of loans including the local BOT.
For domestic funding. TDB has, over the past 4-5 years, actively issued its own
promissory notes and bonds at market-determined rates as an important funding base.
This new source has enabled TDB to expand its loan portfolio while repaying term debt.
0.   Rationale for the Bank Loan
11.        The rationale for the fourth Bank loan was to support the objectives of
the Govemment's Fifth Five-Year Plan (FYP) and assist the Govemment in further
stimulating productive investments through financing activities in agriculture, industry,



4
services, and toufism. The loan was to further promote the role of the private sector
and contribute to regional and rural development Accordingly, the Bank loan was
intended to (i) provide tDB wih financial resources to meet the increased demand for
development finance in the country, and (ii) promote specific medium- and long-term
development projects on a small and medium scale that have ec-onomic and
commercial menrt
12.         TDB played a pioneering role in supportng agriulture, fishing, tourism,
and microfinance at a time when Tonga lacked development finance. A major
contribution by TDB was its role in financing squash production and exports to Japan,
developing Tonga's financial sector through its issuance of promissory notes and
bonds, creating a nascent savings mobilization scheme for the outer islands, assisting
womens' activities, and being the sole provider of microfinance. TDB has the most
extensive geographic representation of any of the banks in Tonga with a total of five
branches and representabive offices, having acquired the lending and savings portfolio
of BOT on the distant Niuas. Accordingly, the Govemment sees TDB as playing a
pivotal role in the economic and social development of the country within the
Govemment's overall pJans and strategies, by helping to promote and finance
commercially and economically viable projects in the private sector.
13.         Associated with the fourth loan was TA No. 1230-TON to the TDB to (i)
review the loan portfolio, (ii) review policies for microlending, (iii) review and update

provide extemal staff training. The TA was Intended to runner strengthen and
consolidate the institutional capabilities of TDB, thereby enhancing its role in promoting
economic development activities (para. 60)
II.   IMPLEMENTATION
A.    Lending Policies
14.         TDE's lending policies are govemed by its Statement of Operational
Policies. The Statement has been continually revised in the recent past by the Board as
the detailed Statement of Operational Policies, Basic Lending Guidelines, and
Prudential Guidelines (Appendix 1). The latest revision has substantially retained the
content of the previous Policy Statement, but has further clarified parameters on sector
exposure limits, rescheduling, etc., and presents the material in a more useful form. In
addition, reference is also made to the Managers Lending Guide and intemal Audit
Policies and Practices Manual. These documents emphasize the developmental role of
TDB and define the scope of its operations, general policies and procedures, and
appropriate guidelines for banking activities and intemal and extemal audit. TDB has
closely adhered to the procedures established in the Policy Statement and manuals,
except at times when occasional breaches have been experienced (para. 15).
15.         TDB's Policy Statement and Guidelines limit loan commitments in the
form of loans, equity investment, and guarantees to any specific industry to no more
than 25 percent of TDB's paid-up capital and reserves. In addition, TDB's total
commitment to any one single enterprise will not exceed 10 percent of TDB's paid-up
capital and reserves. TDB will not carry any foreign exchange risk on its borrowings and



5
will maintain a provision for bad debts based on a separate provision policy, after an
assessment of Its outstanding loans, equity investments, and guarantees, to be
undertaken at least annually. TDB has generally adhered to its Policy Statement and
Guidelines, except that the effectiveness and value of the prudential policies and
guidelines has _been undermined due to two breaches. First TDB is excessively
exposed to tth squash, vanilla, tourism, housing, and construction subsectors, partly
because the prudential guidelines allow the Board to approve loans in excess of the
prescribed limt where it is considered that such breaches are justfied and do not
impose excessive risk tor TDB. While arguments have been advanced in support of this
excessive sector lending, TDB has not taken cognizance of the resultant negative
impact this has on the institution's future long-term profitability and sustainabilit (para.
46). Secondly. TDB is incurring the foreign exchange risks on a US-denominated 1995
loan for USS1.5 million from Caisse Francaise dt Development, which fully exposes
lOB to exchange risk (para. 52). It is understood that the Govemment will assume the
foreign exchange risk, but to date, this issue remains unresolved.
16.         The interest rate structure for lending is determined by interest rate
reviews undertaken by TDB. Between 1990 and 1996, TDB implemented two interest
rate reviews (Appendix 2) and in 1995 a review of fees. Primary considerations are the
maintenance of interest rates in line with comparable lending by other financial
institutions, where applicable, together with the cost ;, funds and impact on profitability.
TOB revised its interest rate downward by about 0.5-1 percent on all sectors in
September 1992 and June 1994 following a detailed review of the Government's
sectoral priorities, and because of the competitive nature of Tonga's banking
environment (parm. 17). TD8 introduced a three-tiered interest rate structure based on
priority sectors and included (i) a standard rate reflecting the cost of lending for a
particular sector in accordance with Govemment priorties, (ii) a prime rate that is 1
percent less than the standard rate to reward good borrowers and to encourage repeat
borrowers; and (iii) a 1 percent annual penalty rate as an incentive to customers to pay
accounts on time. The lowest interest rates have been charged on loans provsded to
top priority sectors for economic development such as small and large agiculture
projects, export- and tourism-related industries, and raw materal processing.
Wholesale/retail, services, and the majority foreign-owned ventures are a low priority
and attract a higher rate, Discretion is also given to management to vary the rates on
existing loans at the time of intemal review or when considering additional loan
approval. Overall, while TDB's interest rate structure appears to be in line with market
rates, the implicit rates for top priority sectors are on average 1 percent below market
rates.
17.         With the entry of two commercial banks in 1993, TOB's competitiveness
became restricted with a ascline in TDB's lending market share. Prior to 1993, TOB had
the largest market share tor agriculture, and industry and business lending, out in 1995,
TDB lost its dominant position for industry and business lending with its shlare of
outstanding loan balances against total domestic bank lending deciining fror TS16
million in 1995 to TS15 million in 1996, while the market share of the commercial oanks
increased from T$18 million to TS20 million, respectively. Between 1994 and 1996,
TOB's outstanding loan balance as a percentage of total bank lending declined at a
diminishing rate from 48 percent (1994) to 39 percent (19g6), while the share of the
commercial banks steadily increased from 52 percent (1994) to 61 percent (1996).

B.   Characteristcs of Subloans
18.         The fourth Bank loan to TDB, net of cancellation, utilized T$5.8 million
(USS4.5 million equivalent) to finance 2,105 subprojects, disbursed over a six-year
period instead of the normal three-year commitment period and four-yeardisbursement
period. The disbursement ratio on dosure of the loan was 79 percent Of the 2,105
subprojects, eight (0.4 percent by number) for a total amount of TS1.0 million (18
percent by value) were above the free limit of USS50,000. The remaining 2,097
subprojects (99 percent by number) for T54.8 million (82 percent by value) wem below
the free limit. The subprojects above the free limit were distributed fairly eventy among
the main productive segments of the private sector, namely agriculture, industy and
manufacturing. tourism and services. The main characteristics of the subprjects in
terms of their size, sectoral distribution, geographical distribution, purpose, maturity,
and other criteria are shown in the Basic Data (pages iii- iv).
19.         Of the total subprojects financed, 2,043 (97 percent by number and 70
percent by value) were below T$10,000. Overall, subloan size averaged T$2,752 and
ranged from T$1,000 to T$183,786. The high proportion of small subloans meant that
this was costly for TD9 to administer. It also reflected the relatively underdeveloped
nature of the private sector and the dominant role of the Govemment in the economy,
thereby limiting opportunities for economies of scale to be realized.
20.         At appraisal it was envisaged that TDB would achieve a balanced
distribution of subloans to the main economic sectors that are important for the
country's development. The actual sectoral allocation showed a skewed trend, A large
proportion of the Bank's loan proceeds supported service-related projects (55 percent),
followed by agriculture (32 percent), industry and manufacturing (7 percent), and
tourism (7 percent). On tne contrary, the distribution of subloans from the Bank loan is
not reflective of TDB's overall distribution of loan approvals (para. 42), which shows
that agriculture dominated approvals from 1990-1996 (67 percent). The variation is
explained by the restrictions on the Bank and IDA credit lines as to which subloans are
eligible for financing. Seasonal and short-term working finance for squash and vanilla
are ineligible, and this has limited TDB's utilization of the credit facilities. But due to the
crops' commercial importance and at the Govemment's directive, TDB aggressively
notes to raise short- and long-term funds (para. 48). Despite the difficulties it faced with
the squash sector. TDB's involvement in funding the development of the squash
industry is to be commended as it enabled achievement of the Govemment's 5th FYP
sector development objectives: to encourage private sector involvement in commercial
crop development. Included under the agriculture sector is fishing, and while fishing is a
major activity both for home consumption and export, little progress was achieved in
realizing the potential of the fishing industry at the national level, partly due to the high
cost structure involving fishing ventures and lack of infrastructure development to
support marketing.
21.         The services sector included financing of transport vehicles and
business activities such as retail, wholesale, and general services. The average loan
size was TS3,161 reflecting relatively small-scale investment. Transport recorded the
highest number and volume of lending (45 percent) following the Govemment's



7
deregulaton of the market in 1993 to import recondifioned vehicles from Japan.
Accordingly, most of the transport subloans were for taxis, buses, and reiated transport
serices. The demand for industry- and manufacturing-related activities was quite
depressed under the fourth loan primarily because the expected suppont facilities for
the development of industrial estate and promotion of the indusra development
incentives policy by the Government lost momentum in the early 1990s. Compounding
the problem was the major restructuring/recession being expenenced in NZ and
AustraUa, then Tonoa's major trading partners, which affected Tonga's reltive
advantage in maintaining its trade/export privileges under the South Pacific Regional
Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement. Consequently, the expected widening of
the economic base and growth contribution of the industry sector to the economy's
gross domestic product were limited. Lending for tourism projects was quite low
compared with appraisal projections due to external and internal factors. Extemaly, the
economic recession in Tonga and between its major trading partners in the early 1990s
affected the growth of tourism, and the high cost structure deterred potential investors
from investing in the country. The Project Completion Review (PCR) Mission leamed
that many of the hotelsiresorts under construction at the time of appraisal are either in
financial difficulties, andlor are realizing that they are not providing what the market
needs. Intemally, Tonga's airline links with the outside world are limited and expensive.
Moreover, Govemment policy has not been supportive of developing the tourist
infrastructure to complement the service. Notwithstanding the skewed sectoral
distribution, the PCR Mission considers that the loan proceeds have supported
investment in some key economic sectors that are important for the country's
development, albeit for a longer period than envisaged at appraisal.
22.         A wide geographical distribution of subprojects was achieved, with 79
percent by value in Tongatapu. - the seat of the Kingdom and the main center of
business and commerce - and 21 percent in the outer islands. Compared with the
three previous Bank loans. the fourth loan has actually made a significant contribution
to supporting investment and development of the outer islands. While the risk of
lenoing to the ouier ibiatiu* .A i*tsl,, ik %pila  9vvd P4;c
portfolio. Apart from BOT. which has an office in Vavau, TDB has established branch
offices in all the five outer islands and acquired the BOT lending and savings portfolio
in the distant Niuas, reflecting TDB's commitment to support economic and social
development of the economy. While the commercial banks were reluctant to lend to
people in the outer islands in the absence of good security and the high costs involved
in monitoring projects, TDB accepted the challenge by increasing its presence in all the
outer islands and is well placed to assist with the development of the private sector
there. The IFAD facility and the NZ bilateral assistance have also complemented the
Bank/IDA credit lines in targeting women, small fafmers, fisherfolk, group borrowers,
and rural enterprises in the outer islands at a cheaper borrowing cost, who otherwise,
would not have been eligible for credit facilities from the commercial banks.
23.         The maturity of subloans ranged from one to more than five years.
Thirty-two percent of the loan proceeds was relent for terms of between one and three
years, reflecting the short- to medium-term nature of most subprojects, while 46 percent
was relent for terms of between three and five years and of more than five years to
finance long-term fixed assets. The latter supports the promotion of specific medium-
and long-tern development projects on a small and medium scale that have economic
and commercial ment. Twenty-two percent of the total loan proceeds was relent for



8
terms maturing within one year, and the proceeds from these subloans enabled
refinancing of other subprojects.
24.         The loan proceeds were fairly distributed to support expansion of
^'S^', "t'~9--              .-               ; ~'^   =.lt-.'  ^;   '' v, -  -  ai.nGad.;ain
replacement for T$1.9 million (32 percent), and establishment of new subprojects for
T$1.3 million (23 percent). The PCR Mission views this as satistactory performance for
Tonga, as the Bank loan directly assisted the start-up costs of new businesses, in line
with the loan objective of promoting the role of the pnvate sector. Most of the new
subprojects were in the service (business, transport), agriculture, and industry sectors.
25.         Associated with the objective of promoting the development of the
private sector and outer islands is the encouragement of women in business and
development. The fourth loin financed 56 subprojects (3 percent by number and 3
percent by value) managed by women as the direct borrower and entrepreneur.
Although utilization was low, this is considered an achievement given that the three
previous Bank loans were not directed at assisting women's activities. Also
complementing the Bank/IDA credit facilities were IFAD's cheap credit line and NZ
bilateral grant assistance that targeted women's activities and rural credit for small
borrowers. The latter two sources were vigorously utilized by TDB because of their cost
effectiveness and flexible disbursement procedures regarding local costs financing vis-
6-vis the Bank's foreign exchangellocal currency costs allocation. Most loans to
individuals required two people to be associated with the loan, and this normally
required the husband and wife signing the loan documents, either as joint borrowers or
one as the guarantor. In the outer islands, women have successfully managed
businesses such as handicrafts, retail projects, vegetable farm and associated produce
sale, taxi operation, and tounsm operation. Women borrowers form a core of TDB's
good customers.
C.    Implementation and Intemal Operation of Subprojects
1.    Implementation Status
26.         All subprojects with loan amounts of T$10,000 and above (5 percent by
number and 38 percent by value) were selected for analysis, representing each sector
and purpose. For a detailed review of the subproject analysis by implementation status,
see Appendix 3; by financial performance, see Appendix 4; and by economic
performance, see Appendix 5.
27.           At the time of the PCf Mission in April 1998, most of the 110
subprojects were fully implemented. Appendix 3 gives the implementation status of the
110 subprojects with subloan size of T$10,000 and above. The total actual cost of
these 110 subprojects was T$7.65 million, 0.5 percent higher than the T$7.6 million
estimated at subproject appraisal. Two subprojects had cost overruns of less than 8
percent due to an extension of the contract and undercosting of the subproject, while
another had minimal savings in investment costs. This performance is considered
satisfactory.



9
28.         Of the 11G subprojacis financred, I 3 are complete, and one.is yet to be
completed. Of the completed subprojects, one subproject for the construction of a
building was completed eight months behind schedule due to a change of the architect,
while the construction of an intensland cargo and passenger vessel was delayed by
one month due to the delay in signing the contract The uncompleted subproject is for
the construction of a 18-unit apartment motel expected to be completed in July 1998,
about 18 months behind schedule. The owner operates a construction company and is
using his construction company to build the motel in between his other jobs. The
associated cost overrun is bome by the owner and was not known at the time of PCR
visit.
29.         Of the total expenditure of T$7.65 million incurred in financing the 110
subprojects, TDB financed TS3.5 million (46 percent) from the Bank/IDA credit lines;
TS1.35 million (18 percent) was from the TDM's internal resources; and TS2.8 milron
(36 percent) was provided by subborrowers. Of the 110 subloans, 62 percent- by value
were for service projects, 19 percent for agriculture, 16 percent for tourism, and 3
percent for industry and manufacturing. In addition, the Bank loan financed the
establishment of 48 new businesses for TS3.0 million, which stimulated private sector
investment, and 62 subprojects involved expansion of existing businesses for TS4.65
million.

basis, using standard commercial procedures. For the larger subprojects, quotations
were obtained based on technical specifications. In a few cases involving the purchase
of secondhand vehicles and/or equipment, the Bank required engineers' certificates as
to suitability, condition, and price reasonableness. The main sources of supply were
Japan (53 percent), NZ (24 percent), Australia (13 percent), United States (4 percent),
and others (6 percent). The Mission found that the procurement procedures utilized by
the subborrowers were generally in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for DFI
loans, with all procurement from the Bank's member countries.
2.    Financial and Economic Performance of Subprojects
31.        Appendix 4 summarizes the financial performance of 110 subprojects
with balances of TS10,000 and above. Bank lending was intended to provide
assistance for sustaining the economic and financial viability of subprojects, thereby
contributing to the development of the country's private sector. In assessing the long-
term sustainability of subprojects, the PCR Mission visited a few large-sized projects on
Tongatapu, reviewed prospects of the 110 subprojects (i.e., if business is ongoing, in
difficulty, and/or closed down), repayment status, and the profitability growth of the first
two years. As of 30 April 1998, 47 subprojects were fully repaid, repayments on 29
subprojects were on schedule, repayments on 30 subprojects were in arrears, and 4
subprojects were rescheduled. Of the 47 fully repaid subprojects. five subborrowers
have transferred their accounts to the commercial banks but their businesses remain
operational, four entrepreneurs have closed down their operations, the prospect of one
subproject is unknown, and 37 subprojects remain operational. Of the 29 subprojects
whose repayments are on schedule, their businesses are ongoing, except that 6
subborrowers accounts were transferred to the Task Force unit as they are
experencing difficulties. The 30 subprojects in arrears are either experiencing



10
difficulties and/or are under legal action. The PCR Mission noted that TDB has been
weak In promptly taking legal action on its hard-core arrears clients. This perhaps
emanates from the board s relatively accommodative approach to borrowers who have
had a less than perfect track record by continuing to refinance their subprojects with the
hope that their business will tum around, and ineffectiveness of TDB's_lgal staff to
promptly pursto legal action on delinquent borrowers. The most prevalent causes for
projects bing in financtal difficulty are (i) loss of interest by subborrowers. due to other
prorities, (ii) absence of a detailed market study ot nonagriculture sectors to determine
potential cash flow and linking the subprojects cash flow to its sustainability, (iil) poor
appraisal quality, (iv) ad hoc project supervision and monitonng, (v) inadequate equity
contribution by subborrowers, and (vi) weak business management.
32.         Lending for tourism  projects has been marginally profitable with
uncertain sustainability. The problem has been compounded by the lack of Govemment
policy and support in implementing its tounsm mastefplan and marketing strategies,
and the lack of infrastructure development to support tourist services, such as
increasing airline capacity and routes, providing an enabling environment to allow
foreign investors to buy land to. build tourism projects, etc. Included under Bank
financing was the refurbishment of a Govemment-owned hotel, now experiencing cash
flow problems due to poor management and poor quality services. From the review of
the files, it was apparent that TDB had been aware of the hotel's poor management for
some time, but did not initiate concrete action to either change management and/or
promptly institute legal action. Instead, TDB rescheduled the account but loan
repayment remains irregular. This experience has highlighted the risks of
accommodating clients with arrears history, TDB's leniency in effecting change of
management, and potential conflict that can anse from the DFI's involvement in a
Govemment-owned project.
33.         During the first year of operation, only 16 subprojects achieved or
exceeded their sales projections, and 94 fell below the projections. In the second year,
13 exceeded them, and 97 performed below the estimates. Total net profits generated
in the first year amounted to TS1.2 million or 61 percent of the projected T$1.9 million.
In the second year, total profits realized were TS1.3 million or 67 percent of the
projected T$2 million. The main reasons for subprojects performing below estimates
were (i) the lack of subborrower commitment to the project; (ii) relatively high cost
structures and shortage of working capital; (iii) untargeted marketing efforts for tourism,
fishing, and industry projects: and (iv) weak management.
34.        In terms of the economic efficiency and productivity of subprojects
(Appendix 5), 19 companies were engaged in exports. Export receipts from these
subprojects in the first two years amounted to T$1.4 million and T$2 million,
respectively. These were 50 percent and 76 percent respectively. Incremental
employment created benefited 521 persons of whom 27 percent were women. The
average actual investment cost per ijob for the 110 subprojects was approximately
TS14,679, considered relatively high for Tonga because of the limited economies of
scale and the labor-intensive nature of most businesses. The actual incremental value
added was T$3.4 million, 19 percent below the projected figure of T$4.2 million.
Overall, the Project generated sufficient economic benefits to the Tongan economy
through employment, foreign exchange eamings from export companies, and
assistance to women and outer islands development.

D.   Operational Performance of TOM
1.    Organization, Management, and Staffing
35.        Appendix 6 provides an outline of TDB's organization structure as of 31
December 1996. There is a managing-director (MO) as chief executive, and two deputy
managing directors (IDOMs): one for operations and one for finance and corporate
services. An Internal Audit Unit, established in 199i and staffed by suitable and
experienced personnel, is operating effectively, thereby meeting a long-standing Bank
requirement. The intemal auditor and a technical adviser appointed under NZODA, with
responsibility for strengthening arrears and portfolio management procedures within
TDB, reports to the MO. The organiation structure was last revised in Apil 1998 but a
significant development occurred in 1992 with the (i) establishment of the Personnel
and Training Division to combine the rote of the Staff Training Unit with the personnel
management function, which had previously been handled by the Administration
Division; and (ii) the setting up of five management committees to oversee the audit,
credit, finance, staff, and systems functions. The committee members include senior
managers and mid level managers and meet regularly to review, discuss, and soJve
important issues. A Human Resource Development Plan prepared under NZODA in
1994 included the (i) implementation of job descrptions for all staff, (ii) review of salary
and benefits structure, (iii) implementation of a new performance appraisal system, and
(iv) preparation of future training needs. The Plan strengthened TDB's training and
personnel management.
36.        TDB has widely penetrated the market with the establishment of its
permanent offices in all of the five outer islands, and a head office in Nukualofa. The
outer island representative offices are reasonably staffed and fully furnished, each
headed by a manager who reports directly to the DMD-Operations at head office.
37.        Overall direction and guidance of TOB's activities is provided by the
Board wlth eight members, seven of whom are appointed by the Govemrnment including
the MD, director of agriculture and forestry, and two prvate sector officials, with the
eighth member from BOT. The minister of finance is automatically appointed as the
chairperson of the Board, with the minister of labor, commerce and industries appointed
as permanent deputy chairperson. Concerns have been raised in the past regarding
potential conflict of interest arising from the participation of the BOT general manager
on the Board. In 1992, TDB requested the Govemment to consider buying out BOTS
shares in TDB, but no decision has yet been taken. The PCR Mission considers that a
board with a more diverse group of directors with diverse backgrounds. and in
particular, stronger private sector/business representation could be more effective in
balancing the sometimes conflicting policy issues.
38.        At the time of PCR Mission, the incumbent managing director who is an
indigenous Tongan, announced his resignation, effective 1 May 1998, after almost
eight years as chief executive of TDB. He was a career agricultural specialist before he
joined TDB in 1977 and worked his way through to initially become the acting MC
between 1988 and 1990, and was confirmed MD in 1991. Setween 1991 and 1994, the
MD was supported by an intemational DMO-Finance and Economic Development



12
(FED), funded under Australian staffing assistance (para. 40), who had a major impact
on introducing new skills and experience to TDB in genral management and policy
decisions, as well as specfic areas such as treasury, planning and economic research,
personnel and training, and intemal audit The provision of other intemational advisers
by bilateral, muItilateral, and other financing agencies in the areas of-management
information system (MIS), business advisory services, intemral audit, and lending have
considerably strengthened TOD's senior management over the years (Appendix 7 gives
major milestone events).
2.    Personnel Administration
39.         TDB has 158 staff members, 112 are based at head office and 46 in the
outer islands offices, as of 31 December 1998. Fifty-one percent of the total staff are
women, with four women holding managerial positions at the head office.
40.         The overall quality of TDB staff is generally good with 26 percent of the
staff having professional academic qualifications, but the bulk of the staff below middle
management require further skills training. In the past, TDB benefited from two
intemational staff on long-term appointments in line positions. The position of DM0-
FED was occupied by an experienced banker under the Australian staffing assistance
for four years (1991.1994), another year as management adviser, overseeing project
implementation work for the Outer Isiand Credit Project funded by IFAD, as well as
providing general management advice to the newly appointed DMD-FED (para. 41).
Two MIS managers, provided under the Australian staffing scheme for four years,
implemented TDB's new computer software and helped improved the MIS. In addition,
NZODA funded three loans/business advisers who were responsible for setting up the
systems, procedures, and training of problem account management. TDB also
benefited from several extemal advisers, of whom 14 were American Peace Corps
members in the areas of intemal audit, business advisory, and accounting; two
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation training advisers; one Australian
Executive Service Overseas Program legal adviser; and one British Overseas
Development Assistance economist.
41.         As the institution matured and staff skills developed, TDB was able to
replace the intemational DM0-FED intemally in 1994, although some reallocation of
functions had to be made to reduce the initial workload on the new appointee. The
arrangement provided a valuable transition period for the intemational ex-DMD-FED
and his replacement, enabling the position to be localized, while still allowing input and
guidance as necessary from the intemational staff. In the past, TDB staff strength
suffered from high tumover (Appendix 8), which affected the overall efficiency of the
institution and continuity of staff. This was noticeable at the time of the entry of two
commercial banks in 1994. Some of the staff holding managerial positions are
considered to be experienced and suitably qualified, but some lack the application to
make informed decisions and/or are reluctant to make decisions. It is also observed
that comprehensive training programs have been developed over the years, which the
Mission considers satisfactory. However, given the rapid changes of TDB's operating
environment and the high rate of staff tumover, further training needs to be directed at
strengthening project appraisal skills, project monitoring and supervision, and new
activities such as venture capital financing and capital market operations.

3.    Lending Operatons
42.         An analysis of TDB's lending operations by sector, size of loan, location,
and maturityjrom 31 December 1990 to 1996 is provided In Appendix 9, In the seven
years ending on 31 December 1996, TDB recorded a 5.2 percent annual average
growth rate. This penod included very high lending approvals of TS23.8 million in 1994
due to vigorous lending to squash and vanilla, followed by a strong contraction in the
subsequent two years. In addition, a substantial increase (111 percent) was recorded in
1994 to industry and business due to an increase in construction activities compared
with 1993. Between 1995 and 1996, lending approvals progressively declined partly
due to TDB's efforts to control its exposure to the squash sector following a market
setback in 1994 due to poor harvest, low yield, and oversupply that lowered the price.
Also, the impact of extemal factors, such as the entry of two commercial banks in late
1993, squeezed TDB's lending market share. The competitive banking environment
was exacerbated by the lack of investment demands, the absence of bankable
projects. and the economic recession between Tonga and its major trading partners,
which affected TDB's lending performance. Despite the macroeconomic difficulties,
TDB achieved its lending growth solely through the financing of squash and vanilla.
contrary to expectations envisaged at appraisal that the Govemment would develop
Tonga's tourist market, encourage development of small industry centers, and promote
economic trade with major trading partners: this necessitated the availability of project
finance from TDB.
43.         A fair proportion of TDB's lending approvals (24 percent by value and 42
percent by number) was directed to subprojects in the outer islands and 76 percent (58
percent by number) approved in Tongatapu, reflecting the concentration of business
activities on the main island. About 25 percent of TDB's approvals (79 percent by
number) were for amounts less than TS2,000 with average subloan sizes of TS846,
while 39 percent by value (0.3 percent by number) were for amounts greater than
T$50,000, reflecting the limited large-scale investments for financing and the high costs
of administering small-sized subloans. Subloans relent for terms of up to two years
accounted for 67 percent of total lending by value reflecting the short-term nature of
most of TDB's lending, loans relent for terms of between two to five years (medium
term) were 18 percent. and loans relent for more than five years (long term) were 15
percent. The low financing percentage for medium- to long-term fixed assets is
attributed to the difficult business and economic environment in Tonga and the lack of
investment demands and infrastructure facilities to support and promote economic
development.
44.         The average processing time for subloan applications below the free limit
was five days, and for those above the free limit it averaged between two to three
weeks. At times, the above free limit applications submitted to the South Pacific
Regional Mission (SPRM) may take longer to process due to additional information
being sought from TOB to complete the appraisal. Presently, for the outer island
subproject appraisals, regional managers have their own approval limits; projects that
exceed their limits are referred to head office, and generally take about three weeks.
The PCR Mission views the processing time to be reasonable.



14
E     Financial Performance of TDB
45.         Appendix 10 provides a summary of TDB's projected and actual loan
portfolio and arrears for the seven years up to 31 December 1996. During this period,
MSO recorded an annual average growth rate of 12 percent in its loan portfolio from
TS21.9 millien (1990) to T$40.3 million (1996). Inital growth In this period was modest
and broadly in line with appraisal projections, and reflected the growth pattern of loan
approvals. The major growth, however, took place in 1994, with the gross loan portfolio
inceasing to T$35 million. It steadily increased to T$39 million in 1995 untl it leveled
off in 1996 to T$40 million. Significant trends over this period included the- (i)
introducfion of commercial housing loans and (ii) large growth in the agriculture,
toutism, and industry and business portfolios. Included in the gross loan portfolio were
some nonperforming tourism, industry, and manufacturing projects for TS0.89 million
and TSO.72 million, respectively, which were approved in late 1980s. These accounts
have a track record of being in arrears, but no prompt action was taken by TOB to
either write-off the accounts and/or institute legal action. Instead, TDB rescheduled the
accounts with the expectation that these projects will tum around. In the past, TDB
provided loan losses for the nonperforming loans until it became apparent during the
1997 financial year audit that these provisions were inadequate, thus necessitating
substantial increases to be made in 1997 resulting in a net loss after tax of TS0.26
million. The provision for loan losses for 1997 was T$1.1 million, and further increases
are likely in subsequent years, particularly when TMB would have to comply with the
National Reserve Bank of Tonga's prudential statements on credit-risK grading systems
and asset quality, to be introduced shortly, As a matter of policy, MOB stops recognizing
income on the nonperforming accounts when the arrears posibon deteriorates to a
point that the subproject's viability becomes questionable, or when accounts are under
legal action, resultng in TDB setting up large reserves for doubfful loans and reserved
interest, leading to further erosion in profitability (para. 47).
46.         The quality of MB's portfolio is also reflected in its arrears and collection
performance. Collection performance for the seven years ending 31 December 1996
was above the 75 percent covenanted limit until it slipped to 61 percent in 1996 (para.
51). As TODB increasingly expanded its activities into squash, vanilla, tourism, and
industry projects, credit risks became more prominent, with arrears virtually doubling to
T$8.5 million or 16 percent of the total portfolio by 31 December 1996, reflecting in part
the changing composition of the loan portfolio. Hard-core arrears (arrears for accounts
with any repayment overdue by 12 months or more) totaled T$5.7 million and were
equivalent to 14.1 percent of the total portfolio, well in excess of the 2.5 percent
covenanted limit (para. 50). The origin of the escalating hard-core arrears rato was the
expansion of larger industry and tourism lending in the late 1 980s. TDB was
encouraged and funded by a EIS loan to diversity into these areas. Fonunately, the EIB
loan also provided for reimbursement to TDB of loan write-offs under certain conditions.
TDB continues to be protected from the full extent of the risks from this portfolio, but
has had to substantially improve its loan-recovery efforts. Between 1995 and 1996, the
percentage of accounts that were below 12 months in arrears have progressively
declined, while the hard core arrears accounts have increased, reflecting the difficulties
experienced by entrepreneurs to meet repayments on time, increasing the number of
projects in diffculty, and the unwillingness of subborrowers to service debts.



15
F.   FRnancial Statements and Ratios
47.         The TDB financial statements - actual and projected - are presented
in Appendixes 11-13. Over the past seven years, TDB's balance sheet recorded
progressive growth as funding from extemal credit lines and short- and long-term funds
raised domestically through the issue of promissory notes and Govemment-guaranteed
bonds enabled it to substantially meet the demand for credit. The loan portfolio grew by
12 percent per annum during the period. Total assets similady increased at 20 percent
per annum during this period to TS46.5 million. Total interest income grew strongly by
16 percent during the period reflecting portfolio growth and the recovery of interest
spread from 5.5 percent in 1990 to 8.3 percent in 1994, but thereafter, interest spreaC
decreased due to the progressive deciine in approvals accompanied by increasing
arrears and provisions for loan losses and bad debts. As .a result, net profit has
fluctuated from TSO.11 million (1990), to TSO.S2 million (1994). and TS0.14 million
(1996). Based on the 1997 audited figures, TDB will incur a net loss after tax bf T$0.26
million at 31 December 1997 due to heavy provisioning resulting from inadequate loss
provisioning and debt write-off over the past years.
48.         A major chlange in TDB's funding has been the increase in short- and
long-term  promissory notes and Govemment-guaranteed bonds to finance its two
important commercial crops: squash and vanilla. This altemative source of funding
enabled TDB to sustain its operations in the recent past. TDB has historically
rescheduled loans that are in arrears resulting in the expected annual cash receipts
from loans being reduced. This, combined with the Increasing squash and vanilla loans
in arrears, the closure of most of TDB's extemal credit lines, and the difficult economic
and operating environment, will place a strain on TDB's ability to ensure that its short-
term assets and obligations are matched.
49.         TOB has maintained modest profitability in the past seven years (ranging
between 1.0 and 4.1 percent per annum return on average equity) and operated
comfortably within the limits of debt-equity, and debt-service coverage ratios
covenanted under the loan (limits of 3:1 and 1.5:1, respectively). While profits have
made some contribution to equity, regular increases in paid-up capital. based largely on
NZODA contributions to the Govemment, have maintained growth of TDB's equity.
G.   Covenants
50.         The details of the loan covenants and their compliance status are given
in Appendix 14. The design of the loan covenants took cognizance of the areas of
concem identified by the PPAR' of the previous Bank loans to TDB. TOB has generally
complied vith most of the loan covenants, but failed to comply with the following
specific covenants: (i) the hard-core arrears ratio exceeded the maximum limit of 2.5
percent; and (ii) there was inadequate data for qualified projects, including relevant
socioeconomic and financial information for subloans of USS10,000 and above.
51.         The fluctuation in the 75 percent collection ratio has resulted in a partial
compliance status. This is due to TDB's heavy involvement in financing development
projects that are generally long term and potentially high risk, as with tourism, industry

and business, squash, and vanilla projects. The sUip in financial covenants is also
attributed to the difficult economic environment and lack of business commitnent by
entrepreneurs due to other priorities.
52.        As discussed in para. 15, TDB is contravening its own operatonal policy-
by taking on-ihe foreign exchange risks of a foreign curency denominated loan. The
Govemment and TDB should take the necessary steps to amend the Act immediately
to safeguard TDB's position and the general perception of TMB by other financiers.
K    The Bank's Performance
53.        The Bank loan was approved on 21 November 1989 but was declared
effective only on 20 July 1990, following two extensions and receipt by the Bank of the
standard legal opinion an;d subsidiary :an agreement. A precondition for loan
effectiveness was the establishment of the Natonal Reserve Bank of Tonga, the
implementation of a market-oriented, flexible interest rate structure conducive to
realizing positive, real deposit and lending rates, and submission by TOB of its
Guidelines for the Rescheduling, and Write-off of Bad Debts. Since the loan became
effective, utilization of the loan by TDB has been slower than earlier envisaged at
appraisal, and subloan submission and loan closing dates were extended three times.
On the closure of the Project, the Bank canceled the undisbursed loan balance of
US$1.19 million equivalent, reflecting a 79 percent utilization rate.
54.        The Bank's tumaround time for processing subloans below the free limit
averaged five days, and for subloans above the free limit, between 2 and 3 weeks due
to additional clarifications and follow-up wAth TDB.
55.        The Bank mounted two special loan administration missions, followed by
ten formal review missions between 1991 to 1997. The Mission considers this to be
satisfactory. Also, the Project was managed successfully by an experienced
rnanagement team, suooorted by Australian and NZODA technical advisers on long-
term assignment with TDB.
111.   EVALUATION
A.   Loan Appraisal
1.    Distribution of Subloans
5B.        The main objectives of the loan were to provide TDB with financial
resources to meet the increased demand for development projects, promote specific
medium- and long-term development projects on a small and medium scale that had
economic and commercial merit, promote the role and development of the private
sector in the economy and regional'and rural development, and support the objectwves
of the Govemments 5th FYP. Under the circumstances, the loan achieved these
objectives as far as the distribution of subloans on various counts is concemed.
However, the expected balanced sectoral distribution was not achieved because TDB
had access to other extemal credit sources that, however, overlapped in purpose. For
example, the EIB loan targeted small- to medium-sized subprojects in tourism,



17
transport, fishing, and agro-industry, while the BanktIDA facility targeted medium- and
long-term subprojects. Given the sluggish nature of the private sector most of the
subprojects that TDB financed were small- and medium-sized subprojects. No sector
limits were defined at appraisal for the reason that it was difficult to target specific areas
for development in a small country where trends change quickly. For example, the
boom in the squash industry vas r.:' envisa;ad at appraisal, but TOB responded
flexibly and capably to opportunities that emerged for development of the industry. The
geographical distribution was fairly even between Tongatapu and the outer islands, The
subloans were fairly utifized for new ventures, resulting in the creation of* new
entrepreneurs, the development of the country's small private sector, and the
expansion of existing businesses.
2. Covenants
57.         The loan covenants were generally well conceived and appropriate in the
circumstances prevalring at the time of appraisal, except that the requirement for
establishing the hard-core arrears ratio at 2.5 percent was unrealistic, particularly when
it was known at the time of appraisal that the ratio was in excess of 3 percent. The non
provision of data on the subprojects socioeconomic and finanuial informaton for
subloans of US$10,000 and above, was attributed to loss of key lending staff and the
lack of communication and direction between senior and middle management.
3.    Quality of Appraisal
58.         The formulation of the Project was consistent with the objectives of the
Govemment's 5th FYP, and the selection of subprojects by sector for financng took
cocnizance of the -_ve-me- 'c. -   -            n Scial dpvetopment of the
country, in particular, development of the private sector. The PCR Mission views that
the loan amount of US$5 million equivalent was too ambitious and excessive compared
with the three previous Bank loans to TDB that ranged between US$1 million and
USS1.5 million. Similarly, the economic and development plans outlined by the
Govemment in its 5th FYP were to some extent unrealistic and ambitious to be
effectively implemented. The expected strategies to enable the translation of objectives
into action plans were not well fornulated. Nonetheless, TOB was the only institution
providing medium- to long-termn loans to finance development projects in productive
sectors of the economy, and was an appropriate institution through which to course the
loan proceeds.
B.   Implementation
59.         The loan, net of cancellation, has been substantially utilized, and the
performance of the Project in achieving its objectives is considered partially successful.
The slower utilization rate reflects the much lower growth in TDB lending to industry,
business, and tourism than anticipated at the time of loan appraisal. Subprojects were
completed largely within original costs, and cost overruns were within reasonable limits'.
However, completion was delayed for a few subprojects mainly because of changes in
the architect and delayed signing of the contract. Also, the economic and financial
oe-+for'nce det' WVr not oukii:I* foar f r ;nrii.o$s This imries the need for T)B
to strengthen its project supennsion, monitoring systems, and follow-up on existing ana



18
com.teteve -ol ThF r,t^lit n' Tt'I-t lon nortfolio is of continuina concem as it
impacts directly on the institution's financial sustainability.
C.   Technical Assistance
s0.         The associated TA for US$32B,000 was intended to further strengthen
and consolidate the institutional capabilities of TDB, thereby enhancing its role in
promoting economic development activities. The performance of the consulting firm
recruited to review TDB's loan portfolio, microlending. and accounting procedures
manual and intemal audit procedures was satisfactory and produced useful reference
materials. But the accounting manual needs confinuous updating to address the
changing information system requirements. The study on microlending activities
provided useful evidence to TDB, Govemment officiais, bilateral and multilateral
agencies about the high cost of TDB's involvement in small-scale and outer-island
lending. Following this study, bilateral assistance has become more focused. The other
component involved (i) provision of software and hardware for enhancement of TDB's
computer systems, and (ii) funding of T1B staff for extemal training. Of the 16 staff that
attended extemal training, two have left TDB. A lesson is that future extemal training
courses snould only be attended by promising and motivated candidates who will
reinvest their acquired knowledge into the job stream.
IV.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A.   Conclusions
61.         The Mission considers that tie objectives of Loan No. 990-TON(SF),
except for improvement of loan portfolio quality, were partially achieved. On the positive
side, despite the longer than anticipated period of subloan commitment and
disbursement, the loan financed 2,105 subprojects of which 56 were managed by
women, and a reasonable number and amount were targeted at the outer islands. The
Bank loan proved an important source of medium- to long-term financing to TDB, in
support of subprojects in agriculture, industry and manufacturing, tourism, and services.
Of the 2,105 subprojects, 587 new business ventures for TS1.3 million were
established. In addition, TDB was and remrains the only institution geared to meeting
the finance requirements of a sizable part ; itie population of the outer islands. It is the
only institution to have pioneered the deve! . <nent of Tonga's financial market with its
issue of promissory notes and Govemment-guaranteed bonds, and creation of a
savings mobilization scheme for the outer islands. The review of 110 subprojects,
totaling 38 percent by value of the loan proceeds, indicated that the Project generated
incremental investment of T$7.65 million and incremental value added of TS3.4 million;
it created employment for 521 persons, of whom 27 percent were women; and 19
businesses were involved in export-related activities. While 47 subprojects accounts
have been fully repaid, some businesses have closed down but some remain operating
with a certain degree or sustainaoiity.
62.         On the negative side, the quality of the loan portfolio remains weak and
continues to be an area of concem, particularly with declining collection performance
due to rescheduling and lack of subborrower commitment to projects. TDB recorded a
loss at 31 December 1997 following massive increases in loan provisioning, arising



19
from past years of underprovisioning and inadequate loan write-offs. Unless the Board
takes concrete actions to tum the institution around, the long-term sustainability of TOB
will be In doubt. Accordingly, the outcome of the Bank's TA that is currently reviewing
and preparing a five-year strategic plan for TOB will address the future repositioning
and long-termnsustainability of the institution. Overall, the Project is irated partly
successful with uncertain sustainability.
B.   Recommendations
1.    For the Bank
63.         The Bank should assist the Govemment with some reform programs
aimed at improving public sector efficiency and accountability, and good govemance;
and facilitating private sector deveiopment. Because Govemment has significant
altemative extemal funding sources for project-type investments, it would be useful for
the Bank to coordinate with the Govemment and other major funding agencies to
determine how these resources could be best utilized.
64.         Considering the compefftive environment that emerged in the banking
sector in the recent past, further institutional strengthening of TDB is considered
imperative. This would involve implementation of performance review standards such
as a credit-rating system, and regular monitoring of actual performance against.
perceived objectives; a review of accounting policies and operational audits to
complement and safeguard the integrity of the MISs; consideration of setting a
minimum limit for subloan size to ensure that the lending operatons are cost effective
and efficient, with appropriate excepbon criteria; and if TDB is to diversify its activities
into commercial banking operations, a clear delineation of authority and responsibilities
will be necessary.
2.    For the Government and TDB
65.        The Govemment must take immediate steps to buy out BOT's minority
shares in TDB to avoid potential conflict of interest arising from the participation of the
BOT general manager in TDB's Board meetings.
66.         The Govemment should review the composition of the TDB Board to
ensure a more diverse group of directors, and in particular, stronger private
sectorlbusiness representation that could be more effective in balancing the sometimes
conflictina policv issues, such as continued lending to overexposed sectors, interest
rate cross subsidies, etc.
67.        The Govemment and TDB should review the act and policies goveming
the operations of TDB periodically with the view to amending them. where necessary,
so as to safeguard TDB from over-exposure and investment risks. Also, given the
changing nature of T-DB's operating environment, the Govemment should promote
independent decision making and autonomy within TDB, This could be achieved if TDB
either (i) operates at armn's length from the Govemment, and/or (ii) as one that is
restructured along business principles to undertake development and commercial
banking simultaneously.



20
e8.         TDB Is encouragod to follow up on the performance of ongoing and
completed subprojects with a view to collecting data on the economic and financial
performance of subprmjects as required in the Loan and Project agreements.
69.         TDB's noncompliance with the covenants for a minimum  annual
collection ratio of 75 pemcent and maximum hard-core arrears of 2.5 percent are reason
for concem regarding the long-term sustainabillty of TDB. Accordingly, MDB should
improve the quaiity of its loan portfolio though vigorous collection performance, close
project monitring and supervision, sbict adherence to loan rescheduling poliies, and
vigorous arrears reducfion. In particular, the quality of appraisals should be linked to the
subprojects cash flow. Moreover, TOB should streamline its procedures in prompty
insftitng legal proceedings apainst its derinauent subbofrowers and/or rcvery
processes.

Dear Sir,
Re: IDA Credit Number 2084-TON
Tonaa Development Bank Project
1.     We refer to: (i) the Development Credit Agreement between
the Kingdom of Tonga (the Borrower) and the International
Development Association (IDA) dated 7 March 1990 (the Credit
Agreement); (ii) the Project Agreement between IDA and the Tonga
Development Bank (TDB) of the same date (the IDA Project
Agreement); (iii) the Loan Agreement (Special Operations) between
the Borrower and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) dated 1 February
1990 (the Loan Agreement); (iv) the Project Agreement between ADB
and TDB of the same date (the ADB Project Agreement); and (v) the
Technical Assistance Agreement, also of the same date, between the
Borrower and TDB of the one part and ADB of the other (the TA
Agreement), all of which relate to the financing of a Tonga
Development Bank Project (the Project) in the Kingdom of Tonga.
2.     Set forth in the following paragraphs are the arrangements
for the administration of the credit (the IDA Credit) provided for
in the Credit Agreement, and the mode of cooperation between ADB
and IDA on all matters relating to the execution of the Project.
3.     Pursuant to Articles II, III and IV of the Credit Agreement
and Articles II, III and Iv of the IDA Project Agreement, ADB will
administer the IDA Credit for and on behalf of IDA together with
the loan (the ADB Loan) provided for in the Loan Agreement and the
ADB grant provided for in the TA Agreement, and carry out the
following activities:



2
(a)  Proiect Execution:  ADB will (i) review and approve
applications for Sub-loans exceeding the amount
specified in paragraph 2(b) of the Schedule of the IDA
-Project Agreement, and (ii) authorize withdrawals from
the Credit Account in respect of Sub-loans not
exceeding the amount specified in paragraph 2(b) of
the IDA Project Agreement. ADB will also monitor the
Borrower's and TDB's compliance with Project-specific
covenants under the Credit Agreement and IDA Project
Agreement. ADB and IDA will have mutual consultations
over matters relating to amendments to TDB's Policy
Statement.
(b) Disbursements: Withdrawal applications (using standard
ADB forms as appropriate) will refer jointly to the ADB
Loan and the IDA Credit in the event procurement is
from a country of origin which is a member of both ADB
and IDA, or to the ADB Loan or the IDA Credit if the
country of origin is a member, as the case may be, of
only ADB or IDA. If the country of origin is a member
of both ADB and IDA, ADB will allocate funds from the
ADB Loan and the IDA Credit on a pari iassu basis of
62.5(ADB):37.5(IDA).  If the country of origin is only
a member of either ADB or IDA, ADB will allocate funds
either from the ADB Loan or the IDA Credit,
accordingly. ADB will send to the Borrower, and a copy
to  IDA,   a  disbursement   letter  detailing  the
disbursement procedures applicable to the ADB Loan and
the  IDA  Credit.      ADB  will  review  withdrawal
applications and related documentation and notify IDA
of approvals of such applications by tested telex for
disbursement by IDA of its funds.   Copies of such
withdrawal applications and documentation shall be
furnished to IDA upon reauest. ADB will also review
and consult with IDA regarding any application for
extension of the Closing Date of the IDA Credit.
Approval of any such extension will be sent by IDA to
the Borrower, with notification to ADB.
(c) Special Account: When the Special Account provided for
in the Credit Agreement is opened by the Borrower, ADB
will advise IDA of such opening and of its location and
terms and conditions. The authorized allocation for
the Special Account is US$340,000 equivalent. ADB will
administer the Special Account on behalf of IDA
pursuant to provisions specified by ADB.
(d)  Project Suoervision:   ADB will review records and
procedures for recording and monitoring the progress
of the Project and the Qualified Projects, identifying
the goods and services financed out of the proceeds of
the  IDA  Cred.t  and disclosing  their use  in  the
Qualified Projects. ADB shall as-.soon as-possible



3
notify IDA each time ADB intends to undertake a
supervision mission. Should IDA wish to participate
in the supervision mission, IDA shall promptly notify
_ADB of such intention. Copies of the following reports
will be made available to IDA:
(i) ADB project supervision reports;
(ii) the auarterly reports required to be furnished
by TDB under Section 3.05(b) of the ADB Project
Agreement;
(iii) the quarterly reviews of interest rate policies
done by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (as
agreed between ADB and the Borrower during loan
negotiations); and
(iv) final TORs, draft reviews, final reviews and
action    programs    related    to    TDB's
Diversification  Proposal,  the  TDB   Loan
Por-lolio Review, and Review of TDB's Micro-
Lending as discussed in the Schedule to the ADB
Project Agreement.
(e)  Accounts and Audit Renorts:   ADB will monitor in
particular the requirements of Section 4.01 of the
Credit Agreement and Section 3.01 of the IDA Project
Agreement with regard to the keeping of accounts,
reporting and auditing by the Borrower and TDB, and
will keep IDA informed of the status of compliance with
such requirements.                            I
(f)  Project Completion Report: ADB will arrange wi_.^ the
Borrower and TDB for the preparation of a Project
Completion Report (PCR) by the Borrower and TDB. as
required by the ADB Project Agreement. The PCR will
evaluate the execution and initial operation of the
Project and the Qualified Projects, the costs and the
benefits derived and to be derived from them, and the
performance of the Borrower and TDB.  Copies of the
PCR will be made available to IDA.   ADB will also
furnish to IDA copies of its own report on the
completion of the Project and the Qualified Projects.
(g)  Consents and Waivers to Proiect-SDecific Covenants:
At the request of the Borrower or on its own
initiative, ADB may grant consents or waivers to any
Project-specific covenants in the Credit Agreement on
behalf of IDA to the same extent as it may grant such
consents or waivers under the Loan Agreement, subject
to paragraph 4(b) of this letter, and subject to the
understanding that this provision does not preclude the
Borrower, to the extent necessary or desired, from
directly requesting such consents or waivers from
either ADB or IDA.

by either party by giving six months' notice.
7.     The arrangements set forth in this letter will become
effective upon confirmation  on behalf of IDA.   ADB shall be
responsible for furnishing copies of this letter to the Borrower
and TDB.
8.     ADB has delegated to its South Pacific Regional Office
(SPRO) in Port Vila, Vanuatu, all loan administration functions
relatin4 to both the Loan Agreement and the Credit Agreement,
including in particular approval of Sub-loan applications from TDB.
