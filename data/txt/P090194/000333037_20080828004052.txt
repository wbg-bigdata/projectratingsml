EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP) with the support of World Bank has identified
a site for the construction of a thermal power plant for electricity generation. The construction of the
20 Mega Watt (MW) thermal power plant is expected to involve acquisition of land for the same
purpose.

Land acquisition is expected to lead to the economic displacement (not physical) of the Project
Affected Persons (PAPs) who are utilizing the identified parcel of land as well as loss of access to
the land that provides for economic resources to the PAPs. This therefore principally triggers World
Bank Operational Policy OP4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement and the laws of Rwanda related to
land acquisition.

The major portion of the land already identified for the construction of the plant is partly owned by
Home of Hope Rwanda a faith based organization which had initial plans of utilizing the land for
the construction of a church and a children's' orphanage.       There are 5 other PAPs who own the
remaining part of the targeted land including crops and trees.

The UERP wants to acquire part of this land that is owned by these 5 other individuals in order to
consolidate a whole piece of land for security purposes. These are small portions of land that the
UERP would like to consolidate in order to enforce security and keep off intruders from the property
once constructed.

A total of 3.59 hectares of land is going to be acquired for this project.     The total land size and
crops including trees present in the site have been valued and will be compensated in cash
amounting to RFW 91,757,177.        The UERP will also assist the Home of Hope Rwanda to look for
another site for construction of the church and orphanage.

In accordance with the World Bank Policy OP4.12 a resettlement action/compensation plan must
be developed by the Government of Rwanda and be submitted to World Bank and the Rwanda
Environment Management Authority (REMA) for approval before any land acquisition, resettlement,
loss, denial of, and restriction to economic resources or any other impact on livelihoods occur.

However, most of the actions and activities related to implementing the resettlement plan have
been undertaken including land measurement and valuation, crop valuation, consultation with the
PAPs and eventual compensation.

This is therefore a retrospective Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) by the Government
of Rwanda-Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP) and is in line with all the necessary
requirements outlined in the UERP Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) document.                 All the
supporting documents including minutes of consultative meetings and copies of final compensation
payments have been attached as an annex in the annex section.

This report principally describes the activities of the project that is proposed and the associated
adverse impacts arising thereof. The section on land acquisition highlights the existing land uses
on the targeted land, brief biography of the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and the magnitude of
the loss. Eventually, the report describes the process used in the valuation of the existing


                                                                                                      2

structures, and crops including trees present in the project site. The Government of Rwanda would
like to present this report to the World Bank as an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP)
document. This is mainly because the fewer than 200 people will be displaced economically in this
site. There will be no physical displacement and shelter destruction because the land in question
does not have any dwellings and households present.          The land is currently being used for
cultivation of crops and trees by the owners.

1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

Introduction
The Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP) through the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU)
and with the support of the World Bank has identified a site where it wants to install a new 20 Mega
Watt (MW) thermal power plant for electricity generation by Electrogaz of Rwanda.

The Thermal Power Plant proposed site is located in the City of Kigali and is along the Kigali-
Byumba road which divides the area into industrial and residential zones to the east and north
respectively. On the Administrative plan, the site is located in Gasabo District, Kabuye Sector in
Cyerere Cell.

The Thermal Power Project is a proposed 20MW diesel generators running on Heavy Fuel Oil
(HFO). The equipments/generators to be installed at the project site will include 3 sets of
generators, with a rated out put of 7.5 MVA and a rated voltage of 6.6 kV, rated current of 656 A,
rated frequency of 50 Hz with 0.8 lagging and a speed of 1000 rpm.

The construction of the power plant shall also include related engineering works, earthworks, and
service utility buildings including an engine hall, control building and a fuel handling house.

In order to construct this plant, Electrogaz would need to acquire the piece of land which is
currently under private ownership.     According to the requirements of the World Bank, any project
which it provides support towards and involves acquisition of land must have a Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) prepared.       The RAP is the document that highlights the steps and procedures that
were followed in order to ensure that the project does not impoverish the livelihood of the PAPs.


2.0 OBJECTIVES OF ARAP
The main objective of the ARAP is to ensure that the land acquisition and resettlement of the
project is fulfilled successfully, so that the affected persons will be compensated adequately, their
livelihood and income restored as soon as possible, and the standard of living of all categories of
the affected persons improved, or at least restored, after resettlement.

This ARAP is retrospective in nature mainly due to the fact that all the major key activities related
to the preparation of an ARAP have been concluded. The PAPs have been fully compensated in
an acceptable manner and supporting documentation is attached as annex.




                                                                                                   6

3.0 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES

3.1 Design and Planning Phase
During the design phase of this project, the expected activities some of which have already
occurred include:

Site Selection History
Identification of a proper site for the construction of the thermal power plant has been an on going
process for a long time now since 2006. An initial site for the construction of the plant next to the
Jabana substation was already identified and the UERP Environmental Advisor (EA) prepared an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) including an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan
(ARAP) based on that site. However, UERP was forced to identify another site after WARTSILA,
the company contracted to undertake the construction of this plant, commenced initial site clearing
works and excavations in the proposed location beginning September 2007 and experienced
immediate problems with the soil which was soft in texture.

In order to install the plant in the earlier identified site, WARTSILA would be obliged to excavate far
much deeper than was initially anticipated and do extensive filling so as to have a stable and
required base structure to support the plant. This new discovery would increase the project cost
tenfold a factor that had not been provided for in the International Development Association (IDA)
loan.

This new dimension necessitated the need for the UERP/PCU, and the contractor to begin the
search for an alternative site for the 20MW plant. It has now since emerged after looking around
that there is an appropriate and much suitable site for the construction of this power plant and for
this reason, the EA has now revised the EMP to suit this new site accordingly.               A similar
assignment of revising and preparing a new ARAP is needed hence this report.

Rationale for the new site
The following reasons primarily bordering on Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA)
concerns about the site, legislative related issues and technical site viability played a significant
role in arriving at a unanimous decision to relocate to this new site for the power plant. They
include;

Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA)
Rwanda Environmental Management Authority (REMA) the environmental regulatory institution in
Rwanda and charged with approvals for EIA reports has been unwilling to approve the EIA report
submitted citing poor choice of site. REMA considers the close proximity of the proposed location
to the Nyabugogo wetland as a reason for not approving the project for fear of imminent and
possible contamination of this feature. This is in spite of the fact that the site already has an
existing substation and the wetland is no longer natural owing to its conversion into rice cultivation.
There have been many meetings held and communication with REMA by the UERP/PCU and its
implementing partners attempting to prevail upon REMA to approve the project owing to the well
developed EMP to no avail. REMA has consistently maintained that only a cabinet approval from




                                                                                                      7

the parliament authorizing through a decree for the allocation of the land for the project remains the
only way that would make them give a positive decision.

Weak and unstable soil structure
Recently, the company contracted to undertake the construction of the power plant began clearing
and excavation of the site and quickly discovered that the soil structure is weak and susceptible to
sinking. The heavy equipment on site began to get stuck in the soil. This implied that in order to
build a stable foundation and base for installing the plant/engines and auxiliary infrastructure, the
contractor would have to excavate as deep as 4 meters and undertake plenty of backfilling. This
new dimension was not factored in the bidding process and would make the cost to shoot
tremendously bearing. In actual sense the contractor would have to excavate and backfill
105,000cm3 of soil and could end up costing approximately 7 million USD.

The additional cost was not anticipated in the IDA loan and would prove difficult to renegotiate from
the   side of  the   Government      of  Rwanda.    Beginning   renegotiations    would   also    drag  the
implementation of the 20MW plant which is long overdue. Selecting an alternative site was
proposed as the most viable alternative to this quagmire.

Site Selection Process
These two fundamental reasons stated above triggered the need for identification of another site
for the construction of this plant. During the initial and very early discussions in 2006 REMA had
proposed a site that is about 1.2 km from the existing Jabana substation as an ideal site that is far
off from the wetland and would thus not pose an environmental risk. At that point in time, there was
no strong justification for considering this site because the Jabana substation site provided an ideal
extension to the proposed 20 MW plant.

However, with the new turn in events, the UERP/PCU together with Electrogaz and the contractor
considered this site as the first alternative and made a preliminary visit to this site to verify its
efficacy. The EA with and Erik Fernstrom (World Bank Energy Specialist) also paid a site visit to
this new location in an effort to contribute into final decision making towards settling on this new
site.

Indeed the reconnaissance surveys by this team indicated that this site is by far highly appropriate
and suitable than the initial site this providing for a win-win situation to the earlier conflicting issues.
The site is along the main Kigali-Byumba-Gatuna road hence provides adequate access during
construction, is on a highly elevated area, and even though a soil investigation is yet to be
undertaken, the preliminary observations according to the contractor show that the soil texture is of
the hardy nature. This discovery rule out the problem of weak soil formation that would require
deep excavation and massive backfilling during the construction and in effect lead to additional
costs previously not factored in the IDA loan. This new site is also extensive in terms of size and
provides room for any future planned expansion if required.

Finally, the proposed new site has two houses/structures thereby making the resettlement process
that will occur before the construction begins fairly easy and straight forward. These two
households who are previous legal land owners had already sold the land and were already fully
compensated by Home of Hope Rwanda, a faith based organization the current land owners.
However, the owners of the households have not yet moved out of this land because Home of


                                                                                                          8

Hope Rwanda is planning to construct a church and an orphanage some time later and have left
the occupiers to use the land until that time that they will be ready to commence construction.

Land Acquisition
The land in question must be acquired for purposes of construction and for this reason an
assessment was undertaken to find out land ownership. The existing parcel of land identified is
largely owned by the Home of Hope Rwanda a faith based organization which plans to construct a
church and a children's orphanage in the site. It should be noted however that the land which now
legally belongs to the Home of Hope Rwanda was initially owned by 2 families who sold it to Home
of Hope Rwanda after mutually agreeing and having been duly compensated. See the annex
section for bank slip deposit copies showing compensation made by Home of Hope Rwanda to the
2 families.

However, because Home of Hope Rwanda did not have immediate plans to commence with the
construction of the church and a children's orphanage, they allowed the 2 households to continue
residing and utilizing the land until such a time that they would be ready. There are 2 houses in the
site and different crops have been planted by the household members who in spite of using this
land are not the legal owners and will thus not get compensated. Home of Hope Rwanda thus
remains the PAPs who will be duly compensated as per the requirements of the bank and not the 2
households.

Adjacent to the land owned by Home of Hope Rwanda are 4 different small parcels of land owned
by 4 different individuals that the UERP/PCU have engaged in discussion and intends to acquire
these parcels of land for technical and security purposes so as to consolidate the entire parcel of
land into a single manageable unit.




                                                                                                   9

3.2 Construction Phase
Excavation of land during civil works
Civil works including stripping of the land, excavation and installation of equipment is largely
expected to occur during the construction phase of this project. However this is expected to occur
only after the PAPs have been duly compensated and resettled with approval from World Bank.

Installation of the thermal power plant
This will involve the construction and installation of a 20MW diesel generators running on Heavy
Fuel Oil (HFO). The equipments/generators to be installed at the project site will include 3 sets of
generators, with a rated out put of 7.5 MVA and a rated voltage of 6.6 kV, rated current of 656 A,
rated frequency of 50 Hz with 0.8 lagging and a speed of 1000 rpm. The Thermal Power Plant shall
have 2 sets of power transformers of 15 MVA, 6.6/110 kV three phase, 50 HZ, two winding oil
immersed with on-load tap charger complete with accessories under natural-oil circulation and
natural-air cooled operation referred to the 110 kV side of the transformer.


3.3 Operation Phase
During operation phase the expected activities include, operation and maintenance of the
generators, transformers, circuit breakers, circuit switches and capacitors that will have been
installed during the construction phase.




                                                                                                10

4.0 POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS
Loss of Agricultural Land
The activity that gives rise to the need for compensation is mainly acquisition of the piece of land
for which the thermal power plant will be constructed. This will mainly impact the PAPs who have
cultivated crops in the land that will be acquired and which has already been identified as the
project site. The types of crops in the site include bananas, grevillea, jacaranda, bamboo tress,
mangoes, sorghum and eucalyptus trees.


Destruction of Vegetation
The civil works activities during the construction will entail clearing of the vegetation inherent in the
project site which includes fruit trees, normal tress, grass and crops that have been planted and or
cultivated by the PAPs. Other Impacts will be those related to Occupation Health and Safety of the
workers during the construction and operation of the thermal power station.

4.1 Size of Land expected to be Acquired
The project will only acquire approximately 3.59 ha size of land for the construction of the plant
including its ancillary infrastructure.

4.2 Land Ownership

4.2.1 Home of Hope Rwanda
The major part of the land targeted for acquisition is owned by Home of Hope Rwanda which is a
faith based organization and initially had plans to construct a church and a children's orphanage in
the land.

4.2.2 Other Individuals
There are 5 PAPs who possess part of the remaining land and use it for growing crops and tress
and these land owners include;
     1. KABAKA Francois Regis Land Owner
     2. NYIRAZUBA Flavia Land Owner
     3. NDAHIRO Emmanuel Land Owner
     4. INEMWENYEWE Jean Bosco owner of crops
     5. HELENA Rebeka ­Land Owner

Brief Background about HELENA Rebeka-PAP
Mrs. HELENA Rebaka is a recent inclusion in the compensation plan for Jabana and the
description given in the following section highlights this very late inclusion and reasons behind it.

During the time of assessment of land and valuation one of the land owners identified was Mr.
INEMWENYEWE Jean Bosco who at that time presented himself as the land owner. His parcel of
land was valued as well as the crops and tress and the compensation in terms of payment was
drafted.




                                                                                                      11

However     just about  the  time   that UERP    was   making  arrangements   to   deposit   the cash
compensation in INEMWENYEWE's bank account, the local authority at the district level who was
engaged in the compensation process revealed the following;

That INEMWENYEWE was not the actual land owner instead the land he laid claims to was owned
by his elder brother called Augustine MWENYEWE who had moved to Burundi during the genocide
era. INEMWENYEWE Jean Bosco was approached to verify these claims and he readily accepted
that this was the case and that he was not the rightful owner of the land.

MWENYEWE Augustine came to hear about the land compensation and immediately sent her
daughter KANEZA Alida to negotiate on his behalf.        KANEZA Alida traveled to Kigali and held
negotiations with UERP including land verification, measurements and re-valuation in her presence
to satisfy her.    Upon her satisfaction, it was now decided that a new contract be written and
payment be made to MWENYEWE Augustine. UERP decided to contact the Burundi embassy and
confirm that indeed Mr. MWENYEWE was based in Burundi and the embassy duly provided these
reference documents. See annex section for these documents.

However and unfortunately, before the payment was made on Mr. MWENYEWE's account, he
passed on and this immediately complicated the matter.            UERP thus decided to pay the
compensation to the next of kin this being the wife called HELENA Rebeka.

In order to ensure that Mrs. HELENA Rebeka was indeed the legal wife of the late MWENYEWE,
the 7 children of HELENA swore an affidavit in court confirming that she was indeed their mother
and the wife to their late father.   They also gave authorization in the affidavit for their mother to
collect the compensation on their behalf. The 7 children are MUKAMUSONI Sona, NKEZABERA
Arnaud, KANEZA Alida, MWENYEWE Anabelle, MWENYEWE Nathalie, POPPE Jeanine and
POPPE Helenie. See annex section for attached sworn affidavit.

UERP also demanded that HELENA further submit a copy of marriage certificate to demonstrate
legality for which she did and is also attached in the annex section.

Based on this submission, UERP therefore compensated the HELENA Rebeka for the land as well
as the trees as follows;

INEMWENYEWE Jean Bosco also presented a case that he would like to be compensated for the
food crops that he had planted and was available on the piece of land before the acquisition. This
was a justified claim and therefore, he was only compensated for the food crops present in the land
and not for land ownership or the other long lasting crops and trees.


4.3 Land Use Type
The identified parcel of land proposed for the construction of the plant is currently utilized for
agricultural production of mainly subsistence crops at a small scale level as well as for shelter as a
dwelling area. Typical crops grown in the area and observed during the assessment study include
bananas, beans, and nappier grass, mangoes, jacaranda, bamboo trees, eucalyptus and grevillea
trees and other local tree species. There are 2 houses in the identified site which provide shelter



                                                                                                   12

for the 2 families who have been previously compensated by Home of Hope Rwanda. This ARAP
is in effect a Compensation Action Plan detailing the modalities that will be employed in
compensating the identified PAPs for the loss of their crops, tress and land due to the acquisition.

5.0 DOCUMENTATION OF HOLDINGS AND ASSETS
Electrogaz through the UERP/PCU engaged the local community leaders in the area in discussing
the compensation process. Using qualified land surveyors and valuers, UERP/PCU has already
undertaken a complete and detailed inventory of all the crops of the PAPs and the land to be
acquired including total land holdings and any necessary personal information of the same. The
UERP/PCU with the assistance of the EA is developing a database for keeping all this information
including the relevant signed records and copies.

The table below provides a full census of the 5 PAPs including the household head, other adults
and children as well as assets. The PAPs do not reside in the land that is targeted for acquisition.
They live in the Kigali city and use the land for crop cultivation in the meantime.

Shelter
The land to be acquired from these 5 PAPs does not include any shelter for human or livestock.
This is because the owners do not dwell in the parcel of land. They all dwell in the Kigali city where
they own or rent houses and only utilize the land at the Jabana site for cultivation of crops and
trees.

The PAPs as indicated in the census table above own property and other parcels of land
elsewhere within the city and in this regard the percentage of land loss per family as a result of this
acquisition is approximately 20% considering the other pieces of land that they possess elsewhere.


5.1 Magnitude of expected loss
The magnitude of expected loss of the land to be acquired can be termed as fairly moderate in
significance in terms of economic or physical losses this is because physical displacement will not
occur and the economic loss from cultivation of crops will be negligible compared to the general
income of the PAPs.

5.2 Information on vulnerable groups or persons
NYIRAZUBA Flavia one of the PAPs can be categorized as vulnerable because she is a widow
heading a household and as such requires special provisions.        Before the concluding the land
acquisition deal, detailed discussions were held specifically with her to determine of by possessing
her land, the project would make her vulnerable. She indicated that she would have sold the land
anyway with or without this project and was comfortable conducting business in town and was thus
able to fend for herself and her single child with ease.

HELENA rebeka is also categorized as vulnerable PAPs because she is a widow having lost her
husband (Augustine Mwenyewe) recently.         Helena resides in Burundi where she is undertaking
various businesses ventures left behind by the husband and currently she has no plans of returning
back to Rwanda.

6.0 VALUATION OF AND COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES

6.1 Calculation of Land Compensation Rate
The total land that will be acquired by Electrogaz for the construction of the 20MW plant is 3.59ha.
This land   measurement      was   undertaken  by  the  District office of  Gasabo-Land   Valuation
Department who were hired by the UERP for this work. The measurements were done in the full
presence of the PAPs who were informed in advance that the measurement process would occur
at such a date. The staff of Gasabo district acted as witnesses during the measurement and
valuation process of this land.

The process of taking measurements of the land to be acquired by Electrogaz was done in full
presence of the PAPs and thereafter verification was done to ensure agreement in sizes recorded.

The PAPs were informed of the day that the land measurement would be done and informed to be
present on that day. The unit of land measurement was done in m2 and later converted into
hectares. After the measurements, the PAPs were told to verify the same and eventually signed a
document indicating that indeed the size of land measured is correct.

One "land owner" Mr. INEMWENYEWE Jean Bosco (It was later discovered that he was not the
actual land owner instead it was the elder brother's land) was not satisfied with the results of the
land measurements and for this reason, the UERP/PCU allowed him to procure the services of a
private professional land valuation firm in Rwanda to undertake a repeat valuation of his land. The
private land valuation firm confirmed the same results as those found by the Gasabo district office
thus bringing this dispute to rest.

6.2.1 Roles of the UERP/PCU during Land Measurements
The UERP/PCU played an oversight role in monitoring and ensuring that the process of surveying
the land was done in an open and transparent manner and in the presence of all the PAPs. The
UERP/PCU informed the PAPs in advance and within adequate time on the dates when the survey
and measurements would be done and insisted upon the presence of the PAPs in all these
meetings.

6.2.2 Roles of the PAPs during Land Measurements
The primarily role of the PAPs during the process of measuring the land was to be physically
present and ascertain that indeed the measurements were correct and to their satisfaction. They
upon being adequately satisfied that these measurements were correct appended their signatures
as proof of satisfaction with measurements.

6.2.3 Roles of the Gasabo District Officials during Land
Measurements
The   Gasabo    District Land   surveyors  were    contracted by   the  UERP/PCU      to  undertake
measurements, survey and valuation of land targeted for the construction of the thermal plant. The
role of this department was to take physical measurements of the land in the presence of the PAPs
and UERP/PCU and to demarcate the size of land to be acquired and determine parcel of land
owned by each of the 4 PAPs. The department then produced a map highlighting the total size of
land to be acquired which it then submitted to the UERP/PCU.


6.3 Compensation for Land
The Gasabo District office then valued the land in accordance with the existing land rates and then
negotiations were held in full presence of the PAPs. The existing land compensation rate
presented by the district of Gasabo officials is 200.00 RFW per square metre. This is the official
compensation rate that the office of land in the district of Gasabo offered to the PAPs as
compensation for their land according to the Government of Rwanda statutes on land acquisition.

The new law on land ownership provided by the MINITERE especially on private land in terms of
compensation and acquisition in Rwanda provide for negotiations over the value of land during
acquisition as a preferred means for arriving at a common agreement. In other words, PAPs are
accorded room to negotiate for the best price for their land after being made aware of the current
existing market land rates.

However, the UERP/PCU regarded the 200 RFW compensation proposed by the Gasabo District
office as too low a value for the PAPs. UERP/PCU then negotiated with the 4 PAPs and agreed
upon a rate of 1,500 RFW per square metre for the 4 individuals. This was the same amount of
compensation that the UERP/PCU offered to the PAPs affected by the construction of the Birembo
substation which is another UERP project.

The negotiations held also agreed that Home of Hope Rwanda would be given back the exact
equal amount of cash that they used to acquire the land from the 2 initial land owners.    To show
proof of the exact amount of cash that they paid, Home of Hope Rwanda provided copies of bank
cheques deposits to the accounts of the previous 2 PAPs as evidence.


                                                                                                 17

The land owners/PAPs were therefore compensated for loss of land at the above rates. The PAPs
have been informed of how this calculation for compensation has been done and it has been
agreed that compensation to the PAPs will be in cash. The PAPs have already appended their
signatures willingly and in the presence of the local government authorities on documents prepared
and that show how much parcel of land they own that will be acquired and how much that will
translate into cash based on the current land valuation rates.

According to COTRAPETO, a private firm undertaking valuation of land and houses that was
requested to provide current land rates for Jabana area, the cost price for land is 1,000 RwF per
square metre. This implies that the UERP still was able to offer better cash compensation rates to
the PAPs that are way above the current market rates.

The table below shows the total land compensation cost that was paid by UERP to the PAPs upon
successful negotiation and agreement.

6.4 Compensation for Initial Topographic Survey
The negotiations between UERP/PCU and Home of Hope Rwanda agreed that compensation shall
cover incurred costs for the topographic survey initially performed by Home of Hope Rwanda
totaling 500 USD on the land. See annex section for attached documentation of communication
from Home of Hope requesting for this compensation.

6.4.1 Assistance in Acquiring another Land-Home of Hope Rwanda
The UERP/PCU has also already provided assistance to the Home of Hope Rwanda in identifying
another piece of land for establishing the school and children's home.

6.5 Calculation of Crops Compensation Rate
The crops that exist in the project area belong to the 2 households who had been previously
compensated for the land and crops including trees at that point in time. For this reason, they will
not be compensated for the crops and have been informed to commence preparations to harvest
the crops before the construction begins. The initial land clearing and excavation will begin in areas
where there are no crops to provide room for the households to harvest their crops in time.

However, the other 4 PAPs will be compensated for the crops found in their land. The valuation
team undertook an assessment of the crops present in the area. The tables below tabulate the
crops found in the land owned by the 5 PAPs.

6.5.1 Calculation for Crop Compensation
Calculation for the compensation of the crops was done by valuing the size of land for which these
crops were planted and then using the known market crops rates as compensation. Compensation
of trees was undertaken by counting the number of trees and then compensating each piece of
tree using the existing market rates for such trees.         Market rates for the crops and trees were
derived from the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) average monthly rates for crops in the local
market.

6.5.2 Total Cash Compensation
Payment of cash compensation for lost assets was the only option implemented in this ARAP. This
is because of 2 reasons namely;



                                                                                                    19

    · During the consultation and negotiations with the PAPs, there was a tremendous
       preference demonstrated by the PAPs towards cash based compensation.

    · Secondly in view of the fact that the livelihoods of the PAPs are not entirely land-based
       and the land taken for the project is a small fraction of the affected asset and the residual is
       economically viable; (b)    active  markets for land, housing, cash compensation was
       considered to be sufficient to replace the lost land and other assets at full replacement cost
       in local markets.

The total amount of money to be compensated for the acquisition of land from the Home of Hope
Rwanda is therefore RWF 16,147,767. An additional US Dollars 500 approximately RWF 275,000
was given to Home of Hope Rwanda for the topographical survey that had been initially done by
the organization. The total amount of money that has thus been given as compensation to Home of
Hope Rwanda is RWF 16,422,767.

The total compensation for land acquisition and crops for the 5 PAPs is RFW 75,334,410.

The overall and total compensation for all the PAPs is RFW 91,757,177 and this entire amount has
been paid through different cheques to the PAPs. See annex section for copies of transmitted
payments.

7.0 Notification/Institutional Responsibility for

Regular consultation and meetings have been held and attended by the Executive Committee of
Home of Hope Rwanda, the 4 land owners, UERP/PCU, Electrogaz, REMA, Office of the Mayor in
Gasabo District and the 2 household members.

7.2 Grievance Redress Mechanism
The office of the mayor for the Gasabo District and the Good Governance office at the district level
are the acknowledged institutions for which the PAPs have been made aware of as avenues for
expressing discontent and disapproval to the resettlement and compensation process. Further to
this the PAPs have been informed that should these two institutions fail to offer them satisfactory
redress then the highest judicial institution in Rwanda (Rwanda-High Court) provides an avenue for
appeal and hearing.

7.3 Arrangements for Monitoring and Implementation schedule
The construction works for the thermal power plant is planned to start in October, 2007. It mainly
includes such works as excavations, stripping of the earth, clearing of vegetation, fencing of the
site etc. The table below illustrates the compensation implementation plan and responsible
institutions that are expected to oversee the implementation.

8.0 AGREEMENT ON COMPENSATION AND
PREPARATION OF CONTRACTS.
The UERP/PCU has already drafted agreement for the compensation for the land acquisition and
crop and prepared a contract for payments to Home of Hope Rwanda and the 5 PAPs. The
UERP/PCU before compensating the PAPs explained to the PAPs what will be compensated for in
cash that has already been wired in the bank accounts of the PAPs. See annex section for copies
of cash transfer documents.

UERP/PCU has also drawn a contract containing all this information and compensation to be made
in the presence of the Home of Hope Rwanda, the 5 PAPs and officials from Electrogaz and
representatives from the local district administration.

The Annex section shows minutes resulting from the negotiations amongst Home of Hope
Rwanda, the 5 PAPs and UERP/PCU as well as evidence of agreements and payments made after
agreement being reached by both parties.

8.1 COMPLETION REPORT
A completion report of the entire resettlement process for this project will be prepared and will
include  a  hand    over   certificate which  will ostensibly provide a  verification   of  when     the
compensation and assistance were undertaken and to whom these services were provided as well
as to indicate that indeed all the compensation has been delivered.

8.2 MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Monitoring and evaluation of the ARAP will be carried out during the whole process the
compensation to ensure that the objectives are met and ensure that successful implementation of
the ARAP occur. The monitoring and evaluation will involve both the internal and external
monitoring. Internal monitoring will be carried out by the UERP/PCU, assisted by the Safeguards
Advisor, to ensure that all of the responsible implementing agencies follow the schedule and
comply with the principles of the ARAP. For proper supervision, UERP/PCU will engage the
safeguards advisor to undertake supervision, monitoring and evaluation for the Project.

The UERP/PCU will through the assistance of the safeguards advisor develop an internal
monitoring framework to supervise the compensation activities. The UERP/PCU Project office will
maintain the basic database of crop compensation.

The local district office at Gasabo will act as independent monitoring facility and will verify that the
compensation process has occurred and followed the due process stipulated in the ARAP.
