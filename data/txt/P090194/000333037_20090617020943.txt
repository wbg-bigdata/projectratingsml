EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction and Study Objectives
The construction of a 20 MW power plant and a connecting 1.2km long transmission line is one of the key
activities that the Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP) planned to accomplish with the funding
from the World Bank/International Development Association (IDA) in order to curb the power crisis
experienced in Rwanda.

In compliance with the regulation and operational policies of the World Bank and the Government of
Rwanda through UERP has prepared an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) for this proposed 20 MW diesel power plant.

The proposed site for locating the 20MW diesel power plant is about 1.2km away from the existing Jabana
substation and is along the main Kigali-Byumba-Gatuna road hence has adequate access necessary during
construction, is on a highly elevated area, and even though a soil investigation is yet to be undertaken, the
preliminary observations according to the contractor show that the soil texture is of the hardy nature. This
site is quite extensive in terms of size and provides room for any future planned expansion if required.

Finally, the proposed site only has two houses/structures in the required site thereby making the
resettlement process that will occur before the construction begins fairly easy and straight forward. These
two households who are previous legal land owners had already sold the land and were already fully
compensated by Home of Hope Rwanda, a faith based organization the current land owners. However, the
owners of the households have not yet moved out of this land because Home of Hope Rwanda is planning
to construct a church and an orphanage some time later and have left the occupiers to use the land until
that time that they will be ready to commence construction.

The UERP/PCU also intends to acquire more land close to the site for technical and security reasons and
has already identified the 4 owners of these small pieces of land and began negotiations for compensation.

The transmission component of the project will involve the installation of towers from the proposed plant to
the Jabana substation. There will be compensation of PAPs for the small parcels of land that will be
acquired and crops/trees that will be cleared in order to install the towers and establish the Right of Way
(ROW). Right of Way is the space or path required internationally when installing electricity transmission
lines to ensure safety. Along this ROW no physical infrastructure is accepted and vegetation must also be
cleared.

A separate Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for the diesel power plant has been prepared and
submitted for approval to the World Bank and REMA. The ARAP has been approved by REMA and the
World Bank and has been disclosed in the World Bank infoshop. However, an ARAP for the transmission
component has not been finalized and is under preparation and once finalized will be submitted to the bank
and REMA for approval.

The EIA and ARAP for this project has already been approved by Rwanda Environment Management
Authority (REMA). See annex J for the copy of the EIA approval letter from REMA.

This project is classified under Category B according to the World Bank Operational Procedure and as such
requires the development of an EMP as per the World Bank requirements. However, in accordance with the
regulations by REMA projects of this nature require a full EIA including an EMP and in compliance with the



                                                                                                           2

REMA regulations, the safeguards advisor has prepared an EIA and EMP to ensure compliance with the
Banks and country regulations.

Project Description
The construction of the 20MW diesel power plant comprises of 2 components; the generation component to
be funded through a World Bank loan and transmission component that will be funded by the Government of
Rwanda.

Component 1. 20 MW Diesel Power Plant
The UERP through ELECTROGAZ and its implementing agencies including RURA and MININFRA plans to
install a 20 MW diesel power plant along the Kigali Byumba-Gatuna road and about 1.2km from the existing
Jabana substation in the city of Kigali in the District of Gasabo.

The project will involve the identification of a suitable location for this project and after compensation; the
land will be cleared before the construction of the plant together with other ancillary infrastructure occurs.

Component 2. 110 Kv Transmission Line
Thereafter, diesel generator sets that will be installed into the site will generate electricity that will be
connected into the national grid through the installation of a 110 kV transmission line from the new plant to
the existing national grid following interconnectivity to the Jabana substation. The transmission line will
include the erection of electricity towers and cables to channel the generated electricity via a high voltage
line to the substation for integration into the national grid. The space required for installing one tower is
225m2 and a total of 7 towers will be installed along the transmission route from the yet to be constructed
power plant to the Jabana substation.

The size of land necessary for actual installation of the plant will be approximately 120m by 140m in size.
However, there are other utility facilities including an engine hall, control building and a fuel handling house
that are needed in the installation of a power plant. Therefore, a total of 3.59 ha of land have been acquired
for the plant.

The land to be acquired for the transmission line is primarily for locating the pylon (towers) which normally
require 225m2 and altogether the total land that will be acquired for this according to the survey is 0.11 ha.
A detailed description of the activities expected to lead in the final installation of this facility is summarised
below.

Project Activities
The project activities will fall under planning, construction, operation and decommissioning phases. The
project specific activities will include the following;

Planning and Design Phase
Activities expected to occur during the planning and design phase of the project include;
     · Identification of project site including feasibility studies, site survey, soil testing, site mapping
          among others.
     · Acquisition of land for construction of the 20 MW power plant and its ancillary structures
     · Survey for a suitable path for installing the 110 kV transmission line from the proposed new diesel
          power plant to the existing Jabana substation.
     · Acquisition of land to locate the 110 kV 1.2 km long transmission line from the new proposed plant
          to the existing Jabana sub station.
     · Assessment, valuation and compensation of Project Affected Parties (PAPs) for loss of land,
          structures and crops as the case may be.



                                                                                                                3

Construction Phase
During the construction phase of the project the following activities will be undertaken namely;
      · Site clearing for the construction of the diesel power plant including its ancillary facilities
      · Clearing of path and establishing Right of Way (ROW) for locating the 110 kV 1.2 km transmission
          line
      · Excavation related works for construction of the diesel power plant
      · Construction of the diesel power plant and related ancillary facilities
      · Construction and installation of the transmission towers

The construction of the power plant and the 1.2 km transmission line shall also include related engineering
works, earthworks, and service utility buildings including an engine hall, control building, fuel handling house
and the installation of the transmission tower lines.

Site Clearing and Stripping
The construction work shall involve the clearing of areas required for permanent works. Stripping shall
include cutting and removal of topsoil, levelling and all other related works to strip off the site.

Excavation and Foundation
Ground excavations for the diesel power plant and the transmission line will be done to the lengths and
widths and exact depths as indicated on the drawings for the construction of the works. In cases where the
bearing capacity of the subsoil under foundations or roads is insufficient, the excavation shall be continued
to such greater depth as may be necessary. All excavation will be carried out mechanically, but the final
shaping and trimming of the sub grade below foundations, etc. shall be done by hand.

Backfilling
Filling of areas and around foundations and backfilling of trenches shall be executed in such a way and to
such extra depths as will ensure that final surfaces after settlement and compaction conforms to the
specified levels.

All fill material shall be well compacted by mechanical means until a high degree of compaction is obtained.
The filling material shall be placed in even layers of a depth not greater than 0.4m and each layer shall be
thoroughly compacted.

Road and Drainages
Access internal roads to the project site will be constructed by clearing and levelling the areas with suitable
materials for road construction. The internal roads shall be minimum 7 m wide, or otherwise allow transport
of the equipment, and turning of vehicles, within the area. The roads shall be connected to the existing
roads upon completion. The road shall be designed for trucks with a weight of 60 tons and 10 tons per
wheel. Provisions shall be made for adequate drainage of the roads covered drainage pipes, concrete
conduits and trenches for electric cables etc shall be provided as needed for the design.

Construction of Service Utility Buildings
A number of utility buildings will be constructed and will serve as auxiliary infrastructure to support the
generation of electricity in the power plant. They include;

Construction of shelter for the diesel plant
There will be construction for a shelter facility for the diesel plant that will be installed in the project site.




                                                                                                                   4

Construction of building block for control purposes
A control block housing unit will also be constructed in the project site for the purposes of controlling the
operations of the diesel power plant.

Construction of access road & and drainage system for water
Access road to the project site will be constructed to provide entry to the plant during construction and
operation. There is an existing gravel road that is narrow and leads to the site after the main tarmac road.
This access road will be widened and rehabilitated to accommodate the huge trucks and other motorised
machinery like excavators and tippers that will be used during construction and operation. Suitable
sewerage works will also be constructed to provide for water and sanitation services.

Installation of fuel storage tanks
A series of 6 heavy and light fuel storage tanks will be installed in the project site and will be primarily used
for storing the fuel that will be for operating/driving the diesel generators to produce electricity.

Installation of generators, transformers & fuel lines
When the construction is finalised, the generators will be installed including the transformers and piping of
the fuel lines. A perimeter wall will also be built all around the project area for security reasons.

The diesel power plant project will have an installed capacity of 20MW being generated by 3 diesel
generators. The project will involve installing the generators and connecting to the main grid running on
Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO).         The equipments/generators to be installed at the project site will be sets of
generators, with a rated out put of 7.5 MVA and a rated voltage of 6.6 kV, rated current of 656 A, rated
frequency of 50 Hz with 0.8 lagging and a speed of 1000 rpm.

The plant shall have 2 sets of power transformers of 15 MVA, 6.6/110 Kv three phase, 50 HZ, two winding
oil immersed with on-load tap charger complete with accessories under natural-oil-circulation and natural-air
cooled operation referred to the 110 kV side of the transformer.

Construction of Transmission Line
There will be construction of a 110Kv transmission line that will be 1.2km long which will connect the new
20MW plant to the Jabana substation. The transmission line will transmit the electricity generated by the
plant to the Jabana substation that is 1.2km away which will then be stepped down and distributed to the
households and other institutions targeted.

The construction of the transmission line will entail surveying of the possible route for the line before land
clearing to create a Right of Way (ROW). Transmission towers and electric cables will be erected and
installed along the route from the proposed diesel plant to the existing Jabana substation which is 1.2km
away.

The ROW will be standard in terms of size according to the international standards for ROW which is 7m by
7m for horizontal and vertical land clearance. There will be land acquisition and destruction of crops and
trees that will be along the transmission route selected. Already survey of the transmission line route has
been done and a total of 0.11 ha of land will be acquired from 7 PAPs to create space for the ROW and the
erection of the 7 towers.

This 1.2km transmission line will not be funded under the bank loan but will be supported with funds from
the Government of Rwanda. Still, in spite of the different funding institutions, this report includes an analysis
of the potential adverse impacts of the transmission component from the new 20MW diesel plant to the


                                                                                                               5

existing substation. A separate Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) is also being prepared for
this component of the programme in accordance with the REMA regulations and requirements. The ARAP
for the transmission component will be submitted to the bank and REMA for approval.

Operation Phase
During the operation phase of the project activities to occur are mainly controlling and operating of the diesel
power plant, and subsequent generating of electricity. Activities related to operating the plant will include,
loading and unloading fuel oil in the tanks, running the diesel engines, regular maintenance works among
others.

Project Alternatives
The study assessed potential project alternatives in terms of
     · Project site alternative
     · Alternative project with capacity to achieve the same goal
     · Process or material alternatives: Materials and process alternative looked at fuel types available
          depending on the particular environmental effects
     · Technology alternative looked at solar, wind and hydro and other sources of electricity
     · No project alternative

Positive Impacts
The positive impacts of the project on socioeconomic development of the people in the area include
additional electricity for the region, provision of conditions for rational and effective use of natural resources
in the country, creation of new jobs for related services and direct workers, and acceleration of the
investment process in the country. The project will also contribute in reducing pressure on biomass which
comes from the scarce and fragile forest resources.

Although the installation of this diesel power plant is more expensive and will increase the cost of electricity
generation in a system which is hydro dominated, the increased cost of generating electricity is much less
in comparison to the cost on the economy of load shedding in absence of this project.

Adverse Impacts
Destruction of Vegetation and Crops
The proposed site for the construction of the diesel power plant and transmission line is located in an area
that is mainly under small scale mixed cropping mainly mangoes, sorghum, guavas, nappier grass among
others for subsistence by the land dwellers.

Specifically in the proposed site for constructing the diesel plant is a collection of eucalyptus trees that to a
great extent form a thicket of approximately 0.5 ha in size. Other trees in the plot are bamboo, grevillea,
jacaranda, and local tress species. Part of the trees in the site will have to be destroyed to pave way for
construction work related activities.

The transmission line or 1.2km path leading to the Jabana substation from the constructed diesel plant has
a variety of tree species (eucalyptus, napier grass, bamboo, grevillea) and crops grown by the land owners
for subsistence use (maize, beans, cassava) who will be compensated as per the RPF for the land acquired
and crops/trees destroyed to clear way for the line and Right of Way (ROW) area.

Land Acquisition
The proposed project site for the construction of the plant in terms of land ownership belongs to Home of
Hope Rwanda which is a faith based institution and has plans to use the parcel of land for the construction
of a church and a children's orphanage centre. Home of Hope Rwanda legally acquired this land from two


                                                                                                                6

local owners who in spite of full compensation have not yet moved away from this site. The reason being,
Home of Hope do not as yet have immediate plans to commence the construction and have thus allowed
the previous owners to continued cultivating the well as to reside in the land until that time when they will be
informed to vacate the premise by Home of Hope Rwanda. Therefore, other than the crops and trees, two
houses made of burnt clay bricks are still present in the site. These will end up being demolished during the
construction of this plant and the families will have to re-settle elsewhere.

The transmission line runs along a 1.2 km path that is owned by 7 land owners following surveying done to
locate a route. The Right of Way (ROW) will be 7m by 7m in terms of vertical and horizontal clearance all
the way along the transmission path. There will also be electricity towers that will be installed along the path
and will be used to erect the electricity transmission cables. The size required for each transmission tower
is 225m2 and a total of 0.11 ha of land will be acquired by the project to install the towers. The total
consolidated land that will be acquired to create the ROW and area for the towers and the plant when
combined together is 3.7ha.

Air Emissions
The project will potentially have adverse impacts on air quality during operation mainly from stack gases
emitted. Emissions will be comprised of particulate matter (PM), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) at 59.5g/hr, oxides of
nitrogen (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), the Green House Gases (GHGs) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2), trace
amounts of various metals, and trace amounts of organic and inorganic compounds. The proportions and
amounts of pollutants emitted will depend on the fuel quality and condition of combustion.

Noise Pollution
Noise pollution from the operation of the generators is inevitable during the night and day periods. The noise
levels (sound pressure) of the generators inside the plant will 85 dBA. Even though noise modeling has not
been undertaken, the generators for the plant will be fully installed with silencers and containerized which in
effect will lead to insignificant noise impacts. The generators are designed to ensure that no more than 65
dBA of sound pressure is emitted within the plant boundary. Rwanda does not yet have noise emission
standards for this reason World Bank standards were used in determining the potential noise impact. The
project area in terms of land use is mainly a mix of agricultural, residential and commercial/industrial land
use where according to World Bank standards, a maximum level of 45-55dBA is allowed for residential and
institutions during the day and night and 70 is allowed for industrial area.

There are 3 houses within a radius of 50 metres from the plant fence on the northern part of the project site,
and 4 other households within a radius of 1 km from the plant boundary. These households combined have
a total of 35 people residing in the dwellings. Section 3.1.1 provides a sketch map of the project site and
related households including the nearby Nyabugogo wetland.

Given the fact that the plant is designed to emit no more than 65 decibel within the boundary, the noise
impacts will moderately impact on the residents in the 3 households within the 50 m radius. However,
according to the engine design the plant will not emit more than 75dBA within a distance of 10 metres from
the plant boundary. Therefore the residents that are within a distance of 50 metres from the plant boundary
will not be impacted by the noise. At the commissioning of the project, the contractor is bound by the
contract documents to undertake noise emission tests at a distance of 10 metres interval from the plant
boundary up to 500metres to determine noise impact at full load capacity. This test will determine if indeed
the specifications presented by the contractor is correct. If the noise level is found to be above the
standards for residential/institution then these residents will have to be relocated.




                                                                                                              7

Fire Hazards
Potential adverse impacts related to fire hazards remain a main feature of this project during the operation
phase of this facility. The plant will deal with combustible products and the risk associated with fire
occurrences form a significant adverse impact and risk on the human health and environment.

Soil Erosion
There is a likelihood of localized soil erosion during the civil works which entail compacting, earth
excavations and moving works. However, these impacts will be largely localized to the project area and will
only occur during the construction phase.

Oil Spills
The transferring of the Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) and Automotive Diesel Oil (ADO) also known as ordinary
diesel from the tankers and pumping for use to the generator sets could result in oil spills around the tank
storage areas. This could lead to potential contamination of soil and for this reason; mitigation measures will
be put in place to manage any accidental spills.

Waste and Waste oil pollution
Waste oil is also an output of the project that poses potential environmental hazard in case of poor handling
and disposal methods. Poor disposal of waste oil filters also has a potential of adversely affecting the
environment through soil contamination.

Workers Health and Safety
Adverse impacts on the workers health and safety is likely to occur especially through workers interaction
with the equipments and machines during construction and operation of the plant. Accidents are likely to
occur during construction and operations when the equipments are in use, and further to this if workers are
exposed to the air emissions and incessant noise of the equipments could lead to potential harm on health
of the workers.

Traffic Congestion
During the construction phase, heavy moving vehicles in and out of the project site are likely to increase
traffic along the Kigali ­Byumba-Gatuna ­Uganda road and could cause congestion.

General Environmental Management Conditions and Measures
The annex section F of this report contains generalized environmental management conditions that the
contractor will be obligated to fulfill. These are general conditions providing an overall guidance and
conditions to ensure environmental safeguards. However, specific mitigation measures are also highlighted
and are included in summary below with the detailed mitigation measures found in the EMP section.

Specific Mitigation Measures
Compensation for Land
The land to be acquired for the construction of the power plant belongs to the Home of Hope Rwanda a faith
based organization with plans to construct a church and an orphanage in the site. 4 other individuals also
own some small portion of land that the UERP/PCU intends to acquire for technical and security reasons.
Home of Hope Rwanda will have to be compensated for the land in accordance with the requirements set
out in the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) document. A separate Abbreviated Resettlement Action
Plan (ARAP) has been prepared and approved by the Bank.

Compensation for Loss of Crops and structures
The UERP/PCU will compensate for all the crops that will be destroyed to pave way for the construction at
the time of construction of the power plant.       This compensation will be calculated according to the



                                                                                                            8

Resettlement Framework Policy document. Compensation for the structures existing in the site will also be
undertaken in full compliance with the RPF.

Emissions Mitigation Measure(s)

   · UERP will create a buffer zone using trees which will serve as natural filters and sinks for the
        gaseous emissions emanating from the power plant.

   · Mitigation measures for emissions will include use of low sulphur fuel (0.5% sulphur content) that is
        recommended and also the generators will be fitted with filters and silencers to reduce flue gas
        emissions and noise impacts. These conditions have been specified in the tender documents and
        suppliers of the diesel power plant will be expected to meet these requirements.

   · Emissions will be controlled by limiting the sulphur content of the fuel by procuring fuel with low
        sulphur content and ensuring that the diesel engines procured meet the international emission
        standards as recommended by the International Pollution Centre.

   · Particulate emissions will be reduced through good combustion control to minimise the products of
        incomplete combustion.

   · Plant operators will be required to install and operate dedicated stack gas samplers or analyzers,
        and report both summary data and violations of standards or limits.

   · Source testing will also routinely required to confirm continued compliance with emission limits.

Noise Abatement Measures
   · All equipments and machinery installed must be tested to verify if they are compliant with the World
        Bank acceptable standards of noise as contained in the World Bank Pollution Prevention and
        Abatement Handbook (PPAH) 1998. The tested noise levels should be recorded as baseline and
        used for future monitoring.

   · Each diesel engine shall be provided with one exhaust silencer and the design will provide the
        required sound attenuation to meet the outside noise level requirements with minimum pressure
        loss. The silencer and the exhaust gas piping shall be provided with condensation drain traps at
        low points. Horizontal pipes shall incline downwards away from the engine.

   · The contractor shall state the noise level of the radiator coolers in dB(A) in one meter distance at
        full radiator load.

   · Noise emitting equipment should comply with the applicable Rwanda and World Bank noise
        standards and should be properly maintained. The World Bank environmental regulations allow a
        maximum 70 dB noise level in industrial or commercial zones and between 45-55 dB for residential
        areas. The diesel engines have been designed to emit noise of 85dB inside of the plant and 60-65
        at the plant boundary. This means that the plant will adhere to the World Bank maximum noise
        level requirements for plant boundary. In terms of maximum noise level for residential area, the
        project site is a mix of industrial/commercial and residential area. Within a radius of 1 km from the
        plant boundary there are 7 houses. However the closest structures are 3 residential houses within
        a distance of 50 metres from the plant boundary. According to the design of the plant, no more
        than 70 dBA can be emitted by the engines at a distance of 10metres from the plant boundary.
        This means that the residential structures standing at a distance of 50 metres will not be impacted



                                                                                                           9

       by the noise. However as stated the contractors is required by the client to conduct noise test once
       the plant is commissioned within a radius of 500metres to verify if indeed the specifications of the
       engines are correct. This will be done and if the results indicate standards above the bank's
       specification, the 3 residents will be compensated and relocated as required by the RPF.

    · All workers in the project site must be equipped with the necessary and required Personal
       Protective Equipment (PPE) prescribed by the Directorate of Occupation Health and Safety of the
       Ministry of Health but not limited to facilities to protect against noise impacts, ear muffs, safety
       helmets, hearing protection etc.

Soil Erosion Mitigation Measure(s)
    · The final site grade should facilitate drainage and avoid flooding and pooling. A site drainage plan
       should be developed to protect against erosion through storm water. Protecting stockpiles through
       the use of silt fencing and reduced slope angles should be used to minimize soil erosion during
       construction and the storm water channeled into the drainage developed.

    · Installation of drainage ditches, construction of runoff and retention ponds is necessary.
       Minimization of disturbances and scarification of the surface should be observed to reduce erosion
       impacts.

    · Borrow pit areas (if any) should avoid other non site areas; borrow areas should be reworked to
       blend into the surroundings. Re-vegetation should be performed using local plants. All slopes and
       working surfaces should be returned to a stable condition.

Oil Spill Mitigation Measure(s)
    · To prevent oil spills and environmental contamination, the power plant and pipelines should be
       designed with spill prevention and detection systems to protect the environment. With spill
       prevention and protection measures there should no adverse effects to the ground and surface
       water and soil.

    · Storage and liquid impoundment areas for fuels, raw and in-process material solvents, wastes and
       finished products should be designed with secondary containment (e.g. dikes) to prevent spills and
       the contamination of soil, ground and surface water.

    · A written emergency response plan should be prepared and retained on the site and the workers
       should be trained to follow specific procedures in the event of a spill.

    · For the waste oil or used oil, the company contracted to supply the oil will collect this used oil for
       proper disposal. In the Environmental Management Plan (EMP), disposal of used oil will be the
       responsibility of the supplier.    All waste oils and lubricants from maintenance of construction
       equipment should be segregated and disposed properly in accordance with the solid waste
       disposal plan.

    · The proponent will identify a reputable company to handle disposal of oil filters. These filters will be
       stored on site under lock before they are collected by the agent of the company for proper disposal.
       The contacting company should ensure that the filters are properly disposed and should apply the
       principle of cradle to grave.




                                                                                                           10

Dust Emission Mitigation Measure(s)
     · Fugitive emissions from roads and site work to be eliminated or minimized by applying water on a
         need to need basis to dirt roads, unpaved surfaces and exposed construction areas during the dry
         season.

Flue Gas Mitigation Measure(s)
To mitigate the effects of flue gas affecting the micro-climate of the area, the stack chimney of the
generators have been designed to reach a height 30 metres. This will enable plume dispersal to be high
preventing smoke and heat from affecting the surrounding area. A 30 metres high chimney for a diesel
power plant is the recommended height by the International Pollution Centre for avoiding plume effect. The
generator sets will be provided with embedded temperature detectors of at least six for stator winding and
one for each bearing. A temperature recorder will be provided to indicate the temperature as measured by
the embedded temperature detectors of generator windings and bearings.

As a long term mitigation measure to reduce emissions, carbon offsets programs should be pursued by the
proponent including plating of tress to act as carbon sinks, increasing efficiency and even purchasing
emission credits.

Workers Health and Safety Mitigation Measure(s)
     · All workers entering the construction site must be equipped with PPE including ear muffs, factory
         boots, overalls, gloves, dust masks, among others. The PPE should be those that meet the
         international standards of PPE.

     · Personal protection gear must be provided and its use made compulsory to all. The entire
         workforce of the plant should be trained in the use of protective gear, handling of chemical
         products and acid storage cells, electric safety equipment, procedures for entering enclosed areas,
         fire protection and prevention, emergency response and care procedures. Training given to the
         employees should be backed by regular on- site training in safety measures.

     · `Restricted ENTRY' signs should be installed to keep away unqualified workers from access to
         restricted areas.

     · Machines and equipments must be operated only by qualified staff and a site supervisor should be
         on site at all times to ensure adherence.

     · The contactor must develop a workers Health and Safety Manual for which all the workers should
         be conversant with for response in case of accidents.

     · The contractor and UERP should develop an Emergency Response Plan for handling any
         emergencies arising thereof during the construction.

Fire Suppression Measure(s)
The construction site must contain fire fighting equipments of recommended standards and in key strategic
points all over the site. Fire pumps, hydrants, sprinkler/water spray systems, hose houses, dry chemical
systems, carbon dioxide systems, detection/alarm systems and portable fire extinguishers are all specified
in the tender documents as necessary in the plant. All these fire suppression equipments are required in a
power plant and must all be present at key strategic points. The contractor is expected to provide all these
equipment for fire suppression as stipulated in the tender documents.




                                                                                                         11

A fire evacuation plan should be developed by UERP/ELECTROGAZ and must be posted in various points
of the construction site including procedures to follow when a fire is reported. All workers must be trained on
fire management and fire drills undertaken regularly.

Solid waste pollution and littering
     · The Contractor and UERP should develop a solid waste disposal plan which includes the provision
         of receptacles at strategic points within the construction site, recycling programmes for recyclable
         wastes, separation of wastes.

     · The contractor and UERP should engage a refuse handling company to remove the wastes from
         the site to the recommended waste management site.

     · Warning signs against littering and dumping in wrong places within the construction site should be
         erected by the contactor.

Accidents at the work place from operating of machineries and equipment by
workers

     · Personal protection gear will be provided and its use made compulsory to all. The entire workforce
         of the plant should be trained in the use of protective gear, handling of chemical products and acid
         storage cells, electric safety equipment, procedures for entering enclosed areas, fire protection and
         prevention, emergency response and care procedures.

     · Training given to the employees should be backed by regular on- site training in safety measures

     · Restricted ENTRY signs should be installed to keep away unqualified workers from access to
         restricted areas.

     · UERP should construct a perimeter fence all around the project site to keep of and restrict
         unauthorised persons from the site. This will reduce accidents that can be caused by unauthorised
         entry or encroachment.

     · Machines and equipments must be operated only by qualified staff and a site supervisor should be
         on site at all times to ensure adherence.

     · The contactor must develop a workers Health and Safety Manual for which all the workers should
         be conversant with for response in case of accidents.

     · The contractor should develop an Emergency Response Plan for handling any emergencies arising
         thereof during the operation.

Monitoring Plan
The EMP proposes parameters to be monitored during preparation, operation and decommissioning of the
plant. Noise levels should be monitored from different sensitive receptors. Soils within and without the area
should also be monitored for oil spills. Storm water from the site should also be monitored of oil traces to
prevent surface and groundwater contamination.

Emissions from the plant also should be monitored. Parameters to be monitored should include Volatile
Organic Compounds (VOC), Particulate Matter (PM), SO2 and NO2.




                                                                                                            12

Conclusion and Recommendations
On the basis of the EIA/EMP study of the diesel power plant, the following conclusions have been drawn by
the UERP/PCU Safeguards Advisor:

    · The project in the short term is environmentally feasible with the implementation of the mitigation
        measures prescribed in the EMP. The benefit of the project outweighs the costs of the project and
        being an emergency stop gap measure to save the country from long term outages, the
        environmental implications can be mitigated against the costs of the project on environment.
    · The contractor's tender documents have elaborately spelt out the mitigation requirements against
        environmental degradation during construction and installation and thus serve as a good basis for
        developing the EMP.


Recommendations
    · An Environmental Audit (EA) should be conducted annually to review compliance to the proposed
        Environmental Management Plan.           According the EIA regulations of REMA, an annual
        environmental audit must be conducted at the end of every year once the diesel plant begins
        operating. The audit will be conducted by registered REMA consultants or the environmental
        safeguards advisor as required by the Organic Law on environmental protection.

    · The goal of this EA is to establish and ascertain the extent to which the project achieved
        compliance with the environmental mitigation measures and requirements that were specified in
        the approved EIA report and make recommendations for correcting any problematic or non-
        compliant activities.

    · It is expected as required by the REMA EIA regulations that the cost of the environmental audit will
        be paid for by the client in this case ELECTROGAZ who will engage competent registered
        consultants.


REMA Approval
This EIA report has been submitted to Rwanda Environment Management Authority for approval and
required approval and go ahead to proceed with the project with conditions have been accorded by REMA
upon review of the report. These conditions for approval are included in the annex J section of this report.

INTRODUCTION
Energy is crucial to Rwanda's economic growth. In Rwanda, electricity is the second most important source
of commercial energy for the formal sector after petroleum fuels. Commercial and industrial establishments
as well as institutions and households in the country use electricity.

Rwanda remains among the lowest per capita electricity and petroleum products consumption countries in
the world. Only about 65,000 (6-8percent) of households have access to grid supplied power, almost
entirely in the main urban areas. Diesel remains the primary fuel for self-generation in rural areas, and also
fro back up in urban areas during the current crisis, and kerosene for lighting for the vast majority.

Grid extension has been extremely limited, and economically justified only to meet rural industrial loads and
emerging population clusters.

Rwanda's post conflict genocide economic recovery is under threat from severe power supply shortages. A
combination of strong demand growth with unexpectedly low water levels in its hydro power sourced lakes
further exacerbated by high technical losses and unreliability of ELECTROGAZ dilapidated network, have
led to extensive and lengthy power cuts.

Despite re-commissioning of an old diesel power plant, load shedding has increased to about 25% of peak
demand with serious adverse consequences. Supply shortages have raised the cost of doing business, in
particular for short export enterprises, and weakened the prospect of attracting new investments. Power
supply shortages have also worsened water supply problems in the main urban areas, leaving
ELECTROGAZ to switch to diesel water pumping and adding to its financial woes.

Rwanda already imports 60% of its electricity needs, mostly from SNEL and Sinelac plants in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, and there is a little scope to increase this further. In the near term before
any new hydro or gas based power can be brought on line, Rwanda will have to increasingly rely on higher
costs diesel power (about 150USc/kWh compared to 2003 average bulk supply cost of around 5USc/kwh).

Urbanization and industrial growth, combined with limited access to electricity and high cost of petroleum
products have led to an even more rapid growth in urban charcoal demand. Severe deforestation during
conflict, in part by internally displaced persons and returning refugees has been further compounded by the
large scale demands for charcoal making, construction materials, and agro industrial, institutional and
commercial customers.

By the end of 2004 Rwanda has faced year energy crisis that has never happened before. The Government
Rwanda of (GoR) through ELECTROGAZ has managed to mitigate the crisis by putting in place diesel
power plants with additional capacity of about 12.5 MWS. The effort to get rid of the deficit has continued.
As part of the strategy of the Government of Rwanda to arrest the energy crisis in the country, the GoR has
asked the World Bank for support of its Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP). The overall
development objectives of the proposed project are to: (i) Alleviate the power shortages: and (ii) enhance
the capabilities of energy sector institutions.

The UERP project is intended to further mitigate the power crisis in Rwanda and to help to restore good
utility practice at the heart of its facilities. The project is being coordinated by the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) housed in ELECTROGAZ and which works under the overall responsibility of a Steering Committee
chaired by the Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA).




                                                                                                              16

The diesel power project expected to produce 20 MW is one of the proposed projects under the World Bank
funding expected to contribute to the alleviation of power shortages in Rwanda.




                                                                                                    17

STUDY SCOPE AND
METHODOLOGY

The scope of the study was determined by the influence of the potential impacts and stakeholders input.
The terms of reference also helped in shaping the scope as well as the methodology to be applied in
assessing the impacts.

The study was undertaken in Jabana area and its environs. The area falls within the Cyerere Cell, Kabuye
Sector of Gasabo District, Kigali City in the Republic of Rwanda.

2.1 Study Scope
A rapid scoping study was undertaken at the beginning of the study. This exercise helped the EIA to define
the spatial and contextual scope of the study.

The scoping process helped the EIA identify the issues that were likely to be of priority importance during
the study and eliminates those that were of little concern. The rapid scoping exercise also enabled the
consultants identify the stakeholders and public concerns.

Scoping exercise also helped in introducing the project to stakeholders and involving them in determining
the scope and focus of the EIA study.

2.2 Methodology
Baseline Assessment
Baseline data was collected from secondary data and primary data. Data collected included information on
physical environment, soils; biological environment: flora; fauna; including significant natural sites etc.;
socio-cultural environment: population, land use.

Project Alternatives
The EA analysed the various project alternatives available to achieve this project's objectives but with the
least adverse environmental impacts. The alternatives were identified and evaluated determining impacts
and cost implications of each alternative. Alternatives assessed during this process included; Alternative
sources of energy including renewable energy sources other than generators; site alternatives in project
location particularly with regards to location based impacts and land use conflicts was assessed; process
alternatives including evaluation of the alternatives in process open to the project with an objective of
minimising raw material use, waste generation and energy requirements; technology alternatives examining
any alternatives in technology to generate electricity open to the project and alternatives in equipment and
facilities so as to determine best affordable options and finally; a No Project alternative was also assessed
to determine the impact of this No Project Scenario.

Public Consultation
During the scoping process, a stakeholder mapping exercises was undertaken to identify Interested and
Affected Parties (I&AP) to the project. The mapping exercise was conducted simultaneously with the
scoping exercise. The exercise identified all the stakeholders in the area. After identifying the relevant
stakeholders, a gleaning exercise was undertaken to do away with those who would not be impacted both
positively and adversely.


                                                                                                          18

The stakeholders' consultation also helped in highlighting the serious socio-economic and environmental
concerns and impacts that could arise from the project and was instrumental in helping to come up with
feasible mitigation measures. During the stakeholder consultation process issues raised were noted and
responses provided as appropriate as possible.

Impact Prediction and Evaluation
Various methods and techniques were applied in impact identification, prediction and evaluation. The EA
identified and analysed potential impacts linking these with specific project activities and phase.




                                                                                                      19

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION AND
BASELINE DATA


This chapter gives a general background and information of the project area as a whole then narrows down
to project specific site in terms of its location, administrative set-up, climate, settlement patterns, and the
major environment attributes, which will play a crucial role in the identification and development of the
project.

Geographical Location
Kigali City, the capital of Rwanda, is situated almost in the centre of the country. Its geographical position is
on Latitude 1º 57'S and on longitude 30º 04' E. Kigali city is situated in the natural region called
Bwanacyambwe within the proximity of the Nyabugogo river basin, between Mount Kigali (1852 m high) and
Mount Jali.

The city is built on interlocking hills, which progressively converge and are separated from each other by
large valleys giving them oval shapes. Originally the city occupied the hills of Nyarugenge and Nyamirambo
which covered an area of about 200 hectares at the time of independence.

The city stretches from the centre to include the following:
     · Towards the east, the hills if Kacyiru, Kimihurura, Mburabuturo, Nyarutarama, Remera and
          Kanombe.
     · Towards the south over the slope of mount Nyarutarama.
     · Towards the west over the slope of mount Kigali, on slopes of Kabusunzu hills, Kimisagara and
          Butamwa and towards the north over the slopes of mount Jali and hills of Gisozi, Gaculiro, Kagugu
          and Kibagabaga.

Administrative Divisions
The actual urban provincial boundaries of Kigali as defined by the decree No. 896/90 of 1990 was
composed of three communes (districts) namely: Nyarugenge, Kicukiro, and Kacyiru. These communes
comprised of a total of 20 sectors and 91 cellules. Today the city is made up of 8 districts (communes),
namely: Nyarugenge, Kacyiru, Nyamirambo, Kicukiro, Gikondo, Kanombe, Gisozi and Butamwa.

Population
The population of Kigali city has been growing over the last two decades, but a new growth trend developed
after the 1994 war and genocide, when there was a dramatic rise in the population caused by the return of
Rwandans from various parts of the World. Most of the returning Rwandans tended to go to the capital
where there was considerable security. The population growth of Kigali City was estimated by different
surveys carried out through out the country as follows: In 1960, the population was 6,000 peoples growing
to 235,664 in 1991 and more than doubled between 1991 and 2000 reaching a figure of 604,966 people.

It is further observed that in 2000, women constituted about 52 percent of the city's population and that
about 56 percent of the entire City's population was age below 20 years. They gives a dependence ratio of
1.4:1 i.e. the population which is below 20 and above 60 compared to that between 20 and 60 years of age
(one economically active person support about one and half persons who are non economically actives).



                                                                                                             20

The actual city population's annual growth is estimated to be 10%. The population growth in the city will
continue at this high rate because of the rural to urban migration tendency. It is estimated in the Kigali City
Master plan 2020 that only 43 percent of the city population were originally natives of the city, while 56.8%
had migrated from other areas as shown by the figure below. The 56.8% migrants to CoK were composed
of 14.6% who were born in other countries, 13.1% from Gitarama prefecture, 6.8% from Butare, 5.8% Kigali
rural and 16.6% from other prefectures.

Family Composition and Size
Kigali City is estimated to have 131,106 households and a total population of 604,966 inhabitants. The
average size of household is therefore 5 persons. It is estimated that 51% of heads of household are male
while 44% are women and 5% are children.

Education Level
The socio-economic survey of August 2000 shows that 10% of Kigali City's population aged 7 years and
above has never had any formal education, 54% have primary education and 5% have post-secondary
education. The level of education is extremely low and therefore the majority of urban dwellers lack the
knowledge and skills to work productively in an urban environment. Most of the people lack capacity to
utilise available and useful information to reduce the poverty that is permeating their lives.

Land use by type
The total planned area is about 47.21%, covering only 1666 hectares and non-planned area is about 52,
69%, which covers 1859, 3 hectares.

The new urban area of Kigali City is around 349 km2, consisting of original area of 112 km2, which was
defined by decree-law no 11/97 of 20/04/1979, and modified by the presidential order no 896/90 of
27/11/1990 to include additional area of about 237 km2.

Specific Site Description
The proposed site for the 20 MW power plant is located in the City of Kigali about 1.2 km from the already
existing Jabana sub station. The site is located along Kigali-Byumba road which divides the area into
industrial and residential zones to the east and north respectively. On the Administrative plan, the site is
located in Gisozi District, Kabuye Sector in Cyerere Cell.

3.1 Physical Environment
This section of the study provides a general description of the Kigali city including climate, flora and fauna
as well as the physical environment.

3.1.1 Location
The proposed project is located along the main Kigali Byumba-Gatuna road in the city of Kigali of Gasabo
District.




                                                                                                           23

3.2 Biological Environment
3.2.1 Physical

The project site is located approximately 300m from the main tarmac road and slopes upwards to the north.
The soil from visual inspection is the hard type; however a detailed soil investigation is underway to
determine key soil characteristics.

The area has a cluster of eucalyptus trees of approximately 0.5 hectares in size that can be termed as
plantation of trees. The rest of the land has been transformed entirely into agricultural production through
the cultivation of bananas, beans and napier grass.

3.2.2 Flora
The plants that are observed in the project site include food crops like mangoes, guavas, sorghum, banana
tress, napier grass, and fruit trees like avocado among others. There are no natural floral species of plants
in the project area other than exotic eucalyptus thicket that has been grown in some parts of the project site.
Other tress in the site includes grevillea, jacaranda, bamboo and some indigenous tree species.




 Photo of trees and crops present in the project site (nappier grass, bananas, eucalyptus and grevillea).

3.2.3 Fauna
There are no animal species of importance within and around the site that would require specific
mentioning.

3.2.4 Sensitive Ecosystem
The Gikondo-Nyabugogo wetland traverses very close to the project site and can be sited approximately 2
kms from the project site. "The Gikondo and Nyabugogo wetland system forms part of inter-connected
water networks that belong to the Nyabugogo - Akagera Basin. Therefore, the wetland system serves as a
vital source of domestic water supply for the majority of homesteads. The Nyabugogo wetland is an
important resource and other than being part of the wider Akagera Basin, it is a vital source of water, habitat
for water fowls, and bird life and provides buffering capacity, source of natural papyrus, used for extensive
cultivation of rice among other ecological services.

3.3 Socio-Economic Environment

3.3.1 Population and Demography
The site identified for the construction of the power station is situated on the road paved Kigali-Byumba-
Gatuna and is about 1.2 kms from the existing Jabana substation. The population around the proposed



                                                                                                             24

project area is minimal and mainly constitute of the members of the staff of the Cooperative of the Rice
Growers of Kabuye (CORIKA), staff of a nearby sugar manufacturing factory of Kabuye, and the staff of the
existing substation at Jabana. About 1.2 km before the proposed project site, and adjacent to the existing
Jabana substation, there is an oil storage depot owned by Total, a health centre is nearby and a Catholic
Church parish. Also a primary and technical secondary school can be observed around the project area.

3.3.2 Socio Economic Profile
The general project area is an agricultural, agro based and industrial centre combined together. One can
observe that the on going industrial activities and ventures in the project area mainly agro based in nature
including the existing sugar factory of Kabuye which is about 1km from the project site. There is a rice
milling factory owned by CORIKA. Agriculture mainly rice growing is carried out in the nearby Nyabugogo
River by the local population and organized groups like the CORIKA. Subsistence agriculture, mainly
growing of food crops like cassava, beans, maize, yams and others is also practiced by the local population.

The existing Jabana substation, the Kabuye Sugar Factory, the fuel station and the oil depot are all
indicative of the type of economic activities that can be profiled in the area. These activities are however
approximately 1.2 kms from the proposed project site. In the immediate surrounding of the project site, the
dominant activity is mainly subsistence agriculture.




Photo of the existing Jabana substation about 1.2kms from the proposed site for the 20MW plant
A number of restaurants and bars are also observed at about 1km from the project area and mainly provide
food and drinks to the workers in the mentioned enterprises as well as truck drivers who come to the fuel




                                                                                                         25

depot to stock and load oil. There is also a bank that serves the local industrial activities in terms of offering
financial services.

3.3.3 Land Uses
The major land uses around the proposed project area are industrial (agro-industry,) agriculture (large and
small scale), residential and commercial. Although the area is zoned as industrial there is a mix of different
land uses. Immediate surrounding (within a radius of 1 KM) of the proposed project site has residential and
subsistence farming as the dominant land uses. A total of 7houses are visible around the project site within
the plant boundary and on going cultivation of food crops demonstrates practise of small scale subsistence
agriculture.

At about 1.2km from the proposed site, a school, fuel station, oil depot, a sugar factory and a few scattered
residential houses can be observed. Other neighbouring land uses include residential, social and industrial.

PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

This chapter describe and examine the various alternatives available for the project. Alternatives examined
during the study included alternative sources of energy including renewable energy sources other than
generators, site alternatives in project location particularly with regards to location based impacts and land
use conflicts was assessed, process alternatives including evaluation of the alternatives in process open to
the project with an objective of minimising raw material use, waste generation and energy requirements,
Technology alternatives examining any alternatives in technology to generate electricity open to the project
and alternatives in equipment and facilities so as to determine best affordable options and finally a No
Project alternative was also assessed to determine the impact of this No Project Scenario.

Preferred Alternative-20MW Diesel Power Plant
Rwanda's post-genocide economic recovery is under threat from severe power supply shortages. A
combination of strong demand growth with unexpectedly low water levels in its hydro power sourced lakes,
further exacerbated by high technical losses and unreliability of ELECTROGAZ's dilapidated network, have
led to extensive and lengthy power cuts.

Rwanda is currently facing a deficit in energy of 50 MW. In order to overcome this deficit, the Government of
Rwanda is planning to curb this deficit by setting up 20MW diesel power plant which will then be connected
to the national grid.

The Government of Rwanda as part of its strategy to deal with this crisis has adopted an emergency action
plan (6-12 months) to normalize the power supply situation in the country. In addition to the expedited
procurement of 20MW of diesel generation capacity noted above, GoR has granted a temporary reduction
of some duties and taxes on ELECTROGAZ diesel purchases.

Despite re-commissioning of an old diesel plant, load shedding has increased to about 25% of peak
demand, with serious adverse consequences. Supply shortages have raised the cost of doing business, in
particular for short export enterprises, and weakened the prospects of attracting new investments. Power
supply shortages have also worsened water supply problems in the main urban areas, leaving
ELECTROGAZ to switch to diesel water pumping and adding to its financial woes.

The purpose of this project is thus to inject 20MW of electricity to the grid-using diesel generators running on
Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) as an urgent short term solution and mitigation measure. The construction is planned
to commence in the month of October 2007.

The decision to embark on the installation of an emergency diesel power generating plant to address the
acute energy crisis in the country was made by the GoR as the only quick intervention to the energy crisis
leading to the seeking of a loan from IDA. Definitely before IDA provided the loan to the GoR they must
have considered other options and overall project objective especially the currently crisis. So to a great
extent, the decision to install a diesel power plant was made by the GoR with the approval or consent from
the World Bank.

4.1 Alternative Fuel
The preferred fuels for operating this diesel engines is Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) and ordinary diesel oil also
known as Low Fuel Oil (LFO).        Low Fuel Oil will be used in small quantities to start the engines before
switching to HFO which will be used extensively for running the engines and generating the electricity.



                                                                                                             27

There are other different types of fuel available in the market that can be used for generating electricity
depending on the engine. These fuels have environmental and economic advantages and disadvantages
and can be used to run the diesel engines. Environmental advantages include low pollutant levels and
combustion efficiency while economic advantages include cost effectiveness. The alternative fuels that can
be used to run the diesel plant other than the HFO include; Low Fuel Oil (LFO), Industrial Diesel Oil (IDO);
and methane gas.

The diesel power plant will use Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) for running the generators. This is because HFO is
cheap and is not required in large quantities and volumes to run the generators unlike LFO which is
expensive and will be needed in great amounts. HFO is more viscous that it has to be heated, which
requires a special heating system, before use and it contains relatively high amounts of sulphur, which
forms sulphur dioxide upon combustion. However, its undesirable properties make it very cheap. In fact, it is
the cheapest liquid fuel available. HFO has less energy per litre than lighter fuels like ordinary diesel. The
plant will require about 400 litres of HFO daily when operating at 60-100% load capacity.

Ordinary Diesel Oil
The other fuels that can be used to run the generators as mentioned above include ordinary diesel oil and
industrial diesel oil. These are generally light and less viscous oil that do not require prior heating to make
them less viscous and light. They do not also contain as much sulphur content as the HFO. One of the
most important characteristics of diesel oil is its low-temperature behaviour. Sulphur content in ordinary
diesel oil produced today contains at most 50, in respect 10 mg/kg. However, they are very expensive and
will be required in such large quantities that it will be unsustainable economically to run the generators on
this fuel type. It is for this reason that the use of ordinary diesel oil to run the plant at 100% load was not
considered. Instead ordinary diesel will be used only when starting and shutting down the plant.

The sulfur content of HFO and diesel fuels commercially used in Rwanda is provided in the table below.

Methane Gas
UERP and ELECTROGAZ intend some time in future to convert the 20 MW diesel power plant to use
methane gas instead of HFO. The existing equipment that will be procured can also run on methane gas
subject to certain modifications. This is a long term plan and is dependent on the quantities of methane gas
produced in Lake Kivu. Extraction of methane gas in Lake Kivu is still at the exploratory stage and therefore
cannot solve the urgent energy crisis. However methane gas is highly considered as a clean energy and
the conversion of the plant from diesel to methane will greatly contribute to clean energy options.

According to the tender documents, the contractor is expected to supply a diesel engine that can operate on
diesel oil and later convert to methane gas.

In conclusion therefore, HFO was chosen as the fuel type of choice owing to its affordability even though not
necessarily the best or most environmentally sound. The construction of the diesel run power plant is
though an IDA loan, where funds have already been committed and there is very little or no opportunity to
provide for more funding for using a different type of fuel that can be much cleaner. Ordinary diesel oil will
be used but in very small quantity in starting and shutting down the plant.

4.2 Alternative Site(s)
Assessment of the proposed site and comparing with other alternative site was considered in this study. In
the assessment, land use and environmental impacts and technical feasibility of the two were used to arrive
to a viable alternative.

As a general conventional rule, diesel power plants should be ideally located very close to or within a sub
station. This way, the energy generated from the power plant is directly directed to the sub station under HV
to the substation for its integration into the national grid. Locating a power generation plant too far away sub
stations will involve the construction of a transmission line which brings with it additional cost investments.

Therefore, the selection of an appropriate site for locating the power plant was influenced by the present
location of available substations in Kigali.

Kigali is currently supplied in electric power by several substations namely:

     1.    Gikondo Substation Site
     The 110kV substation of Gikondo is situated in the center of Kigali city and is located in a densely
     populated area and is the most important substations, serving the biggest load in Kigali and the country.



                                                                                                              29

     The sub station site lacks adequate space for locating the plant and would require a lot of
     compensation hence costly. For this reason it does not become a very appropriate site alternative for
     locating the proposed diesel power plant.

     2.   Gasogi Substation Site
     The Gasogi Substation in the East Kigali is located at a ridge which is not suitable for locating a new
     substation and an extension, mainly because of the challenges that will be experienced in the
     transportation of bulk goods and equipment. Poor accessibility of roads does not favor location of such
     a facility and for this reason it was rejected. Locating the plant here would entail construction of longer
     access roads that would increase the project cost.

     3.   Mt. Kigali Substation Site
     The Mt Kigali Substation located at the South of the city of Kigali is right inside and within a town
     housing development area thus making it unsuitable in terms of location for any extension for that
     matter.

     4.   Jabana Substation Site
     The Jabana Substation, which would be the next the preferred choice of site is situated in the West
     (Byumba Road) with the incoming line from the Mukungwa Ntaruka and Hydropower stations, and was
     established in 1960 and rehabilitated in the mid 80s. The 70 kV line to the East Rwanda has its origin at
     this substation. However, this site is next to an existing swamp and therefore siting it in this area would
     lead to possible environmental risk. REMA would not also approve having the project in this site as the
     new law (Organic Law) does not allow for construction in wetlands.

     5.   Preferred Site
     The newly identified site which is about 1.2 kms from the previously proposed Jabana site is located in
     an area that is sparsely populated, is far from the Nyabugogo wetland, contains hard soil, is spacious
     and thus provides the best alternative in terms of site selection.

Due to the above reason, the new proposed site that is about 1.2 km from the previously proposed Jabana
site in comparison to the other sites presents the most appropriate site for locating the new diesel power
plant.

4.3 Alternative Energy Generation Sources
The project being an emergency intervention to the energy sector in Rwanda, alternatives that are available
for similar objective of the project are quite few. Actually all the alternatives sources of energy discussed
below cannot solve the quick attention and solution needed to arrest the energy crisis.               Still these
alternatives however remote have been discussed as an indicator that due consideration was given to
alternative sources of energy before deciding upon the preferred alternative.

Wind and Solar: There is little potential for wind-generated electricity to contribute to the national network,
as Rwanda is not favored with a windy climate. While Rwanda does have potential for solar electricity
generation, the potential for solar power as a significant provider to the national network is low due to its
comparatively high kW/h purchase price. Thus, at present in Rwanda, wind and solar, along with micro and
mini hydro, are considered to be viable sources of electricity primarily for rural, off-grid people but not for
large-scale, reliable, base load power. For example, in Kenya, more rural homes rely on photovoltaic (pv)
systems for electricity, than rely on the grid. The Photovoltaic Market Transformation Initiative (PVMTI) of
the International Finance Corporation and the Global Environment Facility has been present in Kenya since
1998, with the aim to promote the sustainable commercialization of photovoltaic technology in the
developing world by providing examples of successful and replicable business models that can be financed
on a commercial basis.


                                                                                                              30

Biomass
With a population characterized by low household incomes and low purchasing power of consumers
preventing the trading of commercial forms of energy, Biomass ­ mainly firewood, charcoal and crop
residues ­ accounts for 95% of traditional energy consumed in the urban and in the rural areas owing to low
economic capacity to import other alternatives, and also owing to low technological capacity to develop
alternative sources of higher energy intensity such as natural gas and hydropower.

As a consequence, households and medium scale enterprises are forced to utilize charcoal, firewood, and
agricultural residues as the only source and choice of process energy for their home use and businesses.
The situation has resulted into the hillsides being denuded of trees, causing serious erosion, which in part
has led to decreasing agricultural productivity of the arable land. Use of biomass is not able to solve the
national acute energy problem in the country and is thus not a favoured short term objective.

Lake Kivu Methane Gas
For the long term, the GoR has signed an agreement with a private company to develop methane gas from
Lake Kivu for power generation; it will bring to the grid some 30 MW in 2007.

The exploitation of the natural gas resource at Lake Kivu (some 55 billion m3 of methane) remains the
GoR's priority. Lake Kivu is regarded as the best alternative for a number of reasons including its relatively
low construction cost and short lead time, its relatively low estimated operating costs, its potential for serial
development in response to Rwanda's changing demand need and its diversification away from hydro
power.

The methane resource is also attractive from a global environmental view, as the replacement of fossil fuels
by methane would lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Methane could also possibly be used in
the future as a fuel source in various industries and also as an automotive fuel and such uses would all have
net positive environmental impacts. Further, a methane fired generation facility would provide as by-
production ammonia, which could be used to generate a fertilizer industrial facility. Having identified Lake
Kivu as its preferred alternative energy source the GoR has been limited in the development of this initiative
due to lack of sufficient funds.

However, as mentioned earlier, the energy crisis in Rwanda necessitated the urgent need for a project that
could stem the crisis on a short term basis as other options are getting explored. Methane gas in Lake Kivu
is still at the exploratory stages and thus cannot be relied upon to resolve the energy crisis.

Geothermal
Located in Cyangugu and Gisenyi the resources can provide between 170MW and 320 MW. This project is
still under feasibility studies and cannot address the emergency power problem in Rwanda which needs
urgent intervention.

Peat
With 150 million tonnes potential, the GoR has already signed a contract with Canadian company for
potential studies. This project is still under feasibility studies and cannot address the emergency power
problem in Rwanda which needs urgent intervention.

Hydro Power Projects
Development of hydro schemes are considered to be the most economical source of reliable and
sustainable electricity for the grid in Rwanda in the medium to long term, with the cost of generation much
less than diesel generation. The Regional Rusumo Hydro Power Falls Project to be funded by the World
Bank and expected to be completed in 2011 will inject an increased capacity of electricity to the GoR. Other


                                                                                                             31

hydro power projects in the pipeline include, Rukarara, Nyabarongo and other small micro hydro dams that
again will take a few years before they are commissioned. However, all these hydro schemes are at the
feasibility stage where environmental assessment studies are currently under preparations. They cannot
therefore solve the crisis in Rwanda because they are all planned to be commissioned by 2012-2015.

4.4 Alternative In-Put Materials
The process materials that are required by the proposed project include construction materials like cement,
sand, ballast etc during construction and HFO for running the plant during operation phase, water for cooling
the generators, lubricants for the engines and ordinary diesel oil for starting up the generators and shutting
down.

Water Utilisation
There are no alternative materials for cooling the engine jets and plant other than water. The generators
must be cooled and water is the only substance that can be used to cool the engines effectively and cost
effectively. So the task was to assess existing and alternatives water sources for use to cool the engines.
The study had 3 alternatives sources; piped municipal water; surface river water and rainwater.

55,000 litres needed as the base storage capacity of the cooling system meaning that during
commissioning, the storage tank will be filled with water upto a maximum of 55,000 litres. Thereafter the
diesel power plant requires 200 litres per day as top up and this will be through an automated system. This
water is poured into the radiators daily and it is recycled. A portable water treatment facility will be designed
in the water system of the diesel plant in order to purify the engine cooling water before using it is used.
Impure water is likely to spoil the efficient functioning of the plant or even breakdown. There will be no waste
water from the radiators that will require special disposal this is because the water will be recycled.

The plant operators will also require approximately 500 of water litres daily domestic use especially in the
staff quarters. The waste water from domestic use including from the toilet will be channelled into the
existing sewer line.

Surface water Option
Surface water from the nearby Nyabugogo River would be a viable option for the plant. However, the water
used to cool the engines requires purification in order to remove any impurities that could spoil the engines.
River water is generally impure and would require additional costs for purifying the river water. This water is
also used for agricultural irrigation and using it as an option would cause conflict or competition. For this
reason this option was rejected.

Rain Water Harvesting
Tapping and harvesting rainwater would also be an option but it would require the proponent to have a large
roof catchment surface.      The project should consider building a water tank for roof catchment as a
supplement for general washing and toilet use or as a back up during water shortages. This option is reliant
on availability of rain and hence cannot be fully considered as a stand alone source of water for the plant.
Hence this option was not rejected and should be considered.

Municipal Water (Preferred Option)
 Water supply from ELECTROGAZ thus is the only viable option for the project. The project intends to draw
water from the already existing water line which will be directed into the plant system including fire fighting
tank and the cooling tank. The water will still be treated before it is used to cool the plant and also for
domestic purposes.




                                                                                                              32

The use of municipal water in this diesel plant will impact on other water users who depend on the water
source but the impacts will be minor and not significant in terms of magnitude. This is because the plant
does not require a lot of water for cooling. The water used in cooling the diesel engines is recycled over and
over again.

The diesel plant thus requires 55,000 litres of water during the commencement of operation and thereafter it
will   requires 700 litres per day for daily use(domestic) and top up of the cooling plant. Rwanda's
ELECTROGAZ water supply is not going to be significantly affected or impacted by the withdrawal of 700
litres for use in the plant daily. The water will be abstracted from the Nyanze pump station in Kigali that
generates 30million litres of water per day. The 55,000 litres storage tank capacity also acts as a back up in
cases of water shortage. In principle the plant will only use 200 litres of water per day.

4.5 Combined Cycle Project
Another alternative technology is for the project to be converted into a combined cycle plant. Combined-
cycle plant produces electricity from two sources instead of one. When the exhaust from the combustion
turbine is used to make steam in a heat recovery steam generator this is called combined cycle. Both
sources of energy then drive turbines and electric generators to produce electricity. Integrating combustion
turbine and steam turbine technology provides an extremely efficient electricity production process.
Combined cycle is about 30 percent more efficient than a traditional steam plant.

A combined cycle project would operate cleaner and more efficiently than the fuel-powered units. As a
result, air emissions will be significantly reduced. However the project being an emergency plant and the
duration and costs of installing a combined cycle would not be feasible for the project objective.

Major advantages of combined cycle plant over the proposed project include

    I. higher thermal efficiency,
    II. lower fuel consumption,
   III. lower emission of NOx,
   IV. no SO2 and particulate matter emission,
    V. no solid waste generated such as coal ash,

Combine Cycle was not considered during the project conceptualization hence as an alternative it has not
been rejected and is a possible option that can be pursued. The fact that heat recovery was not considered
during the conceptualization phase does not rule out the possibilities of installing this technology in future. A
heat recovery plant can still be installed to capture the exhaust heat from the engines and used to generate
electricity projected to almost 1 MW at the moment. However, such recovery heat systems must be
connected to a nearby factory that would use the heat for running boilers immediately. This is the only
inadequacy in capturing the heat. There are no industrial plants nearby that can capture the heat and use it
right away. For this reason, this option cannot be explored right away. The sugar factory that is about 1km
from the site can be considered even though the distance is far away.

4.5.1 Energy Efficiency
Energy efficiency is using less energy to provide the same level of energy service. Efficient energy use is
achieved primarily by means of a more efficient technology or process rather than by changes in individual
behaviour. This is thus the idea of meeting energy needs by increasing efficiency instead of increasing
energy production.

The alternative energy section of this report has described the possible sources of alternative energy that
increase efficiency and lead to less emissions.


                                                                                                              33

In terms of energy efficiency at the domestic/household level, a UERP/ELECTROGAZ project is already
promoting the installation of fluorescent lights instead of incandescent lights to attain the same level of
illumination but with less energy use hence reduced emissions. Even though this is a viable alternative to
the existing project, it is not able to lead to the injection of more MW into the national grid which is needed to
address the current energy shortage in Rwanda. Hence it has not been really rejected because it is a
project running concurrent to the proposed diesel power plant, but it is not able to increase electricity supply
needed through increased efficiency.

There is need for the GoR to introduce other projects in the country that will increase efficiency in energy
use and should target the industrial sector, transport sector, manufacturing sector etc. Such programs will
play a great role in reducing emissions and associated impacts.

4.6 No Project Alternative
A no project scenario was also looked into in this study. The forgone costs of not having the project could
results in economic loses in terms of power cuts to industrial operations, agriculture and agro industries,
domestic operations among other targeted socio-economic activities of the proposed project.

The no-project scenario will mean the status quo of the area remains and no occurrence of adverse impacts
as well as positive impacts posed by the project implementation.

The no project option will have the forgone costs and benefits including
    · The targeted consumers will forgo improved electricity supply.
    · Generation of employment opportunities through expansion of business activities that would have
          been spurred by availability of electric power will occur.
    · The rural electrification programme will suffer.

LEGISLATIVE, POLICY AND
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

The chapter of the study reviews the relevant legal and institutional arrangements that would hinder or guide
the development of the project in line with the national and international laws. Rwanda being a signatory to
various international conventions and laws, it's important that national projects are in line with these laws
and as such some of the relevant international conventions are reviewed in this chapter.

5.1 Organic Law on Environment Protection and Management
The law sets out the general legal framework for environment protection and management in Rwanda. It
also constitutes environment as a one of the priority concerns of the Government of Rwanda. Under the
fundamental principle on national environmental protection policy develops national strategies, plans and
programs, aiming at ensuring the conservation and use of sustainable environmental resources.

The law gives right to every natural or legal person in Rwanda to live in a healthy and balanced
environment. They also have the obligation to contribute individually or collectively to safeguard country's
natural, historical and socio-cultural heritage.

The framework of the law on the protection and management of natural resources centres on avoiding and
reducing the disastrous consequences on environment. It measures result from an environmental evaluation
of policies, programs and projects, aimed at preventing the consequences of such activities.

The principle of sustainability of environment and equity among generation emphasizes human beings at
the core of sustainable development. They therefore, have a right to a healthy and productive life in
harmony with nature. They must so as to equitably meet the needs of the present and future generation.

The protection and management of environment is currently registered in the environmental organic law that
has been published in the official Rwanda newspaper in May 1st 2005.

MINITERRE which is the ministry responsible for the environment under the article 65 puts the in place
Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) which is the institution now charged with the
responsibility of ensuring environmental protection by demanding for EIA studies to be undertaken before
projects are executed.

The present organic law has the following objectives:

    · To protect human and natural environment;
    · To establish fundamental principles of management and protection of environment against all
          forms of degradation so as to develop natural resources and to fight all kinds of pollutions and
          nuisances;
    · To improve the living conditions of the population while preserving ecosystems            and available
          resources;




                                                                                                          35

     · To ensure sustainable environment and resources as well as rational and sustainable use of
          resources, taking into account the equality between the present and future generations;
     · To guarantee to all Rwandans an economically viable, ecologically rational and socially acceptable
          development;
     · To establish the precaution principle in order to reduce the negative effects on Environment and
          ensure the rehabilitation of degraded areas.

Chapter IV of the Organic Law Article 65 clearly calls for the need to subject projects to mandatory
Environmental Impact Assessment.

Article 3: States that every person has the duty to protect safeguard and promote environment. The State
shall protect, conserve and manage the environment.

Article 65: Further specifies that every project shall be subjected to environmental impact assessment prior
to its commencement. It shall be the same for programs, plans and policies likely to affect the environment.
Specific details of projects referred to in this Article shall be spelt out by the order of the Minister in charge of
environment.

Article 66:

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) shall include at least the following:

          · A brief description of the project and its variants.
          · Analysis of direct and indirect foreseeable consequences on the environment.
          · Analysis of the initial state of the environment.
          · Measures envisaged reducing, preventing or compensating for the consequences.
          · Reasons for the choice.
          · A summary of requisitions from clause1 to 5 of this article;
          · A definition of the evaluation and monitoring methods used regularly and environmental
               indicators before (initial state), during and after implementation of the project or, as the case
               may be, at the final evaluation stage of the project;
          · A financial evaluation of measures recommended preventing, reducing or compensating for
               the negative effects of the project on the environment and measures for regular monitoring
               and control of relevant environmental indicators.
Article 67:

States that the analysis and approval of environmental impact assessments is done by the Rwanda
Environmental Protection Authority or any other person given a written authorisation. The project promoter
shall pay a levy which shall be assessed from the amount invested or to be invested, excluding the amount
of operating cost. The assessment of this levy shall be fixed by law establishing the National Fund for the
Environment. The impact study shall be done at the expense and under the responsibility of the promoter.


The Organic Law also puts in place the National Fund of the Environment in Rwanda (FONERWA). The
composition, the working and the assignments of these institutions will be determined by particular laws.

The article 66 of the Organic Law on the environment specifies that it has created, to the level of the
Provinces, of the City of Kigali, of the Districts, the Cities, the Sectors and the Cells, Committees
responsible for the conservation and the protection of the environment. The composition, the working and
the assignments of these committees will be determined by Decree of the prime minister.

Title IV of Article 67 of the Organic Law requires that the execution of Policies, Plans and Projects must be
subject to mandatory EIA studies to identify the potential adverse impacts they could have on the
environment.


                                                                                                                 36

Further to this through the Ministerial Decree, a list of all the project that must be subjected to mandatory
EIA has been put in place under article 68 of the Organic Law. Article 30 further stipulates that works of
public or private construction as roads, dams etc must be subjected to EIA studies.

Article 69 of the Organic Law further specifies that the EIA studies undertaken must be submitted to REMA
for approval and the studies must be undertaken at the proponent's expense.

The Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 2007
REMA has now developed the EIA regulations which provide a guideline and requirements for EIA in
Rwanda. According to these new regulations Sub Article 1 makes it mandatory for all the projects listed
under schedule I to be subjected to a full scale EIA. The Sub Article further states that:

Sub Article 1) No environmental authorization shall be granted by the Authority for any project in Schedule I
to these Regulations if no environmental impact assessment has been submitted to the Authority in
accordance with the provisions of these Regulations.

Sub Article 2) states Any project listed under Impact Level III of Schedule I to these Regulations shall
require a full environmental impact assessment by the preparation of an environmental impact report, unless
the Authority refuses permission.      The construction of a power project facility is in this category and thus
must be subjected to full scale EIA.

Public Hearing Process
Article 47: The Authority shall on receipt of the developer's environmental impact report, arrange for a public
hearing to take place within twenty (20) working days from the first day of public notification, at which
relevant Lead Agencies, local governments, civil societies and concerned members of the public may
comment on the environmental impact report and express views on impact of the proposed development.
The Authority shall cover all costs incidental to the public hearing.

Article 48: All projects classified under Impact Level III shall be subjected to a public hearing prior to the
decision-making process.

5.2 Energy Policy
The national policy goal is to meet the energy challenges and needs of the Rwandan population for
economic and social development in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner.

Since 1994, the energy sector as well as the overall economy has gone through structural modifications,
where the role of the Government has changed, markets have been liberalised and private sector initiatives
encouraged. Hence, the energy policy document has to take into account structural changes in the economy
and political transformations at national and international levels.

The national policy objective for the development of the energy sector is to provide an input in the
development process by establishing an efficient energy production, procurement, transportation,
distribution, and end-user systems in an environmentally sound manner. The Energy Policy, therefore,
focuses on market mechanisms and means to reach the objective, and achieve an efficient energy sector
with a balance between national and commercial interests.

An interactive and participatory process between Government, other stakeholders and relevant groups has
been necessary as part of the formulation process in order to incorporate views of market actors and energy



                                                                                                              37

consumers to address the complex nature of the sector. Specifically, the energy policy takes into
consideration the need to;


(a) Have affordable and reliable energy supplies country wide;

(b) Reform the market for energy services and establishes an adequate institutional framework, which
facilitates investment, expansion of services, efficient pricing mechanisms and other financial incentives

(c) Enhance the development and utilisation of indigenous and renewable energy sources and technologies

(d) Adequately take into account environmental considerations for all energy activities

(e) Increase energy efficiency and conservation in all sectors; and


(f) Increase energy education and build gender-balanced capacity in energy planning, implementation and
monitoring.

Domestic energy demand has grown rapidly due to population growth and the increase in economic
activities especially during the last ten years

Biomass based fuels dominate the energy scenario, with an estimated 95% of the total energy supply made
up of firewood, charcoal, and agricultural residues. This is likely to remain so in the near or even medium
term future, unless income levels substantially increase. Lack of investment for about 20 years in electricity
generation capacity has resulted in severe capacity deficits in electricity supply in Rwanda. At the same
time, overuse of existing hydropower capacity has added a deficit in energy resources that not only
deteriorates electricity but also water supply, due to its effect on water pumping stations.

No new generating plant has been constructed in Rwanda since 1982 and, given the current electricity
supply shortage; new investment in generation is urgently needed. It has been clear for some time that
Rwanda's current energy crisis was looming due to the necessary over exploitation of hydropower water
resources in the preceding years. However, despite identifying multiple longer term investment opportunities
including Lake Kivu methane gas, Rusumo Falls, Nyabarongo and Rusizi III, only limited progress has been
made in securing funding for enhanced generation capacity.

Given that Rwanda is a land characterised by many hills and small rivers there is also significant potential
for the exploitation of micro-hydro power. Studies by the Ministry of Infrastructure have identified more than
160 sites with potential ranging from 20 KW to over 600 KW. There is also wind data that indicate there are
potential sites for wind farms. However, without rising incomes and greater disposable incomes it will be
some time before electricity be affordable by the rural communities. Transmission costs for small amounts of
electricity over larger distances will remain a barrier to connecting wind turbines to the Grid.

Studies have shown that there is a considerable quantity of peat existing in Rwanda, in the order of 155
million tonnes. However, there has been very little exploitation of peat due to technical and economic
difficulties, and also possible environmental impacts. Other renewable energy sources, but so far not fully
tapped, which could be harnessed to meet the growing energy requirements include solar and geothermal.

Rwanda continues to rely on imported petroleum products; Electricity generation is mainly hydro-based,
while diesel plants will soon provide 15 MW. Discussions on the development of Methane gas for electricity



                                                                                                           38

are ongoing. The dissemination of renewable energy technologies has been limited to the promotion of
improved stoves, improved charcoal production techniques, solar, biogas and to a lesser extent
photovoltaic. Initiatives to increase utilisation of peat for electricity generation and windmills are being
explored.

The vision of the energy sector is to effectively contribute to the growth of the national economy and thereby
improve the standard of living for the entire nation in a sustainable and environmentally sound manner.

The mission of the energy sector is to create conditions for the provision of safe, reliable, efficient, cost-
effective and environmentally appropriate energy services to all sectors on a sustainable basis.

By fulfilling its vision and mission, the energy sector will contribute to social economic development, and in
the long-term framework, poverty reduction.

The national energy policy objectives are to ensure availability of reliable and affordable energy supplies
and their use in a rational and sustainable manner in order to support national development goals. The
national energy policy, therefore, aims to establish an efficient energy production, procurement,
transportation, distribution and end-use systems in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner.

Short and medium term policy priority actions
The priority for Rwanda is to implement projects now, to overcome the current electricity crisis, to prevent
the next electricity crisis, to tackle proactively the wood crisis, to begin to provide greater access to modern
energy and to reduce reliance on petroleum products due to the oil price crisis. Without implementation
further capacity building and studies will have no value.

Our management and institutional capacity has to continue to progress if these projects are to be delivered
effectively and efficiently. This will require further external support and guidance.

Several policy actions will be implemented in order to achieve the broad and specific objectives of this
energy policy. Strategic financial interventions required to move forward the policy priority actions are
indicated alongside the proposed actions.

Priority policy actions

     1.    Meet the crisis of blackouts caused by delayed investment and drought

     2.    Provide economic power by developing the use of Lake Kivu methane, and by bringing on line
           more hydro power.

     3.    Enhance overall electrical infrastructure to meet demand growth and supply quality needs
           generation, transmission and major distribution construction and rehabilitation.

     4.    Deliver a programme of rural electrification on the basis of enhanced distribution networks, micro
           hydro, and solar power.

     5.    Implement a wood and charcoal efficiency and substitution strategy to counter the deforestation
           crisis.

    6.     Continue steady progress to a viable electricity and gas sector, consistent with meeting social
           needs.


                                                                                                             39

    7.    Commence utilisation of Kivu gas for other than power generation.

    8.    Determine options for response to oil prices and petroleum products costs, and their impact on the
          economy. Reduce reliance on petroleum products.

5.3 Land Policy
Apart from a few scattered land regulations, most of which date back to the colonial period, Rwanda has
never had a proper land policy nor has it ever had a land law, a situation that enhances the existing duality
between the very restrictive written law and the widely practised customary law, giving rise to insecurity,
instability and precariousness of land tenure.

The Rwandan Government, therefore, found it compelling and necessary to establish a national land policy
that would guarantee a safe and stable form of land tenure, and bring about a rational and planned use of
land while ensuring sound land management and an efficient land administration.


The following are the main obstacles that hinder the efficient management of land in Rwanda, necessitating
the establishment of a national land policy that would guide the essential land reforms:

· Strong pressure on the already spatially limited land resources by a rapidly growing population;

· Domination of the agricultural sector which lacks any specialization in terms of human resources and
  equipment, and lack of alternative concrete and realistic options that would reduce the pressure on land
  resource;

· A land tenure system dominated by customary law which favours land fragmentation, a practice which
  reduces further the size of the family farms which are already below the threshold of the average surface
  area that is economically viable;

    -         A considerable number of landless persons who have to be resettled at all costs

    -         Scattered farming plots that are difficult to manage due to the scattered mode of human
              settlement

    -         Lack of a reliable land registration system that would guarantee the security of land tenure;

    -         Weak and inadequate existing methods of land-use planning and land improvement (outline of
              land potential, land use and land development; reliable methods of soil and water
              conservation);

    -         Disorderly and fraudulent land transactions, necessitating the establishment of regulations that
              would enable the authorities to give to the land a recognised market value which brings
              considerable profit to the Government Treasury;

    -         Unplanned use of marshlands which, in spite of their good agricultural soil, cannot be wholly
              recovered for agricultural purposes, in view of the following factors:

              · Abundance of water which is necessary as a useful water reservoir;

              · The soil make-up, which does not lend itself easily to the current cultivation methods;


                                                                                                           40

              · The biotic environment and biodiversity which should be protected at all costs;

              · The obvious poor coordination among various institutions which use with land to support
                  their activities;

Currently, the land tenure system in Rwanda operates in a dual legal system: On one hand, there is:

     · The customary law, which governs almost all the rural land and promotes the excessive parcelling
         out of plots through the successive father-to-son inheritance system. And on the other, there is

     · The written law, which mostly governs land in urban districts and some rural lands managed by
         churches and other natural and legal persons. This law confers several land tenure rights to
         individuals such as land tenancy, long term lease and title deeds (particularly in towns).

On the whole, Rwanda's land tenure system requires comprehensive reforms, from the elaboration of a
national land policy to the establishment of a land law and land code, which will guide the judicious use and
management of the land resource for the economy to be able to take off in such a way that our country is
freed from the grips of poverty.

In the perspective of the harmonious and sustainable development, the overall objective of the national land
policy of Rwanda is to establish a land tenure system that guarantees tenure security for all Rwandans and
give guidance to the necessary land reforms with a view to good management and rational use of national
land resources.

Specific Objectives
     · To put in place mechanisms which guarantee land tenure security to land users for the promotion
         of investments in land resource.
     · To promote good allocation of land in order to enhance rational use of land resources according to
         their capacity.
     · To avoid the splitting up of plots and promote their consolidation in order to bring about
         economically viable production.
     · To establish mechanisms which facilitate giving land its productive value in order to promote the
         country's socio-economic development.
     · To focus land management towards more viable and sustainable production by choosing reliable
         and time-tested methods of land development.
     · To develop actions that protects land resources from the various effects of land degradation.
     · To establish institutional land administration arrangements that enable land to have value in the
         market economy.
     · To promote research and continuous education of the public in all aspects of duties and obligations
         with regard to land tenure, land management and land transactions.
     · To establish order and discipline in the allocation of land and land transactions in order to control
         and/or curb pressure on land, inappropriate development, land speculation and land trafficking.
     · To promote the involvement and sensitization of the public at all levels in order to infuse land use
         practices that are favourable to environmental protection and good land management.
     · To promote conservation and sustainable use of wetlands.

Land tenure may be considered as a set of modes or procedures of land acquisition and ownership. It is, in
other words, a combination of rules that define the modes of access, use and control of land and its




                                                                                                          41

renewable natural resources. It is therefore a relationship between men or social groups and land or its
underlying resources.

Land tenure has a multidisciplinary dimension that includes social, technical, economical, institutional, legal
and political aspects. Debates on land issues must deal with various aspects of the environment, including
the vision of space and nature, forms of land ownership, the role of the government, etc.

In Rwanda, there are currently two modes of land acquisition, namely acquisition according to customary
law or conceptions, and acquisition according to the rules of the written law.

According to custom, land ownership is held by whoever occupies the land first. This rule has always been
respected in our society. However, in modern times, land acquisition by occupation has become obsolete
since all vacant land belongs to the State. Likewise, the provisions of the decree-law No. 09/76 of 4th March
1976, article 1, stipulate that `all land not held under the written law and affected or not by customary law or
land occupation belongs to the State'.

Customarily, land rights are passed on from father to son through inheritance. Girls are excluded from
inheritance of the family land from the father. Concerning inheritance rights of widows, the custom merely
gives them the right to use the land that belonged to their deceased husbands.

In its original customary conception, land was owned collectively. Any disposal of land was therefore
inconceivable, since such land was considered as family property that belonged to the ancestors, as well as
to present and future generations.

With the introduction of the subdivision of land into individual plots due to successive inheritance
procedures, each family owner of a plot of land was considered as the real owner of the plot, having the
right to dispose of it as it wishes. However, Article 2 of the decree-law No. 09/76 of 4th March 1976
stipulates that nobody may sell off his land rights except with the written authorization of the Minister of
Lands upon the recommendation of the Municipal Council where the land is located.

In actual fact, ownership through prescription originates from the written law since traditionally, title deeds
were unheard of. Rwandans consider that once a right has been acquired or recognized, even customarily,
it is indefeasible. This is why the many existing landless people, not having received any new land, continue
to feel cheated and left out because they have no right over the land which they owned customarily over 30
years ago, since the law has fixed the time limit of acquisition by prescription to 10 years.

Method of acquisition through written law

      · Tenancy contracts of plots for building purposes for a 3-year period in urban areas.
      · Long lease contracts of land for agricultural purposes for a period of 15 years or more in rural
           areas.
      · Free assignment contracts in both rural and urban areas to natural or legal persons for social
           activities with real impact on the welfare of the people.
      · Sale contracts and title deeds for plots that are built in urban areas. This is a system of land tenure
           by urban residents who first lease plots with the contractual obligation of developing them. The
           Ministry of Lands delivers the title deeds after confirming that the plots have been developed.
      · Right of access: mode of land acquisition which is common for public institutions.

Apart from the above-mentioned different modes of land acquisition and land ownership, there is the case of
the landless people who live in rural areas and who must live from farming. These are mostly the refugees



                                                                                                            42

of 1959 who were forced into exile for political reasons and left their land behind. These same refugees
have now returned to their country and find themselves landless. They cannot claim back their previously
owned land which has been occupied by other Rwandans who remained in the country, because the Arusha
Peace Accord's fixed the time limit for acquisition by prescription to 10 years

5.4 Relevant Policies

5.4.1 International Legislations
Rwanda is a signatory to a number of conventions on sustainable development and is a member of various
bilateral and multilateral organizations. Some of the relevant development partners in this project are the
World Bank and a number of United Nations agencies.

5.4.2. World Bank Environment and Social Safeguards Policies
World Bank Operational Policies (OP) and Bank Procedures (BP) Environmental Assessment - BP4.01 and
OP 4.01 (January 1999 all of which require environmental assessment of projects proposed for World Bank
financing to help ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable.

Environmental Assessment is one of the 10 safeguard policies of the World Bank.             The World Bank
Environment and Social Safeguard Policy aims at improving decision making, to ensure that project options
under consideration are sound and sustainable, and that potentially affected people have been properly
consulted.

The World Bank's environmental assessment policy and recommended processing are described in
Operational Policy (OP)/Bank Procedure (BP) 4.01. The World Bank system assigns a project to one of
three project categories, as defined below:

Category "A" Projects
An EIA is always required for projects that are in this category. Impacts are expected to be `adverse,
sensitive, irreversible and diverse with attributes such as pollutant discharges large enough to cause
degradation of air, water, or soil; large-scale physical disturbance of the site or surroundings; extraction,
consumption or conversion of substantial amounts of forests and other natural resources; measurable
modification of hydrological cycles; use of hazardous materials in more than incidental quantities; and
involuntary displacement of people and other significant social disturbances.

Category "B" Projects
The construction of the diesel power plant falls under Category B of the World Bank Operational. A
proposed project is classified as Category B if it's potential adverse environmental impacts on human
populations or environmentally important areas--including wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other natural
habitats--are less adverse than those of Category A projects.

These impacts are site-specific; few if any of them are irreversible; and in most cases mitigation measures
can be designed more readily than for Category A projects. The scope of EA for a Category B project may
vary from project to project, but it is narrower than that of Category A Environmental Assessment.

Like Category A Environmental Assessment, it examines the project's potential negative and positive
environmental impacts and recommends any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or
compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance.




                                                                                                          43

Category "C" Projects
No EIA or other analysis is required. Category C projects result in negligible or minimal direct disturbance of
the physical environment. Typical projects include education, family planning, health, and human resource
development.

5.4.3 Climate Change Convention
The Convention on Climate Change sets an overall framework for intergovernmental efforts to tackle the
challenge posed by climate change. It recognizes that the climate system is a shared resource whose
stability can be affected by industrial and other emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Rwanda having ratified and signed the convention has the obligation to adopt national policies and take
corresponding measures on the mitigation of climate change, by limiting its anthropogenic emissions of
greenhouse gases.

The project falls under the Climate Change Convention due to the fact that it generates greenhouse gas
emissions.

Article 4 of the protocol calls for development of measures to mitigate climate change by addressing
anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the
Montreal Protocol, and measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change.




                                                                                                           44

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Rwanda is currently facing a deficit in energy of 50 MW. In order to overcome this deficit, the Government of
Rwanda is planning to curb this deficit by setting up 20MW diesel power plant which will then be connected
to the national grid.

The purpose of the project is to provide 20MW of electricity to the grid-using diesel running on Heavy Fuel
Oil (HFO).

The UERP through ELECTROGAZ and its implementing agencies including RURA and MININFRA plans to
install a 20 MW diesel power plant along the Kigali Byumba-Gatuna road and about 1.2km from the existing
Jabana substation in the city of Kigali in the District of Gasabo.

A 1.2 km 110Kv transmission line from the proposed diesel power plant will be constructed to connect to the
Jabana substation. The plan is to channel the electricity generated from the 20MW plant to the substation
for stepping down before being introduced into the national grid.

The project will involve the identification of a suitable location for this project and a viable transmission route
for the 110Kv line and after compensation, it is expected that the land will be cleared and stripped before the
construction of the plant occurs together with other ancillary infrastructure. Thereafter, diesel generator sets
will be installed into the site which will generate electricity to be connected to the exiting national grid
following interconnectivity to the Jabana substation. The connection to the Jabana substation will involve
installation of transmission towers, and the electricity cables.

The size of land necessary for installing the plant will be approximately 120 by 140m in size. However,
there are other auxiliary facilities that are needed in the installation of a power plant. Therefore more land
will be acquired for security and future expansion reasons. Therefore, a total of 3.59 hectares of land have
been acquired for the plant.

The consolidated size of land that will be acquired for the transmission line is 0.11ha and the PAPs will be
compensated according to the requirements in the RPF and ARAP to be prepared. This means that jointly
combining the 2 components a total of 3.7ha of land will be acquired for the project to be implemented.

Project Activities
The project activities will fall under planning, construction, operation and decommissioning phases. The
project specific activities will include the following;

Planning and Design Phase
Activities expected to occur during the planning and design phase of the project include;
     · Identification of project site including feasibility studies including site survey, soil testing, site
          mapping among others.
     · Acquisition of land for construction of the 20 MW power plant and its ancillary structures.
     · Survey for transmission route for the 110Kv line from the diesel power plant to be constructed to
          the Jabana substation.
     · Acquisition of land for construction of the 1.2 km 110 Kv transmission line and ancillary structures.



                                                                                                                45

      · Valuation and compensation of Project Affected Parties (PAPs) for loss of land, structures and
          crops.

Construction Phase

Construction of fuel storage tanks
A series of several fuel storage tanks will be constructed in the project site and will be primarily used for
storing the fuel that will be for operating/driving the diesel generators to produce electricity.




                                                                                                                   47

Installing of generators and transformer & piping of fuel lines
When the construction is finalised, the generators will be installed including the transformers and piping of
the fuel lines. A perimeter wall will also be built all around the project area for security reasons.

The diesel power plant project will have an installed capacity of 20MW being generated by 4 diesel
generators. The project will involve installing the generators and connection to the main grid running on
Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO).       The equipments/generators to be installed at the project site will be sets of
generators, with a rated out put of 7.5 MVA and a rated voltage of 6.6 kV, rated current of 656 A, rated
frequency of 50 Hz with 0.8 lagging and a speed of 1000 rpm.

The Diesel Power Plant shall have 2 sets of power transformers of 15 MVA, 6.6/110 Kv three phase, 50 HZ,
two winding oil immersed with on-load tap charger complete with accessories under natural-oil-circulation
and natural-air cooled operation referred to the 110 kV side of the transformer.

Operation Phase
During the operation phase of the project activities to occur are mainly controlling and operating of the diesel
power plant, and subsequent generating of electricity. Activities related to operating the plant will include,
loading and unloading fuel oil in the tanks, running the diesel engines, regular maintenance works among
others.

6.1 Project Technology Description
The project is using a simple but expensive technology for electricity generation using diesel driven
generators. This is combustion of fuel oil in open chambers in order to generate electricity.

In-Put/Raw Materials
The diesel power plant will primarily use the following few materials that can be described as raw materials
in order to function and generate electricity. They include;

     1.   Fuel oil for running the engines -The plant when operating at 60-100% load will require an
          estimated amount of 100,000 litres per day.
     2.   Lubricating oil for the engines for the plant is estimated to be about 85 litres per day when
          operating at 60-100% load.
     3.   Natural air to mix with the HFO for combustion
     4.   Water for cooling the engines is estimated to be about 55,000 litres at the commissioning which will
          act as the storage and then 200 litres will be used daily as top up. Water used in cooling will be
          recycled using a closed circuit cooling system and hence will not emanate as waste.
     5.   It is estimated that 500 litres of water will be used daily by the staff in the project site for domestic
          use.
     6.   Engine coolant to assist the radiators to cool the engines will be required and about 100 litres will
          be used every 2 months.


Fuel Type
The diesel power plant will use 2 types of fuel oil to generate electricity. At the start of the operations, when
the engines are cranked up, ordinary diesel oil (Low Fuel Oil) will be used to start up the engines and this is
because ordinary diesel is light, viscous and recommended for start up of the engines.

The plant will then after 3 minutes switch to the use of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) for generator combustion and
electricity generation. The HFO system shall be designed for fuels with minimum viscosity of 125 CSt at
50°C maximum viscosity of 180 CSt at 50°C. Short stoppages for a few hours shall be possible on HFO.




                                                                                                               48

During shut down of the engines, again the HFO system will be switched off and for 3 minutes, the engines
will be shut down using ordinary diesel oil. During normal unit operation (60 to 100% load on HFO) exhaust
gas at the stack outlet shall be nearly invisible, i.e. the Bacharach Smoke Number shall not exceed two.
Operation on ordinary diesel fuel shall only be necessary for regular start-stop procedure and flushing the
fuel system before overhaul.

Amount/Quantities of HFO utilised per day
Operating at 60-100% load capacity, the HFO that will be used by the power plant is estimated at 100,000
litres of per day.

Actual specification of the Heavy Fuel Oil and restricted values are provided in the table below. These
values are based on international specifications and are included in the tender documents which the
contractors are expected to meet at the time of bid submission.

Water
Water is required to cool the diesel engines through a series of radiators and fans. This is municipal water
that is treated first and then mixed with a coolant to ensure that the water does not corrode the engines.
The engines will require approximately 5,000litres of water during the initial stages of starting up the power
pant. Thereafter, the engine is in built with a recycling system whereby the water will be recycled and re-
used just like in a motor vehicle engine.




                                                                                                           49

The cooling water of the diesel engines shall be cooled by means of a two-circuit table design radiator

minimum loss of performance. The system shall include silencers, platforms and stacks. Each diesel engine
shall be provided with one exhaust silencer and the design will provide the required sound attenuation to
meet the outside noise level requirements with minimum pressure loss.

Lubricating Oil System
Filters, pumps and coolers shall be installed with adequate drip pans and drain pipes to the sludge tank.

Fuel Oil System
The HFO system shall be designed for fuels with minimum viscosity of 125 CSt at 50°C maximum viscosity
of 180 CSt at 50°C. The unloading pump module shall unload the HFO to only one HFO tank while the
second tank shall be operated as a storage-settling tank.

The water and sediments regularly drained from the storage tanks shall be directly piped to the static 3-
chamber oil-water separator for treatment. All fuel tanks shall be installed within a sealed concrete basin.
The basin shall have a retaining wall designed to cater the volume of the biggest tank plus 15%. The HFO

pan with drain connection for emptying the pan by gravity into a can.

Oily Water Treatment System

Sludge Tank
The overall design shall aim at collecting of sludge from the plant and pump/drain the same into a sludge
tank for unloading the same on to sludge trucks for further disposal. The disposal of the sludge is the
responsibility of the client in this case ELECTROGAZ. The sludge can be re-used in road construction or for
firing boilers as a source of fuel in factories.

Water Treatment System
The oily water leakages and drains from the plant, especially from the fuel tank farm shall be collected in
intermediate tanks and piped & pumped into a static minimum three chamber oily water separator of proven
design. The separator shall be located close to the tank farm and consist of interconnected concrete basins
were the oily water suspension is slowed down in flow and the oil is physically separated from the water.

The 3rd chamber shall have on the sloped bottom a connection to the storm water system. This outlet shall
be provided with an oil alarm devise. The skimmed oil is collected in one chamber. This chamber shall be
fitted with a suction pipe and one weather-protected manual operated electric driven pump in order to pump
the oil into the sludge tank.

The sludge is generally caked HFO which will be collected and can be used in road construction because it
is asphalt or for firing of boilers. ELECTROGAZ plans to sell the sludge to road construction companies or
to factories. The project therefore plans to have interested companies in road construction or industries
using boilers to collect the sludge regularly for use.

The water separated from the oil during the separation process is mainly clean water and does not contain
any hazardous substances. The water will be channelled to the existing storm water drain. However,
because there can be leaks with the treatment system, monitoring of the effluent will be undertaken
periodically.

Water Supply, Sewage and Sanitation
Water supply and sewage shall be installed as necessary in the plant site. A water tank of sufficient
capacity connected to the public water-supply system shall be provided. The toilet shall be equipped with a
water closet of low flush type and a lavatory basin with tap with hot and cold water. All sewage pipes shall

The engine hall shall be equipped with an electrified overhead crane suitable for maintenance of two units.
The engine room shall be designed so the required noise level data will be fulfilled.

Fuel handling House
A separate building shall be designed for oil handling.

6.4 Project In Puts, Outputs and Wastes Generated
The aim of the project is to generate electricity, however in the process the principle of input-output applies.
The input of the project as mentioned earlier include, HFO, lubricating oil, water and air. The positive output
of the process will include 20 MW of electricity.

Wastes Generated
The main wastes from the process include;

     1.  Emissions are expected as stated in the earlier section of the report to be emitted from the
         motorised trucks during the construction process and also at the operation phase when the diesel
         plant will be operational. These will be managed as outlined in the impact mitigation section 7 of
         this report.

     2.  Used lubricating oil will emanate from the engines during operations especially when the engines
         are being serviced requiring draining of the used oil for replacement. The used oil will be collected
         and given to companies who like iron smelting companies etc. After every 2,000 hours of running
         the lubricating oil will be changed and it is estimated that 4,600 litres of used oil will emanate from
         this action once every 2000 hours.

     3.  Sludge will come out during the separation of water from the HFO and the sludge will be given to
         road construction industry or factories with boilers. The estimated quantities of sludge are 400
         cubic metres.

     4.  Used engine oil filters are wastes that will emanate at the time of engine servicing and
         maintenance.     These oil filters will be disposed in accordance with the REMA guidelines for
         disposal.

     5.  Waste water from general cleaning and washing of the plant, domestic use within the plant and
         from the oily water separation tank constitutes the other set of liquid wastes that will be generated
         during the operation phase of the plant. The waste water will be channelled into the existing storm
         water drain and sewage line.




                                                                                                              52

    6.   General solid waste materials from the staff quarters and the plant for example domestic
         household wastes, papers, etc will be generated and disposed through the collection by waste
         providers to the dumping site in Kigali.

    7.   Construction debris which will be removed from the site and disposed in a landfill approved for
         handling construction debris in Rwanda.

6.5 Project Operations and Management
As described in chapter one of this report, UERP/PCU through ELECTROGAZ will contract a company to
install generators for the purposes of producing electricity to be connected to the existing grid. Upon
commission of the plant, the contracted firm will hand over the plant and its operations back to
ELECTROGAZ.




                                                                                                    53

POWER PLANT ­ POTENTIAL ADVERSE
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

This chapter address the potential adverse impacts of the construction and installation of the diesel power
plant. In this report, environmental impacts are defined in totality to mean, socio-economic, cultural, physical
as well as biological. The chapter is structured into two parts one describing positive impacts of the
development and the second part addressing the adverse impacts of the project on the environment.

The project being a national development agenda in the energy sector has immense benefits that could
save the country losses in terms of power rationing and frequent outages. However poor planning of the
project could also affect the environment that supports millions of Rwandese through the project potential
hazards that the project could pose to the public, pollution of water resources and atmospheric resources.


7.1 Positive Impacts
Positive impacts of these project are various and diverse in nature. They range from employment
opportunities, to wealth creation, industrialization, improvement in service delivery to technology transfer
and capacity building.

7.1.1 Socio-economic Benefits
The impacts of the Project on socioeconomic development of the people in the area include additional
electricity for the region, provision of conditions for rational and effective use of natural resources in the
country, creation of new jobs for related services and direct workers, and acceleration of the investment
process in the region.

Employment Opportunities
On employment the project expects to employ local casual and skilled labor on-site. This is exclusive of
indirectly employed people who will provide support and related services including those trading in foodstuff
for the workers on site and construction personnel during the site preparation phase of the project.

Steady supply of power to the region will also boost the industrial capacity of the area thus creating
additional employment opportunities.

Electricity
The project aims to provide an additional 20 MW to in the national grid which is significant to the country.
With additional electricity in the regional grid, the country as a whole is expected to attract more
investments.

7.1.2 Environmental Benefits
The proposed diesel power project has potential for contributing to the good of the environment of the area.
The project will supply an additional 20 MW to the regional grid which will enable ELECTROGAZ connect
more consumers leading to a substantial reduction in other sources of energy that have impacts on the
forest cover and greenhouse.




                                                                                                            54

7.2 Adverse Impacts
Adverse impacts of the diesel power project are those unintended effects of the project that have negative to
sustainable development and the environment.

7.2.1 Impacts on Physical Environment ­Construction Phase
Land Acquisition/Compensation Power Plant Component
The land targeted for the construction of the diesel power plant is owned Home of Hope of Rwanda which is
a faith based Christian organization and plans to utilize the land to construct a church and a children's
orphanage center. The contractor requires land that is 2.06ha in size for the installation of the power plant
even though a larger parcel of land than this will be acquired to provide room for any future planned
expansions of the diesel power plant. In terms of compensation, the construction activities will lead to the
destruction of crops and vegetation including Guavas, Bananas, Mangoes, Bamboo trees, and Napier grass
among others.

Land Acquisition/Compensation Transmission Component
The land targeted for establishing the route for the 1.2km transmission line from the new diesel plant to the
Jabana substation is 0.11ha and owned by 7 different land owners. Acquisition of this land will lead to crop
and vegetation destruction along the transmission path in order to establish the required ROW. Generally
land required for erecting the transmission towers and ROW is 15m by 15m (225m2) for the towers that will
be 7 in number and 7m by 7m the space on both sides of the line which is referred to as the Right of Way.

Mitigation
There will be compensation for the land to be acquired from the Home of Hope Rwanda who is the current
legal owners of this land in question. There will also be compensation for the crops that will be destroyed to
pave way for construction. Therefore, Home of Hope of Rwanda will upon successful land valuation and
crop and structure valuation be compensated in full for the loss of land to be acquired and crops/structures
to be damaged. There are other 4 PAPs who will also be compensated for the loss of land and crops.
Compensation will be undertaken in strict accordance to the already developed Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF) and a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) will have to be developed before compensation
occurs.

Similarly, a survey and valuation of the land to be acquired for the transmission component has been
undertaken and compensation for land and crops accorded to the 7 identified PAPs as specified in the RPF
document and a separate ARAP will be developed before any compensation or resettlement occurs.

Fugitive Dust
Fugitive dust may be emitted from construction works and stock piles of materials including machinery as
well as from truck traffic. This could cause health related impacts to the communities around and workers in
the project site.

The diesel power construction machinery and vehicles will also have other air quality impacts even though
negligible.

Mitigation
    · The dirt roads and exposed construction areas should be moisturised during the dry season to
          prevent or minimise the fugitive dust emissions.

    · Installation of speed bumps and speed limit signs to reduce speed of construction equipments
         capacity to blow dust




                                                                                                          55

    · Install Heavy duty muffler systems on heavy equipment and vehicles

    · Proper location of material stockpiles, especially sand and soil downwind from the commercial,
          residential and other establishments will be required; Frequent wetting of the stockpile and working
          area; screening of or providing wind breaks for stockpiles;

    · Diesel powered construction equipment and vehicles should be well maintained to minimise
          tailpipe emissions; Covering of trucks; and proper selection of equipment and control of speed
          limits in construction area.

    · Workers in the project site must be equipped with the necessary and required Personal Protective
          Equipment (PPE) prescribed by the construction industry but not limited to safety helmets,

Soil Erosion
During the construction phase, activities involving preparation, stripping, grading, soil removal, backfilling,
compacting, disposal of surplus and excavation of the earth surface to pave way for the installation of the
diesel power plant will lead to fugitive dust emission and accelerate soil erosion and run off.

Another impact of the project on soil and geology will be compaction, soil erosion and increased runoff. The
compaction will prevent infiltration of surface water to the ground. This impact will only occur on site where
compaction will be done.

Mitigation
    · To prevent soil erosion during site preparation, disturbed soils should be compacted immediately.
          Development of storm water drains around the site should prevent erosion occurring on the site.

    · Wind blown erosion is to be prevented by soil compaction and wetting the ground to prevent rising
          of soil particles.

    · The final site grade should include the development of a drainage channel to facilitate drainage
          and avoid flooding and pooling by storm water. A site drainage plan should be developed to protect
          against erosion. Protecting stockpiles through the use of silt fencing and reduced slope angles
          should be used to minimize soil erosion during construction.

    · Borrow areas (if any) should avoid agricultural areas; borrow areas should be reworked to blend
          into the surroundings. Re-vegetation should be performed using local plants. All slopes and
          working surfaces should be returned to a stable condition

Vehicular Emission
During the construction phase of the power plant, use of heavy equipment and machinery like trucks, and
excavators will cause increased vehicular emission (CO2) in the atmosphere and will cause to some extent
some form of atmospheric pollution. This impact is expected to occur during the construction and operation
phase. During the operation phase it is projected that at least 4 trucks will be supplying HFO and ordinary
diesel oil to the plant every day and hence localised vehicular emissions are also expected during this time.

Mitigation
    · Install vehicles with emission reduction gadgets to reduce the quantities of emissions.

    · Ensure that the vehicles are regularly services and properly maintained so as to reduce emissions.




                                                                                                            56

Visual Impacts
The construction works for the installation of the diesel power plant and associated civil works is likely to
cause visual impacts in the immediate surrounding.

Mitigation
Construction of lower profile structures, use of less visible colors, planting of screening vegetation around
the plant boundary, Proper design of the stack and dispersion characteristics.

UERP should create a natural buffer of trees which will be important in reducing the visual impacts and
screen the area while retaining a natural ambience. This is a long term mitigation measure especially
because the trees are expected to grow tall over a period of 6-7 years.

Noise Pollution
The machinery and equipment that will be used to undertake different civil works during the construction
phase of the diesel power plant will cause noise pollution in the immediate surrounding of the project area.
The noise impact related to construction is expected to last only during the construction phase and will be
short term in nature and not very significant in terms of magnitude and scope. The immediate surrounding
of the plant within a distance of 1 km there are 7 houses spread out.

The construction equipment and machinery are mainly motorised trucks, excavators, tippers and
conventionally these machines do not emit noise that would be adverse to the neighbouring residents within
a 50 m distance. This is what leads to the conclusion that noise impacts during the construction phase will
be insignificant on the immediate surrounding. The workers on the other hand will experience noise related
impacts of a fairly high magnitude because of the close proximity when operating the motorised vehicles
during construction.

During the operation stage, noise from the engines is expected to lead to potential impacts and this is
discussed in the operation phase of impact analysis.

Mitigation
     · Noise emitting equipment should comply with the applicable Rwanda standards and World Bank
         noise standards.      Rwanda does not have noise emission standards and thus World Bank
         standards will be use for compliance purposes.

     · Construction traffic off-site will not contribute significantly to noise levels on public highways
         because roads leading to the site already have very heavily traffic.

     · Noisy equipment should be operated only during daytime.

     · The construction activity during daytime is not expected to seriously affect the noise level in areas
         adjacent to the construction site and there will be no construction at night.

     · All workers in the project site must be equipped with the necessary and required Personal
         Protective Equipment (PPE) prescribed by the construction industry but not limited to facilities to
         protect against noise impacts, safety helmets, boots, dust masks, gloves, overall, goggles, helmets
         etc.




                                                                                                          57

     · Workers and personnel operating equipments and machinery producing incessant noise and
          vibration should stick to no more than 5 hours a day in handling of equipment and machinery.

     · Vehicles will be fitted with noise reducing equipment to minimize noise impacts during construction.

Destruction of vegetation cover/crops
The project area is present with a variety of crops including beans, papaya trees, cassava, bananas, and
maize among others. There is also a considerable thicket of eucalyptus tree species planted on the project
site covering an area of approximately 0.5 ha. These crops and trees will inevitably have to be removed to
pave way for the construction of the diesel power plant. This is the same with the transmission component
of the project. In order to establish a ROW for erecting the towers crops and vegetation along the surveyed
route will be destroyed.

Mitigation
This impact is unavoidable. However, UERP/PCU will compensate for the crops and tress that will be
damaged as a result of the construction activities. The plant area will also be landscaped by replanting and
replacing the trees that will be destroyed in the process of clearing the site for construction works.

Accidents/Hazards
As a result of the operation of equipment and machinery, there is a likelihood of accidents occurring
especially to the workers when operating the equipments on and off the site. Unauthorised entry and
encroachment into the site can also lead to accidents.

Mitigation
     · All workers need to be provided with the recognised and appropriate Personal Protective
          Equipment (PPE) while at the construction site including gloves, dust masks, boots, goggles, and
          overalls among others.

     · UERP should create a high perimeter fence all around the project site complete with a gate and
          guard to ensure that unauthorised entry is restricted at all times during the construction and
          operation phases of the project.

     · During the construction the project site should be completely sealed off and warning signs erected
          informing the general public to keep off the construction site when construction is in progress.

     · Personal protection gear must be provided and its use made compulsory to all. The entire
          workforce of the plant should be trained in the use of protective gear, handling of chemical
          products and acid storage cells, electric safety equipment, procedures for entering enclosed areas,
          fire protection and prevention, emergency response and care procedures. Training given to the
          employees should be backed by regular on- site training in safety measures.

     · No ENTRY signs should be installed to keep away unqualified workers from access to restricted
          areas.

     · The contactor must develop a workers Health and Safety Manual for which all the workers should
          be conversant with for response in case of accidents.

     · The contractor should develop an Emergency Response Plan for handling any emergencies arising
          thereof during the construction.




                                                                                                          58

Increased Traffic/Road Accidents
It is expected that during the construction, an increase in traffic will be experienced along the Kigali-
Byumba-Gatuna road and more specifically closer to the construction site because of the several vehicles
that will be getting in and out of the construction site. This increased vehicle movement will increase the
general traffic of the area as a result if heavy vehicles and is likely to cause traffic congestion. Also the area
could experience road accidents owing to the increased traffic.

Mitigation
The entire heavy vehicles that is likely to cause traffic congestion when delivering goods in the construction
yard should provide these services during traffic off peak hours to reduce traffic congestion.

To reduce potential road accidents, there is need to erect speed bumps closer to the project area and
warning signs limiting the speed when approaching the construction site.

     · Install advance warnings and traffic signs indicating on going construction and heavy machinery
          frequently using the area. Install speed bumps to warn other road users of on going construction
          and also to reduce speed when approaching the area.

     · Transport of heavy goods likely to congest traffic should be undertaken during off-peak times to
          reduce congestion

     · Request for the support of traffic police officers prior to construction works to control the traffic
          especially when heavy equipment is planned or scheduled for transporting.

Surface water contamination from waste water and site run-off
Minor short-term lowering of the groundwater table during dewatering of foundation excavations is not
expected to have a significant impact.

Mitigation
     · Water from dewatering activities and storm water discharges should be managed to minimise
          water quality impacts to nearby surface water resources such as the nearby irrigation canals.
     · A site drainage plan which includes a suitable drainage canal and channel should be developed in
          the project site and used to channel storm water away from the plant into the nearest and
          appropriate water body or valley.

Storage and treatment of solid waste
Solid waste materials during the construction include paper wrapping, scrap metal, excavated soils,
polythene, plastic and metal containers will cause pollution and littering of the immediate and localized
environment.

Mitigation
     · Contractor should develop a solid waste disposal plan which includes the provision of receptacles
          at strategic points within the construction site, recycling programmes for recyclable wastes,
          separation of wastes.

     · The contractor and ELECTROGAZ should engage a refuse handling company to remove the
          wastes from the site to the recommended dumping site.

     · Warning signs against littering and dumping within the construction site should be erected by the
          contractor.



                                                                                                               59

     · The contactor must construct toilets for use in the site during the construction which will be
          connected to the sewer line.

     · The disposal of used oil filters should be the sole responsibility of the supplier who should advise
          on the environmentally sound disposal method an dif possible should recapture back all the filters
          from ELECTROGAZ.

Fire Hazards/Accidents
During the construction phase the chances of fire hazards occurring cannot be overlooked due to the use of
combustible machinery and equipment in undertaking the construction works.

Mitigation
     · A robust fire prevention program and fire suppression system should be developed by the
          contactor. (A draft fire suppression plan is attached in annex D but needs further refinement
          by UERP and ELECTROGAZ who must carry out a vulnerability assessment before
          developing into a final suppression program). The plan for fire suppression should borrow
          from the already existing fire management plan available in other plants owned by
          ELECTROGAZ.

     · The construction site must contain fire fighting equipments of recommended standards and in key
          strategic points all over the site. Fire pumps, Hydrants, Sprinkler/water spray systems, Hose
          houses, Dry chemical systems, -alternative systems, Carbon dioxide systems, Detection/alarm
          systems, Portable fire extinguishers among others.

     · All workers must be trained on fire management and fire drills undertaken regularly.

7.2.2 Adverse Impacts ­Operation Phase
The following adverse impacts are anticipated to occur during the operation phase of the diesel power plant.

Emissions to air
Combustion of the distillate oil will result in emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide,
carbon dioxide, and particulate matter.

Air pollution
Carbon dioxide levels in flue gases vary depending on the type of fuel used and the excess air level used for
optimal combustion conditions. Flue gas volumes also depend on these two variables.

Operational phase of the project effects of the air emissions on air quality will include particulate emissions
which represent the main pollutant of concern, with gaseous emissions such as sulphur dioxide (SO2),
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) potentially significant due to combustion of Heavy Fuel
Oil.

Quantities and Types of Emissions
Air quality impacts during operation of the power plant will consist primarily of stack gases emitted following
fuel combustion. Emissions will be comprised of particulate matter (PM), sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of
nitrogen (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), the greenhouse gases (GHGs), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane
(CH4), trace amounts of various metals, and trace amounts of organic and inorganic compounds. The
proportions and amounts of pollutants emitted will depend on the fuel quality and combustion strategy.




                                                                                                            60

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for calculating emissions inventories
require that an oxidation factor be applied to the carbon content to account for a small portion of the fuel that
is not oxidized into CO2. For all oil and oil products, the oxidation factor used is 0.99 (99 percent of the
carbon in the fuel is eventually oxidized, while 1 percent remains un-oxidized).

Finally, to calculate the CO2 emissions from a gallon of fuel, the carbon emissions are multiplied by the ratio
of the molecular weight of CO2 (m.w. 44) to the molecular weight of carbon (m.w.12): 44/12.

CO2 emissions from a gallon of petrol
          = 2,421 grams x 0.99 x (44/12) = 8,788 grams = 8.8 kg/gallon = 19.4 pounds/gallon

CO2 emissions from a gallon of HFO/diesel
          = 2,778 grams x 0.99 x (44/12) = 10,084 grams = 10.1 kg/gallon = 22.2 pounds/gallon

For the basis of this calculation 1 gallon is equated with 3.785 litres while 1 pound is equated to 0.4549kg. A
gallon of diesel is calculated to produce 22.2 pounds (10.1) of CO2 emissions. Based on this, 1 litre of diesel
is expected to result in;

10.1kg divided by 3.785 litres (1 gallon) = 2.668 kg/l.

Two thousand (2000) litres ­ used per week - will therefore produce (2000 litres x 2.668 kg/l) 5,336 kg of
carbon dioxide. The plant's CO2 emissions will therefore amount to 5,336kg. This is equal to 31.8 kg/day.
There are currently no national or international standards which define maximum CO2 emission levels (in
mg/Nm3 or in gC/kWh produced). Given current technologies and those being developed, a maximum
emission level of 120 g/kWh produced is considered best practice.

Mitigation
To reduce CO2 emissions timely and frequent service and maintenance of the generators should be
undertaken. This will improve combustion of fuel which will be efficient and reduce emissions.

Carbon emission offsets
Another mitigation measure even though long term that the project could adopt in order to reduce the
emissions is embracing the carbon offset mechanism. This should include planting trees to act as carbon
sinks, increasing plant efficiency and even purchasing carbon emission reduction credits.

Nitrous Oxide (N2O) Emissions
Emissions of N2O are minor and the uncertainty is high in fuel combustion. Reliable emission factors are not
yet available for all sources.




                                                                                                              61

According to the tender documents provided to the contractor, the maximum NOx, SO2 must be no more
than a maximum of 2000mg/Nm3. This is the calculated emission limit that is internationally recommended
to ensure that the emissions do not adversely affect the atmosphere. The contractor will undertake testing
of the engines during commissioning to determine if these standards are met.

The plant engines will be designed to ensure that the international emission standards for emissions are
complied with.

Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) Emissions
This is a dual fuel plant that uses ordinary diesel for starting up the generators and then as soon as the
generators pick up, a switch to HFO is made. In the same way, during shut down of the engines, a switch is
made from HFO to ordinary diesel oil.

Sulphur Dioxide emissions depend on sulphur content of the fuel. For fuel oil (including heavy fuel oil)
sulphur content varies from 0.3 to over 5 per cent. Lighter products may contain minimal sulphur (<0.3 per
cent), whilst heavy fuel oil can contain from up to 3-5 per cent sulphur. Currently the world average sulphur
content of crude oil is around 1.3 per cent, although there are considerable variations between different
sources (Vernon and Jones, 1993).

Sulphur content in diesel oil produced today contains at most 50, in respect 10 mg/kg.

SO2 emission factor for diesel is approximately 0.05. Generally, all sulphur content present in the fuel is
converted to SO2. Therefore, the pollution load (SO2) for the generation plant per week will be as follows.

Pollution load = emission factor x fuel consumption

               = 0.005 x 2000 litres

This is equal to 10 kg/week. This translates to 59.5g/hr, against the World Bank standard limits of 125(g) as
stated in table above.

According to the tender documents provided to the contractor, the maximum NOx, SO2 must be no more
than a maximum of 2000mg/Nm3. This is the calculated emission limit that is internationally recommended
to ensure that the emissions adversely affect the atmosphere.

The plant engines will be designed to ensure that the international emission standards for emissions are
complied with.

Below are details of the sulphur content in HFO available in Kigali. In order to meet the sulfur dioxide
standards of 4 tons per day and a maximum concentration of 2000 mg/Nm3, given the available fuel quality,
the diesel generators will be fitted with filters to ensure reduction of flue gas emission. The tender
documents provided to the contractors clearly specified the quality of oil and the sulphur content expected to
be met.

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Emissions
The major source of NOX is the high temperature combination of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen, in
combustion processes, there being also a lesser contribution from combustion of nitrogen contained in fuels.

Mitigation
The plant engines will be designed to ensure that the international emission standards for emissions are
complied with.

During the performance test period measurement and recording, emission levels at the property will be
measured and monitored according IEC-651 & 804 class 2. The contractor will measure and record the
following to determine the level to which they comply with the international standards.

     1.   NOx emission according to ISO 10849.
     2.   SO2 emissions according to ISO 7935.
     3.   Particular matters according to ISO 9096.

In order to determine the ambient air emissions samples were undertaken around the project site and then
analysed and the results are in the tables below.

The results show that the ambient emissions for nitrogen and sulphur dioxide in the project area are above
the maximum average over a 24 hour period recommended by World Bank.




                                                                                                        63

The mean PM10 values obtained in this study were observed to be 239 ±126 µg m-3 with a range of 66.7 to
444.5 µg m-3. The levels are higher than the recommended WHO guidelines; in some cases up to over 150
% or even higher (WHO, 1999).

Creation of Natural Buffer Zone
The project should also plant trees all around the perimeter wall to act as a buffer zone as well as mitigation
measure to act as carbon sinks by filtering the resultant gaseous emissions from the power plant. Tree
planting is part of the carbon offsets approach and is expected to be a long term mitigation measure.

Noise Pollution
Noise pollution from the operation of the generators is inevitable during the night and day periods. Even
though ambient noise levels at the time of the study was not conducted on receptors at the edges of the
property boundary and on an average hourly basis, as defined in the World Bank guidelines, noise impacts
is not expected to be high outside the site boundary as the generators are containerized in sound proof
walls and have installed silencers. The Contractor shall state the noise level of the radiator coolers in dB(A)
in 500 meter distance at full radiator load.     These engines will be designed internationally to ensure that
within the plant boundary the emission level must be ranging from 60-65 decibels. The bank's maximum
limit in industrial and residential areas is specified in table below for day and night. The project site and
surrounding can be classified as a mixture of industrial, agro based, commercial and residential/institutional.
A total of 7 houses that can be observed in the project surrounding and they are approximately between 50-
1000 metres away from the plant.

According to the World Bank maximum noise level as shown in table below, in residential areas a level of
55dB and 45dB is allowed for day and night and 70dB for industrial or commercial areas. Since the project
area is a mix of different zones, this project considers residential/institutional as the standard of
consideration.

Outside of the plant boundary, 3 houses are within a distance of 50 metres and the residents could possible
be adversely impacted by the generator noise since. Even though out of the plant boundary the noise
emitted will be 60-65dBA, these engines have been designed to emit no more than 70dBA at a distance of
10m from the plant boundary. Since the first house closest to the plant boundary is 50 metres away, these
households should not be affected but this is subject to verification if indeed the plant specifications for
noise are correct. For this reason upon commissioning the contractor has signed a clause requiring testing
of noise at full load capacity form different distances up to 500metres.

Further more each diesel engine shall be provided with one exhaust silencer and the design will provide the
required sound attenuation to meet the outside noise level requirements with minimum pressure loss. The
silencer and the exhaust gas piping shall be provided with condensation drain traps at low points.

World Bank Maximum Noise Levels

Location/Zone                                   Day                       Night
Residential, educational
or institutional area                           55 dB(A)                  45 dB(A)
Industrial or                                   70 dB(A)                  70 dB(A)
Commercial area

However to ensure that the engines are actually meeting the required noise levels as stated above, during
the commissioning of the power plant, noise level tests will be conducted in the following manner to confirm
the levels at different distances as specified in the tender contract documents;




                                                                                                            64

    · Maximum noise level inside the machine room with all DGU's running at 100% load. All
        measurements at 1 m distance of each DGU.
    · Maximum noise level outdoor with all DGU's running at 100% load. All measurements at 500 m
        distance of the noise source, e.g. air openings at machine room, exhaust outlet, etc.
    · Maximum noise level inside Plant Control Room and Associated Rooms with all DGU's running at
        100% load. All measurements within the respective rooms at 1 m above floor level (Above
        mentioned values shall be guaranteed by the Contractor. The guaranteed figures all necessary
        tolerances for accuracy of testing, shall include all sampling, instrumentation, notwithstanding the
        performance test code standard. No further tolerances of any kind shall be permitted.

Mitigation
    · The generators as described have industrial and marine silencer preinstalled. The noise levels thus
        will not exceed maximum noise levels prescribed for industrial area as shown above in table
        above. This is because the generators have been designed internationally not to exceed the
        stated limits.

    · For the workers who will be working in the plant, will require to have ear muffs to prevent damaging
        the ears.

    · The equipment will be designed and enclosed in an acoustic enclosure to limit noise to 85 decibels
        inside of the plant. Workers in close proximity to this equipment would be required to use hearing
        protection. Off-site noise would not exceed 70 dB (A) because the engines have been designed
        and built in such a way that the maximum noise level at the plant boundary does not exceed 65
        decibels.

    · All equipment and machinery installed MUST and will be tested to verify if they are compliant with
        the World Bank acceptable standards of noise as contained in the World Bank PPAH 1998. The
        tested noise levels should be recorded as baseline and used for future monitoring.

    · All workers in the project site must be equipped with the necessary and required Personal
        Protective Equipment (PPE) prescribed by the construction industry but not limited to facilities to
        protect against noise impacts, hearing protection etc.

    · Personal protection gear will be provided and its use made compulsory to all. The entire workforce
        of the plant should be trained in the use of protective gear to handle noise impacts.

    · Noise monitoring will be conducted every 1 month upon commissioning for one year and the
        periodically after every 4 months through out the project life or whenever complaints are made
        related to noise pollution.

    · The project should also plant trees all around the perimeter wall to act as a noise buffer zone and
        in effect serve to reduce the noise impact from the power plant. The planting of trees as a noise
        attenuating measure is regarded as a long term mitigation measure.

    · During the performance test period measurement and recording of noise levels at the boundary of
        the property will be measured and monitored according IEC-651 & 804 class 2.




                                                                                                         65

Oil spills Occurrences
Oil spills could occur during the transport, unloading and transfer of the fuel to on-site storage and could
contaminate the existing soil resources and the nearby Nyabugogo River. Even though the river is 1.2km
away from the project site this impact cannot be overlooked.

Mitigation
     · Need to design appropriate protection devices against accidental discharge of toxic substances
          (bases/air-tight tanks for machines, reservoirs etc.).

     · Storage and liquid impoundment areas for fuels, raw and in-process material solvents, wastes and
          finished products should be designed with secondary containment (e.g. dikes) to prevent spills and
          the contamination of soil, ground and surface water. The secondary containment dikes will be
          used through out the life of the project mainly to offer secondary spill protection and avoid
          contamination.

     · All the fuel storage tanks should have secondary containment with sufficient volume to contain a
          spill from the largest tank in the containment structure. The containment area should have a means
          of removing accumulated water.

     · A spill and emergency response plan would be developed and put in place prior to commencement
          of construction. (Annex D contains a draft response plan that has been developed for further
          refinement by the UERP).

     · Frequent inspection and maintenance of facility

Wastewater/Oily water discharge and treatment
Waste water and oily water discharge emanating from the power plant will be separated and the separated
or treated water will be channelled to the existing storm water drain because it is not hazardous.

Mitigation

     · The wastewater discharge will be designed to comply with World Bank standards.

     · The overall design shall aim at collecting the sludge from the whole power plant and then
          pump/drain the same into a sludge tank for unloading the same on to sludge trucks for further
          application in the road construction industry as asphalt or for firing boilers in factories. As stated
          earlier, the sludge will be used as asphalt for road construction or for firing boilers in factories. It is
          estimated that approximately 400 litres of sludge will be produced monthly if the plant is operating
          at 60-100% load. The sludge will be collected in drums and stored for further collection by road
          contractors or factories contracted by ELECTROGAZ.

     · Testing of samples of the waste water before they are channelled into the storm water drainage for
          presence of oil residue will be undertaken every time that HFO/water separation occurs in the oily
          water separation tank.

     · All the used oil from the engines especially when the engines are serviced and the used oil is
          drained will be recycled. As a general rule the supplier of the oil will also collect the used oil. Used
          oil is generally used in curing electricity poles but it will be up to the contractor hired to collect the
          used oil to decide how to recycle.        In other ELECTROGAZ plants for example, Total is the
          company contracted to supply diesel and other lubricants. They provide the oil and lubricants in



                                                                                                                 66

        drums and also collect the used oil for recycling. This is the same model that will be used in this
        new plant.

Solid waste pollution and littering
Solid wastes generated from the operation of the plant will include used engine oil filters, oil lubricant
packaging material, engine coolant containers as well as domestic wastes that will emanate from the staff
housing units.

Mitigation
    · Contractor should develop a solid waste disposal plan which includes the provision of receptacles
        at strategic points within the construction site, recycling programmes for recyclable wastes,
        separation of wastes.

    · The contractor should engage a refuse handling company to remove the wastes from the site to
        the recommended dumping site within Kigali city

    · Warning signs against littering and dumping within and around the construction site should be
        erected by the contactor.

Accidents at the work place from operating of machineries and equipment by workers
The potential for accidents and hazards occurring in the diesel power plant during the operation of the
equipment and machinery is a likely adverse impact that could lead to loss of life or injury to the workers.

Mitigation
    · All workers entering the construction site must be equipped with PPE including goggle, factory
        boots, overalls, gloves, dust masks, among others. The PPE should be those that meeting the
        international standards of PPE.

    · Personal protection gear will be provided and its use made compulsory to all. The entire workforce
        of the plant should be trained in the use of protective gear, handling of chemical products and acid
        storage cells, electric safety equipment, procedures for entering enclosed areas, fire protection and
        prevention, emergency response and care procedures.

    · Training given to the employees should be backed by regular on- site training in safety measures.

    · No ENTRY signs should be installed to keep away unauthorised workers from accessing the
        restricted areas.

    · Machines and Equipments must be operated only by qualified staff and a site supervisor should be
        on site at all times to ensure adherence.

    · The contactor must develop a workers Health and Safety Manual for which all the workers should
        be conversant with for response in case of accidents.

    · The contractor should develop an Emergency Response Plan for handling any emergencies arising
        thereof during the operation.




                                                                                                            67

Fire risk and accidental discharge of products

Heavy fuel used by the plant has a relatively low fire or explosion risk however the risk of fire outbreaks in
the diesel power plant cannot be overlooked.

Mitigation
     · The diesel engines should be fitted with a vapor monitor and a toxic vapor ignition monitoring
         system.

     · A robust fire prevention program and fire suppression system should be developed by the
         contactor. (A draft fire suppression plan is attached as annex D but needs further refinement
         by ELECTROGAZ who must carry out a vulnerability assessment before developing a final
         suppression program). It is suggested here that the proposed diesel power plant borrow the
         existing fire prevention program that is being used by ELECTROGAZ in other energy stations.

     · The site must contain fire fighting equipments of recommended standards and in key strategic
         points all over the site. Fire hydrants, sprinkler/water spray systems, dry chemical systems, carbon
         dioxide systems, detection/alarm systems, foam and portable fire extinguishers are all included in
         the tender documents as necessary fire suppression equipments that must be in the plant as part
         of the elaborate fire fighting system.

     · Staff should be trained in fire emergency procedures and refresher drills organised after every 6
         months by the contractor, ELECTROGAZ and jointly with the Kigali Fire Department if this
         department will be available.

     · A fire evacuation plan must be posted in various points of the construction site including
         procedures to take when a fire is reported.

CFCs Emissions from the Central cooling systems likely to exacerbate the Green House Effect
The presence of CFCs from the central cooling system of the diesel power plant is likely to increase the
GHGs effect in the atmosphere thereby contributing to some level of global warming.

Mitigation
     · Processes, equipment and central cooling systems involving the potential release to the
         environment of CFCs will not be installed. The central cooling system is a closed circuit and does
         not use any CFCs.

Micro-climate
The operation of the diesel power plant in the site is likely to modify the micro-climate of the area due to
heat and air pollution from flue gas, dust and noise.      There is need to conduct further studies around the
area to determine the project impacts on the micro climate.

The plant life is estimated to be about 30 years in the absence of malfunctions etc. However, it is not the
intention of the MININFRA to have the plant working full time through out the project life span. MININFRA
intends to stop using the diesel power plant once the energy crisis is resolved upon which the diesel plant
will be shut down and only used as during emergency.

Water Resources
Water from the main ELECTROGAZ network will be used for cooling the diesel power plant. The power
plant requires 200 litres of water to cool the engines per day. An initial 55,000 litres is needed as the base
capacity of the cooling tank where after, 700 litres will be used per day.



                                                                                                           68

Water for use in this plant will come from Yanze pumping plant which supplies 30 million litres per day and
hence the abstraction of 55,000 at once and 700 litres per day is insignificant in terms of impacting on other
water users. This is not the only water source for Kigali city which has other 5 pumping stations for water
capable of supporting the city.

The system will constitute a back in itself this means that only 200 litres of water will be used daily. The
55,000 litres in the tank is the back up.

Visual Impacts
During operation of the plant might present unwanted visual impacts, both by its physical presence and
profile against the surrounding area, and by visual impacts of the plume (particularly during periods of poor
atmospheric dispersion) and secondary formation of aerosols that can reduce visibility. Large structures
such as stacks and fuel tanks towers may also adversely impact the visual quality of the area.

Mitigation
     · Mitigation against visual impact can be through landscaping the area with trees to screen the
         project stacks and fuel tanks. This is the reason ELECTROGAZ acquired a bigger parcel of land
         and did not develop the entire section but instead left these sections with eucalyptus trees to
         reduce the visual impacts.

     · The plant chimneys are 30m high and have been designed according to the requirements of the
         International Pollution Centre in such a way to reduce plume hence the plume effect will be
         negligible. At a height of 30m it is a guarantee that the plume will be dispersed higher up in the
         atmosphere hence minimizing the visual impacts associated with plume.

Encroachment
Illegal and unauthorized access to the power plant during its operation stage can lead to accidents and
hazards.

Mitigation
The UERP should fence the entire project site using a high perimeter wall in order to avoid unauthorized
access to the site.

7.2.3 Project Decommissioning

The power plant has a life span of over 30 years for as long as the plant equipment and associated
infrastructure is well maintained. The plant may be decommissioned after its life span or if the government
decides to close down the plant for any other reason for that matter.

The decommissioning plan will be prepared by ELECTROGAZ who will upon project commissioning take
ownership and responsibility for operating the plant from the contractor. The cost of decommissioning
including implementation of the decommissioning plan will be met by the client in this case ELECTROGAZ
as clearly stipulated by REMA in the EIA guidelines and thus in this case ELECTROGAZ will be responsible
for decommissioning the project.

Decommissioning of the plant will involve shutting down the generators, removing the generators from site,
dismantling the supporting infrastructure including fuel tanks, cables and all those structures that were not
on site before the project implementation.




                                                                                                           69

Some of the impacts of this project phase are similar to those that have been discussed during construction
and operational phase. But there are those impacts that are specific to project decommissioning after the
project life is over. During this phase, there is a possibility of leftover oil spilling when the handling
structures, pipes and generators are dismantled.

After the project decommissioning, the proponent will be required to rehabilitate the site to its former status
or near what it was before the project was commissioned.         The client in this case ELECTROGAZ is
expected to prepare a decommissioning plan if and when it will intend to decommission this facility. This
plan must be submitted to REMA for approval before activities for decommissioning are undertaken. As per
the regulations of REMA the proponent will bear the costs for decommissioning and site rehabilitation.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
FOR 20 MW DIESEL POWER PLANT

This Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been developed for this project and will be implemented
by the consulting contracted company and ELECTROGAZ. The EMP defines the measures needed to
prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts, improve environmental performance and
ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies, and these are being incorporated in the proposed
project. The recommendations for main environmental mitigation measures are summarized in the EMP
document.

This EMP defines the measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts,
and to improve environmental performance while ensuring compliance with applicable environmental
standards during the planning and design phase, construction and operation and eventual decommissioning
of the plant.

The recommendations for main environmental mitigation measures include waste management and
disposal planning, noise and air abatement measures, emergency and oil spill response planning as well as
the purchase of necessary response equipment. These mitigation measures are being incorporated in the
project design and are already included in the tender documents for procurement of the equipments.

From the on set the Safeguards Advisor (EA) would like to recommend that before the construction works
begin, there is every need for assessments to be done to ascertain the ambient air quality of the project site
and the noise levels including the water quality of the irrigation canal. This vital information is imperative if
effective monitoring of compliance is to be achieved because they will set the baseline situation.

At the time of the initial preparation of this report, the ambient baseline analysis in terms of air and water
had not been undertaken. However, these have now been conducted and they are as follows;

Water quality tests on the Nyabugogo River were taken from different points and the samples were
analyzed in a laboratory where a full chemical analysis was conducted. The results are as follows;

It was not possible to undertake ambient noise levels due to lack of instruments in Kigali but before the
commissioning of the plant UERP plans to procure a noise meter which will be used to undertake the tests.
The noise meter will also be used to conduct initial tests to the engines at different distances to verify the
noise levels. The contractor has also been mandated to conduct noise tests up to a distance of 500m along
the plant boundary upon commissioning at full load to determine the noise impacts with respect to World
Bank standards.

Ambient air quality test was also undertaken at different points within the plant site using the passive
approach. The parameters that were analyzed and results are shown below;

Relevant World Bank standards included in this report are for noise levels at the plant perimeter, effluent
standards and ambient air quality around the plant for which the new plant must comply with. These
guidelines and requirements have also been included in the tender documents and remain the specifications
for which the bidding contractors should embrace when responding to the expression of interest. Prior to
accepting the diesel engines and the associated infrastructure, mandatory testing as stipulated in the tender
documents will be undertaken to verify and confirm whether or not the equipments comply with the World

Bank regulations.     Environmental testing will seek to verify the noise and emission qualities of the
equipments among others.

In order to develop institutional capacity in implementing and enforcing the EMP, training should be provided
with adequate budgets to ensure satisfactory achievement of sound environmental performance.               The
training proposed here should include capacity building and training in environmental assessment,
environmental mitigation plans, and environmental monitoring for the ELECTROGAZ staff. In some cases,
it may be appropriate to include the staff from the environmental implementation agencies, such as the
pollution control board, REMA, and other relevant ministries involved in the implementation of the UERP.

Training and capacity building will be vital in implementing the EMP especially ELECTROGAZ staff who will
be responsible for primarily ensuring that mitigation and monitoring of the key activities are followed. The
proposed training will target relevant UERP, ELECTROGAZ, REMA, RURA and MININFRA staff and will
entail training in monitoring and evaluation, impact mitigation and internal self environmental audit.

Development of internal tracking/monitoring system
The Environmental Advisor is in the process of developing a participatory computer based monitoring and
tracking sheet that will be used to monitor the mitigation of the adverse impacts of the project. The tracking
sheet will use Microsoft Access program application and upon its completion, all the UERP/PCU and its
implementing agencies will be trained on how to use this tool to monitor compliance.

Responsibility of Institutions in Implementing the EMP
The company that will be awarded the contract to construct and install the diesel power plant will remain the
key responsible institution for undertaking the mitigation measures proposed as well as the monitoring
activities/measures associated with this mitigation plan.       The other institutions mainly ELECTROGAZ,
REMA, UERP/PCU, Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) etc. will be solely involved in supporting the
monitoring to ensure compliance.

Upon successful installation, commissioning and handing over of the plant to ELECTROGAZ by the
contractor, ELECTROGAZ shall henceforth become the sole and lead institution responsible for ensuring
proper mitigation measures and monitoring as indicated in the EMP document is followed.             However the
contractor will provide one technical advisor for a period of one year to provide capacity building support in
all the related management and maintenance field.

Specifically in Monitoring and Evaluation the following institutions will play the following roles namely;

Role of Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA):

Oversight Monitoring
As the lead agency responsible for the protection of environment in Rwanda, REMA will play the leading
oversight role of monitoring the activities of the project according to the Organic Law establishing REMA and
its functions.

Site Inspection Visits
REMA will undertake regular site visits to inspect and verify for themselves the nature and extent of the
impacts. REMA will undertake also undertake regular site visits to inspect and verify for themselves the
extent to which the mitigation measures proposed in this EMP are being complied with or vice versa. They
will then be expected to make viable recommendations based on their findings to the EA and
ELECTROGAZ.




                                                                                                            76

REMA is designated to undertake site inspection visits at will and at any time as stipulated for by the
Organic law. During the construction phase, REMA will be making monthly site visits to assess the progress
and compliance to the EMP. During the operation phase, the site visits by REMA will be determined by the
available staff capacity in REMA. Presently, REMA has allocated one of its staff to provide support to the
project on a full time basis.

Periodic Reports
REMA will prepare periodic environmental consolidated reports on their analysis of the compliance progress
of the construction of the power plant. REMA will submit these reports at its own discretion to whoever is
specified in the Organic Law.

Role of the Contractor

Daily and Routine Monitoring
The company/firm that will be awarded the contract to install the diesel power plant will undertake the major
role of ensuring the mitigation measures in the EMP are followed to the detail.

During construction the contactor will undertake regular monitoring of all the activities occurring in the
project site to ensure compliance to the EMP.

The contactor will bear all the costs related to monitoring activities during the construction and installation
phase of the diesel power plant.

Role of the Safeguards Advisor/UERP
The UERP/PCU assisted by the Safeguards Advisor will undertake regular monitoring of all their planned
activities during all the phases of the project as specified in the EMP document.

The Safeguards Advisor will assist the UERP/PCU to develop suitable records of the site inspections and
visits for submission to REMA and the World Bank. This will involve efforts towards building the capacity of
the UERP/PCU towards this end as well.

The Safeguards Advisor will also be responsible for assisting in building capacity of the UERP/PCU in
monitoring the impacts and mitigation measures resulting from the action of the contractors, transporters
and suppliers and all third parties in the course of their duties under the project.

Kigali Fire Brigade

Site Inspection
During the construction and installation of equipments in the project area, the Kigali Fire Brigade which is
the agency responsible for fire management in the City Kigali will undertake site inspection to verify if a fire
management plan is in place before construction works begin. Thereafter upon commissioning of the
project, this agency will further ascertain that the correct fire management equipments as stipulated in the
fire response plan are in place and in the right points.

Fire Drills
The EMP provides for regular fire drills preferably twice annually. The overall objective is to ensure that
there is a high level of preparedness against fire outbreaks at all times. ELECTROGAZ will arrange for its
own fire drills and will engage the Kigali Fire Brigade depending on their availability.




                                                                                                            77

World Bank
Approval
The World Bank will provide approval to the final EMP and RAP for the power plant developed before
construction activities begin. This approval will only be given if the World Bank is satisfied with the EMPs
and RAPs developed.

Role of ELECTROGAZ

Routine Monitoring
ELECTROGAZ will provide routine monitoring at all the stages of the project implementation as indicated in
the EMP. More specifically during the operation phase of the plant, ELECTROGAZ will be the main
responsible institution for undertaking all the mitigation and monitoring requirements in the EMP.

Monitoring Equipment (s) Needed by ELECTROGAZ
The UERP PCU will purchase two equipments that are necessary for monitoring of air emissions and noise
levels at the Jabana plant and which will be used by ELECTROGAZ for regular monitoring of the same. The
Annex C section of this report contains the specifications of these equipments whilst the EMP highlights the
costs of the same equipment.

Emission Measurement Equipment
In order to undertake the emission levels at the regular intervals specified in the EMP, instruments for
measuring emissions of the gaseous must be purchased and used by the ELECTROGAZ site managers at
the plant. The UERP/PCU will purchase this equipment which will be at the plant for regular use and upon
the end of the UERP this equipment will remain the property of ELECTROGAZ.

Noise Measurement Equipment
In order to undertake the noise levels at the regular intervals specified in the EMP, instruments for
measuring noise levels must be purchased and used by the ELECTROGAZ site managers at the plant. The
UERP/PCU will purchase this equipment which will be at the diesel plant for regular use and upon the end
of the UERP this equipment will remain the property of ELECTROGAZ.

Effluent Measurement
In order to undertake the effluent release levels at the regular intervals specified in the EMP, the relevant
ELECTROGAZ staff at the plant will collect water samples at regular intervals as specified in the EMP and
submit for testing at accredited laboratories in Kigali for testing and results. The UERP/PCU will meet the
cost of testing for effluent until the life of the project and thereafter, ELECTROGAZ will be expected to take
samples to the laboratory for testing at its own cost.

Clarification of responsibilities related to monitoring

Contractor
The contracted company will be solely responsible for ensuring that monitoring and adherence to the EMP
beginning from the construction phase up to the point where they install the plant and it is commissioned.
Thereafter there responsibility to the project monitoring ceases henceforth. However, the contractor will for
a period of one year provide one technical person to provide capacity building support in all the related
management and maintenance field.

UERP/PCU



                                                                                                           78

The UERP PCU will provide oversight monitoring of the project in accordance with the EMP up until the 4
year life span of the project. Upon the end of the project duration, the UERP PCU will no longer be
responsible for any monitoring activities associated with the project thereafter.


ELECTROGAZ
ELECTROGAZ will remain the sole institution that will fundamentally be responsible for undertaking
monitoring through out the project phase, when the contactor hands over the project and also after the
UERP PCU winds up as a project. ELECTROGAZ will be expected to ensure monitoring through out the
project phase until if it gets decommissioned.

Complaints from PAPs
During the construction phase of the project complaints from PAPs on any adverse impacts will be directed
to the plant manager. However, as required by the Organic Act, the local population needs to be made
aware of the fact that they can raise their complaints to REMA which is the institution that can enforce
environmental regulations. For that matter REMA needs to up its communication and awareness strategy
so that the population is conversant with who they can lodge their complaints.

EMP Responsibility and Costs
The table below is the Environmental Management Plan for mitigating the project's potential adverse
impacts. The principal responsible actors in implementing the EMP at each stage have been highlighted in
red and underlined and the rest of the actors provide oversight support.

    · Specifically during the design phase of the project, the responsibility of implementation will lie with
         UERP and ELECTROGAZ. During the construction phase, the contractor and ELECTROGAZ will
         be responsible fully for implementing the mitigation in the EMP. At the operation and
         decommissioning phase, ELECTROGAZ will be solely responsible for implementing the EMP.

    · In terms of cost of implementation, the resettlement and compensation costs will be met by UERP
         and are reflected in the ARAP.

    · Mitigation costs at the construction phase cannot be quantified in the EMP because they are in
         built in the overall bidding cost by the contractor. The contractor is going to meet all the costs
         related to construction related impacts.

    · Costs for mitigating potential impacts at the operation and decommissioning phase will be met by
         ELECTROGAZ.

    · ** In the EMP table the principal responsible party for each mitigation is underlined. However, in
         any EMP no single party has overall mandate over mitigation and monitoring. The rest of the
         parties mentioned will be responsible for undertaking oversight monitoring and enforcement as is
         the case with REMA and this is why they have all been included**.

MONITORING PROTOCOL
FOR THE DIESEL POWER PLANT

9.2 Monitoring Plan
A detailed environmental monitoring plan has been developed to verify that predictions of environmental
impacts are accurate and that unforeseen impacts are detected at an early stage and allow corrective
measures to be implemented, if needed. During the construction phase the plan provides for dust, noise and
safety monitoring. During the operation period, monitoring is planned for air emissions and air quality,
noise, water quality and effluent monitoring as well as a routine inspection of the oil tanks storage and
handling area.

Baseline water quality analysis was conducted at several points along the Nyabugogo River and the results
of these analyses are reflected in the table below.

It was not possible to undertake ambient noise levels due to lack of instruments but before the
commissioning of the plant UERP plans to procure a noise meter which will be used to undertake the tests.
The noise meter will also be used to conduct initial tests to the engines at different distances to verify the
noise levels.

Ambient air quality test was also undertaken at different points within the plant site using the passive
approach. The parameters that were analyzed and results are shown below;

9.2.1 Responsibilities and Costs for Environmental Mitigation Measures
Table below outlines the overall package of environmental mitigation measures that will be implemented in
relation to the diesel power facility. The table also assigns general responsibilities for implementing each
group of mitigation measures. A detailed implementation schedule has also been developed.

Consistent with the UERP/PCU and World Bank's contracting strategy of integrating environmental
protection and mitigation activities into the Contractor's Scope of Work, the specifications for many of the
activities were included in the bid package upon which the Contractor is developing its base rates.
Therefore, since many of the costs associated with environmental protection and mitigation activities are
included in the Contractor's base rates, it is not possible to present a detailed accounting of all the monies
devoted to the project's construction phase environmental protection and mitigation activities. These costs
are therefore described as `Within contract budget' in Table below. Similarly, mitigation or monitoring
measures that will be carried out by ELECTROGAZ staff, with no additional expenditure required, are
described as `Within operational budget' in Table below.

   · The parameters for water quality analysis are available in the monitoring plan section in the next
        table.
   · 10,000 USD for PPE is based on cost estimated provided by ELECTROGAZ staff following
        incurred costs in other power plants or sub stations. The cost is recurrent and spread over 4 years.
        It is not related to monitoring but to mitigation costs.
   · The maintenance of fire equipment is going to be the responsibility of ELECTROGAZ.                 The
        contractor will hand over the plant to the client after commissioning and would only retain 2 experts
        if agreed with ELECTROGAZ for a period of one year to offer technical advice after which the plant
        will be fully operated and managed by ELECTROGAZ. According to the contract, the client does
        not provide financial resources and support for maintenance instead the contractor only offers
        technical support.
   · ELECTROGAZ will outsource this services related to OHS training.

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATIONS

Demand for electricity in Rwanda continues to outstrip supply, with the total shortfall in electricity supply
across the country. Industrial, commercial, and domestic electricity consumption is restricted by supply, thus
additional generation is required to promote economic growth and poverty alleviation for a shorter period
before long term projects under construction and improvement are completed.

The diesel power plant will provide an additional 20 MW to the national grid. The plant will also promote
regional investment and rural electrification programme thus reducing pressure on biomass energy source.
The plants will also create short-term construction employment and long-term operational jobs.

Based on the findings of the study, the project is environmentally and socially viable with minimal adverse
environmental impacts. Being an emergency project, most of the impacts will be short term with low
magnitude confined within the project site.

Some of the impacts are inevitable and can only be minimised due to inadequate or lack of effective
technology. If the Environmental Management is implemented, the impacts of the project will either be
eliminated or minimised to a manageable and sustainable levels.

10.1 Recommendations
An annual environmental audit should be undertaken after the first year of plant operations. The areas to be
assessed should include oil, air and noise pollution. The audit should also review the projects compliance of
environmental management plan and standards prescribed in the EMP.

When decommissioning the project, the proponent should rehabilitate the site to its former status and
remedial action undertaken to ensure the land is not contaminated.

For future reference it would be advisable to have gas combined cycle plant as opposed to diesel fuelled
generators which is expensive and unsustainable for a country like Rwanda which has no oil deposit.

Agenda

    How will Word of Life get the new plot to set up its infrastructures since its old plot will be used to install
    the 20 MW diesel power plants for ELECTROGAZ?

Meeting

    After seeing the importance of the 20 MW diesel power plant project, realising that, two years ago, the
    old plot given to Word of life was identified for installation of the 20 MW diesel power plant and it was
    only one convenient plot for 20 MW project due particularly to technical advantages that it offers, all the
    participants agreed to go ahead looking how to speed up the land acquisition process initiated by
    Gasabo District with regards to the new plot where Word of Life could develop its project. The new
    identified site located at around 300 meters from the old one.

    The discussions ended by agreeing on the followings:




                                                                                                             112

             -   Gasabo District has started the inventory of items to be discarded within the identified plot
                 for Word of Life and the relevant compensation document will be available within one
                 week.
             -   The said plot shall be with the same value as the old one and relevant amount shall be
                 transferred by PCU-UERP/ELECTROGAZ immediately after signature of these minutes
                 and upon presentation of the account number by the Beneficiary (Word of Life).
             -   Compensation shall cover also receipted costs for the topographic survey initially
                 performed by Word of Life totalling 500 USD.
             -   Word of Life/Home of Hope Rwanda and UERP agreed to co-operate in connection to
                 access road for the two sites, water supply, electricity connection etc.

ANNEX B. AMBIENT AIR, NOISE and EFFLUENT QUALITY STANDARDS
The guidelines presented in the tables below are to be used only for carrying out an environment
assessment and monitoring in the absence of local ambient standards as is the case with Rwanda where
there are no ambient quality standards yet. They were constructed as consensus values taking particular
account of WHO, USEPA, and EU standards and guidelines. They do not in any way substitute for a
country's own ambient air quality standards.

 (micrograms per cubic meter)


                              24-hour                                       Annual
 Pollutant                   average                                        average


 PM10                          150                                            50
 TSPa                          230                                            80
 Nitrogen dioxide              150                                            100
 Sulfur dioxide                150                                            80


 Measurement of PM10 is preferable to measurement of TSP.


For plants smaller than 50 MWe, including those burning non fossil fuels, PM emissions levels may be as
much as 100 mg/Nm3. If justified by the EA, PM emissions levels up to 150 mg/Nm3 may be acceptable in
special circumstances. The maximum emissions levels for nitrogen oxides remain the same, while for sulfur
dioxide, the maximum emissions level is 2,000 mg/Nm3.

Ambient Noise
Noise abatement measures should achieve either the levels given below or a maximum increase in
background levels of 3 decibels (measured on the A scale) [dB (A)]. Measurements are to be taken at noise
receptors located outside the project property boundary.

                                                     Maximum allowable log

Liquid Effluents
The effluent levels presented in Table 2 (for the applicable parameters) should be achieved daily without
dilution. Where leaching of toxics to groundwater or their transport in surface runoff is a concern, suitable
preventive and control measures such as protective liners and collection and treatment of runoff should be
put in place.

Institutional requirements and monitoring
UERP will undertake environmental monitoring to ensure that the construction and operation of the diesel
power plant complies with high environmental standards and the requirements of the environmental
legislation applicable in Rwanda and the policies and guidelines by World Bank.

Annual monitoring reports arising from the monitoring activities will be made available to REMA and World
Bank and others as requested and appropriate. If any standards have been exceeded, the operator will
investigate probable causes and if any are traced to the operation of the plant, remedial measures will be
implemented to restore compliance.

UERP/PCU will submit to World Bank and REMA an annual report containing the summary of the
     (i)       Monitoring results for the stack emissions, noise, and water quality;
     (ii)      Copies of all permits, licenses, and clearances related to the environment and safety issued by
               the relevant government agencies; and
     (iii)     In the event that in the reporting period the project has been cited for violation of any
               environmental or safety regulations, the report will include a certification from the relevant
               government agency that the defect has been corrected or an acceptable plan to correct the
               defect has been approved.

Emissions from the main stack will also be monitored to demonstrate compliance with emission standards
and guidelines. Noise will be monitored at the start of each construction phase and thereafter every month
to test compliance with the appropriate noise standards described in this report. Noise will also be monitored
at any time if legitimate complaints of excessive noise are received from the local community. If the
appropriate noise standards are exceeded, action will be taken to reduce noise levels. All effluent monitoring
will take place in the discharge pipe of wastewater. Temperature, pH, and flow rate will be monitored
continuously and conductivity will be monitored at intervals.

With regard to monitoring emissions and air quality:
In addition to the control of combustion conditions in real time, required to ensure the best (and therefore
most economic) energy output possible, regular monitoring of the emissions of the main pollutants is also
required in order to ensure compliance with maximum levels. With regard to sulphur dioxide emissions,
monitoring can alternatively be based on the sulphur content in fuel oil.

Monitoring data will be analyzed and reviewed at regular intervals and compared with the operating
standards so that any necessary corrective actions can be taken. Records of monitoring results will be kept



                                                                                                          115

in an acceptable format. The results will be reported in summary form, with notification of exceptions, if any,
to the responsible government authorities and relevant parties, as required. In the absence of specific
national or local government guidelines, actual monitoring or surrogate performance data will be reported at
least annually.

ANNEX D. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN FOR PROPOSED PLANT

The construction and installation including the operation of the proposed diesel power plant in J is expected
to trigger the likelihood of potential incidences which require the need for the development of an Emergency
Response Plan to arrest such incidences whenever and if they occur.
This is a framework of how the emergency response plan is for the diesel plant is expected to look and is by
no way the actual response plan. It is expected that the winning company to be awarded the contract of
constructing the diesel power plant will develop a comprehensive response plan which will be guided by a
vulnerability assessment for which the company will have to undertake. This emergency response plan has
incorporated separate sections handling responses to fire hazards in the plant including steps for reporting
incidences.

Why develop an Emergency Response Plan?
An ERP is a definite plan to deal with major emergencies in any enterprise and in effect is an important
element in all diesel power plants and programs. Besides the major benefit of providing guidance during an
emergency, developing the plan has other advantages. Unrecognized hazardous conditions that would
aggravate an emergency situation may be uncovered, allowing them to be eliminated. The planning process
may bring to light deficiencies, such as the lack of resources (equipment, trained personnel, supplies), items
that can be rectified before an emergency occurs. In addition an emergency plan promotes safety
awareness and shows the organization's commitment to the safety of workers.

The lack of an emergency plan could lead to severe losses such as multiple casualties and possible
financial collapse of the organization.

An attitude of "it can't happen here" may be present. People may not be willing to take the time and effort to
examine the problem. However, emergency planning is an important part of company operation.

Since emergencies will occur, preplanning is necessary to prevent possible disaster. An urgent need for
rapid decisions, shortage of time, and lack of resources and trained personnel can lead to chaos during an
emergency. Time and circumstances in an emergency mean that normal channels of authority and
communication cannot be relied upon to function routinely. The stress of the situation can lead to poor
judgment resulting in severe losses.

What is the overall objective of this plan?
This emergency plan specifies procedures for handling sudden unexpected situations. The objective is to
reduce the possible consequences of the emergency by:
      · Preventing fatalities and injuries;
      · Reducing damage to buildings, stock, and equipment; and
      · Accelerating the resumption of normal operations.

Development of the plan begins with a vulnerability assessment. The results of the study will show:
      · How likely a situation is to occur
      · What means are available to stop or prevent the situation and
      · What is necessary for a given situation

From this analysis, appropriate emergency procedures can be established. At the planning stage, it is
important that several groups be asked to participate. Among these groups, the setting up of a joint
occupational health and safety committee can provide valuable input and a means of wider worker
involvement. Appropriate municipal officials should also be consulted since control may be exercised by the



                                                                                                          120

local government in major emergencies and additional resources may be available. Communication, training
and periodic drills will ensure adequate performance if the plan must be carried out.

Vulnerability assessment
Although emergencies by definition are sudden events, their occurrence can be predicted with some degree
of certainty. The first step is to find which hazards pose a threat to any specific enterprise. When a list of
hazards is made, records of past incidents and occupational experience are not the only sources of valuable
information. Since major emergencies are rare events, knowledge of both technological (chemical or
physical) and natural hazards can be broadened by consulting with fire departments, insurance companies,
engineering consultants, and government departments.

The company to be contracted will be expected to undertake a comprehensive vulnerability assessment for
the Jabana project site. The hazards identified here are merely the common hazards associated with diesel
power plants. They are classified into two categories mainly:

Technological hazards
Areas where flammables, explosives, or chemicals are used or stored should be considered as the most
likely place for a technological hazard emergency to occur. Examples of these hazards are:
     · Fire
     · Explosion
     · Building collapse
     · Major structural failure
     · Spills of flammable liquids
     · Accidental release of toxic substances
     · Deliberate release of hazardous biological agents, or toxic chemicals
     · Loss of electrical power
     · Loss of water supply
     · Loss of communications

Natural Hazards
     · Floods
     · Earthquakes
     · Other severe wind storms
     · Severe extremes in temperature (hot).

The possibility of one event triggering others must be considered. An explosion may start a fire and cause
structural failure while an earthquake might initiate all the events noted in the list of chemical and physical
hazards.

What is the series of events or decisions that should be considered?

Having identified the hazards, the possible major impacts of each should be itemized, such as:
     · Sequential events (for example, fire after explosion)
     · Evacuation
     · Casualties
     · Damage to plant infrastructure
     · Loss of vital records/documents
     · Damage to equipment
     · Disruption of work



                                                                                                             121

Based on these events, the required actions are determined. For example:
     · Declare emergency
     · Sound the alert
     · Evacuate danger zone
     · Close main shutoffs
     · Call for external aid
     · Initiate rescue operations
     · Attend to casualties
     · Fight fire

The final consideration is a list and the location of resources needed:
     · Medical supplies
     · Auxiliary communication equipment
     · Power generators
     · Respirators
     · Chemical and radiation detection equipment
     · Mobile equipment
     · Emergency protective clothing
     · Fire fighting equipment
     · Ambulance
     · Rescue equipment
     · Trained personnel

Elements of the emergency plan to be developed by the contractor
The emergency plan should include;
All possible emergencies, consequences, required actions, written procedures, and the resources available
     · Detailed lists of personnel including their home telephone numbers, their duties and responsibilities
     · Floor plans, and
     · Large scale maps showing evacuation routes and service conduits (such as gas and water lines).

Since a sizable document will likely result, the plan should provide staff members with written instructions
about their particular emergency duties.

The following are examples of the parts of an emergency plan. These elements may not cover every
situation in every workplace but serve they are provided as a general guideline when writing a workplace
specific plan:

Objective
The objective is a brief summary of the purpose of the plan; that is, to reduce human injury and damage to
property in an emergency. It also specifies those staff members who may put the plan into action. The
objective identifies clearly who these staff members are since the normal chain of command cannot always
be available on short notice. At least one of them must be on the site at all times when the premises are
occupied. The extent of authority of these personnel must be clearly indicated.

Organization
One individual should be appointed and trained to act as Emergency coordinator as well as a "back-up"
coordinator. However, personnel on the site during an emergency are key in ensuring that prompt and
efficient action is taken to minimize loss. In some cases it may be possible to recall off-duty employees to
help but the critical initial decisions usually must be made immediately.



                                                                                                       122

Specific duties, responsibilities, authority, and resources must be clearly defined. Among the responsibilities
that must be assigned are:
          · Reporting the emergency
          · Activating the emergency plan
          · Assuming overall command
          · Establishing communication
          · Alerting staff
          · Ordering evacuation
          · Alerting external agencies
          · Confirming evacuation complete
          · Alerting outside population of possible risk
          · Requesting external aid
          · Coordinating activities of various groups
          · Advising relatives of casualties
          · Providing medical aid
          · Ensuring emergency shut offs are closed
          · Sounding the all-clear

This list of responsibilities should be completed using the previously developed summary of
countermeasures for each emergency situation. In organizations operating on reduced staff during some
shifts, some personnel must assume extra responsibilities during emergencies. Sufficient alternates for each
responsible position must be named to ensure that someone with authority is available onsite at all times.

External organizations that may be available to assist (with varying response times) include:
     · Fire department
     · Ambulance services
     · Police departments
     · Telephone company
     · Hospitals
     · Utility companies
     · Industrial neighbours
     · Government agencies

These organizations should be contacted in the planning stages to discuss each of their roles during an
emergency. Mutual aid with other industrial facilities in the area should be explored.

Pre-planned coordination is necessary to avoid conflicting responsibilities. For example, the police, fire
department, ambulance service, rescue squad, company fire brigade, and the first aid team may be on the
scene simultaneously. A pre-determined chain of command in such a situation is required to avoid
organizational difficulties. Under certain circumstances, an outside agency may assume command.

Possible problems in communication have been mentioned in several contexts. Efforts should be made to
seek alternate means of communication during an emergency, especially between key personnel such as
overall commander, on-scene commander, engineering, fire brigade, medical, rescue, and outside
agencies. Depending on the size of the organization and physical layout of the premises, it may be
advisable to plan for an emergency control centre with alternate communication facilities. All personnel with
alerting or reporting responsibilities must be provided with a current list of telephone numbers and
addresses of those people they may have to contact.




                                                                                                         123

Procedures
Many factors determine what procedures are needed in an emergency, such as
     · The degree of emergency,
     · The size of organization,
     · The capabilities of the organization in an emergency situation,
     · The immediacy of outside aid,
     · The physical layout of the premises, and
     · The number of structures determines procedures that are needed.
Common elements to be considered in all emergencies include pre-emergency preparation and provisions
for alerting and evacuating staff, handling casualties, and for containing of the emergency.

Natural hazards, such as floods or severe storms, often provide prior warning. The plan should take
advantage of such warnings with, for example, instructions on sand bagging, removal of equipment to
needed locations, providing alternate sources of power, light or water, extra equipment, and relocation of
personnel with special skills. Phased states of alert allow such measures to be initiated in an orderly
manner.

The evacuation order is of greatest importance in alerting staff. To avoid confusion, only one type of signal
should be used for the evacuation order. Commonly used for this purpose are sirens, fire bells, whistles,
flashing lights, paging system announcements, or word-of-mouth in noisy environments. The all-clear signal
is less important since time is not such an urgent concern. The following are "musts":
     · Identify evacuation routes, alternate means of escape make these known to all staff; keep the
          routes unobstructed.
     · Specify safe locations for staff to gather for head counts to ensure that everyone has left the
          danger zone. Assign individuals to assist handicapped employees in emergencies.
     · Carry out treatment of the injured and search for the missing simultaneously with efforts to contain
          the emergency.
     · Provide alternate sources of medical aid when normal facilities may be in the danger zone.
     · Containing the extent of the property loss should begin only when the safety of all staff and
          neighbours at risk has been clearly established.

Testing and Revision
Completing a comprehensive plan for handling emergencies is a major step toward preventing disasters.
However, it is difficult to predict all of the problems that may happen unless the plan is tested. Exercises and
drills may be conducted to practice all or critical portions (such as evacuation) of the plan. A thorough and
immediate review after each exercise, drill, or after an actual emergency will point out areas that require
improvement. Knowledge of individual responsibilities can be evaluated through paper tests or interviews.

The plan should be revised when shortcomings have become known, and should be reviewed at least
annually. Changes in plant infrastructure, processes, and materials used and key personnel are occasions
for updating the plan.
It should be stressed that provision must be made for the training of both individuals and teams, if they are
expected to perform adequately in an emergency. An annual full-scale exercise will help in maintaining a
high level of proficiency.

FIRE RISKS AND MANAGEMENT PLAN
ELECTROGAZ, through the Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project is in the process of selecting a
company to install a diesel power plant as part of the Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation that is aimed towards
alleviating the power problems experienced in Rwanda.

An Environmental Management Plan for the project has been developed and is contained as part of the EIA
study report.

Even though the EMP contains measures for mitigating the potential risk of fire occurrences in the power
plant, the UERP Environmental Safeguards Advisor has developed a Fire Risk and Fire Management Plan
aimed at setting out an outline of procedures to manage and suppress any fire out breaks that could occur
during the functioning of the plant.

This plan is a draft guideline and it is expected that the selected company will refine this plan upon the
undertaking of a vulnerability/risk assessment.

This fire safety plan has been developed and will make every effort to comply with and enforce the
requirements of the Government of Rwanda Fire Code, and all other statues, policies, protocol, procedures
and instructions as may be issued by the Kigali Fire Brigade.

The plan is expected to provide for the safety of plant occupants through the elimination and control of fire
hazards, maintenance of fire protection and life safety systems, establishment and implementation of fire
safety plans, procedures, and inspections of the plant.

The eventual contracted company to install the equipments will be expected to develop a written fire safety
plan which is intended to protect occupants from fire and helps to ensure effective evacuation of the building
under all emergency conditions.

Application
This Plan will have to be refined to incorporate the existing substation facility as well.

Training
Fire safety training and emergency evacuation practice drills for workers must be conducted jointly by a
competent Security/Fire Safety firm no less than once every twelve months.

Emergency Evacuation
In the event of fire or other emergencies that require emergency evacuation of the plant, the procedures
contained in this Fire Safety Plan shall be carried out upon refinement by the contractor.

Emergency Procedures for Occupants
Emergency procedures signage will be affixed to the wall at all key strategic points within the plant. Note: It
should be mandatory to evacuate the plant upon sounding of the Fire Alarm.

Upon Discovery of Fire:
· Leave the fire area immediately and close all doors
· Activate the Fire Alarm
· Call the Kigali Fire Brigade
· Leave building via nearest Exit
· Do not return until it is declared safe to do so by a Fire Official




                                                                                                         125

Upon Hearing Fire Alarm:
     · Before opening doors, feel door and doorknob for heat. If they are not hot, brace yourself against
          the door and open it slightly. If you see smoke, or feel air pressure or a hot draft, close the door
          quickly.
     · Leave building via nearest Exit
     · Close all doors behind you

Fire Alarm Systems
The purpose of the fire alarm system is to alert all occupants to a fire emergency so that evacuation
procedures can be initiated. The fire alarm audible devices should be heard throughout the plant. The fire
alarm system should consist of the following components:

Alarm Initiating Devices ­ These devices should be installed throughout the plant designed to detect heat,
smoke or flame causing an electrical signal to be sent to the Central Control Panel.

Central Control Panel ­ A microprocessor-based device that receives and processes electrical signals from
alarm initiating devices located throughout the plant including heat detectors, smoke detectors, manual pull
stations, sprinkler system alarm switches, etc, then transmits signals that cause audible and visual alarm
devices such as bells, horns, strobe lights, etc to operate.

Annunciator Panel ­ a lighted or graphical display device, located in the main entrance to the plant that
indicates the location or zone of the activated initiating device, e.g. detector that has responded to the
presence of smoke, heat or flame; or a manual pull station that has been activated by an occupant.

Signaling Devices ­ audible and visual devices (horns and strobe lights) located throughout the building in
corridors and rooms to indicate the actuation of the fire alarm system.

FIRE CODE MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS

A certified firm should be contracted and made responsible to implement the following schedule of checks,
tests & inspections; and will maintain records of tests, inspections and maintenance work performed.

     · Check maintain corridors free of obstructions

Elimination of Ignition Sources
All non essential ignition sources must be eliminated where flammable liquids are used or stored. The
following is a list of some of the more common potential ignition sources:

Open flames, such as cutting and welding torches, furnaces, matches, and heaters-these sources should be
kept away from flammable liquids operations. Cutting or welding on flammable liquids equipment should not
be performed unless the equipment has been properly emptied and purged with a neutral gas such as
nitrogen.

Chemical sources of ignition such as D.C. motors, switched, and circuit breakers-these sources should be
eliminated where flammable liquids are handled or stored. Only approved explosion-proof devices should be
used in these areas.

Mechanical sparks-these sparks can be produced as a result of friction. Only non-sparking tools should be
used in areas where flammable liquids are stored or handled.

Static sparks-these sparks can be generated as a result of electron transfer between two contacting
surfaces. The electrons can discharge in a small volume, raising the temperature to above the ignition
temperature. Every effort should be made to eliminate the possibility of static sparks. Also proper bonding
and grounding procedures must be followed when flammable liquids are transferred or transported.

The storage of any flammable or combustible liquid shall not physically obstruct a means of egress from the
building or area.

Containers of flammable or combustible liquids will remain tightly sealed except when transferred, poured or
applied. Remove only that portion of liquid in the storage container required to accomplish a particular job.

Ventilation
Every inside storage room will be provided with a continuous mechanical exhaust ventilation system. To
prevent the accumulation of vapors, the location of both the makeup and exhaust air openings will be
arranged to provide, as far as practical, air movement directly to the exterior of the building and if ducts are
used, they will not be used for any other purpose.

Removal of Incompatibles
Materials that can contribute to a flammable liquid fire should not be stored with flammable liquids.
Examples are oxidizers and organic peroxides, which, on decomposition, can generate large amounts of
oxygen.

Flammable Gases
Generally, flammable gases pose the same type of fire hazards as flammable liquids and their vapors. Many
of the safeguards for flammable liquids also apply to flammable gases, other properties such as toxicity,
reactivity, and corrosivity also must be taken into account. Also, a gas that is flammable could produce toxic
combustion products.




                                                                                                            128

Location and Marking of Extinguishers
Extinguishers should be conspicuously located and readily accessible for immediate use in the event of fire.
They should be located along normal paths of travel and egress. Wall recesses and/or flush-mounted
cabinets should be used as extinguisher locations whenever possible.

Extinguishers should be clearly visible. In locations where visual obstruction cannot be completely avoided,
directional arrows should be provided to indicate the location of extinguishers and the arrows will be marked
with the extinguisher classification.

If extinguishers intended for different classes of fire are located together, they will be conspicuously marked
to ensure that the proper class extinguisher selection is made at the time of a fire. Extinguisher classification
markings will be located on the front of the shell above or below the extinguisher nameplate. Markings will
be of a size and form to be legible from a distance of 3 feet.

Condition
Portable extinguishers should be maintained in a fully charged and operable condition. They should be kept
in their designated locations at all times when not being used. When extinguishers are removed for
maintenance or testing, a fully charged and operable replacement unit should be provided.

Mounting and Distribution of Extinguishers
Extinguishers should be installed on hangers, brackets, in cabinets, or on shelves. Extinguishers having a
gross weight not exceeding 40 pounds should be so installed that the top of the extinguisher is not more
than 3-1/2 feet above the floor.

Extinguishers mounted in cabinets or wall recesses or set on shelves should be placed so that the
extinguisher operating instructions face outward. The location of such extinguishers should be made
conspicuous by marking the cabinet or wall recess in a contrasting color, which should distinguish it from the
normal decor.

Extinguishers must be distributed in such a way that the amount of time needed to travel to their location
and back to the fire does not allow the fire to get out of control. OSHA requires that the travel distance for
Class A and Class D extinguishers not exceed 75 feet. The maximum travel distance for Class B
extinguishers is 50 feet because flammable liquid fires can get out of control faster that Class A fires. There
is no maximum travel distance specified for Class C extinguishers, but they must be distributed on the basis
of appropriate patterns for Class A and B hazards.

Emergency Egress
Every exit should be clearly visible, or the route to it conspicuously identified in such a manner that every
occupant of the building will readily know the direction of escape from any point. At no time should exits be
blocked. Any doorway or passageway which is not an exit or access to an exit but which may be mistaken
for an exit should be identified by a sign reading "Not An Exit" or a sign indicating it actual use (i.e.,
"Storeroom"). Exits and accesses to exits should be marked by a readily visible sign. Each exit sign (other
than internally illuminated signs) should be illuminated by a reliable light source providing not less than 5
foot-candles on the illuminated surface.

Fire Drills
The purpose of the fire drill is to ensure that supervisory staff and occupants are totally familiar with
emergency evacuation procedures, resulting in orderly evacuation with efficient use of exit facilities.




                                                                                                            129

The Kigali Fire Brigade should oversee the fire drill and direct designated supervisory personnel to carry out
the requirements of the Fire Safety Plan. All designated supervisory personnel should be provided access
to the approved Fire Safety Plan prior to being assigned any fire related duties/responsibilities.

The drill should be reported to the Fire Department prior to commencement, in accordance with "Required
Procedures for the Conducting of Fire Drills". The fire drill should include, but not necessarily be restricted
to:

      Checking of the annunciator panel
      Identifying the alarm source/location (the elevators are not to be used)
      Reviewing the fire alarm systems, silence and re-set procedures.
      Reviewing the Fire Safety Plan documents required By the Fire Code
      Practicing the emergency evacuation plan

Following each drill, all persons with delegated responsibility should attend a debriefing session to report on
the actions and the reactions of the participants. The Plant Manager should keep a record of the date of the
drill, who directed the drill, what actions were taken, any problems with supervisory personnel and what
corrective actions can be taken.

Information regarding the fire drills and Fire Code maintenance tasks should be entered in the Fire Log
Book for inspection by the Chief Fire Official, if requested, and kept at the plant Reception Desk.




                                                                                                          130

ANNEX E. INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM AND INVESTIGATION
PROCEDURE
The Incident Reporting System should be designed to:
     · Track and analyze employee injuries and illnesses, property and machinery damage, as well as
          serious events or near misses which might have resulted in personal injury, illness, or property and
          machinery damage
     · Initiate the worker's compensation process, if necessary
     · Meet regulatory reporting requirements

All incidents (accidents resulting in injury or causing illness to employees) and events (near-miss accidents)
should be reported in order to:
     · Establish a written record of factors, which cause injuries and illnesses and occurrences (near-
          misses), which might have resulted in injury or illness but did not, as well as property and
          machinery damage.
     · Maintain a capability to promptly investigate incidents and events in order to initiate and support
          corrective and/or preventive action.
     · Provide statistical information for use in analyzing all phases of incidents and events involving
          personnel.
     · Provide the means for complying with the reporting requirements for occupational injuries and
          illnesses

The Incident Reporting System requirements apply to all incidences involving personnel arising out of or in
the course of employment, which results in (or might have resulted in) personal injury, illness, and/or
property and machinery damage.

A. Incidents (Occupational injuries and illnesses)
Injuries and illnesses that require reporting include those injuries and illnesses occurring on the job which
result in any of the following: lost work time, restrictions in performing job duties, requirement for first aid or
outside medical attention, permanent physical bodily damages, or death. Examples of "reportable injuries
and illnesses include, but are not limited to, heat exhaustion from working in hot environments, strained
back muscles from moving equipment, acid burns on fingers, etc.

Other incidents requiring reporting include those incidents occurring on the job which result in any of the
following: injury or illness, damage to a machine, fire/explosion, property damage or chemical releases
requiring evacuation of at least that immediate spill area. Examples of reportable incidents include denting
the fender of machines/equipment, and release of pressurized air through a leaking valve into a room.

Examples of "non-reportable" injuries and illnesses include small paper cuts, common colds, and small
bruises not resulting in work restrictions or requiring first aid or medical attention.

B. Events (Near Misses)

Other incidents which, strictly by chance, do not result in actual or observable injury, illness, death, or
property damage required to be reported. The information obtained from such reporting can be extremely
useful in identifying and mitigating problems before they result in actual personal or property damage.

Examples of near miss incidences required to be reported include the falling of a compressed gas cylinder,
overexposures to chemical, biological, or physical agents (not resulting in an immediately observable
manifestation of illness or injury), and slipping and falling on a wet surface without injury.



                                                                                                              131

Personnel Responsibilities
All personnel have a responsibility to report all occupational injuries and illnesses, and other incidents or
events under the Incident Reporting System.

A. Committee of Health and Safety

OHS has the overall responsibility for implementing the Incident Reporting System, including review of
incident/event reports, recommendation of corrective and/or preventive actions, and maintaining record
keeping required by the regulations.

B. Supervision

Supervisors are primarily responsible for ensuring that the Incident Report and appropriate workers
compensation forms are completed and distributed as indicated on the forms in a timely manner.

C. Personnel

All employees must be familiar with the procedures for reporting occupational injuries and illnesses and
hazardous conditions or situations in which employees may be potentially exposed. All personnel have the
responsibility to initiate the incident reporting sequence by informing their supervisors immediately of an
actual or potential injury or illness as soon as possible after an incident has occurred.

Incident Reporting Procedures and Practices
This section describes the specific procedures that shall be followed by personnel in order to effectively
report occupational injuries and illnesses and other incidents or events.

A. Incidents (Injuries and Illnesses)

Serious injury or illness posing a life-threatening situation should be reported immediately to the local
emergency response medical services (Call 911).

Injuries and illnesses should be reported by the injured employee to his or her supervisor in person or by
phone as soon after any life-threatening situation has been addressed. If the injured employee is unable to
report immediately, then the incident should be reported as soon as possible.

B. Events

Incidents not involving injury or illness, but resulting in property damage, must also be reported on within 48
hours of the incident.

In cases of a fire or explosion that cannot be controlled by one person, vehicular accident resulting in injury
or damage, or a chemical release requiring a building evacuation, the involved party must immediately
report the incident to the emergency response services in the area (911 - police, fire, etc.) If injuries or
illnesses occur, the reporting must follow those procedures outlined in above.

All near miss incidences are also required to be reported on the Incident Report Form within 48 hours of
occurrence. In place of indicating the result of the incident (i.e., actual personal or property damage), the
reporting person shall indicate the avoided injury or damage.




                                                                                                          132

Events, hazardous working conditions or situations, and incidents involving contractor personnel must be
reported to OHS immediately.

C. Record keeping
OHS will maintain the required and summary of (recordable) Occupational Injuries and Illnesses and the
Supplementary Record of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses for each calendar year.

Incident Investigations
OHS personnel should review each reported incident and event to:
     1.  Determine if further investigation is required and then perform the investigation
     2.  Make recommendations for corrective and/or preventative actions necessary to reduce or eliminate
         hazardous conditions and monitor the status of the abatement actions.

Health and Safety Manual
Each new employee should be given a copy of the Health and Safety Manual upon starting employment.
This manual describes health and safety programs and is available to the employee as a reference dealing
with health and safety issues.

Training
To ensure that personnel are cognizant of the Incident Reporting System requirements and are aware of
their own and other's responsibilities, a series of informational and instructional training opportunities should
exist. Personnel new to the plant should attend New Employee Orientation training, which will inform them
on organizational structure, resources, and procedures. This orientation will ensure that new personnel are
aware of the existence of this Manual and of its contents, and who the responsible persons in their
organizations are.

Review and Audit
The effectiveness of a program can only be accomplished if the program is implemented. Therefore,
periodic reviews and audits should be conducted to confirm that all employees have obtained a copy of this
Manual and are familiar with the incident reporting requirements. Furthermore, review and auditing should
include an inspection of report submissions and filing systems.

Implementation
Implementation of the Incident Reporting System should be effected through a combination of mechanisms.
The general theme of these means is focused on program education, understanding, and awareness which
include:
         · Distribution of the Health and Safety Manual
         · Training for supervisors
         · Program review and audit




                                                                                                            133

ANNEX F. GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT CONDITIONS
· In addition to these general conditions, the Contractor shall comply with any specific Environmental
  Management Plan (EMP) for the works he is responsible for. The Contractor shall inform himself about
  such an EMP, and prepare his work strategy and plan to fully take into account relevant provisions of that
  EMP. If the Contractor fails to implement the approved EMP after written instruction by the Supervising
  Engineer (SE) to fulfil his obligation within the requested time, the Owner reserves the right to arrange
  through the SE for execution of the missing action by a third party on account of the Contractor.

· Notwithstanding the Contractor's obligation under the above clause, the Contractor shall implement all
  measures necessary to avoid undesirable adverse environmental and social impacts wherever possible,
  restore work sites to acceptable standards, and abide by any environmental performance requirements
  specified in an EMP. In general these measures shall include but not be limited to:

    (a) Minimize the effect of dust on the surrounding environment resulting from earth mixing sites,
    asphalt mixing sites, dispersing coal ashes, vibrating equipment, temporary access roads, etc. to
    ensure safety, health and the protection of workers and communities living in the vicinity dust producing
    activities.


    (b) Ensure that noise levels emanating from machinery, vehicles and noisy construction activities (e.g.
    excavation, blasting) are kept at a minimum for the safety, health and protection of workers within the
    vicinity of high noise levels and nearby communities.

    (c) Ensure that existing water flow regimes in the adjacent Nyabugogo river and other natural or
    irrigation channels is maintained and/or re-established where they are disrupted due to works being
    carried out.

    (d) Prevent bitumen, oils, lubricants and waste water used or produced during the execution of works
    from entering into the Nyabugogo River, and CORIKA rice irrigation channel and also ensure that
    stagnant water in uncovered borrow pits is treated in the best way to avoid creating possible breeding
    grounds for mosquitoes.

    (e) Prevent and minimize the impacts of quarrying, earth borrowing, piling and building of temporary
    construction camps and access roads on the biophysical environment including protected areas and
    arable lands; local communities and their settlements. In as much as possible restore/rehabilitate all
    sites to acceptable standards.

    (f) Upon discovery of ancient heritage, relics or anything that might or believed to be of archeological or
    historical importance during the execution of works, immediately report such findings to the SE so that
    the appropriate authorities may be expeditiously contacted for fulfilment of the measures aimed at
    protecting such historical or archaeological resources.

    (g) Implement soil erosion control measures in order to avoid surface run off and prevents siltation, etc.

    (h)   Ensure that garbage, sanitation and drinking water facilities are provided in for construction
    workers.

    (i) Ensure that, in as much as possible, local materials are used to avoid importation of foreign material
    and long distance transportation.




                                                                                                         134

     (j) Ensure public safety, and meet traffic safety requirements for the operation of work to avoid
     accidents.


· The Contractor shall indicate the period within which he/she shall maintain status on site after completion
  of civil works to ensure that significant adverse impacts arising from such works have been appropriately
  addressed.

· The Contractor shall adhere to the proposed activity implementation schedule and the monitoring plan /
  strategy to ensure effective feedback of monitoring information to project management so that impact
  management can be implemented properly, and if necessary, adapt to changing and unforeseen
  conditions.

· Besides the regular inspection of the sites by the SE for adherence to the contract conditions and
  specifications, the Owner may appoint an Inspector to oversee the compliance with these environmental
  conditions and any proposed mitigation measures. State environmental authority (REMA) may carry out
  similar inspection duties. In all cases, as directed by the SE, the Contractor shall comply with directives
  from such inspectors to implement measures required to ensure the adequacy rehabilitation measures
  carried out on the bio-physical environment and compensation for socio-economic disruption resulting
  from implementation of any works.

Worksite Waste Management
· All vessels (drums, containers, bags, etc.) containing oil/fuel/surfacing materials and other hazardous
  chemicals shall be bunded in order to contain spillage. All waste containers, litter and any other waste
  generated during the construction shall be collected and disposed off at designated disposal sites in line
  with applicable government waste management regulations.


· All drainage and effluent from storage areas, workshops shall be captured and treated before being
  discharged into the drainage system in line with applicable government water pollution control regulations.


· Used oil from maintenance shall be collected and disposed off appropriately at designated sites or be re-
  used or sold for re-use locally.


· Entry of runoff to the site shall be restricted by constructing diversion channels or holding structures such
  as banks, drains, dams, etc. to reduce the potential of soil erosion and water pollution.

· Construction waste shall not be left in stockpiles along the road, but removed and reused or disposed of
  on a daily basis.


· If disposal sites for clean spoil are necessary, they shall be located in areas, approved by the SE, of low
  land use value and where they will not result in material being easily washed into drainage channels.
  Whenever possible, spoil materials should be placed in low-lying areas and should be compacted and
  planted with species indigenous to the locality.

Material Excavation and Deposit
· The Contractor shall obtain appropriate licenses/permits from relevant authorities to operate quarries or
 borrow areas.




                                                                                                           135

· The location of quarries and borrow areas shall be subject to approval by relevant local and national
  authorities, including traditional authorities if the land on which the quarry or borrow areas fall in traditional
  land.

· New extraction sites:


       a.  Shall not be located in the vicinity of settlement areas, cultural sites, wetlands or any other
           valued ecosystem component, or on on high or steep ground or in areas of high scenic value,
           and shall not be located less than 1km from such areas.

       b.  Shall not be located adjacent to stream channels wherever possible to avoid siltation of river
           channels. Where they are located near water sources, borrow pits and perimeter drains shall
           surround quarry sites.

       c.  Shall not be located in archaeological areas. Excavations in the vicinity of such areas shall
           proceed with great care and shall be done in the presence of government authorities having a
           mandate for their protection.

       d.  Shall not be located in forest reserves.          However, where there are no other alternatives,
           permission shall be obtained from the appropriate authorities and an environmental impact study
           shall be conducted.

       e.  Shall be easily rehabilitated. Areas with minimal vegetation cover such as flat and bare ground,
           or areas covered with grass only or covered with shrubs less than 1.5m in height, are preferred.

       f.  Shall have clearly demarcated and marked boundaries to minimize vegetation clearing.

· Vegetation clearing shall be restricted to the area required for safe operation of construction work.
  Vegetation clearing shall not be done more than two months in advance of operations.

· Stockpile areas shall be located in areas where trees can act as buffers to prevent dust pollution.
  Perimeter drains shall be built around stockpile areas. Sediment and other pollutant traps shall be located
  at drainage exits from workings.

· The Contractor shall deposit any excess material in accordance with the principles of these general
  conditions, and any applicable EMP, in areas approved by local authorities and/or the SE.

· Areas for depositing hazardous materials such as contaminated liquid and solid materials shall be
  approved by the SE and appropriate local and/or national authorities before the commencement of work.
  Use of existing, approved sites shall be preferred over the establishment of new sites.

Rehabilitation and Soil Erosion Prevention
· To the extent practicable, the Contractor shall rehabilitate the site progressively so that the rate of
  rehabilitation is similar to the rate of construction.

· Always remove and retain topsoil for subsequent rehabilitation. Soils shall not be stripped when they are
  wet as this can lead to soil compaction and loss of structure.

· Topsoil shall not be stored in large heaps. Low mounds of no more than 1 to 2m high are recommended.




                                                                                                               136

· Re-vegetate stockpiles to protect the soil from erosion, discourage weeds and maintain an active
  population of beneficial soil microbes.

· Locate stockpiles where they will not be disturbed by future construction activities.

· To the extent practicable, reinstate natural drainage patterns where they have been altered or impaired.

· Remove toxic materials and dispose of them in designated sites. Backfill excavated areas with soils or
  overburden that is free of foreign material that could pollute groundwater and soil.

· Identify potentially toxic overburden and screen with suitable material to prevent mobilization of toxins.

· Ensure reshaped land is formed so as to be inherently stable, adequately drained and suitable for the
  desired long-term land use, and allow natural regeneration of vegetation.

· Minimize the long-term visual impact by creating landforms that are compatible with the adjacent
  landscape.

· Minimize erosion by wind and water both during and after the process of reinstatement.

· Compacted surfaces shall be deep ripped to relieve compaction unless subsurface conditions dictate
  otherwise.

· Revegetate with plant species that will control erosion, provide vegetative diversity and, through
  succession, contribute to a resilient ecosystem. The choice of plant species for rehabilitation shall be
  done in consultation with local research institutions, forest department and the local people.

Water Resources Management
· The Contractor shall at all costs avoid conflicting with water demands of local communities.

· Abstraction of both surface and underground water shall only be done with the consultation of the local
  community and after obtaining a permit from the relevant Water Authority.

· Abstraction of water from wetlands shall be avoided. Where necessary, authority has to be obtained from
  relevant authorities.

· Temporary damming of streams and rivers shall be done in such a way avoids disrupting water supplies
  to communities down stream, and maintains the ecological balance of the river system.

· No construction water containing spoils or site effluent, especially cement and oil, shall be allowed to flow
  into natural water drainage courses.

· Wash water from washing out of equipment shall not be discharged into water courses or road drains.

· Site spoils and temporary stockpiles shall be located away from the drainage system, and surface run off
  shall be directed away from stockpiles to prevent erosion.

Traffic management
· Location of access roads/detours shall be done in consultation with the local community especially in
  important or sensitive environments. Access roads shall not traverse wetland areas.


                                                                                                           137

· Upon the completion of civil works, all access roads shall be ripped and rehabilitated.

· Access roads shall be sprinkled with water at least five times a day in settled areas, and three times in
  unsettled areas, to suppress dust emissions.

Disposal of unusable elements
· Unusable materials and construction elements such as electro-mechanical equipment, pipes, accessories
  and demolished structures will be disposed of in a manner approved by the SE. The Contractor has to
  agree with the SE which elements are to be surrendered to the Client's premises, which will be recycled
  or reused, and which will be disposed of at approved landfill sites.

· As far as possible, abandoned pipelines shall remain in place. Where for any reason no alternative
  alignment for the new pipeline is possible, the old pipes shall be safely removed and stored at a safe
  place to be agreed upon with the SE and the local authorities concerned.

· AC-pipes as well as broken parts thereof have to be treated as hazardous material and disposed of as
  specified above.

· Unsuitable and demolished elements shall be dismantled to a size fitting on ordinary trucks for transport.

Health and safety
· In advance of the construction work, the Contractor shall mount an awareness and hygiene campaign.
  Workers and local residents shall be sensitized on health risks particularly of AIDS.

· Adequate road signs to warn pedestrians and motorists of construction activities, diversions, etc. shall be
  provided at appropriate points.

· Construction vehicles shall not exceed maximum speed limit of 40km per hour.

Repair of private property
· Should the Contractor, deliberately or accidentally, damage private property, he shall repair the property
  to the owner's satisfaction and at his own cost. For each repair, the Contractor shall obtain from the
  owner a certificate that the damage has been made good satisfactorily in order to indemnify the Client
  from subsequent claims.

· In cases where compensation for inconveniences, damage of crops etc. are claimed by the owner, the
  Client has to be informed by the Contractor through the SE. This compensation is in general settled
  under the responsibility of the Client before signing the Contract. In unforeseeable cases, the respective
  administrative entities of the Client will take care of compensation.

Contractor's environment, health and safety management plan
Within 6 weeks of signing the Contract, the Contractor shall prepare an EHS-MP to ensure the adequate
management of the health, safety, environmental and social aspects of the works, including implementation
of the requirements of these general conditions and any specific requirements of an EMP for the works.
The Contractor's EHS-MP will serve two main purposes:

For the Contractor, for internal purposes, to ensure that all measures are in place for adequate EHS
management, and as an operational manual for his staff.




                                                                                                        138

For the Client, supported where necessary by a SE, to ensure that the Contractor is fully prepared for the
adequate management of the EHS aspects of the project, and as a basis for monitoring of the Contractor's
EHS performance.

The Contractor's EHS-MP shall provide at least:

      · A description of procedures and methods for complying with these general environmental
           management conditions, and any specific conditions specified in an EMP;
      · A description of specific mitigation measures that will be implemented in order to minimize adverse
           impacts;
      · A description of all planned monitoring activities (e.g. sediment discharges from borrow areas) and
           the reporting thereof; and
      · The internal organizational, management and reporting mechanisms put in place for such.

The Contractor's EHS-MP will be reviewed and approved by the Client before start of the works. This review
should demonstrate if the Contractor's EHS-MP covers all of the identified impacts, and has defined
appropriate measures to counteract any potential impacts.

EHS Reporting
The Contractor shall prepare bi-weekly progress reports to the SE on compliance with these general
conditions, the project EMP if any, and his own EHS-MP. An example format for a Contractor EHS report is
given below. It is expected that the Contractor's reports will include information on:

      · EHS management actions/measures taken, including approvals sought from local or national
           authorities;
      · Problems encountered in relation to EHS aspects (incidents, including delays, cost consequences,
           etc. as a result thereof);
      · Lack of compliance with contract requirements on the part of the Contractor;
      · Changes of assumptions, conditions, measures, designs and actual works in relation to EHS
           aspects; and
      · Observations, concerns raised and/or decisions taken with regard to EHS management during site
           meetings.

It is advisable that reporting of significant EHS incidents be done "as soon as practicable". Such incident
reporting shall therefore be done individually. Also, it is advisable that the Contractor keeps his own records
on health, safety and welfare of persons, and damage to property. It is advisable to include such records,
as well as copies of incident reports, as appendixes to the bi-weekly reports. Example formats for an incident
notification and detailed report are given below. Details of EHS performance will be reported to the Client through the
SE's reports to the Client.

Training of Contractor's Personnel
The Contractor shall provide sufficient training to his own personnel to ensure that they are all aware of the
relevant aspects of these general conditions, any project EMP, and his own EHS-MP, and are able to fulfil
their expected roles and functions. Specific training should be provided to those employees that have
particular responsibilities associated with the implementation of the EHS-MP. General topics should be:
      · EHS in general (working procedures);
      · emergency procedures; and
      · Social and cultural aspects (awareness raising on social issues).




                                                                                                                  139

Cost of compliance
It is expected that compliance with these conditions is already part of standard good workmanship and state
of art as generally required under this Contract. The item "Compliance with Environmental Management
Conditions" in the Bill of Quantities covers these costs. No other payments will be made to the Contractor
for compliance with any request to avoid and/or mitigate an avoidable EHS impact.




                                                                                                      140
