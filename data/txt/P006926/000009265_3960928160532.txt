MDMORUNDUM AND RECCHHZSTION OF YUE PESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL RANU OP RECONSTRUCTION AND D VZLOPEn T
TO THE EXECUm    DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC 0? COSTA RiCk
FOR TEE
TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
1.       Background:  Transport sector management weaknesses end the poor physical
condition of the roads in Costa Rica hinder reliable transport at a reasonable
cost. Around 702 of the roads are in poor condition mainly for want of
maintenance. Key sector issues includet (a) MOPT's weak management and poor
setting of priorities, (specially in the allocation of resources between the
Federal and the Cantonal networks) and ineffective coordination between planning
and execution of works; (b) inefficient and heavily subsidized railway (about
US$8-10 million annually or 17? of the transport sector investments in 1988); and
(c) high cost of port services. Whereas there is full cost recovery in the road
subsector and the retail price of motor fuels is above the border price, the
railway loses about CR$ 2.6 for every CES earned in revenues and the port tariffs
are not based on costs. The Government's adjnstment atrategy emphasizes resolution
of these issues in the context of improving public sector efficiency. Progress has
been made; for example the entities responsible for road maintenance have been
reorganized recently and made accountable to MOPT's Chief Engineer, the Director
General of Public Works. The Government presented a 1991-1995 program for the
rehabilitation and maintenance of Cantonal roads that was found acceptable by the
Bank. Also, the Government entered into a contract-program with INCOFER which
provides for personnel reductions and other measures to improve its efficiency, so
as to reduce the need for Government subsidies. In addition, the Government
prepared a satisfactory action plan for improving the ports institutional,
financial and operational performance.
2.       Rationale for Bank involvement:  Through six interventions in the road
subsector the Sank has assisted MOPT in setting up the basic apparatus for
planning, programming and execution of investments, and in the development of a
national transport plan. Building on past experience, there is now an opportunity
to assist the Government to improve efficiency in the port and railway subsectors,
in which the Bank has not been hitherto involved. The proposed project would
concentrate on institutional strengthening and promote sound investment policies on
a sector wide basis. No other donor agencies are directly involved in
institutional development on a sector wide basis.
3.       Proiect Obiectives:  The project's objectives are tot Ci) assist the
Government to improve the efficiency of resource use by strengthening transport
sector management; (ii) rationalize the provision of railway services through a
contract program which provides for specific targets to improve efficiency over
time ; (iii) assist the Government's efforts to promote exports by improving the
quality and reliability of road transportation in the main corridors; (iv) improve
port efficiency through equipment modernization; and (v) improve management of in-
transit container traffic through improvements in technology.  The project would
also strengthen MOPT's capacity for planning and programming sectorwide investment
programs and would support its 1991-1995 Investment and Maintenance Program (IMP)
which is satisfactory. The proposed project stresses implementation of
infrastructure maintenance policies and making public investments more efficient.
4.       Proiect Descriptions  The project supports institutional measures to
increase the efficiency of the sector and the Bank loan would fund a slice of



- 2 -
MOPT's ;991-1995 Investment and Maintenance Program (IMP). Selection of the IMPS'
comporLents to be financed under the project was carried out on the basis of
continuity of Bank involvement in the rehabilitation and maintenance of the federal
road network and the urgency of relieving congestion in the Port of Caldera. The
main institutional measures call for ensuring the soundness of the sector's annual
investment program and encouraging increased participation of the private sector,
designing a strategy for the maintenance of Cantonal roads, and improving port
operations and railway services. The institutional strengthening measures will be
supported by technical assistance and training (42) for: (a) developing a new
Transport Plan and strength-ning the Directorate General of Planning (DGP) for
investment programming, project preparation and evaluation, (b) implementing a
pavement management system in DGP and strengthening road maintenance management in
MOPT's Sub-Division of Maintenance, (c) tariff evaluation in MOPT's tariff section
and for tariff setting and costing in IN4COP, (d) improving information management
in JAPDEVA, (e) implementing an action plan to rationalize railway services, and
(f) training for mid-level management in MOPT, JAPDEVA and INCOP. The physical
components aret (i) rehabilitation and upgrading of about 458 km of primary roads
in the import/export corridors (422); (ii) periodic maintenance of about 878 km of
other main roads feeding the corridors (30Z); (iii) replacement of the Puntarenas
jetty in the major port system in the Pacific (9Z); (iv) equipment and tools for:
(a) road and ratl track maintenance, (b) road safety, (c) pavement management, (d)
information systems in MOPT, INCOFER, INCOP, and JAPDEVA. le) grain handling
operations in the port of Calderas, and (f) control of in-transit cargo (9?), and
(v) engineering and supervision of (i) through (iii) (6?). In the past, projects
implementation have had difficulties because of the lack of coordination within the
executing agency and delays in the provision of counterpart funds. These lessons
have been taken into consideration in designing the project; to ensure project
coordination the executing agencies have been fully responsible for project
preparation and a Coordinating Unit will be appointed to execute the project. To
ensure availability of counterpart funds the Borrower will maintain a project
account with sufficient funds to cover six months of expenditures. The total cost
of the project, to be carried out over six years, is estimated at US$96.8 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$68.4 million (71?). A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement are shown in schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the
status of Bank group operations are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 7694-CR dated April 23, 1990, are also attached.
5.       Actions Agreed:  To improve sector management, address the issus- of
maintenance of Federal and Cantonal roads, and scale down railway operations, MOPT
has already carried out a number of measures, including; (i) reorganizing key
offices related to road maintenance and equipment and raising their status in
MOPT's organizational hierarchy; (ii) drawing a satisfactory action plan for the
maintenance of Cantonal roads; and (iii) reducing the staffing and the operational
deficit of the railways.
6.       During negotiations, the Government agreed to:  (a) carry out its
1991-1995 plan for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the Cantonal Roads System
and to review with the Bank, no later than than June 30 of each year its compliance
with the plan; (b) carry out the Program which includes an action plan for the
gradual decentralization of the maintenance of the Cantonal road system, a plan for
the rationalization of port operations and for INCOP to: (i) achieve working and
operating ratios of no more than 852 and 932 respectively by 1992 and maintain no
worse a financial performance thereafter; and (ii) set aside funds for dredging in
order to ensure continuous availability of the berths in Puerto Caldera; (c)
enforce the terms and conditions of the Contract-Program between INCOFER and the
Ministry of Public Works and Transport, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of



-3-
Planing as reviewed and updated by the Implementation Committee; (d) establish and
maintain a Project Account satisfactory to the Bank; (e) establish and maintain a
Project Coordinating Group satiefactory to the Bank; (f) furnish to the Bank, not
later than June 30 of each year a work program for project implementation during
the subsequent year, including inter alia, the next year's road rehabilitation and
maintenance program financed under the project and its related environmental impact
analyses. The latter will be HOPT's responsibility and will be carried out by the
Ministry of Natural Resources and Mines and/or by qualified consultants; (g) update
and review with the Bank, not later than June 30 of each year, its five-year
Investment and Maintenance Program (IMP) following policies and criteria acceptable
to the Bank; (h) increase the use of contractors in MPOT's periodic maintenance of
the primary and secondary roads to reach 652; (i) include in the procurement
documents for LCB a price adjustment mechanism satisfactory to the Bank; (j) cause
MOPT to ensure that the subprojects financed under the project will be carried out
in accordance with sound archeological practices in respect of the cultural
property of Costa Rica; (k) cause MOPT to present to the Bank, not later than June
30, 1993 an action plan, satisfactory to the Bank, for the implementation of the
recommendations of MOPT's reorganization study to be carried out under the
technical assistance for developing the Transport Plan and comply with the terms
and conditions of said plant and (1) when 502 of the loan funds have been
committed, the Bank and the Borrower to carry out e mid-term review of progress in
project implementation. Failure to implement the Project and the Action Plans will
constitute default under the Loan Agreement.
7.       Loan effectiveness would be contingent upon:  (a) satisfactory progress in
implementing the railways' Contract-Plan; (b) the appointment of a Project
Coordinating Unit with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank; (c) the Borrower to
set-up a project account, satisfactory to the Bank, with an initial deposit of
US$1.2 million to be replenished every four months and to establish a special
account in its Central Bank; and (d) the Borrower, INCOFER, INCOP and JAPDEVA
entering into subsidiary agreements to make available loan proceeds.
83.      Benefits.  The  proposed project is expected to yield economic rates of
return well in excess of the estimated opportunity cost of capital, which is about
12?. For the first year program of road works, the estimated economic rate of
return is 352.
9.       Risks.  No major technical risks are expected, but because of tha
project's policy emphasis, there are risks related to the sustainability of the
Government's commitment and its ability to implement the required policy and
institutional reforms in the sector, particularly in the sensitive domain of staff
reductions in the railways. The series of actions to be agreed upon as outlined
above, early implementation of initial actions before Board presentation and the
mid-term review proposed should contain these risks to an acceptable level.
10.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
