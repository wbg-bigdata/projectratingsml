IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Central African Republic
Economic Management Project (Credit 1971-CA)
Preface
I.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Economic
Management Project in the Central African Republic (CAR), for which Credit 1971-CA
in the amount of SDR 10.3 million was approved on December 13, 1988 and made
effective on October 5, 1989. The credit was closed on March 31, 1997, 27 months after
the original closing date of December 31, 1994. Final disbursement took place on May 5,
1997, at which time a balance of SDR 1,312,087.55 was cancelled. Co-financing for the
project was envisaged by UTNDP but not provided.
2.    The ICR was prepared by Ellen Cohen from the Institutional Development and
Social Policy Division of the Africa Region and reviewed by David Berk, Acting Country
Director, AFCD7. The Borrower did not provide comments.
3.    Due to the socio-political unrest in CAR during 1996, a completion mission did
not take place. Preparation of the ICR was done at HQ and is based on material in the
project file. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by preparing its own
assessinent of the Economic Management Project implementation, a summary of which is
attached as Appendix A.






Economic Management Project (Credit 1971-CA)
Central African Republic
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
I.   IDA free-standing TA projects to CAR began with an emergency operation, Cr.
1150-CA, approved in FY81 to help Government get the economy moving and increase
external financing and absorptive capacity. The Second TA Project (Cr. 1581-CA) was
approved in FY85 to help Government design and implement a national economic
rehabilitation program in major sectors and the civil service and train nationals to
implement it. IDA provided support to the CAR adjustment program through three
structural adjustment credits from 1986 through 1994 (SAC I, Crs. A023-CA and 1732-
CA, approved in FY87; SAC II, Cr. 1916-CA, approved in FY88; and SAC III, Cr. 2162-
CA, approved in FY90). The Economic Management Project (Cr. 1971-CA), approved in
FY89, was designed to support implementation of the Government's adjustment program.
Project Objectives
2.    The principal objective of the Economic Management Project (EMP) was to
strengthen the core ministries responsible for managing the country's economy and for
implementing the structural adjustment program.  Objectives were also to upgrade
technical skills of local staff, inter alia, through promotion of on-the-job training. (Paras
1-3)
Implementation Experience and Results
3.   Institutional objectives were partially met. Five technical advisors were recruited
to work with teams of nationals. However, only two teams worked in a coherent manner:
the team trained in diamond evaluation and the one in administrative reform. Only the
team which appraises diamonds is likely to be sustainable, since Government pays the
team bonuses to keep them from leaving. In all components, about 1,300 people benefited
from short-term training which should reinforce performance in their current jobs or
contribute to capacity elsewhere in the Administration (Paras 10, 21-22)
4.    The project was implemented during a period of difficult political transition,
which continues to the present. Factors not subject to Government control which affected
implementation included political instability and civil disturbance, co-financiers'
performance and Bank performance. The life of the project was punctuated by prolonged
i



civil servant strikes and violence. UNDP was to provide funds to recruit a technical
assistance coordinator, but this never materialized. which partially affected achievement
of objectives.  France provided advisors in Treasury, Budget, Customs and Fiscal
departments who were essentially substitution TA and when they left, no replacements
were recruited. The Bank sent the wrong message to Government by extending the EMP
credit closing date twice when it was clear that objectives were not being met and
Government was not making serious efforts to carry out reforms. (Paras 14-15)
5.    Factors subject to Government control included Government commitment,
macreconomic policies and conditions, appointment of key staff, provision of counterpart
funds and administrative procedures. Lack of political will was the key reason that the
reforms envisaged in the SAC III program were not implemented under the EMP.
Macroeconomic policies contained in the civil service statute, public enterprise
rehabilitation program and Budget law were agreed but never implemented. Lack of
payment of counterpart funds was a continuous challenge throughout project duration.
And slow and cumbersome administrative procedures often delayed more than a year
recruitment of consultants and procurement of goods. (Paras 1 6-19)
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
6.    Both the political situation and the credibility of the State had deteriorated
progressively by the early 1990s. For more than two years, implementation of the
program supported by the SAC III and financed by the EMP was no longer a serious
concern for the Government. Even in the upbeat conditions that prevailed in 1994, after
the devaluation of the CFAF franc and the improved economic prospects of CAR,
notably the increase in world prices of its major exports, cotton and coffee, and the
increased revenue generated from livestock exports, Government did not carry out
promised actions in public enterprise privatization/liquidation, day-to-day management of
Treasury operations or the new law reforming the civil service. The situation has
deteriorated drastically and since 1996 was marked by three Army mutinies, accompanied
by civilian violence and looting. With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been
preferable to close the EMP credit earlier, by not extending the closing date twice. (Para
31)
7.    Bank Performance. Overall, the Bank's performance was uneven. Identification
correctly focused upon the need for the Administration to put in place procedures and
systems and staff trained to manage them. Preparation was deficient: the Bank had
recognized the Government's institutional weaknesses and problems encountered in TA
II, yet it helped Government to design a complicated operation which overburdened the
Administration's capacity. Bank performance in appraisal was also deficient. It does not
appear that lessons learned from TA II were translated into concrete appraisal steps to
avoid the pitfalls of previous TA. There is no record that discussions were held with all
the beneficiary departments, which could have signaled risks of weak capacity at those
levels and provided incentives for beneficiary participants to buy-into and sustain the
project. Supervision was mostly satisfactory. T'ask managers provided continuity, since
ii



Bank management did not: six division chiefs and six directors in six years. Despite poor
indicators, Bank management did not close the project and upon Government's request,
twice extended the credit closing date by 12 months each time. With the turnover in Bank
management, it appeared that no manager wanted to take responsibility to close a project
that was clearly not meeting objectives. (Paras 23-27)
8.    Borrower Performance. Overall Borrower performance was mostly deficient.
From project start-up, there was lack of ownership of the operation.  In addition,
incompetence of the project management team in the first two years of implementation
led to suspension of disbursements due to non-compliance with IDA procedures. From
end-1991 onwards, project management was very good, but lack of political will at the
highest levels stifled EMP progress. Turnover at the ministerial level--six ministers in six
years--and their political interference delayed or reversed operational decisions made in
all components, particularly in PE reform, Finance and Civil Service. (Paras 28-30)
9.    The Borrower did not prepare a plan for the project's future operation. Yet there
is still an unfinished reform agenda. Should the Bank design a future institutional
development operation, it should do so when there exists an environment conducive to
change, switching from "business as usual" to earnest capacity-building, with clear
political will on the side of the Borrower. Any future operation should be simple in
design and limited in focus to one or two key areas, such as budget management and
disengagement of the State from productive activities. (Para 32)
10.   Lessons Learned. When the Economic Management Project was prepared, it was
expected that a solution to the political situation was imminent.  Even under this
assumption, which did not materialize, project design was over-ambitious and unwieldy
for the weak CAR administration. Lessons learned for the Bank are to design the project
to fit both country realities and Borrower capacity. A third lesson is to ensure that project
objectives are consistent with instruments, since long-term institution-building objectives
cannot be matched to a short-term lending operation. A fourth lesson is that continuity in
Bank management is essential to ensure responsibility on the Bank side.  Bank
management turnover resulted in successive managers "passing the buck" to avoid taking
a decision to close the credit. (Paras 33-36)
11.   A fifth and most important lesson is for the Bank to adjust to realities. The CAR
institutional reality was staff turnover and lack of incentives for the national teams. The
CAR political reality was lack of Government commitment at the highest level to
implement the program supported by SAC III. When these realities became clear, Bank
management should have closed the Economic Management Project, or at the very least,
supported technical (task manager) recommendations to not extend the credit closing
date. Successive governments took advantage of the laxity in Bank management and,
with Bank complicity, disregarded project objectives and used EMP funds for studies in a
desperate attempt to put in place a medium-term economic program which ultimately
failed. (Para 37)

A.   STATEMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Credit Objectives
1.    The project's principal objective was to strengthen the core ministries responsible
for managing the country's economy and for implementing the structural adjustment
program. Objectives were also to upgrade technical skills of local staff, inter alia,
through promotion of on-the-job training. Through an integrated package of assistance
and training, the project aimed to put in place organizational structures in which tasks and
resource requirements were clearly specified, methods and procedures for carrying out
these tasks were developed, codified and applied, and in which functional linkages among
and within these institutions were delineated and understood.
Assessment of Objectives
2.    The project's principal objective was not met. It was wide in scope and over-
ambitious, given the social, poitical and institutional environment. Project design did not
fit: it was too complex for the weak administrative capacity of the Borrower, who was to
implement four main components in 7 beneficiary departments (MFPCI, CAADE,
MTAC/MTPAT, MEM, MCS, MCI, HCPE). This was foreseen, since the pre-appraisal
review meeting had expressed concern about the extent of sectoral disperson of the
project, as it could make the project unduly complex and difficult to manage. The same
point was made by the Senior Operations Advisor, prior to appraisal, who wondered
about the enthusiasm regarding successful implementation and impact of the Economic
Management Project (EMP), given the considerable problems encountered under the
Second TA project (TA II). He also queried how organization and information solutions
could overcome problems of leadership and management.
3.    Implementation of the EMP was characterized by a weak administrative
apparatus, lack of trained personnel, continuous turnover of demotivated staff--the same
problems encountered in TA II execution and the same risks acknowledged in the EPS in
FY88--plus lack of political will.
B.    ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
4.    The degree to which the project may be judged concerning achievement of
objectives is evaluated in the context of the socio-political situation and according to two
categories: (i) macroeconomic policies and (ii) institutional development.
Macroeconomic Policies
5.    The EMP had virtually no effect on implementation of the Second Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC II, Credit 1916-CA), which was approved by IDA on June 9,
1988. The second tranche of SAC II was released in February 1990, four months after
the EMP was declared effective.
l



6.    The EMP began operating amid a climate of optimism, in March 1990, after the
Party Congress (RDC, CAR's sole political party) had engendered hope of an imminent
opening up in the country's political arena. SAC III was approved by IDA in June 1990,
and its first tranche released two months later. In the absence of a clear position by
President Kolingba on the awaited economic and political measures, optimism gave way
to impatience. Protests erupted--sometimes violent--along with strikes, some of which
severely paralyzed day-to-day activities across the country during 1990-93.
7.    The country experienced a brief respite following election of President Patasse in
September 1993, the devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994, the agreement with
the IMF on a Stand-by arrangement in March 1994 and the release of the SAC III second
tranche in April 1994. However, after the Stand-by arrangement expired in March 1995,
the situation deteriorated markedly, and Government desperately began to design a
medium-term economic program to be supported by an IMF ESAF arrangement.
Discussions were interrupted by army mutinies in April and May 1996, followed by
widespread violence and massive looting. When another agreement was reached in
November 1996 with the IMF and the Bank on a PFP covering the period 1997-99, a
third mutiny erupted, and the reform agenda remains unfinished.
8.   In this setting, it is not surprising that the macroeconomic policy objectives of the
EMP were not achieved. OED rated the outcome of SAC III as highly unsatisfactory,
with sustainability unlikely and institutional development impact as negligible. OED
noted that "the majority of SAC III objectives were not met. GDP declined, the fiscal
situation worsened and human resource development came to a virtual standstill. The
time required to implement the reforms was underestimated, priorities were not clearly
set and the conditionality package focussed too much on action plans and not enough on
actions. The deterioration in the country's political situation, due to delays in an
anticipated transition to democracy, compounded the problem."
Institutional Development
9.    Despite the new approach to TA, which consisted of assigning experts to teams of
nationals to carry out a unit work program, institutional development was only partially
achieved. The EMP-financed actions to support SAC III included macroeconomic
management (with emphasis on resource mobilization, expenditure control, debt
management and investment planning), civil service and public enterprise reform,
financial management and promotion of private sector expansion. Capacity-building in
these areas was a key focus of the EMP, which was to lay the foundation for development
of sustainable and efficient institutions in charge of economic policy formulation and
management. Activities involved on-the-job training, study trips abroad (including a
program twinned with a public administration school in Canada and specialized diamond
training in Belgium) and in-country seminars, complemented by purchase of office
equipment and vehicles.
2



10.   Five technical advisors were recruited to work with teams of nationals, who were
mostly preoccupied with the socio-political situation, demotivated by arrears in salary
payments and not keen to work during civil servant strikes. Frequent turnover among
trained nationals was another problem. However, there were two notable cases of groups
which worked well as teams: the team trained in diamond evaluation and the one in
administrative reform. These results were likely due to the dynamic personalities of the
technical assistants, stability of the teams, technical competence of the team members and
the training perks offered in CAR and abroad.
11.   Statistics from BECDOR, the government office responsible for evaluation of
diamond and gold production, show an increase in diamond exports from 1990-92 to
1993-95: an increase in value of 50 percent and in volume of 20 percent between the two
periods. However, statistics on diamond taxes collected do not show a measurable
increase in revenue. Nevertheless, since the BECDOR technical assistant left CAR in
1992, transfer of skills was likely achieved, as the nationals have continued work on their
own. In the civil service ministry, a technical assistant trained ten nationals to prepare to
implement the new civil service statute, covering remuneration, recruitment, promotion,
training and career management. However, one cannot judge either his or the national
team's effectiveness, since lack of political will has prevented implementation of the
policy.  Apart from these teams, none is working in a coherent manner in other
departments which benefitted from the EMP. (See Tables 5 and 6 for TA inputs and
project accomplishments.)
12.    A 1993 evaluation of technical assistance provided under the EMP concluded
that the project suffered from lack of internalization by its beneficiaries. The evaluation
noted that the EMP was perceived as a source of funds for office materials rather than
reinforcement of institution-building in targetted ministries, which probably influenced
delivery of long-term TA and impact of TA on project implementation and performance.
C.  MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
13.   Affecting achievement of project objectives were: (a) factors not generally
subject to government control; and (b) factors generally subject to government control.
Factors Not Subject to Government Control
14.   Four important factors fall under this category:  political instability, civil
disturbances, performance of co-financiers and Bank performance. Political instability
and civil disturbances substantially affected implementation of the project. During the
life of the project, there were civil servant strikes punctuated with violence and looting,
due to non-payment of salary arrears, the bumpy transition to democracy and even since
the Presidential election, continued exclusion of those outside the President's circle from
decision-making and overt corruption. The country went through numerous cabinet
shuffles, a military dictator, a transitional legislative body and a democratically-elected
3



president during EMP execution. Government policies were implemented at an uneven
pace, often interrupted and delayed, particularly during 1990-93 and 1995-96. CAR has
not had a formal program with IDA since 1994, after release of the second tranche of
SAC III, or with the IMF since 1995, when the Stand-by arrangement expired.
15.   Regarding co-financiers, it was envisaged that UNDP would provide funds to
recruit a technical assistance coordinator but this never materialized, which partially
affected achievement of objectives. France provided parallel financing with advisors in
Treasury, Budget, Customs and Fiscal departments who were essentially substitution TA
and when they left, no replacements were recruited. Regarding Bank performance, IDA
sent the wrong message by extending the EMP credit closing date twice when it was clear
that project objectives were not being met and Government was not making a serious
effort to carry out reforms.
Factors Subject to Government Control
16.   Government commitment, macroeconomic policies and conditions, appointment
of key staff, provision of counterpart funds and administrative procedures were five
factors subject to Government control that affected achievement of objectives. Although
Government commitment appeared firm during project preparation, its lack of
commitment to execute the reform agenda substantially impeded attainment of the
project's goals. Macroeconomic policies contained in the civil service statute, public
enterprise rehabilitation program and successive Budget laws were agreed but never
implemented. The uneven performance of the economy during the early years of the
EMP partially affected project progress. However, Government did not take advantage of
the economic conditions that prevailed following the CFAF devaluation, i.e., the increase
in the world price of major exports, coffee and cotton, plus increased revenue from
livestock exports, to carry out overdue reforms.
17.   Regarding key staff, IDA suspended credit disbursements of the EMP for 3
months in 1991, due to poor project management and consistent non-compliance with
loan covenants, non-respect of IDA procurement and disbursement procedures and non-
payment of counterpart funds. In late-1991, a newly-appointed project director began to
improve project management, but was faced with turnover of five different ministers
responsible for EMP implementation during the past five years. Turnover of staff in
teams appointed to work with technical assistants was a continuous challenge; although
the issue was raised numerous times with Government, it was never corrected. Lack of
payment of counterpart funds toward operating costs was a persistent problem. At
Government request in 1993, IDA agreed exceptionally to increase from 50 to 100
percent IDA coverage of operating costs for 12 months, and in 1994 extended the
amendment through December 1995. Faced with a liquidity crisis in early 1996,
Government requested and IDA agreed to amend again the credit agreement, raising IDA
coverage of operating costs to 90 percent. Finally, slow and cumbersome administrative
procedures often produced extreme delays in consultant recruitment and procurement of
goods.
4



18.   All of the above factors contributed substantially to implementation delays in
project execution.  While the SAR estimated five years from signature to project
completion, actual supervision amounted to 7.25 years.
Other
19.   During the mid-term evaluation in 1991, the project scope was reduced, given
delays in execution and the coming on-stream of two complementary IDA credits. It was
agreed to drop two EMP components--strengthening the transport sector and promotion
of private sector activities--since the Transport Sector Project (TSP) and the Enterprise
Rehabilitation and Development Project (ERDP) began to provide assistance in FY90 and
FY91, respectively, in institution-building and training as envisaged under the EMP.
D.   PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
20.   Project sustainability is unlikely. In the current context of on-going civil strife,
political uncertainty and security risks, the policy environment for economic dialog and
activities is fragile. In terms of economic and financial management, a strong foundation
is missing. It could be set up only with political will and transparent decision-making at
the highest levels.  Effective, unambiguous leadership would ensure adherence to
existing-but-not-respected Treasury procedures, application of the civil service statute,
closure in PE privatizations and development of an in-service training policy. Only in
1994, after the CFAF devaluation, was CAR able to meet its revenue targets and control
its expenditure program. Borrower commitment at present cannot be gauged, since each
new government has professed to carry forward the unfinished reform agenda but does
not deliver.
21.   Moreover, as identified by civil servants in seminars highlighting problems in
seven departments, administration personnel lack incentive to work:  they are
demotivated by nepotism and ad-hoc recruitment, fraudulent work practices, lack of
sanctions and arrears in salary payments. Only the team which appraises diamonds is
likely to be sustainable. Government has an interest in collecting diamond tax revenue,
so it pays the team bonuses to keep them from leaving. Work program preparation by
beneficiary departments had developed into a useful monitoring tool. But this exercise
was discontinued when Government and IDA, in late-1995, agreed to finance priority
actions required to produce a medium-term economic program with little consultation
from the beneficiary departments. Given CAR's severe cash constraints, it is doubtful that
resources for maintenance of the office equipment will be allocated.
22.   But there are several elements of institution-building which might be sustained if
proper incentives are put in place: (a) PMU personnel trained in Bank procurement and
disbursement procedures should help their ministries implement future IDA operations,
when Bank assistance resumes. (b) Staff who received specialized training in diamond
appraisal and in administrative reform regulations and the nearly 100 who received
5



computer training should be able to contribute effectively to their work anywhere in the
administration. (c) About 1,300 people benefited from short-term training under the
EMP; even if transferred elsewhere in the administration, they should also be productive.
(d) National consultants and experts, recruited to carry out the Treasury audit and various
studies, provide facilitation and training and fill gaps in the administration have acquired
experience that should earn them future contracts and help develop the local consulting
profession.
E.  BANK PERFORMANCE
23.   Overall, the Bank's performance was uneven. According  to the SAR,
identification was carried out in November 1987, although no identification mission
report is in the files. Project identification per se was satisfactory, correctly focusing on
the need for the Administration to put in place procedures and systems and staff trained to
manage them. The approach to team TA with nationals to work as a group was
innovative in the late-1980s. Preparation was deficient. The Bank had recognized the
Government's institutional weaknesses and the problems encountered in TA II. And yet it
designed a complicated, multi-faceted operation which overburdened the capacity of the
Administration. In addition, there is no evidence that the Borrower was a real participant
in project preparation. In fact, a 1993 evaluation of project technical assistance noted that
the EMP was perceived as a 'Bank' project and not a CAR Government operation.
Preparation was driven by the pressure to put in place quickly a TA operation to support
the structural adjustment program. Had this not been the case, the Bank might have taken
the time required to prepare more thoroughly such a labor-intensive operation--which
usually requires 12-18 months--instead of only five months.
24.   Bank performance in appraisal was deficient. It does not appear that lessons
learned from TA II were translated into concrete appraisal steps to avoid the pitfalls of
previous TA. There is no record that discussions were held with all the beneficiary
departments, which could have signaled risks of weak capacity at those levels and
provided incentives for beneficiary participants to buy-into and sustain the project. On
the other hand, the appraisal team recognized and noted project risks, took into account
on-going and proposed donor contributions and prepared a matrix implementation plan
although the performance indicators were not quantifiable. But the Bank had only a
partial plan to offset project risks. For example, the SAR did not address the weak
motivation and mobility of staff. Given the Government's absorptive capacity, the credit
amount was too high and the implementation period was too short.
25.   Supervision, carried out by three task managers over seven years, was mostly
satisfactory. Task managers provided continuity, since Bank management did not, with a
turnover of six division chiefs and six directors. On average, two supervision missions of
two weeks each took place annually. Supervision staffweeks are high, because seven
beneficiary departments required labor-intensive supervision in specialities of diamonds
and mining, debt management, public finance, parastatal reform and civil service
management.
6



26.  In the early years, the Bank did not pay attention to the qualified SOE audits
submitted by project management and only 2-3 years later was the project accounting
system revamped and the auditors able to certify the early SOE accounts. The Bank was
sometimes slow in responding to the Borrower, with instances of 4-5 months' delay in
providing non-objections on consultant terms of reference and contracts. Supervision
missions collaborated well with co-financiers (France and UNDP), identified
implementation problems (counterpart funds, lack of progress in studies, project
management) and gave appropriate ratings, noted when legal covenants were not
enforced, showed flexibility and pragmatism in reducing EMP scope (dropping two
components covered by new IDA credits), and persisted in signaling management
attention to poor development impact and implementation progress indicators.
27.   Despite poor indicators, Bank management did not close the project and upon
Government's request to make up for lost time, twice extended the credit closing date by
12 months each time. The first extension was in the wake of the CFAF devaluation, when
the Bank was buoyed with optimism about economic prospects in CAR and the project
was rated Satisfactory. The second extension was granted despite an Unsatisfactory
rating. The third extension covered three months, to allow Government to prepare its
contribution to the ICR and to carry out audit of 1996 project accounts. With the
turnover in Bank management, it appeared that no manager wanted to take responsibility
to close a project that was clearly not meeting objectives.
F.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
28.   Overall Borrower performance was mostly deficient. Although the SAR stated
that Government commitment was firm during preparation, it was not demonstrated
during project implementation. From EMP start-up, there was lack of ownership of the
project. In addition, incompetence of the project management team for the first two years
of implementation led to a crisis of confidence between the PMU and the Bank and
between the PMU and the beneficiary departments. This situation deteriorated into a 3-
month suspension of disbursements due to non compliance with IDA procedures. From
end-1991 onwards, project management was very good.  However, PMU success
depended to a considerable extent upon senior authorities. And lack of political will at
the highest levels was the root cause of the dismal results of the adjustment program and
the EMP whose aim was to support SAC implementation. Turnover at the ministerial
level--six ministers in six years--and their political interference delayed or reversed
operational decisions made in all components, most notably in PE reform, Finance and
Civil Service.
29.   Added to obstacles faced by the project management team  was limited
institutional capacity elsewhere in the Administration, hampering Borrower performance
and resulting in: (a) delays in submission of audit/accounting reports; (b) extreme delays
in evaluating bids for consultant services and procurement of goods; (c) insufficient
7



payment of counterpart funds; (d) inordinate delays, sometimes over one year, in
commenting on studies to authorize final payment to consultants; and (e) TA recruited to
train teams of nationals attempting to do so in a context where work incentives for
nationals did not exist. During most of EMP's execution, Borrower performance was
adversely affected by political unrest and violence which continue to this day.
30.   Of the original studies identified in the SAR and actually completed, there was
very little follow-up by Government (see Table 7). One output, the mining plan, is a
valuable, scientific document which is available to promote investment in the mining
sector. Drafting of the privatization law, not originally envisaged in the SAR, was carried
out with Bank Legal Department technical assistance.
G.   ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
31.   The assessment of the project's outcome is unsatisfactory. Both the political
situation and the credibility of the State had deteriorated progressively by the early- I 990s
and has continued to this day. In such a context, successful implementation of the EMP
was virtually impossible. Strengthening of the core ministries responsible for managing
the country's economy was negligible. On-the-job training took place and some technical
skills were upgraded. But there were no performance indicators by which to judge skills
transfer so one cannot judge impartially the outcome of this objective. With the benefit of
hindsight, it would have been preferable to close the EMP credit earlier, by not extending
the closing date two times.
H.   FUTURE OPERATIONS
32.   The Borrower did not prepare a plan for the project's future operation. There is
still an unfinished reform agenda.  Should the Bank design a future institutional
development operation, it should do so when there exists an environment conducive to
change, switching from "business as usual" to earnest capacity-building, with clear
political will on the side of the Borrower. Any future operation should be simple in
design and limited in focus to one or two key areas, such as budget management and
disengagement of the State from productive activities.
8



1.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
33.   When the Economic Management Project was prepared, it was expected that a
solution to the political situation would be imminent. Even under this assumption, which
did not materialize, project design was over-ambitious and unwieldly for the weak CAR
administration. A lesson learned for the Bank is to base design on country realities, not
upon hopes that the political situation would improve or that staff would have incentives
to work.
34.   The creation of the PMU added to the bureacracy of an already overburdened
Ministry of Plan, even though the PMU was set up precisely because the Administration
did not have capacity to handle complex project coordination and execution across
ministries. A second lesson for the Bank is to design the project to fit capacity of the
Borrower. Perhaps a PMU could be set up as an agency to serve several IDA operations.
Procurement and accounting functions could be contracted out to the private sector.
35.   A third lesson for the Bank is to ensure that project objectives are consistent with
instruments. Institution-building is a long-term endeavor, yet the lending instrument time
frames to implement SAC III and the EMP were short and medium-term, 18 months and
5 years, respectively.
36.   A fourth lesson for the Bank is that continuity is essential to ensure management
responsibility on the Bank side. Bank personnel changes resulted in successive managers
"4passing the buck" to avoid taking a decision to close the credit.
37.   A fifth and most important lesson learned is for the Bank to adjust to realities.
The CAR institutional reality was staff turnover and lack of incentives for the national
teams, which discouraged learning on their part and sustainable transfer of skills and
capacity-building by the TA. The CAR political reality was lack of Government
commitment at the highest level to implement the program supported by SAC Ill. When
these realities became clear, Bank management should have closed the Economic
Management Project, or at the very least, supported technical (task manager)
recommendations to not extend the credit closing date. The Bank did not adapt to
changing circumstances and by not taking firm action, undermined its credibility.
Successive governments took advantage of the laxity in Bank management and, with
Bank complicity, disregarded project objectives and used EMP funds for studies in a
desperate attempt to put in place a medium-term economic program which ultimately
failed.

APPENDIX A: Borrower Assessment of Economic Management Implementation
(Summary)
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EMP PROJECT
Context
1.    The Economic Management Project (EMP) experienced a succession of difficulties
throughout the entire period of its implementation.
2.    Over the period 1990-1993, as the country embarked on a difficult process of
democratization, the Government found itself in a state of virtual paralysis, economic
activity fell off substantially, and the public finances collapsed. This situation resulted in
the accumulation of large volumes of arrears in payments to both domestic and external
creditors.
3.   In 1994, in agreement with governments in the CFA franc zone, the Central African
Republic proceeded to devalue its currency by 50 percent, and gave a commitment to take
certain measures to overcome the serious economic and financial difficulties inherited from
the past. It reopened its dialogue with the IMF and the World Bank, and adopted an
adjustment program supported by a standby arrangement approved by the IMF during
consultations in March 1994.
4.    This program focused principally on the public finances, and was designed to
eliminate the primary deficit through rehabilitation of the tax administration and expansion
of the tax base, in addition to measures designed to keep the wage bill at its 1993 level.
5.    UJnfortunately, a number of slippages occurred during implementation of this
program, preventing the Government from bringing it to completion.
6.    It was during this time that the EMP was suspended for the second time for failure
to make its repayments to the World Bank Group.
7.   In 1995, the Government unsuccessfully attempted to reopen negotiations with the
IMF and the World Bank, and the country had no assistance from the international
community.
8.   In 1996, the country experienced a period of crisis, marked by a series of revolts in
April, May, and November, which jeopardized continuation of the EMP and resulted in the
closure of IDA Credit 1971-CA.
9.    Thus the outcomes of this project should be seen as reflecting the political and
economic context within which it was implemented.
21



FINANCIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EMP
10.   The sociopolitical context within which this project was executed had very
unfavorable repercussions on its financial implementation, and to a large extent explains the
results obtained.
11.   As of completion of the EMP, a total expenditure of FCFA 4,227,572,078 had been
incurred, representing a consumption rate of 76.98 percent. This leaves an available
balance of FCFA 1,264,127,902, which it is proposed to cancel.
EX-POST EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT
Medium- and long-term objectives
12.   The results obtained by the Government in terms of achievement of the project's
medium- and long-term objectives are inadequate, except where the Ministry of Mining and
the Ministry of Civil Service are concemed.
13.   The EMP program has had a major impact on the mining sector, and a less
significant but still substantial impact on civil service reform. Its effects on the Ministry of
Finance and Planning are negligible, however.
Government performance
14.   The weaknesses of the Government's performance took the form of  poor
management resulting from bending of the World Bank's rules and procedures, as reported
by the February 1991 supervision mission, the difficulties of releasing the local counterpart
contribution, the incomplete or inaccurate identification of areas to be submitted for EMP
financing, shortfalls in the estimated budgets for the work programs relative to certain
components, partial or total disregard of the findings of the consultant's reports that were
intended to guide the Government's actions, delays in certification of services performed or
works carried out causing needless extensions of contract deadlines, and disruption of
certain of the project activities caused by civil servant mobility and transfers.
World Bank performance
15.   Within the framework of this project the World Bank made every effort to enable
the Government to successfully complete the relevant programs through the activities of its
resident mission, which served as liaison between the EMP and Bank headquarters, through
its supervision missions, which provided the Bank with reports on progress made, helped to
solve difficulties encountered and steer the project activities, and offered recommendations
for the enhancement of project performance, and through the reorganization of the EMP's
administrative and accounting management by Fiduciare Audit Afrique (FAA) in 1992
following the February 1991 supervision mission.
22



16.   On the other hand, while the World Bank was able to identify the needs submitted
for EMP financing, it was not able to cope with the consequences of the Government's
limited absorption capacity, the weakness of its administrative apparatus, and the low
productivity of its human resources.
17.   Furthermore, the World Bank often takes a very long time to respond to notices of
procurement submitted to it for approval.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendationsto the Government
18.   With a view to ensuring better performance in the future, it is essential that the
Government make every possible effort to improve the country's absorption capacity, with a
view to withdrawing all of the funds placed at its disposal under a World Bank project, and
that it honor its own financial commitments, make provision for recurrent costs upon
project completion, and create an interministerial and muldisciplinary unit responsible for
systematically taking action on consultants' reports and studies, so that their findings can be
used to enable the Government to properly steer its activities or make choices, define
performance criteria, and assign to the project or project component managers the task of
producing reports and the obligation to ensure results.
Recommendations to the World Bank
19.  It is clear that ignorance of procedures and of Bank rules was at the root of the
problems encountered during implementation of the EMP.  Consequently, it is
recommended that the Bank organize seminars for project managers in order that they may
become completely familiar with those procedures and rules and able to explain them to
others.
CONCLUSIONS
20.   Despite the extension of IDA Credit 1971 -CA, the Government was unsuccessful in
implementing all of the programs linked to the reforms that were to result from the EMP.
Most of the objectives set were not achieved. The economic reforms did not contribute to
the establishment of a short-term forecasting tool that would allow the Government to
obtain an overview of the entire Central African economy. Nor did they contribute to any
improvement where the public finances are concerned.
21.   However, certain of the EMP components did successfully implement their
programs and obtained results enabling them to achieve their assigned objectives. One of
these was the mining component, which succeeded in completing its program to improve
23



the capabilities of BECDOR and implement the mining plan, of which the
recommendations will guide the Government's actions in promoting the mining sector and
making it more attractive to both domestic and international investment. The same applies
to the civil service component, which enabled the Govemment to complete its reform
program, even though this did not bring about any substantial improvement in public sector
productivity or a reduction in the wage bill, despite retrenchment of the civil service staffs.
22.   The EMP is an essential project that should enable the Government to implement
reforms designed to strengthen the capacities of the institutions responsible for economic
management, improve public sector productivity, and create conditions conducive to
development of the private sector, an essential factor in ensuring that the overall demands of
economic and social development are adequately met. Unfortunately, the events that have
shaken the country, as well as the poor productivity of the Central African Government,
have affected the project outcomes. This situation is proof that a country's stability, and the
determination and expertise of its senior civil servants, are determining factors in ensuring a
project's success.
