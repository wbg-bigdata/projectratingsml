REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR AND BANK STRATEGY
A. Introduction
1. 1         The Government of Kazakstan has requested World Bank assistance to finance a project
in support of irrigation and drainage rehabilitation and improvement. The proposed project would
rehabilitate irrigation and drainage infrastructure covering some 30,000 ha. of on-farm irrigation as well
as limited inter-farm works, promote development of privatized farms through pilot initiatives for farmer
training and information, and strengthen the environmental capacity of concerned ministries and agencies.
The proposed project is the fourth bank-financed investment project in Kazakstan and the first in
agriculture.
B. Sector Overview
1.2          Agriculture is a major contributor to Kazakstan's economy. It accounts for about one-
quarter of GDP and around 23 percent of total employment. Livestock contributes between 50 to 60
percent of total output with beef, mutton, dairy products and wool being the major livestock products.
The crop sector is dominated by grain, mostly wheat, which accounts for about 65 percent of total crop
output. Other important crops are fodder crops, potatoes, and vegetables. Agriculture continues to be
a major source of export earnings with agricultural products constituting about ten percent. Major
exports include grain, meat, and wool.
1.3          About 200 M ha, or 75 percent of Kazakstan's total land area, is used for cropping and
grazing, with most agricultural land-devoted to extensive livestock grazing. Kazakstan can be divided
into three distinct geographical areas: the South, where most irrigated agriculture takes place; the North
where most rain-fed crop and livestock production occurs; and the expansive central region, which is
suitable mainly for extensive grazing. Cropped land covers about 35 million ha, of which nearly 33
million ha is rain-fed and about 2.4 million ha is irrigated. Cereals cover about 62 percent of total
cropped area with forage and vegetable crops accounting for most of the rest.
1.4          Kazakstan has a typical continental climate with cold, dry winters and hot dry summers.
Annual precipitation in the agricultural lands varies from less than 150 mm in the extreme Southwest to
nearly 450 mm in the foothills of the Southern mountains. Kazakstan is primarily located on steppes and
much of the Southern part of the country is desert. Soils are moderately fertile. Soils in the desert area
have a high natural salt content and tend to be alkaline, making them vulnerable to surface salinity under
conditions of poor irrigation and drainage. About 26 percent of the land is vulnerable to erosion,
primarily by wind.
1.5          Most production takes place on the recently privatized successors to state and collective
farms. State farms, which numbered about 2,100 before privatization, were particularly large, averaging
80,000 ha in 1992 of which just over 13,000 ha were cultivated. Nearly a third of these farms are
located in the North and produce rain-fed grain. Another 600 farms are engaged in extensive sheep
raising and 380 are intensive dairy and beef operations.



1.6          Collective farms or their successors number about 430 and are smaller than state farms
with average cultivated area of about 9,800 ha. Collectives tend to be more diversified in production than
the former state farms but traditionally in terms of management there has been little difference between
the two. As in other parts of the FSU, private plots on state farms and near urban centers are playing
a growing role in total output particularly for meat, milk, vegetables and fruit.
1.7          Performance in agriculture since independence has been poor. Output in the sector fell
by about 13 percent in 1994, following a 12 percent decline in 1993 and an average 5.3 percent decline
per annum between 1990 and 1993.  Last year saw another poor harvest with grain production
particularly hard hit. Declining yields are primarily the cause of lower output though area cropped has
also declined. Yields have been adversely affected by sharp declines in input usage. Fertilizer utilization
has dropped by two-thirds since 1992, fuel shortages have disrupted planting and harvesting activities,
and worn-out farm machinery has not been replaced.
1.8          The financial position of most farms has deteriorated markedly in the past three years,
with a sharp increase in the number of farms reporting losses. The losses have been due largely to
official pricing and marketing policy that depressed producer prices well below world market levels while
the prices of inputs were liberalized. The resulting cost price squeeze served to tax the sector by an
estimated US$323 to US$756 million in 1993.
C. Agricultural Policy Reforms
1.9          The Government has accelerated its reform program in agriculture over the last two years
in an effort to stem the crisis in the sector and restore growth in output and improve productivity and
rural incomes. The focus of the reform program in agriculture is on three key areas: (i) price and
government trade policy; (ii) marketing reform; and (iii) farm privatization and restructuring. Price and
trade reform is aimed at ending the cost-price squeeze facing agriculture through measures to allow farm
prices to rise to world market levels. The measures include an end to compulsory delivery of agricultural
commodities to the Government at fixed and low prices relative to world market prices and trade reforms
aimed at ending restrictions on agricultural exports. Government procurement of commodities has
decreased from over 20 million tons per annum as recently as 1992 to less than 800,000 tons for 1995,
and new rules for public procurement have been implemented to make it voluntary with competitively
determined prices.
1.10         Market reforms are aimed at privatizing the state enterprises that were formerly
responsible for all aspects of marketing and processing of agriculture commodities and encouraging the
entrance of new trading, input supply and processing firms into the sector. Privatization of the state
agricultural enterprises is nearly complete in a process that has transferred ownership to the suppliers of
the enterprises and the workers. New entrants to the sector are being encouraged by the gradual
development of a legal, and regulatory environment conducive to commerce. Already much of the old
structure for marketing and processing of livestock products, and fruits and vegetables has been bypassed
by private sector marketing channels. Less progress has been made in the development of alternative
channels for grain trade though even there private traders and exporters are offering increasing
competition to former state-owned firms.
1.11         Farm privatization also has moved quickly (Annex A). Farm privatization in Kazakstan
began seriously in 1991, with the advent of legislation defining objectives and methods. Subsequent
legislation has further refined the process and the timetable including passage of the end of 1995 of a new



land code and supporting legislation on land registration. By the end of 1995 over 80 percent of former
state farms had gone through the privatization process and the remainder are slated to be privatized early
in 1996. Privatization in Kazakstan refers to land management, and does not result in private land
ownership. Rather, the State retains ownership of all land and confers inheritable use rights to the
workers, the managers, and sometimes to other non-agricultural people in the farming community. These
lease rights can be sold, sub-let, bequeathed, or otherwise transferred.  On the farm  level, the
privatization process involves three steps. First the farms' land and non-land assets are evaluated and
entitlement to land leases and shares of non-land assets are distributed to eligible farm members. Second,
a period of formal and informal consultations are held with the farming community on the options and
process of privatization. Finally, a general assembly meeting of the farming community is held during
which the farm members decide on the post-privatization structure of the farm and the conditions of
membership/ownership, and elect the manager.
1.12          The initial decisions on the ownership and management structures have in most instances
been to adopt a cooperative ownership structure with management arrangements and operating procedures
similar to the former state model. This initial lack of restructuring can be traced to the harsh economic
environment within which the process is unfolding coupled with weaknesses in implementing the
privatization program. Information on alternative farm structures is often not available or inadequately
explained, and farm members are unclear about the procedures if they chose to opt out of the cooperative
and establish their own operation. Despite these weaknesses, there are growing indications that the first
decisions on how a farm will be structured are not final. Some farms have changed ownership structures
and managerial arrangements, often more than once. These changes are usually made to accommodate
the desire of some members to break away from the larger group and establish their own enterprises.
In such cases the management arrangements become more complex, incorporating a growing number of
units, either individual family farms, group farms, cooperatives, or other smaller units. This process is
expected to accelerate as the sector becomes more commercially oriented and experience is gained with
privatization procedures, and the cost-price squeeze is eased with the completion of price and trade
reform.
D. Sector Strategy and Bank Support
1.13          The Bank's strategy to assist the Government of Kazakstan is founded on four key pillars
including support for: (i) macroeconomic stabilization and price reform; (ii) transformation of the
economy to a competitive, market based system through privatization of state enterprises and encouraging
competition from new market participants; (iii) strengthened capacity for social protection; and (iv)
rehabilitation and improved management capacity for public infrastructure. For agriculture, the Bank's
approach rests firmly on these pillars. The Agricultural Sector Report of September 1994 identified low
output prices relative to world market prices as a fundamental factor affecting performance and
profitability in agriculture and suggested a number of reforms in pricing, government procurement of
agriculture commodities, and in trade policy designed to bring agricultural prices in line with world
market levels. These reforms were incorporated into the Development Policy Letter agreed in the context
of the FY95 Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL - Ln No. 3900).
1.14          The Sector Review also identified farm privatization and restructuring as important
elements of the reform program and the SAL includes conditionality on appropriate land legislation in
support of the development of land markets. Also, a proposed Land Registration Project (FY97) is
intended to strengthen the system  for registering rights to land and real property.  A proposed
Agricultural Privatization Support Project (FY98S) is intended to provide post-privatization support to



- 4 -
emerging private farms. The proposed IDIP project would complement these initiatives and provide
support for the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure on irrigated farms that have been
privatized and are undergoing restructuring.
E. Bank Lending Experience
1.15          The Bank only has recently begun to lend for agricultural projects in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia and has limited project experience with countries in transition. The experience with
irrigation projects in these countries is limited to two irrigation rehabilitation projects, one in Albania and
one in Armenia. Common issues that have arisen for agricultural projects in general and these two
irrigation projects are:
*      the need for a stable macroeconomic environment and a favorable incentive
structure for the sector;
*      the importance of local ownership of project design and commitment to its
implementation;
*      the necessity of introducing rigorous economic and environmental criteria in the
design of programs and projects;
*      the importance of an adequate farm privatization program in conjunction with
initiatives to rehabilitate farm infrastructure, including irrigation facilities;
*      the need to transfer responsibilities and at least some of the operation costs and
maintenance to water users; and
*      the necessity  for strong oversight and implementation  capacity by the
implementing agency to assure that construction of irrigation work adhere to
international standards of quality.
1.16          These issues have been shared with Government and every effort has been made in project
preparation to address them in the design of the project. Implementation of the project will benefit from
the fact that Kazakstan has been one of the most successful and persistent countries in Central Asia in
pursing macro-economic and marketing and pricing reforms. It currently is implementing an aggressive
reform program with support of the SAL and an a IMF program that is intended to accelerate progress
with stabilization and remove remaining price and trade distortions affecting the sector. The importance
of beneficiary participation is being emphasized through a careful consultation process during project
preparation and implementation. Strict economic and environmental criteria were utilized to screen
potential projects in an exhaustive process to cull projects with unsatisfactory economic rates of return
or with potentially detrimental environmental impacts. Project design also has focused on improving cost
recovery for inter-farm systems and quality of construction.
1.17          More generally, OED's 1994 Review of World Bank Experience in Irrigation provides
evidence on performance and recurrent issues in some 200 Bank-financed irrigation projects. Although
67 percent of the projects were rated satisfactory (84 percent when weighted by size of area served),
operational performance has in general been poorer than anticipated at appraisal. It was found that
projects with relatively low unit costs per hectare tended to be more successful (project cost averaged



US$4,800 ha)-'. The proposed project is in line with the report's major reconimendation that the Bank
should shift emphasis from financing new irrigation to upgrading existing irrigation. Critical factors
identified for project success include: quality of system design; quality of construction works; adequacy
of O&M, and; the need to foster the conditions associated with the formation of durable irrigator groups.
The review also indicated that O&M tends to be best in irrigation agencies that are financially
autonomous; the District Water Committees in Kazakstan are now  self-supporting.  It was also
recommended that O&M entities should receive their funding directly from the irrigators where feasible;
also this is the case in Kazakstan.
1/     For the proposed project, average per ha investment cost is about US$2,250.

II. THE WATER SECTOR AND IRRIGATION SUB-SECTOR
A. Water Resources
2.1            Water resources are limited. Annually recurring surface water resources total about 100
km3 (billion cubic meters), of which about 44 km3 originate in other countries. It is estimated that about
43 km3 are available for irrigation development. Less than 0.1 percent of the total land area is under
irrigation at present, with limited water supply for expansion.  Potential annual yield of usable
groundwater is estimated at 15 km', mostly in the Southeast, of which some 2.5 km3 has been developed.
Groundwater supplies at present are used for irrigation of about 85,000 ha.
2.2            Many rivers, especially the larger ones, have been provided long-term  and seasonal
regulation by reservoirs and storage ponds. Kazakstan now has 204 reservoirs, with a total capacity of
95.5 km3. The largest reservoirs are found in the basins of the Aral Sea, Lake Balkash, and the Irtysh
River. The salinity of reservoirs varies from 0.12 g/L in East Kazakstan to about 2.1-2.7 in the central
part of the country, with most reservoirs around I g/L.
B. Irrigation and Drainage Development
2.3            "Regular"Z' irrigation is practiced on 2.4 million ha (1990), of which 95.6 percent is by
surface water, 3.6 percent by groundwater, and 0.8 percent by sewage water. Surface irrigation is used
in 70 percent of the area, sprinkler in the remainder In addition, there are 878,500 ha of flood irrigated
lands. Drainage facilities have been provided for 623,000 ha (26 percent) of the regular irrigated lands.
Seventy percent of the irrigated area is in the five Southern oblasts. It is estimated that only about 70
percent of the land irrigated in 1990, or 1.7 million ha, is actually being irrigated in 1994. Almost
680,000 ha (30 percent) of the lands are out of use because of soil salinization, water logging, broken
or incomplete distribution systems, improper farming practices, limited inputs such as fertilizers and fuel,
and, in some instances, lack of water.
2.4            Major crops under irrigation in descending order of planted area are fodder crops (about
half the area) mainly alfalfa, winter wheat, maize (grain and silage), cotton, rice, sugar beets,
vegetables/onions/fruits, oil crops, potato and tobacco. Fodder crops are required for winter feeding of
the large livestock population and grown in many areas where salinity and poor drainage prevent other
crops from being grown. Total sown area, especially for fodder crops, is decreasing and crop yields have
declined from 15 percent to 40 percent in the last five years, primarily due to economic disruption.
2.5            Major inter-farm facilities include about 14,000 km of channels. Major problems in the
inter-farm systems include low operation efficiencies due to seepage in unlined canals, resulting in water
losses and waterlogging of adjacent lands. Maintenance is deficient and declining due to staff cuts and
shortage of funds. Water scheduling is quite rigid, in some cases leading to over irrigation and a rise
in the water-table. Privatization may present cost and operational problems in delivering water to the
smaller farm units.
2.6            The majority of irrigated lands in the five Southern oblasts, almost 90 percent, are
irrigated with surface methods, usually furrow and borders. About 75 percent of the irrigated land in
2/     'Regular' irrigation means irrigation by some specific technical, constructed method, such as border or sprinkler, at planned intervals.



- 7 -
the other oblasts is irrigated by large-scale sprinkler systems. Overall, about 1.65 million ha are irrigated
by surface and 0.68 million by sprinkler. Drip systems are rare and used mainly on an experimental
basis. The major on-farm problem is the lack of funds for maintenance and rehabilitation of facilities,
affecting yields and area irrigated.
2.7           Drainage systems have been constructed on only about 624,000 ha, or 26 percent of the
irrigated land. About 60 percent is by open ditch, 32 percent by vertical wells, and 7.8 percent by buried
horizontal pipe. There has been little development of new drainage and, little maintenance done since
about 1990. Still only 3.6 percent (86,000 ha) of the irrigated land has a water table less than 1.5 m
below the surface, and only 2.2 percent of the irrigated land (52,000 ha) is classed as highly saline.
However, and additional 170,000 ha (7.1 percent) are classed as mildly saline and that percentage will
undoubtedly increase (as will the percentage of highly saline land) if drainage systems are not improved.
Although new lands are not being developed for irrigation, new drainage works are also required for
irrigated lands that have not been previously drained.
2.8           Much of the agricultural drainage system  is not functioning properly because of
deficiencies in design, construction and maintenance. A significant problem also exists with disposal
of highly mineralized water. A strict policy of limiting or excluding disposal of drainage outflows in the
main river systems leads to a severe depletion of flows in some rivers. Several of the major drainage
systems have outlets into lakes or evaporation ponds whose capacity is exceeded by the drainage inflows.
2.9           Irrigated agriculture in Kazakstan is extensive in terms of the large fields that are
irrigated, the crop technologies applied and the type of farm machinery used. With energy now being
more realistically priced, such an extensive system that requires long and inefficient water delivery and
tractor hauls cannot survive competition from the world market and therefore has to change. To save
energy, different on-farm operations need to be combined, requiring different types of machinery and
equipment. Besides the fact that lands have been taken out of use, and the productivity is declining, the
most pressing problem in irrigated agriculture is the environmental consequence of poor water
management and excessive water use from surface water resources, which in the Syr Darya Basin has
contributed to the drying of the Aral Sea. On the other hand, re-use of (good) drainage water is seldom
practiced.
C. Institutional and Legal Framework3'
2.10          Organization of the Sector.  Several ministries, agencies, and organizations are
responsible for managing and administering the water resources and environmental policies effecting the
water and irrigation sectors in the Republic of Kazakstan. Since 1991, a number of organizational and
structural changes have taken place. The Ministry of Reclamation and Water Management was eliminated
in 1991 and replaced by the Committee on Water Resources. The Ministry of Ecology and Biological
Resources (MOEB) was established in 1992 as the successor to the State Committee on Ecology and
Nature Use and the Ministry of Forestry. Other changes may be expected in response to changing
demands on the Government. The major institutions of the Government of Kazakstan concerned with
the irrigation sector include:
3/     For details, see Annex B, "Overview of Institutional Framework'; Annex R, "MOA Organization'; and Annex T, "MOEB
Organization".



- 8 -
*      the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) which is responsible for the development of
agricultural production. The monitoring of drainage, water logging, and soil
salinity conditions for the major irrigation projects in the five Southern Oblasts
is the responsibility of Hydrologic Amelioration Expeditions under the Minister
of Agriculture.
*      The Ministry of Geology and Protection of Underground Resources (MOG), the
key state authority in the field of geological prospecting and protection of the
underground resources.
*     Committee for Water Resources (CWR) which is responsible for maintaining and
operating the existing interfarm system for delivery of irrigation and rural
drinking water through regional and district water resource committees;
supervising eight river basin water management agencies; setting national policies
with respect to water quality and administering international river systems with
respect to water sharing.
*      Water Management Design Institutes. There are a number of design institutes
in Kazakstan with experience in the planning and design of irrigation and
drainage projects including Kazgiprovodkhoz, the former central water
management design institute. Most of the regional institutes have now been
placed under the administrative control of the Ministry of Agriculture.
*     Construction Organizations. There are general construction organizations known
as industrial unities (ICU) in each of the oblasts. Each region has also facilities
for producing prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and metal works.
*      The Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources (MOEB), which is a
planning, management, and monitoring agency mandated to promote the
protection and rational use of natural resources including land resources, soil,
water, forests, wildlife and fisheries.
*     Hydrometeorological Service (Hydromet), the principal authority in the field of
hydrometeorology and pollution monitoring.
*      The Ministry of Construction, Architecture and Housing, responsible for
enforcing construction norms and standards.
*     The Ministry of Health (MOH). The State Sanitary-Epidemiological Service
(SanEpid) under the MOH has the responsibility for determining, preventing and
mitigating the negative impacts of environmental pollution on human health.
*     The State Committee on Land Relations and Organization of Land Use (SCLR)
is entrusted with developing and implementing unified state policy on land
management and ensuring land reform.



- 9 -
*      The Committee on Forestry (CF) is responsible for forest planning, development
and management.
*      The Ministry of Economy is responsible for preparing, approving, and
recommending technical projects for government funding.
2.11          Legal Framework. There are a number of environmental codes, common laws, decrees
and regulations. Some of these are relevant to environmental, water and agricultural sectors, including:
(i) the Law "On Environmental Protection" (June 1991), which establishes state ownership of the natural
resources, including, land, water, minerals, forests and wildlife; (ii) the "Water Code" (March 1993) for
the purpose of regulating water for domestic, industrial and agricultural use and to ensure meeting
environmental requirements; (iii) for a decree "On Land" (December 1995) which elaborates on land
ownership and classifies lands depending on the purpose of their use; (iv) the Law "On Land Reform in
Kazakstan" (June 1991) which states the objectives and conditions for land reform and its major
directions; and (v) the "Forestry Code" (January 1993), which clearly states that forests are the exclusive
property of the Republic, but provides for the different forms of forest ownership and establishes different
forest categories and liabilities for violation of the code and introduces economic instruments. Many of
these laws are now being amended and enforcement has been lacking, especially of the environmental
legislation and regulations.
D. Water Resources Planning and Management
2. 12         Management. Under the CWR there are nineteen regional committees in each of the
oblasts. Under the regional committees there are 96 district water resources committees. Regional level
activities and regional staff still receive their funds from the central government. All of the district level
operations are now self-supporting. In theory the concept is quite good. However, the process has been
introduced too suddenly and in practice funds at the district level are quite limited because of inability
and/or unwillingness of water users to pay water charges.
2.13          There are eight river basin organizations (BVOs) covering all areas of the Republic with
responsibility for allocating water to enterprises and farms. Each farm has fixed and registered water use
limits. During water short periods, water is prorated according to prescribed crop water requirement
norms. Higher value cash crops usually have first priority during water short periods. Water delivery
and operational plans are prepared each year. Any new area brought under irrigation requires special
registration even if the new area will be irrigated from water savings on the farm.
2.14          Government is also interested in privatizing O&M of the inter-farm systems. MOA, with
the objective to halt the decline in system maintenance, has requested the Bank to assist with a feasibility
study on the establishment of a private irrigation company for a selected typical canal command; it is
intended that the company would be wholly owned by the water users (Para. 4.28).



- 10 -
E. On-Farn Water Management
2.15          On-farm system operation and maintenance is the responsibility of the farm. Previously
O&M funds were provided by the State. Because these funds are no longer available, maintenance of
on-farm facilities has been neglected. Externally, farm management represented the farm in negotiations
with the oblast administration regarding water allocations, investments and O&M, and paid service fees,
with or without negotiation. Internally, water management and O&M were generally organized on a
brigade level under the direction of the brigade's hydraulic technician, who worked in close collaboration
with other members of the brigade technical team.
2.16          A number of the farms that have been privatized have basically retained their original
management structure and are able to continue operations, including irrigation practices, according to
given rotation programs, using accumulated experience and expertise. Other privatized farms include a
number of small units (para. 3.5). Focus group discussions conducted as part of the project social
assessment, revealed a common pattern of relative isolation of the small units. Where restructuring has
involved the creation of small groups or small independent units, the members who leave the larger unit
are generally allocated land at the end of a watercourse, effectively marginalizing them from the large
unit, limiting their access to services and making them subject to decisions and actions taken upstream.
For such restructured farms, WUAs should be organized in order to provide an institutional bond between
all water users that transcends the remnants of the previous management structure and allows for
continuity in case of further restructuring. The consultant team working on project preparation is
developing pilot programs to create WUAs in some of the restructured farms to be included in the first
two years of the project in order to develop an appropriate WUA model for Kazakstan and to propose
an efficient, effective program to organize WUAs.
F. Financial Issues
2.17          Water pricing was introduced in 1992. The Government is required to deliver water and
end users are expected to pay. Because water is considered to be State property, water charges are for
services associated with water delivery and supply. Farms are assessed on the basis of scheduled
deliveries, with rates based on recovery of O&M costs. Farms are billed based on a volumetric
measurement of water used. The CWR sets prices for irrigation water. Setting and collection of water
charges for irrigation is done at the District level. Water for industrial use is usually controlled by City
Water Channel Authorities. Cost for drinking and industrial water use is determined at the Republic level.
Each industry has its own prices. All prices must be approved by the State Monopoly Committee.
2.18          In 1994 of the 17,500 mcm of water allocated for irrigation, 92 percent was used, but
only 47 percent (1,195 million tenge) of the water fees were collected. For drinking water only 29
percent (143 million tenge) of the fees were collected.
2.19          For FY 1995 the Committee on Water Resources was allocated 24 million tenge out of
the national budget of 175,400 million tenge ( 0.014 percent). Only 40 percent of this money was made
available. This budget is required to support Republic staff, oblast staff, BVO office staff, reservoir
operations and major river diversion structures. District level operations and interfarm systems are to
be covered by user fees.



- 11 -
2.20          There are few incentives to reduce water use at this time. However, if an enterprise/farm
exceeds its allocated water use, MOEB can fine the enterprise up to 5 times the cost of the amount water
used above the allocation.
2.21          The existence of a water charge system to recover O&M costs for the inter-farm system
will enhance the potential for recovery of the costs for rehabilitating the inter-farm systems.
Unfortunately, the current capacity for beneficiaries to pay for water is limited. As market conditions
normalize and farms begin to realize full market value for their crops, this situation should improve.
However, during the transition period, some sort of government support program may be required.
There is a proposal to use taxation to cover water service charges now pending with the government.
G. Environmental Sector Issues
2.22          Current environmental problems and degradation of natural resources in Kazakstan stem
mainly from past economic policies and practices in the former Soviet Union (FSU) that promoted
quantitative targets set for the economy of the whole country and its different sectors by central planning
authorities. These policies were accompanied by pricing policies under which natural resources were
undervalued and the environment as a whole was treated as a free good, both by productive sectors and
by consumers. In parallel, the lack of sound and realistic environmental policies, legislation, standards
and management systems capable of enforcing those regulations and standards, has led over the years to
over-use of natural resources and their degradation, as well as to pollution levels with increasingly
adverse effects for public health.
2.23          The underlying challenge facing Kazakstan in all aspects of environmentally sustainable
development is the need to strengthen substantially the environmental institutions, and the related legal
framework, so that they can undertake their mandated tasks. Environmental problems in the sector are
caused in general by the following: outdated water and land management policies and practices and lack
of integrated pest management (IPM); inadequate technical design, poor construction, operation and
maintenance (O&M) of irrigation and drainage systems; institutional deficiencies, including lack of
economic and environmental criteria in project selection and development; insufficient staff with
experience both in sectoral and environmental agencies; financial constraints preventing adequate O&M
of environmental monitoring systems and inadequate staffing to tackle sectoral environmental problems.
2.24          The following problems have been identified as posing constraints on environmentally
sustainable agricultural development in Kazakstan: (i) surface and underground water scarcity and uneven
seasonal and territorial distribution accompanied by increasing water losses in irrigated agriculture; (ii)
surface and underground water pollution by agriculture, including run-off due to past over-application
of agro-chemicals; (iii) soil fertility depletion due to poor agricultural practices; (iv) increasing wind and
water soil erosion due to reduction of afforestation efforts; (v) waterlogging and salinization of soils due
to poor design and construction, reduction in O&M and in some cases non-operation of irrigation and
drainage systems; (vi) inadequate enviromnental standards and policies, that are in some cases
incompatible with international norms, which in turn are not appropriately implemented, enforced or
monitored due to ineffective environmental management and monitoring systems; and (vii) lack of
capacity to develop and implement projects in an environmentally sustainable fashion.



- 12 -
H. Bank Environmental and Water Strategy in Kazakstan
2.25          A key element of the Bank's overall strategy for agriculture in Kazakstan seeks to address
environmental concerns, including public sector management capacity in environmental agencies. The
Bank's focus is on: (a) preventive measures to avoid adverse environmental impacts, through the use of
policy and regulatory measures, environrnental assessments (EAs), environmental planning and economic
instruments; and (b) curative measures to address existing problems of water and soil pollution in a cost
effective manner.
2.26          The macro-economic and policy reforms currently underway in the country are likely to
result in significant environmental benefits, particularly as inefficient and pollution intensive facilities are
closed or replaced with cleaner technologies, and price reform leads to more rational and efficient land,
water, and agro-chemical inputs use. These reform measures will need to be complemented by appropriate
environmental policies and priorities, and an effective environmental institutional and management
framework, including environmental standards, monitoring, and economic incentives systems. Once
appropriate norms and standards are established, adherence should be adequately enforced and monitored.
This will require functional streamlining of the respective environmental agencies and greater
transparency of their operation as well as increased public participation.
2.27          While Kazakstan has not yet developed a comprehensive water resources development
strategy and management plans, initial steps are being taken by Government within the context of the
Bank-supported Aral Sea Basin Program, which involves activities benefitting the Syr Darya basin in
Kazakstan, including inter alia, water resources management and environmental studies, improving
hydrometeorological services, data bases, information services, and water quality management; and
undertaking wetland restoration and capacity building; a preliminary development plan for the Syr Darya
basin in Kazakstan has recently been completed under Program 4.4.4' In addition, a number of pilot
projects are currently being proposed for implementation as part of Program 3.1 b-', with the objective
of testing solutions for water management and salinity problems. The proposed project is complementary
to the Aral Sea Program as it would provide an opportunity to identify and demonstrate the use of "good
practices" in irrigation and drainage, including water conservation and environmental management, which
could be applied elsewhere in the Aral Sea Basin. The project's environmental sub-component would also
complement specific assistance being provided to the MOEB under the Technical Assistance Loan, which
supports in particular the ministry's legislative, monitoring and enforcement capabilities.
2.28          Kazakstan has not yet developed a comprehensive forest sector development strategy and
management plans through initial steps have been undertaken in this direction through the adoption of a
new "Forestry Code" and supporting implementation regulations. The project's environmental mitigation
measures would include the planting of trees in shelter belts along project area boundaries to retard soil
loss and erosion, and improve environmental conditions in the project area.
2.29          The proposed project has been prepared in a manner consistent with the recommendations
under the Bank Water Resources Management Policy and the Forest Sector.  It will support:
(a) strengthening of sector and media institutions involved in environmental management; (b) developing
4/     Syr Darya Control and Delta Development Project
5/     Water Quality Management - Agricultural Water Quality.

EA capacities; (c) re-enforcing agro-meteorological, water and soil quality monitoring systems and data
management; (d) mitigation of existing waterlogging and salinity problems; (e) afforestation efforts to
slow soil and wind erosion and degradation of watersheds; and (f) increasing awareness of the role of
trees in retaining soil fertility and averting degradation.
I. Ten and Five Year Irrigation Investment Plans
2.30          In 1991, "An Integrated Program for the Development of Land Reclamation" (IPLR,
Kazgiprovodkhoz, 1991) was completed and approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The study identified
775,000 ha in 19 oblasts where technical irrigation and reclamation improvements were needed. A Ten-
Year Indicative Plan (Harza, Nippon Koei, Kazgiprovodkhoz) was prepared by reviewing and screening
the Projects identified in the IPLR. Factors considered in screening projects were economic merit;
political factors such as project distribution among oblasts; projects with an identified risk of immediate
failure; environmental impact; improved technology; status or potential for privatization; potential for
early implementation with emphasis on projects with potential for quick response; and availability of
feasibility studies and designs.
2.31          The Ten-Year Plan identified 58 main projects, with 141 irrigation and drainage
reconstruction sub-projects covering over 150,000 ha with an estimated cost of US$651 million.
Comprehensive reconstruction of irrigation and drainage was proposed on 74,600 ha.  Drainage
improvements were proposed on 95,500 ha, including 18,500 ha of new  drainage.  Irrigation
improvements were proposed on 62,100 ha. It was estimated that implementation of the Plan would result
in an increase in US$63 million in annual net farm income from crop production.
2.32          The projects in the Ten-Year Plan were further evaluated to select a set of projects for
possible implementation during the first five years. Feasibility studies were carried out on 34 sub-projects
covering 62,000 ha with an estimated cost of US$140 million. From this list of 34 sub-projects, 22 sub-
projects in 11 oblasts with a total area of 40,000 ha have been proposed for implementation under the
Kazakstan Irrigation and Drainage Improvement Project. The actual number of projects selected for
implementation during the first five years will be limited by the availability of international loan funds
and the availability of the government's budget to finance local costs. Since the Project has been
developed as a program, it will be possible to substitute sub-projects if necessary or add sub-projects as
additional funds become available.

III. THE PROJECT AREA
A. General
3.1            The sub-project areas are located throughout Kazakstan in eleven of the nineteen oblasts
and cover about 30,000 ha. Most of the work is concentrated in the five Southern oblasts of Almaty,
South Kazakstan, Taldy-Korgan, Kzyl Orda and Zhambyl.  (IBRD Map 27736).  A summary of
conditions in the project areas is presented in Annex D.
B. Agriculture
3.2            Irrigated farms were almost all large State or Collective farms with irrigation and farm
operation facilities scaled to large fields and operated by specialists. Compared with western large farms,
the production system is mostly outdated in terms of production technologies, type of farm machinery
and management principles. Except for grains, total planted area has declined since 1990, because of the
deterioration of irrigation and drainage facilities and the shortage of financing for farm production inputs
and new machinery (Table 3.1).

3.3           In terms of crop production, potatoes, vegetables and fodder crops are grown in all
oblasts with regular irrigation, of which Almaty, Taldy Korgan and Zhambyl are the main producers.
These three oblasts are also the main producers of sugarbeet. Cotton can only be grown in South-
Kazakstan, while maize is mainly grown in the four oblasts of Almaty, Taldy Korgan, Zhambyl and Kzyl-
Orda. Kzyl-Orda is also the main oblast for rice production and winter cereals. Since the bulk of cereals
is grown in the northern "Virgin Lands" under rainfed conditions, it is questionable whether wheat and
barley should be grown under irrigation in Kzyl-Orda as well. The problem, however, has been the
absence of a functional marketing and distribution system in the country, which encourage local



- 15 -
government authorities to try to achieve oblast self sufficiency in the production of major food
commnodities.
3.4            Yields of most crops in 1993 were 20 percent or more below their level in 1990. The low
yields are a consequence of economic disruption of agricultural production resulting in lack of spare parts
and (appropriate) machinery, lack of funds to purchase inputs, late payments by the State for past
purchases, reduced directed credit from the State with, no alternative sources of credit, distorted price
relationships between non subsidized production inputs and controlled prices received for crops and
livestock.

C. Privatization
3.5            As part of the social assessment conducted for this project (see Annex A), managers of
30 of the farms identified for participation in the project were interviewed regarding the privatization
status of the farms. Twenty-two of the farms had already been privatized by the end of June 1995, and
seven more were privatized by the end of the calendar year. One agricultural research farm, is scheduled
to remain under State control, and may therefore be excluded from the project. The current or proposed
new structures are as follows: eight joint stock companies; seven collective enterprises; six farmers
associations; three comrade associations; and four private enterprises. Nineteen of the 30 farms have



- 16 -
been restructured - split up into smaller units - to some degree. Most of those have a large unit and a
number of small units, individual family farms or small cooperative units; a few have been divided into
many small units, primarily in South Kazakstan. All of those that privatized in 1994 or before have
restructured somewhat; several of which seem to be undergoing an annual process of redefining both
land divisions and management structure. In sum, the situation is very fluid, for the most part tending
toward increased restructuring.
3.6           Farm restructuring might be expected to affect the project in at least two ways: it could
leave a management void that affects water management, and thus effective use of the investment; and/or
restructuring would require additional investment to modify the irrigation system to accommodate smaller
turnout areas. Although all of the farms still maintain an umbrella management entity that could continue
to be responsible for operation and maintenance of the on-farm works, it is clear that small break-away
units are given low priority by farm management (para. 2.16). Water User Associations can fill this
management void. Restructuring is not expected to require additional on-farm investments, as the design
of existing systems appears to be flexible enough, and turnout areas are small enough to accommodate
restructuring.
D. Socio-Economic Status
3.7           The people on the farms proposed for the project include a broad cross-section of Kazak
rural people whose situation mirrors the general economic situation in the country. They are troubled
by the collapse of the economy, reflected in their failure to receive wages; they understand the dissolution
of old trading arrangements, which results in the lack of spare parts for machinery and other shortages;
and they suffer from the absence of markets in a nascent market economy. Farms that grow specialized
crops, such as onions or vegetables near urban centers are faring well because they already have
established private market ties that they can continue to develop. Grain farms are in a somewhat more
precarious situation since state domination of the grain trade has subsided more slowly which has retarded
the emergence of private marketing channels. However, 1995 may have marked a turn around in the
development of a multi-channel market system, as state involvement in marketing was dramatically
reduced and active private trade quickly began to emerge.  In either case, however, an important
challenge of privatization is for farms to balance the need to be financially viable with the need to protect
soil resources by adhering to the crop rotation system developed for each farm and religiously maintained
until the present.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Background
4.1           Substantial investments were made during the Soviet era in the irrigation and drainage
infrastructure, dramatically expanding irrigated area. These systems have deteriorated due in part to poor
design and construction, but also to inadequate maintenance and failure to complete required drainage
systems. This deterioration has increasingly led to water logging and salinity, and reduced yields. The
situation has been exacerbated by environmental problems, including inefficient water management, water
pollution and declining soil fertility. Current environmental standards and policies are inadequate and the
environmental management systems are not able to control the situation.
4.2           In 1991, an Integrated Program for the Development of Land Reclamation (IPLR) was
completed and approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The program identified 775,000 ha in 1,300
projects located in 19 oblasts where irrigation and drainage improvements were needed. In October 1992,
a Bank identification mission visited Kazakstan and the Government expressed interest in Bank financing
for this program. Project preparation was undertaken from January 1994 through June 1995 with support
of a Japanese PHRD Grant. Ten and Five Year Investment Plans were prepared. Project preparation was
continued in September 1995 under a "bridging operation" with financing from an advance of the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF).
B. Project Objectives and Rationale for Bank's Involvement
4.3           The rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage infrastructure and improving its
management, as well as enhancing the environment are key elements in the Bank's strategy to promote
sustainable irrigated agriculture (paras. 1.13 and 2.29). The project's main objectives would be to: (i)
promote sustainable irrigated agricultural production through irrigation and drainage rehabilitation,
improved water management, and better operation and maintenance; (ii) introduce improved agricultural
practices and farmers' information services; and (iii) strengthen irrigation and environmental agencies.
4.4           More specifically, the Bank's involvement in the project would: (i) include economic and
environmental selection criteria in long term irrigation investment planning; (ii) introduce higher technical
standards and new technologies/procedures in planning, design, construction (particularly quality control),
environmental protection and procurement; (iii) start, as a pilot program, farmers' participatory training
and farmers' information services to provide information on general farm management, improved
production packages, and better water management; (iv) support privatization by establishing eligibility
criteria for participating farms and improving the skill levels of recently established and prospective
independent farms; (v) strengthen MOA's project implementation capacity and strengthen MOA's,
MOEB's and other concerned agencies' environmental, technical and management capacity; (vi) expose
the local design institutes and the local construction industry to new technologies and better practices; (vii)
assist in the establishment of Water Users Associations (WUAs) for O&M within the newly privatized
farms; (viii) introduce farmers' participation in project design and implementation; and (ix) improve
O&M of the inter-farm systems through increased collection of water charges.
C. Project Selection Criteria
4.5           The criteria agreed with MOA for the inclusion of sub-projects in the investment program
are shown in Annex F. Most importantly, the sub-projects would only take place on the privatized



- 18 -
successors to state farms and would aim at rehabilitating presently irrigated areas and/or land previously
irrigated but now abandoned. The feasibility study would be undertaken for each sub-project to establish
its economic and financial viability (economic and financial rate of returns should exceed 12 percent).
Participating farms would sign appropriate letters of agreement with MOA to repay investment costs
through a per hectare cost recovery fee.
D. Main Components
4.6           The project would support a six year irrigation and drainage investment program. It has
been appraised on the basis of feasibility studies for about 34 sub-projects prepared by MOA with the
assistance of foreign and local consultants. Out of these 34 sub-projects, a core program of nine sub-
projects has been identified for construction starts in Year One (1996/1997) and Two (1997/1998) of the
implementation program. Two other sub-projects (Saryozenski and Kranaya Polyana) have only recently
been proposed for Year Two implementation. These two sub-projects, together with the sub-projects to
be selected for Year Three from a list of 13 "reserve projects" or from other potential sub-projects, would
still need to be prepared and approved by the Bank for implementation. Main components of the project
would be:
(a)    Improving reliability and efficiency of irrigation water use, involving irrigation
rehabilitation and installation of sprinkler systems; and reducing waterlogging
and salinity, involving rehabilitation of collector drains and on- farm drainage
improvements; the project works would include predominantly on-farm system
rehabilitation (about 30,000 ha) as well as selected improvements in inter-farm
irrigation and drainage;
(b)    Promoting agricultural development of privatized farms through a pilot operation
aimed at providing farmers' training, demonstrations and information services;
and
(c)    Institution building, including: (i) support for the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) in the MOA; and (ii) strengthening the environmental and monitoring
capabilities of the MOA, the MOEB and other concerned agencies; undertaking
a study of feasibility of transferring of inter-farm irrigation management from the
public sector to the water users.
E. Detailed Features
Component 1: Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems (Base Cost US$ 78.3 million)#'
4.7           General. The rehabilitation works would be undertaken in three groups of sub-projects,
averaging about 10,000 ha of on-farm systems and/or inter-farm irrigation and drainage systems.
Individual sub-projects may involve either (i) Comprehensive Reconstruction of Irrigation Systems
(CROIS), including irrigation and drainage; (ii) reconstruction of on-farm drainage only; or (iii) either
related or self-standing inter-farm irrigation or drainage improvements. On-farm irrigation may include

Projects for Years One and Two."



- 19 -
either surface irrigation or sprinkler irrigation. On-farm drainage works consist of either surface, tile
or vertical drainage.
4.8            Year One (1996/97). The 6 sub-projects identified for implementation starts in Year One
comprise 10 km of inter-farm canals; 6,500 ha of on-farm irrigation improvements and 10,300 ha of on-
farm drainage, including 1,400 of tile drainage and about 7,800 ha of vertical drainage. (base cost about
US$26 Million).
4.9            Year Two (1997/98). The 3 sub-projects currently under preparation for implementation
starts in Year Two comprise 2,100 ha of on-farm irrigation improvements and 5,500 ha of on-farm
drainage improvements, including 4,900 ha of tile drainage and 600 ha of vertical drainage. (base cost
about US$17 Million).7'
4.10           Year Three (1998/1999). Sub-projects to start in Year Three would be selected from the
list of 13 "reserve projects" or, if needed, from among other potential sub-projects (base costs about
US$26 million).
4.11          On-farm irrigation systems. Two basic types of on-farm irrigation projects are being
proposed; those to be rehabilitated as surface furrow systems; and those to be reconstructed as pivot
sprinkler irrigation systems. The surface systems generally involve replacing the open earth canal
delivery system with a lined or closed pipe system, providing outlets down to 15 ha farm blocks. The
surface systems are, in most cases, designed for use with movable hose. Major elements of the sprinkler
systems include replacement of the delivery  system  with a closed pipe distribution system, and
installation of a mobile or stationary pump station where required. The center pivot system would service
an average of 50 ha. The works include provision of slide gates, pipe valves, water meters in pipes,
broad-crested long measuring flumes, pressure relief regulation valves, and check valves.  Other
infrastructure reconstruction such as roads and power lines are provided as needed. Demonstrations in
water management (para. 4.18) would contribute to improving on-farm water use efficiencies.
4.12            An economic and technical evaluation was carried out for each irrigation reconstruction
project to determine irrigation type. In general sprinkler irrigation was proposed where sub-surface
closed drainage was required, land leveling was needed, in water short areas, and in sub-projects where
sprinkler systems are currently used.  The farms will make the final choice regarding the type of
sprinkler system that will be purchased for their farm.
4.13           On-farm drainage systems. In general on-farm sub-surface drainage will be provided for
areas where the water table is less than 2 meters from the surface. Drain depth will be set at 2 m and
plastic pipe will be used for all sub-surface drains. Vertical drainage was selected for use in Maktara
District (Golodnya Steppe) and involves a total of 70 drainage wells (about 7,800 ha).
4.14          One of the most critical components of a successful drainage scheme is a proper outlet.
Special attention was given to the question of drain outlets during the preparation of the feasibility
designs. The GOK has a strict policy of limiting the discharge of drainage water into a receiving body
that has a higher water quality than the discharging flow. A number of alternative procedures have been
used in the past to conform to this regulation. Many drainage systems have had their flows diverted into
specially constructed evaporation ponds or are conveyed large distances to natural depressions or salted

lakes. It will be necessary to review the drainage outlet alternatives in more detail during the design
phase. Special water balance and water quality studies will be required for several of the larger projects.
Component 2: Promoting Agricultural Development on Privatized Farms
(Base Cost US$1.9 million)8'
4.15           Pilots for Farmers' Participatory Training and Information Services. Most members
of the project farms, at least at this time, appear to prefer to be part of a functional group within their
large farm unit and work under the aegis of the former State/Collective Farm management and specialists,
rather than to take the risk of being the owner of a smaller private farm. These functional groups may
be a former production brigade of 60 - 80 people, working on 450 to 500 ha, or smaller family groups
or teams. The groups are responsible for either on-farm water management, crop production or one of
the farm services, such as water delivery, maintaining a pool of farm machinery or dairy production.
However, the overall responsibility for water management and services still remains with centralized
farms management and specialists.
4. 16         The main reasons for the reluctance of the shareholders to restructure the larger farms
into smaller units include: (i) lack of overall farm management skills; (ii) lack of operating capital and
access to agricultural credit; (iii) poorly developed marketing and input supply mechanisms; and (iv)
limited availability of inputs, spare parts, and equipment. The project will address the first issue through
a pilot operation to capitalize on the potential for increased agricultural production created by the
investments in irrigation and drainage. The pilot focuses on informing farmers on commercial farm
management principles, the use of more efficient production and water management practices and options
for privatization.
4.17           Effective research, extension and agricultural information services do not exist for private
farmers in Kazakstan. Agricultural training takes place in the higher educational centers at universities
while specialist advice, mainly in the form of directives, usually comes from agricultural research
institutes. Therefore, a number of practical, client-oriented, short participatory training courses or
workshops will be prepared and conducted under the project at selected project farms or training centers
for government officials, farm managers and directors, production specialists and farmers' groups and
individual private farmers. Topics for training will include modern farm and business management
practices, new crop production technologies, improved on-farm water management, marketing and
processing of produce, and environmental topics.
4.18          Together with the training, relevant demonstrations on improved on-farm  water
management (types of irrigation and drainage) and new crop production technologies will be conducted
to show farm managers and (future) farmers how to increase efficiency of applied inputs, the use of more
efficient farm machinery and tractors and how to intensify crop production.
4. 19         To further support the participating farms and other irrigated farms not included in the
project, a "Farmers' Information Services Desk" will be established in MOA to provide technical
pamphlets, videos and other materials on critical agricultural issues related to farm management,
production and marketing. Most information will be disseminated in Russian and Kazak through the
existing TV and Radio channels by MOA's Press Center and through two "Farmers' Weekly" papers.

4.20          Farm Restructuring. The project will support the privatization process and promote
restructuring, as appropriate and desired by farmers, in four principal ways: by developing and refining
a strong participatory process in design and implementation, the project will contribute to the
empowerment of farm members; by providing access to information and management skills, it will
encourage entrepreneurial farmers to take the risks associated with creating and managing new farm units;
by creating Water User Associations in conjunction with restructuring, it will provide an institutional
mechanism to operate and maintain the system and assure equitable access to water by all farmers; finally,
by discouraging concentrated ownership of farms, the project will help preserve the universe of choice
during this difficult transition period. Each of these elements is discussed in the following paragraphs.
4.21          The project incorporates a multi-step  consultation  process in  the design  and
implementation of sub-projects. This will engage both farmers and managers in making decisions and
assuming responsibility for farm assets to be affected by the project. This iterative consultation process
will broaden the prevailing concept of farm management and will contribute significantly, although
somewhat indirectly, to making further steps in the privatization process more open, more transparent,
and more informed.
4.22           One reason that farmers are still reluctant to break away from new collective or corporate
farms is a lack of management skills that would enable them to operate new farms. Management of new
restructured units is important for the project, as it will affect the potential for increasing agricultural
production that is created by the project. The project will develop a number of practical training courses
on production and management issues, demonstrations of improved water management and production
technologies and create broader information dissemination mechanisms (see paras. 4.17 - 4.19). This
management training component will support privatization very concretely by assisting new family and
small cooperative farms to establish themselves, as well as prompt larger units to consider restructuring.
4.23          As farms restructure, water user associations will be created to fill institutional gaps that
give break-away units inadequate access to water. Appropriate models for Kazakstan will be developed
under the PPF that build on and strengthen existing community bonds. The project will then launch pilot
efforts on farms already restructured to test and refine the models. Depending on the outcome of a pilot
effort to create an autonomous water district that is responsible for water management from the diversion
to the farmgate, the project may promote widespread adoption of this concept as a way of decentralizing
authority and responsibly for water resource management to an operational level.
4.24          On some farms, farm managers and technicians are attempting to acquire land use right
certificates from farm members to create large commercial farm units, encompassing either a whole
former state farm or the equivalent of a brigade unit. Currently, other farm members are vulnerable to
pressure to cede their use rights due to great uncertainties. To preserve the future choices of vulnerable
farmers, the project will exclude farms that restrict the ability of farm members to cede their land share
from the principal unit and start new farm units. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that
the eligibility criteria for participation in the project would require that the bylaws of each farm
participating in the project would guarantee the right of individuals and groups to withdraw their shares
from the collective or corporate entity and establish their own independent farms.

Component 3: Institution Building (Base Cost US$5.0 million)9'
4.25           Support for the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) (Base Cost US$ 2.2 million). The
project would upgrade the institutional capacity of the MOA in planning, preparing, executing and
monitoring an irrigation and drainage investment program. For that purpose, a PIU was established in
July 1995, under the direct supervision of the Minister of Agriculture. PIU staff, including Resident
Engineers for construction supervision, would be recruited on a competitive basis and financed (base cost
US$0.9 million) under the project.
4.26          The PIU would contract management and engineering consultants to (i) assist and train
PIU staff in project planning, management, monitoring, procurement and financial management; (ii) take
responsibility for updating/preparing feasibility studies, preparing Environmental Impact Assessments
(EIAs), undertaking field surveys and designs, preparing bidding documents; and (iii) assist PIU with
farmers' participation, establishing WUAs and construction supervision.  It is expected that the
management and engineering consultants will work with national design institutes as partner(s) in a joint
venture or as sub-contractors. The main consultant would provide training to staff of the local design
institutes in, inter alia,  construction supervision and quality control. These arrangements would
strengthen the local consulting industry, as well as introduce it to better engineering standards and
business practices. It is expected that the consultants' contract would involve some 175 person-months
of expatriate staff and about 5,000 person-months of local experts and support staff. During Negotiations
it was agreed that the need for further consulting services would be examined during the mid-term review
(para. 5.30) and funds would be reallocated if such a need would arise.
4.27          Strengthening Environmental Capacity (Base Cost US$2.6 million)'.  This sub-
component would include:
(a)    Institutional Development and Training (Cost US$855,000), involving:
a. I    Institutional Development (Cost US$250,000), including preparation of
an improved Environmental Assessment (EA) regulatory framework for
irrigation/drainage development; preparation of an EIA manual for
irrigation/drainage projects; and building environmental capacity in MOA
through the creation of an Environmental Unit.
a.2    EIA  Preparation and State Ecological  Expertise  (SEE) Review
(US$150,000), including preparation of remaining project specific ElAs
and SEE Review as required by national environmental legislation and
governmental regulations.
a.3    Training (US$370,000) for managers, irrigation/drainage engineers,
environmental staff, and farmers. A supporting information program
would be developed that may include television spots, preparation of
brochures, guides, leaflets, bulletins, video and radio programs, etc.
9!     Excluding costs for engineering and construction supervision, which are included in Component 1.

a.4    An EA Harmonization Seminar (Cost US$85,000) to reconcile differences
in Bank and Kazak EA requirements and procedures and foster EA
preparation for project processing in various sectors;
(b)    Strengthening  Water/Soil Quality,  Monitoring  and  Pollution  Control,
Agro-meteorological Programu and Provision of Equipment and Materials (Cost
US$970,000), including provision of field and laboratory monitoring equipment,
computers for data processing and management, vehicles, office equipment, spare
parts and chemicals for laboratory analysis; monitoring of soil contamination,
drainage, surface and ground water quality, water table and salinity;
strengthening existing agro-meteorological data collection systems; measuring
water losses in irrigation/drainage systems; and supporting monitoring of
pesticide residues and quality control of agricultural inputs/outputs;
(c)    Special Environmental Studies (US$150,000), including  development of
cost-effective methods to prevent salinity and water-logging, methods for the
reclamation of saline soil or introduction of alternative land use; and
(d)    Developing and Implementing Mitigation Plans (US$625,000), including a pilot
project to clean drainage water from agro-chemical residues; and afforestation
within the boundaries of the sub-project areas.
4.28          Study of the Feasibility of Privatizing Irrigation Management for a Typical Canal
Command Area (US$230,000). Funds would be provided under the loan for a study to examine the
feasibility of establishing a private irrigation company for the area served by the Tashatkul canal
(approximately 40,000 ha) in Dzambul Oblast. MOA is concerned about the sustainability of the inter-
farm systems because of insufficient funding of O&M and sees user participation and privatization as
a means to improve system O&M. It is envisaged that the company would be owned by the water users,
be fully responsible for operation and maintenance and financially self-sufficient. The study would define
the desired services to be provided by the company, the costs for providing these services, financial
arrangements and the process of establishing the company and transferring to it management of the
system. The study would specifically consider issues of jurisdiction, ownership, organizational structure
of the new management, the need for technological improvements in operation and maintenance to
facilitate the transfer process, and training needs, among others.
F. Implementation Schedule
4.29          The project is to be implemented over a period of six years.  A summary of the
implementation schedule is shown in Annex L. The IDIP has been designed as an irrigation development
program. Individual sub-projects can be added or removed from the program based on the willingness
of beneficiaries to participate, ability of beneficiaries to pay for the on-farm reconstruction costs, and
economic viability, technical feasibility, and environmental acceptability of each sub-project.
Construction periods for individual sub-projects are expected to be about two to three years, depending
upon the size of the project.

G. Project Costs
4.30             The proposed project is estimated to cost about US$118 million. This estimate is based
on December 1995 prices, but with the addition of taxes and physical and price contingencies. The
foreign exchange component is estimated at about US$49 million or about 42 percent of total project cost.
Physical contingencies were assumed at 10 percent of the investment costs. Price contingency estimates
assume an increase in local currency costs of 15 per cent per annum starting in 1997 (based on expected
local inflation) and in foreign exchange of 1.8 percent for 1996, 2.7 percent for 1997. 2.5 percent for
1998, 2.5 percent for 1999, 2.6 percent for 2000, and 2.7 percent for 2001 and 2002. Physical and price
contingencies combined comprise 32 percent of the project base cost. Import duties, and value added tax
amount to about 17 percent of the base cost.'L' The costs for on-farm irrigation works with surface
irrigation are about US$1,400/ha, and with sprinkler irrigation US$ 2,600/ha. The costs for horizontal
sub-surface drainage are about US$1,440/ha, and for vertical drainage US$600/ha. Project costs are
summarized in Table 4.1 and details are presented in Annex M.

H. Financing Plan
4.31             A loan of US$80 million equivalent to the Republic of Kazakstan is proposed, to finance
80 percent of total costs net of taxes. This would cover 100 percent of foreign costs and 61 percent of
local costs net of taxes and duties. The Borrower would contribute about US$20 million equivalent or
about 20 percent of total project cost (net of taxes). The costs of on-farm rehabilitation works would
eventually be repaid by participating farms through a cost recovery fee (para. 5.23). In August 1995,
the Bank approved an advance from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF); this advance will be repaid
under the loan. The financing plan for the project is presented in Table 4.2.
H/      The treatment of taxes in the cost tables is based on existing tax legislation. The Bank has just leamt that revisions to the legislation
are being proposed so that project costs financed by multi-lateral lenders including the World Hank will be exempt from custom duties
and VAT taxes.

4.32          Counterpart Funds.  Project implementation according to plan requires the timely
availability of budgetary resources to finance local costs.  Assurances were obtained during loan
negotiations that. (i) the Government would introduce, beginning in FY97, a line item in the annual draft
budget for the project until its completion, for the sole use of the project, and in an amount to be agreed
with the Bank; (ii) Government would provide sufficient funds in its annual budgets to cover routine
environmental monitoring activities by MOA, MOEB, MOG, Hydromet, and SANEPID in the sub-project
areas; and (iii) an annual review would be undertaken by the Government and the Bank of Government's
investment program in irrigation to assure that only priority investments are undertaken and that planned
investments would not threaten counterpart funding levels for the proposed project.
I. Procurement
4.33          Procurement of goods and works would follow the "Guidelines: Procurement under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995" revised in January 1996. Recruitment of consultants would
follow the "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrower and by The World Bank as
Executing Agency, August 1981." The Borrower will use Bank's standard bidding documents for goods
and works, including the Bank's Regional sample NCB documents for works issued in 1995. For
consulting assignments the Borrower will use the relevant Bank's standard form of contract. A General
Procurement Notice would be issued in Development Business in June 1996, followed by individual
specific notices for contracts above US$10 million. The Project Launch Workshop is planned for
September 1996.
4.34          Responsibility for all procurement will rest with the PIU of the MOA. The staff of the
PIU will include a full time procurement specialist. Moreover, the PIU will be assisted by a consulting
firm (paras. 4.36(c) and 5.6), which will provide a full time procurement specialist for at least the first
year of project implementation.
4.35          There are civil works construction organizations and plants for the fabrication of concrete
pipes and irrigation structures in nearly all oblasts. During the Soviet era these organizations had
considerable construction and manufacturing capabilities. Therefore, there should be no major problem
for most of them to implement the relatively small sub-projects anticipated for implementation under the
project. All these former state organizations have recently been privatized and converted into joint stock
12/   Including US$17.8 million of taxes and duties.

companies; they have financial and managerial autonomy, do not receive subsidies from Government and,
therefore, meet the eligibility criteria of the Bank's operational directives.
4.36          Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3. Details of the proposed
arrangements are as follows-3:
(a)    Works. The project would consist of some 15 sub-projects which will require
civil works construction and the supply and installment of various types of
materials and equipment. To simplify procurement arrangements, the bidding
for the sub-projects will require general contractors to procure, supply and install
all necessary equipment. Contracts over US$0.5 million would be procured
through ICB. Based on the currently available list of "reserve projects" (para.
4.6), it is expected that other smaller valued contracts below US$500,000 each
would be procured through NCB up to an aggregate amount of US$2.0 million.
Works estimated to cost less than $100,000 per contract and up to a maximum
aggregate amount of US$500,000 may be procured under lump sum, fixed price
contracts awarded on the basis of quotations from three qualified domestic
contractors in response to a written invitation;
(b)    Goods:
(i)    ICB (US$1.3 million) procedures would be used for contracts of
US$200,000 and above;
(ii)   International Shopping (IS) would be used to procure items included in
contract packages estimated to cost under US$200,000 each (with an
aggregate value not exceeding US$3.0 million), such as vehicles, field
and office equipment, etc. IS shall be based on quotations from at least
three suppliers in two different countries; and
(iii)   National ShopDing (NS) would be used for small items or items that can
be obtained off- the shelf, and for national services (printed materials and
video/TV productions) estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per
contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$2.0 million on the basis of
at least three quotations from qualified suppliers.

(c)    Consultants.  The following consultants and staff would be recruited by the
PIU: (i) through short-listing a consulting firm to assist, inter alia, with project
planning, management, procurement, and construction supervision and
monitoring; and to take responsibility for project design, preparation of bidding
documents, and undertaking environmental impact assessments (EIAs) (para.
4.30); value of first contract (for three years) US$7.7 million; (ii) through short-
listing, a consulting firm, to assist, inter alia, with the pilots for farmers' training
and information services; (paras. 4.15 to 4.19); All training activities are an
integral part of the consultant services' contract and its scope, program and
budget would need to be approved by the Bank. Contract value US$1.5 million;
(iii) through short-listing, a consulting firm to assist with strengthening the
environmental capacity of MOA, MOEB and other agencies (para. 4.30);
contract value US$1.2 million; and (iv) staff for the PIU, selected on the basis
of job descriptions and a selection process approved by the Bank (total costs
about US$1.0 million). About 12 local, highly qualified individuals would be
recruited (initially for one year, with the possibility of extension upon satisfactory
performance) to staff the PIU and to represent the MOA as the client and the
main executing agency vis-a-vis other governmental agencies and participating
farms, and foreign and local consulting firms, and contractors; these individuals
will cover all required main disciplines, including engineering, procurement,
agriculture, the environment, cost recovery, farmers' participation, office
management, accounting and monitoring and evaluation. In addition Resident
Engineers (one for each sub-project) would be recruited by the PIU to take
charge of construction supervision.
4.37          Bank Review. All ICB contracts (both goods and works) would be subject to prior Bank
review, as well as the first works contract following: (i) NCB; and (ii) fixed price contract awarded on
the basis of three quotations. Also, the letters of invitation for all consulting assignments (including the
terms of reference) and contracts with consulting firms costing more than US$100,000, as well as sole
source selection, and contracts with individual consultants costing more than US$50,000 would be subject
to prior review by the Bank. All other contracts would be subject to ex-post review by the Bank on a
random basis. Agreement was reached during loan negotiations that all procurement processes and
actions under the project would follow the procedures outlined in paras. 4.36 to 4.37.
4.38          A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) has not yet been completed.
However, procurement proposed under the project would follow Bank Procurement Guidelines.
4.39          Information regarding procurement administration would be collected and recorded by
the PIU and quarterly reports would be sent to the Bank. These reports would also indicate: (a) revised
cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project; (b) revised timing of procurement actions and
completion time; and (c) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.

J. Disbursements
4.40          The proposed Bank loan of US$80 million equivalent would be disbursed over a period
of 6 years, and the expected project closing date would be December 31, 2003. There is no experience
yet to form a disbursement profile for Kazakstan, but it is estimated that the country's ability to
implement the project over a six-year period is reasonable, especially given that a PIU has already been
set up. The estimated disbursements during each year of project implementation are shown in Annex 0.
4.41          The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed in US Dollars as shown in Table 4.4 below:
Table 4.4: Disbursement Categories
Disbursement Category           Allocation              Disbursement Basis
______________________j(US$ M)
1. Goods: Equipment and Materials     3.5   100 percent of foreign expenditure 100 percent
of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 85
percent of local expenditures for other items
procured locally
2. Works                             60.4   70 percent of expenditures
3. Consultant Services               11.6   100 percent
4. Refund of Project Prep Advance     1.5
5. Unallocated                        3.0
Total                  80.0
4.42          Direct payment procedures from the Bank to suppliers will be used. Disbursements
against the categories described in Table 4.4 would be made upon receipt by the Bank of fully
documented applications, except for: (i) contracts for works valued at less than US$500,000; (ii) contracts
with consulting firms valued at less then US$100,0QO; and (iii) contracts with individual consultants
valued at less than US$50,000; contracts for goods costing less than $200,000; disbursements for these
items would be made against certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documentation for
SOE would be retained by the Borrower and made available to the Bank during supervision. Direct
payment application and applications for special comrnitments would be accepted for minimum amounts
of US$20,000. To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account in
one of the major commercial banks to cover the Bank's share of expenditures. An initial deposit of
US$500,000 would be made, with the amount in the Special Account increased to the ceiling of US$1.0
million when total disbursements reach US$2.0 million. Applications for replenishment of the Special
Account would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever
occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the same procedure as
described above. In addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Account which have been
reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests. At negotiations, agreement was
reached that disbursement arrangements will follow the procedures described above, including the
establishment and operation of the Special Account. A condition for disbursement of expenditures made
in respect of Category (2), would be that each sub-project in respect of which disbursement is sought
would be selected, approved and implemented in accordance with the procedures and eligibility criteria,



- 30 -
and on ternms and conditions specified in the cost recovery resolution, and in schedule 7 of the loan
agreement, and satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank will make its decision to finance a sub-project after
reviewing the feasibility study, the EIA and the SEE review.
K. Status of Project Preparation
4.43            The project has been based on the economic and environmental screening of 141 sub-
projects in 19 oblasts and which had been included in the Ten Year and Five Year Irrigation Investment
Plans (paras. 2.30 - 2.31). Feasibility studies have been prepared for 34 sub-projects initially selected for
inclusion in the Five Year Investment Plan, including 9 core projects currently proposed for
implementation under the IDIP and the 13 "reserve projects" (para. 4.6). Under the "bridging operation"
(para. 4.2) the PIU has been set up and staffed and the referred to feasibility studies will be updated for
sub-projects scheduled with implementation starts in the first year, and EIAs/SEEs for these sub-projects
will be prepared. Detailed designs and bidding documents for the Year One sub-projects are scheduled
for completion by July 1996. In addition, a Sector Environmental Analysis (SEA) and two draft sub-
project specific pilot Environmental Impact Assessments (ElAs) have been prepared; the latter will also
be finalized during the" bridging operation" (See Annex X for a summary of the SEA). A social
assessment of 30 farms identified for participation in the project was also undertaken.
L. Participation
4.44          Major project stakeholders include the MOA and the CWR and their representatives on
different administrative levels, design institutes, contractors, farm managers, farm members and
individual farmers. The project will fund works that originally were included in a long-term irrigation
and drainage improvement program, most elements of which were incorporated at the initiation of
managers of former state and collective farms, or at least with their active involvement. With the advent
of privatization, farm members and independent farmers located on the former state farms have become
important stakeholders, as they will ultimately be responsible for repayment of the cost of on-farm works.
The project will actively engage these stakeholders through a transparent 5-step consultation and decision
making process (Annex P) which will ensure that they are empowered to make important decisions at
each step in the design and implementation process and that they are clearly aware of the cost and O&M
implications of the decisions. The project will also promote two other mechanisms to ensure that the
voices of major stakeholders are factored into decisions and operations. First, given the experience of
independent farmers being marginalized from farm services, including water, Water User Associations
(WUAs) will be promoted to ensure that independent farmers have a voice in water management. WUA
models appropriate for Kazakstan will be developed in early stages of the project. Second, on a pilot
basis, the project will help prepare a private Irrigation Company at the canal command level, based
roughly on a U.S. irrigation district model, to manage inter-farm water sources, thus decentralizing water
administration and increasing the voice of local farmers and farm managers in water allocation decisions
and inter-farm water management.

M. Enviromnental Aspects and Impacts
4.45          In accordance and consistent with the requirements of the Bank OD 4.01 "Environmental
Assessment", the project has been screened and placed into EA Category "B", which requires the
preparation of an environmental analysis to define environmental management, monitoring and mitigation
measures as necessary. However, in accordance with Kazak law ElAs should be prepared, and SEE
reviews conducted for each sub-project. Assurances were obtainedfrom Government at negotiations that
(i) the proceduresfor selection of sub-projects would include (i) the preparation of EUAs and SEE reviews
for sub-projects would be conducted within theframework of the recommendations of the SEA and the two
pilot ElAs, and in accordance with the Bank's and Government's EA requirements and procedures.
Assurances were also obtained at negotiations that: (i) recommended mitigation measures in the ElAs and
SEE reviews would become an integral part of project design and implementation; (ii) "chance find"
procedures would be developed and applied to address the risk of encountering unknown archaeological
sites and used in accordance with the guidelines and requirements of Kazakstan acceptable to the Bank;
and (iii) all agrochemicals to be applied under the project would be approved, stored, distributed and
used in accordance with the guidelines and requirements of Kazakstan acceptable to the Bank.
4.46          The project has been subject to field-based environmental review that indicates its positive
impact on the environment. The project would not expand irrigation to new areas but would improve
irrigation technology on existing agricultural land, leading to improved water conservation and
agricultural practices. The proposed drainage improvements on these lands would reduce present and
potential waterlogging and salinity problems.  The project would have an additional positive
environmental impact by reducing water losses through improved system conveyance and flow control.
Pesticide runoff would also be reduced through disseminating information to farmers and training on the
safe use of pesticides, following Bank requirements on techniques for IPM, thus, in turn, reducing water
pollution and soil contamination. Adverse impacts will be mainly limited to the construction phase but
remedial measures will be taken (para. 5.20). The proposed project would not involve involuntary
resettlement and is not anticipated to have an impact on known archaeological or historical sites in any
of the sub-projects areas.
N. International Waterways
4.47          The investment program  under proposed project could affect the rivers that are
international waterways in accordance with OP 7.50, para. 1 (a) and (b), i.e., rivers and tributaries that
ultimately flow to and/or are shared with other riparian countries. However, a notification for the
activities under the project is not required since: (a) the proposed works are limited to the rehabilitation
of existing schemes. The proposed sub-projects would not expand irrigation to new areas or alter the
nature of the original schemes. The areas that would be rehabilitated are relatively small; the average area
with on-farm works is about 2,000 ha. Some collector drains servicing larger areas are anticipated to
be rehabilitated as well but no additions or alterations are planned as compared to their original design;
(b) because of the small size of the individual sub-projects, their implementation is not expected to
adversely change the quality or quantity of water flows to the other riparians; the improvements in
irrigation would have a positive environmental impact by reducing water losses through improved
conveyance and flow control; new drainage construction is very limited so that the increases in drainage
discharges will be very small as compared to the water flows in the receiving water bodies; (c) there
is no indication that any ongoing or planned projects in the riparian countries could adversely affect the
sub-projects. It may, therefore, be reasonably assumed that the project would not be adversely affected
by the other riparians possible water use; and (d) a review of existing international agreements and



- 32 -
arrangements between Kazakstan and riparian countries has shown that none of these legal instruments
would require notification for the activities to be carried out under the project; GOK has confirmed this
in writing. All sub-projects to be financed under the loan would be checked by the Government, and
reviewed by the Bank, to ensure that they meet all applicable international water requirements.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Organization
5.1           Organization at the National Level. Government has delegated overall responsibility for
project implementation to the Ministry of Agriculture, except for parts of the environmental sub-
component (paras. 4.27 and 5.11).
5.2          Inter-Ministerial Coordination. An Inter-ministerial Coordinating Committee (ICC) has
been established composed of the Minister of Agriculture (Chairman), the Deputy Ministers of Economy,
Finance, MOEB, and Construction, the Deputy Chairman of the CWR, the Director of the PIU
(Secretary) and representatives of the Committee for Foreign Investments, the Ministry of Geology, the
State Committee on Land Relations and Organization of Land Use (SCLR), the HS, SANEPID, the CF,
and farm managers. The Committee would meet quarterly, or more frequently when required, to review
progress and resolve problems of inter-agency coordination.
5.3           Project Organization at the Provincial Level. Oblast Coordination Committees have been
established for Year One projects to provide the necessary coordination on project matters at the
provincial level. Most ministries and national agencies are represented at the Oblast level, so that the
Committee will be an image of the ICC at the national level. These Committees would be chaired by the
Deputy Governor of the Oblast. Other OCCs for the remaining sub-projects would be established one year
prior to the planned implementation period.
B. The Ministry of Agriculture
5.4           General. Details of MOA organization are provided in Annex R and Chart 1. MOA does
not maintain a specialized department for irrigation and drainage planning, design and execution; this task
was carried out by its design institutes which are now financially self-supporting. Development of new
projects is currently being promoted by the financially independent Republican Association
"Kazakgromeliovodkhoz", an agglomeration of design institutes and construction organizations. There
is no department for extension or training. Environmental monitoring (mostly soil salinity and depth to
ground water) is the responsibility of three monitoring units, locally called "Expeditions", with offices
in Almaty, Zhambul and Taldykorgan.
5.5          Project Implementation Unit. The MOA management, administration and coordination
of the project will be the direct responsibility of the already established Project Implementation Unit
(PIU). The Director of the PIU will be directly responsible to the Minister of Agriculture . The PIU will
have units for Contract Administration, General Administration and Accounting, Monitoring and
Evaluation, and a Technical Unit comprised of the necessary specialists (Charts 2 and 3). Assurances
were obtained during loan negotiations that the PIU would be adequately staffed and would continue to
employ a Project Director and professional staff that would be acceptable to the Bank.
5.6          The PIU will contract all consultants required to assist with project implementation,
including but not limited to: (i) management and engineering consultants to assist with overall project
planning and management and the design and implementation of the irrigation and drainage works;
(ii) farm management and training consultants to assist with the implementation of the agriculture



- 34 -
component; and (iii) environmental consultants to assist with the implementation of the environmental sub-
component. For summaries of the Terms of Reference see Annex S.
5.7           Environmental Unit. The MOA has at present no environmental review or planning
capacity.  An Environmental Unit (EU) would be established in the MOA headed by a Senior
Environmental Advisor who would be directly responsible to the Minister. He would be supported by
two environmental specialists. The EU's responsibilities would include but not be limited to: sectoral
environmental policy making, planning and management to meet MOA responsibilities under national
environmental legislation; developing MOA's EA capacity for sectoral, regional and project-specific
activities; coordinating development and enforcing sectoral environmental policy directives; preparing
sectoral environmental strategies and action plans; coordinating sectoral environmental training; and
liaising with other environmental agencies. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that the
EU be established within the MOA prior to March 31, 1997.
C. The Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources
5.8           General. The Ministry was established in 1992. It is a planning, management and
monitoring agency mandated to promote the protection and rational use of natural resources. MOEB
depends on Government funding and is severely curtailed in all aspects of its mission. The Ministry has
undergone at least two reorganizations since its founding. The recruitment and retention of trained
specialists remain a problem, and are likely to continue until the economy improves. Laboratory facilities
are antiquated and ill-equipped, hindering the accomplishment of basic data gathering and enforcement
(Annex T, Chart 4).
5.9           State Ecological Expertise (SEE). The law "On Environmental Protection" has provided
for mandatory SEE (environmental review) prior to making any development decision; public and private
financing of a project can start only after obtaining a positive SEE. All development programs, plans
and designs, together with Environmental Impact Assessments are subject to an SEE. All projects with
foreign investments are subject to SEE at the national level. MOEB's Department for SEE and
Radiological Safety is responsible for normative requirements and guidelines for EIA and SEE.
5.10          State Ecological Inspection (SEI). SEI is an organizational entity within MOEB with
the prime responsibility for state environmental control to ensure compliance with existing legislation,
standards, requirements and conclusions of SEE. SEI issues licenses and permits for use of natural
resources, waste disposal, and emissions and discharges of pollutants. It assesses fees and fines for use
of natural resources and pollution, and clears permits for surface and ground water use, importation of
agro-chemicals, etc.  SEI also controls handling, storage, transportation, use and distribution of
pesticides, herbicides and other agro-chemicals; as well as compliance with national environmental and
water legislation.
D. Organization of Environmental Sub-Component
5.11          The overall responsibility for coordinating the activities under the environmental sub-
component will rest with the PIU, as well as all aspects of contracting, procurement and financial
management. The principal agencies responsible for the various elements of this sub-component are:
(a)    Institutional Development: MOA and MOEB;



- 35 -
(b)    Special Environmental Studies: MOA; MOEB and AAS;
(c)    Environmental Monitoring: MOA, MOEB, Hydromet, CWR, MOG, SANEPID;
(d)    Pilot "Clean Drainage Water Project": Kaznekhanobr; and
(e)    Afforestation: CF.
Other participating agencies will include the Ministry of Justice, Research and Design Institutes, and
subordinate national and regional bodies of above ministries. Environmental consultants recruited by PIU
would assist the PIU and relevant counterpart agencies with implementation.
E. Organization of Agricultural Component
5.12          The overall responsibility for implementing the agricultural component will rest with the
Department for Production, under the direct leadership of MOA's Deputy Minister in charge of this
Department. However, all aspects of contracting, procurement and financial management will be
handled by the PIU. Farrm management and training consultants, contracted by the PIU, will take
responsibility for the preparation of short farmers' training courses and workshops and carry out the
training, demonstrations and farmers' information services program as spelled out in Annex J. The
demonstrations in the farmers' field will be planned and carried out in close coordination with the PIU.
F. Project Preparation and Bank Review
5.13          Standards for Surveys, Investigations, Planning and Design. Acceptable international
standards will be introduced for survey, investigation, planning and design practices under the project.
Criteria for on-farm irrigation planning, drainage planning and comparing economic options for on-farm
irrigation have been agreed upon and are available in the PIP.
5.14          Environmental Impact Assessments. Although not required by the Bank, Kazak law
requires the preparation of ElAs and SEE reviews for each sub-project. These will be prepared by the
PIU consultants for review and approval by the MOEB. It has been agreed that the already prepared
draft SEA and two draft pilot EIAs will he finalized during the bridging operation, incorporating the
comments provided by MOEB and the Bank. The English summaries and conclusions of the SEE
documents are expected to be furnished to the Bank prior to the submission of the first draft bidding
documents for civil works.
5.15          Bank Review. 7he selection of sub-projectsfor which updated/detailedfeasibility studies
will be prepared would be subject to Bank review and concurrence, based on a review of the pre-
feasibility reports preparedfor each sub-project. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that feasibility
studies, EIAs and conclusions of SEE reviews for sub-projects would be submitted to the Bank for review
and approval.
G. Arrangements for Construction
5.16         Domestic Construction Capacity. It is expected that most civil works will be undertaken
by local civil works contractors. More than 30 former state construction organizations have been
transformed in private joint-stock companies; most of them have experience in irrigation construction



- 36 -
works. Due to lack of Government funding for construction, these contractors have lost much of their
former production capacity due to heavy reductions in staff, loss of operable equipment and lack of spare
parts. However, as the sub-projects are small, local construction capacities should still be sufficient for
implementation. Two week training programs will be conducted to instruct national contractors on the
contents of the bidding documents, the bidding procedures, commercial practices for importing goods
and the arrangements for construction supervision.
5.17          Supply of Locally Manufactured Concrete Elements. Concrete pipes and pre-cast
irrigation structures are traditionally widely used in Central Asia. Quality of design, production and
installation have however not always been adequate. The following measures will be taken to overcome
these problems: (i) appropriate specifications (including the use of air-entraining admixtures to reduce
damage caused by the many freezing/thawing cycles); (ii) sampling and testing; and (iii) adequate
construction supervision.
5.18          Construction Supervision and Quality Control. Independent construction supervision and
strict control of construction quality on behalf of the client did not exist in the FSU, which contributed
considerably to poor quality construction as compared to acceptable international standards. To address
the lack of supervision, detailed procedures for construction management, quality control, inspection
procedures and material testing have been prepared. Assurances were be obtained during loan
negotiations that internationally acceptable standardsfor construction and construction supervision would
be applied during project implementation.
5.19          Leasing Specialized Construction Equipment. The domestic construction industry lacks
certain specialized construction equipment such as trenchless tile drain machines. Arrangements will be
made under the project for the PIU to procure such equipment and lease it to the contractors.
5.20          Environmental Impact. Procedures to mitigate any adverse impacts during construction
will be included in the bidding documents; this may cover site stabilization, collection of construction
materials and wastes, procedures to ensure environmental protection, and the safety and health of
workers.
5.21          Project Implementation Plan. The detailed work plan for the first two years of project
implementation and the preliminary plans for subsequent years are included in the Project Implementation
Plan. Assurances were obtained that the detailed workplan will be updated regularly by the PIU, at least
twice a year, and would be subject to Bank review. Generally the work plan would be updated just prior
to the arrival of a Bank supervision mission. A typical plan for a sub-project is shown in Annex N.
H. Farmers' Participation
5.22          In order to ensure that farmers assume responsibility for the cost and operation and
maintenance of on-farm project investments, the project will adopt a participatory process to engage
farmers in decisions regarding design, implementation, O&M and cost recovery. This iterative process
will begin with the presentation of alternative designs, and continue to the final stage of performance
testing and turnover, which will include detailed O&M plans. The first step in the process will be to
develop an acceptable participation framework. Ideally, decisions would be made by a general assembly.
More likely, however, a group of farmer representatives will be created that will ultimately report to the
assembly. Each farm will establish its own participation protocol that must be endorsed by the PIU
before any action is taken. Final approval of any sub-project will require precise documentation of the



- 37 -
consultation process, as well as clear guidelines for participation in subsequent decision making and
monitoring. As a first step in this process all potential participating farms for year I and year 2 sub-
projects have signed Letters of Intent indicating the farm's desire to participate in the project and to pay
the cost-recovery fee.
I. Financing of Sub-Project Works and Equipment
5.23           The major investment component under the project would be for the rehabilitation and
improvement of on-farm irrigation and drainage systems. Participating farms would have to repay such
investments. However, the banking system in Kazakstan is still inadequate and would not be able and
willing to handle long term loans for investments in infrastructure. As Government has clearly an interest
in protecting agricultural land from further deterioration, it is reasonable that Government would share
in the risks associated with investing in land improvements. It has been agreed with Government that cost
recovery for on-farm works and installation of irrigation equipment be undertaken through a cost-recovery
fee that is linked to the land and would be assessed on a per hectare basis. This would also have the
advantage that responsibility for repayment is passed on to a new owner after sale, bankruptcy etc. Farms
would initially sign a letter of intent after general agreement indicating their decision to participate in the
project and their agreement on the scope of the work to be carried out. Subsequently, after detailed
designs and cost estimates have been completed, the farms would sign an agreement with the MOA for
implementation and the terms for repayment.
5.24            The cost-recovery fee would be a per hectare charge based on the amortization of the
on-farm investment costs. The water code of 1991 provides the legal basis for such a fee as it contains
the provisions for per hectare charge to recover the costs of capital The costs would include actual
construction costs including works and equipment. The fee would seek to recover between 70 to 80
percent of the investment cost and would be based on a 30 year amortization period with a five year grace
period an annual interest rate in US Dollars of eight percent. The percentage of costs to be recovered
is consistent with the fact that some of the benefits of the investments accrue to beneficiaries outside the
farm (decreased water losses, improved water quality). Since all the benefits can not be captured by the
participating farms, partial cost recovery from the direct beneficiaries is justified. The annual per hectare
charge derived from this calculation would be levied and collected by the Oblast level authorities. For
the inter-farm works, an increased land levy is being proposed for farms benefitting from the
improvements. The Government has prepared a draft resolution satisfactory to the Bank relating to the
introduction of the cost recovery fee, including methods of calculating the fee, the selection of sub-
projects, and eligibility criteria for participating farms. Adoption, by the Government of the resolution,
satisfactory to the Bank, is a condition of effectiveness.
J. Plans for Operation and Maintenance
5.25           Inter-farm Systems. The CWR has initiated a system of water charges to cover the costs
of inter-farm operation and maintenance charges (para. 2.17). Experience with the system in its first two-
years shows that the collection rates is about 47 percent, which is resulting in inadequate maintenance
and deterioration of the system. The major factors explaining the low collection rates are the relative
newness of the system, the novelty of charging for water, and the overall financial conditions of the farms
given the low producer prices relative to world market prices. The Government price reforms currently
being implemented should put farms into a much better position to cover water charges fully beginning
in 1996. A concerted effort is now required by the Government to assure that discipline is introduced
and maintained in the collection of water charges. Collection of water charges is undertaken by the



- 38 -
District Water Resources Committees, which are financially self-supporting and entitled to keep the
revenues to finance their operations. An improved collection rate would thus have an immediate positive
impact on O&M operations. To this end, assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government
would implement measures to improve cost recovery rates for 0 & M of inter-farm works in accordance
with the following schedule: 55 percent by December 31, 1997; 70 percent by December 31, 1998; 80
percent by December 31, 1999; and greater than 90 percent by December 31, 2000. These measures
include: (i) monitoring of prices received by producers to determine the impact of price reforms on the
ability offarms to pay charges; (ii) commitment by the Government to make up any shortfall in collection
of targeted amounts that can be attributed to lack of progress in Government pricing or marketing
reforms; and (iii) a system of enforcement to collect any overdue charges.
5.26         On-farm systems. Generally, most farms have tools and equipment which can also be
used for on-farm maintenance of the irrigation facilities. Horizontal subsurface drainage systems will
need periodic cleaning; farms with vertical wells will need to undertake repairs and maintain pumps and
related equipment. An assurance was obtained during loan negotiations that a detailed O&M plan will
be preparedfor each sub-project.
K. Water User Associations
5.27         Although the management of privatized farms appears to resemble that of the previous
state farm era, a qualitative shift is occurring with both positive and negative consequences. Management
accountability is shifting from the MOA to members of the farm. The positive impact of the shift can
be seen in the way managers are searching for ways to make the farms profitable, and thereby to keep
their jobs. The negative impact can be see in the way that break-away farm units are virtually ignored
by farm management. Managers are accountable to farmers, but to members, not non-members. In
farms where the previous structure is intact, management continues to assume responsibility for the
operation and maintenance of the farm's irrigation system, generally following old patterns. However,
focus groups reveal that break-away farmers are generally located at the end of a delivery unit, and they
frequently are given low priority in irrigation service. The project would support the creation of WUAs
within the boundaries of the previous state farms, through which the members would assume
responsibility for O&M of the irrigation and drainage systems, the main objectives being to ensure an
equitable and timely water supply to the members of the WUA, and to maintain the system adequately.
The WUAs would need to adopt appropriate rules and regulations for their governance, water distribution
and allocation, sanctions for violations, conflict resolution mechanisms, cost sharing etc. To be effective,
however, the associations must be given legal status, which will require an appropriate legal and
regulatory framework. An assurance would be obtained during loan negotiations that MOA would
continue to take action and develop, as necessary with the assistance of consultants, a legal and
regulatoryframeworkfor the successful establishment andfunctioning of Water UserAssociations (WUAs).
L. Project Monitoring and Reporting
5.28         Performnance Monitoring. Monitoring the implementation and performance of the project
will involve the inventory, collection, processing and analysis of considerable data on water, natural
resources, land use and agricultural production. Performance monitoring indicators have been agreed
upon (Annex U). While overall responsibility for coordinating performance monitoring rests with the
PIU, other entities involved include, inter alia, the Expeditions (for soil salinity, water quality and
agricultural production), MOEB, and CWR (for collection of water charges) and MOA's Department of
Production for agricultural training and Farm Management). The management and engineering consultant



- 39 -
will assist PIU and the Expeditions in establishing a GIS based Performance Monitoring and Evaluation
Information System (PIS) to store and process the data. Initially, the PIS would be prepared for a typical
sub-project such as Chengeldy. Once the GIS database structure and analysis procedures are established,
the PIS can be turned over to monitoring and evaluation units for implementation. The necessary training
and technical assistance would be provided to these units to carry out their tasks.
5.29         Reporting. PIU would prepare: (i) quarterly progress reports on procurement; and
(ii) semi-annual progress reports by December 31 and June 30; copies would be sent to the Bank for
review. The semi-annual reports would include information on: (i) completion rate of on-going works;
(ii) payments made to contractors; (iii) reports on institutional developments (including technical
assistance and training); (iv) an up-dating of the performance indicators; and (v) a report on difficulties
encountered, proposed measures to overcome these and assistance required. An up-dated annual budget
for project implementation will be prepared by October 31 for submission to the Ministry of Finance. A
Project Completion Report would be prepared by the PIU within 6 months of project completion.
M. Bank Supervision
5.30         The supervision plan in Annex V provides details on planned Bank supervision missions.
An assurance was obtained at loan negotiations that a mid-term review of the project would be undertaken
by a joint team from the Bank and MOA prior to October 31, 1999.
N. Accounts and Audits
5.31         Project accounts will be managed by the PIU. The project accounts would identify all
sources and uses of funds, including detailed accounting of the proceeds of the Loan and the operation
of the Special Account. The project account would be audited by an independent auditor, preferably with
an international accounting firm, acceptable to the Bank, and the audit reports would be submitted to the
MOA and to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The audit report would contain
a separate opinion on the operation of the Special Account and the Statement of Expenditure (SOE)
procedure, if utilized.

VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Introduction
6.1              Economic analysis has been used from the outset of project preparation as one of the main
criteria for screening individual investment sub-projects that were included in the Government's original
1991 program of irrigation and drainage works. Other factors included in the screening are technical
feasibility, expected environmental impact and potential for privatization. Based on these criteria, 34
potential sub-projects were identified during preparation and subjected to further economic and financial
analysis that resulted in the list of nine core project, and 13 reserve projects that were considered during
appraisal.
6.2              The economic analysis is an ongoing process that will continue through the final design
and approval stages for each sub-project. Feasibility studies are being updated, final cost estimates are
being prepared and the farms are participating in discussions of investment options and the implications
for project costs and 0 & M. The dynamic nature of the process has already resulted in the elimination
of some sub-projects, design changes for some of the other sub-projects, including changes in irrigation
technology, or in the selection of different areas of rehabilitation and additional changes are likely .i-' One
or two of the projects that currently are in the core program may still be replaced or substantially revised
based on further consultations with farm members.
6.3              In all cases, choices of technology and equipment will be carefully reviewed.  Final
selection of sub-projects for financing will only be made on the basis of satisfactory results of the
economic and financial analyses (at least 12 percent rate of return).
B. The Sub-Projects
6.4              The economic analysis presented here focuses on the nine core projects identified for
construction starts in Year One and Two. Base Investment costs for these sub-projects comprise about
57 percent of base project costs and 70 percent of the base costs for the irrigation and drainage works.
Seven of the nine sub-projects involve comprehensive on-farm irrigation and drainage rehabilitation
(CROIL), and two sub-projects involves rehabilitation of on-farm drainage works only, (Annex W,
Table 1). Five to six sub-projects with investment costs totalling about US$26 million would be selected
from the list of thirteen reserve projects or from other potential sub-projects for implementation beginning
in Year Three. While the thirteen sub-projects have not been included in the analysis presented here,
preliminary economic analysis during preparation and appraisal suggest that they have economic rates of
return in a similar range to the returns for the Year One and Two sub-projects.
14/     An example of the type of changes being made in project design and selection occurred in the Chengeldy sub-project. The original
design proposal included comprehensive irrigation and drainage rehabilitation including pump replacement at a very high investment
cost. In discussion with farm managers and farm members, it became apparent that rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage in another
area of the farm serviced by a different pump would not only reduce investment costs substantially but potentially would increase
benefits as the area under the new scheme had higher yield potential than the original area. The changes also involved a switch from
sprinkler irrigation to lower cost under surface irrigation. On the basis of these discussions, a new scheme was designed, costed and
evaluated for inclusion in the core program.



- 41 -
C. Benefits & Costs
6.5           The primary benefits of the proposed project would be incremental agricultural production
from: (i) increased efficiency in water use in the irrigation sub-projects through improved water delivery
and irrigation practices; (ii) reversing the declines in yields from water logging and salinity build-up
through improved drainage; (iii) expanded area cultivated through reclamation of some abandoned areas;
and (iv) higher agricultural productivity as a result of farmers honing water management skills, adopting
improved cultural practices, and switching to improved varieties and higher value crops. Benefit streams
were derived separately for each sub-project and comprised yield increases, increased area under crop
due to reclamation of abandoned irrigated areas, and in some instances changes in cropping patterns.
6.6           Yields throughout Kazakstan have declined by 12 to 70 percent since 1990 due largely
to the economic crisis that has affected input use, fuel supplies, and equipment availability (paras. 1.7,
3.4). However, for the without-project case, it is assumed that the policy reforms currently being
implemented by the Government will restore the incentive structure facing all farms and quickly reverse
the recent decline in yields. Thus, rather than using the most recent yield data for the with-out project
case, crop yields have been adopted that equal the average levels achieved in the three years prior to
independence.  For the with-project situation the assumptions used are as follows:
-      Comprehensive On-Farm Irrigation and Drainage (eight sub-projects). Yields
are expected to grow by 23 to about 100 percent depending on the crop and sub-
project area, with most yield increases in the 40 to 60 percent range (Annex W,
Table 2). It is assumed that the full yields under with-project conditions would
be achieved in the fifth year, starting from with-out project yields in year one.
*      On-Farm  Drainage Works (two sub-projects).  Incremental production is
expected from two sources. First, without the investment in drainage, yields
would decrease due to increased salinity and water logging. The gradual build-
up in salinity could eventually reduce yields to zero. For the analysis it was
assumed that the without-project yields would decline by one percent per annum
over a ten year period and stabilize thereafter. Second, with improved drainage,
yield increases could be anticipated.  With-project yields were assumed to
increase from 10 to 20 percent depending on the crop over the first five years.
6.7           Aside from yield increases, area under crop is expected to increase by about 10 percent
or 2,200 hectares (Annex W, Table 1). The increase arises through the reclamation of irrigated lands
presently abandoned due to waterlogging and poor drainage. Cropping pattern assumptions in the with-
project case are derived largely from technical and agronomic recommendations for the agro-climatic and
soil conditions found in each sub-project.
6.8           Besides the direct benefits to the sub-projects from the proposed investments, a potentially
significant stream of benefits accruing to a larger segment of the farm sector could come from the pilot
initiatives under the agricultural component.  The benefits from the information generated by the
component are difficult to quantify. But three potential type impacts are foreseen:
*      Direct improvements in productivity and production because of information on
improved technological packages and management practices disseminated through
demonstration plots, and the print and broadcast media.



- 42 -
*      Improved Government services as the pilot initiatives tested under the project
yield information that will enable the Government to design and implement
effective farm support services quickly. In essence, the pilot could accelerate the
learning curve on how to best provide farm services thereby bringing benefits on
-stream from farm restructuring and improved farm management practices faster
than would be the case without the project.
*      A  similar set of benefits would arise from  the institutional component.
Improvements in the capacity of the Government to use participatory approaches
in the planning, design and implementation of public investments in irrigation
could lead to better investment decisions and faster implementation.
6.9           Another set of benefits that are difficult to quantify and often which also accrue to a
larger population than the direct beneficiaries arise from the expected environmental impact of the project.
Namely, the project would: (i) increase water availability down-stream through more efficient water use
on sub-project farms; and (ii) improve water quality and availability through better drainage. Moreover,
the project's interventions to strengthen environment monitoring capabilities could lead to improved
investment decisions where water availability is a dominant factor and better operational decisions related
to water use in existing enterprises where water is an essential input.
6.10          Price and Currency Assumptions. The monetary unit for the analysis is the US Dollar.
Prices for non-traded items are 1995 prices converted to dollars using average exchange rates prevailing
at that time. The prices of non-tradeable goods and services in Kazakstan are expected to increase
significantly in the medium term relative to internationally tradeable goods to correct for the substantial
undervaluation of the real exchange rate of the tenge. The magnitude and timing of the correction is
uncertain. For planning purposes and for the economic and financial projections, it is assumed that local
costs and prices will increase at a rate of 15 percent per annum over the project implementation period
relative to the increases in foreign costs (of importable goods and services) which are assumed to move
in line with the Bank's projections of increases in the Bank's MUV index. Since the analysis focuses on
project starts in the next two years and since project construction for each sub-project is expected to take
two to three years, all local prices have been adjusted from 1995 levels to the year 2000.
6.11          Farm gate prices for tradable commodities were derived by using the World Bank
projections for year 2000 in 1990 constant price, using the G-5 Manufacturing Unit Value Indices for
inflation adjustment (Annex W, Table 3). Prices for non-traded commodities (fruits and vegetables) were
updated using the 1995 prices from local markets and escalated at an annual rate of 15 percent over the
project implementation period. The value of fodder crops is based on the calculation of net returns
estimated from feeding sheep, beef cattle and dairy cows. The value of livestock products used to
estimate the price for fodder units was also based on international market prices.
6.12          Investment Costs. Calculation of investment costs for the economic analysis includes the
full cost of the sub-project investment net of taxes adjusted as discussed above to account for the
anticipated appreciation in the exchange rate for the tenge. (see Annex W, Table 1 for impact of this
adjustment on investment costs). Replacement costs for sprinkler equipment, pumps, flow meters and
hydrants were also included in the analysis. In addition to the civil works and equipment associated with
the rehabilitation of the irrigation works, the costs of the agricultural component were included in the
analysis.

6.13          Operating Costs.  Estimates of input requirements with the project are based on
recommendation of Kazak Research Organizations. These estimates were reviewed and amended during
project preparation to ensure that quantities of labor, seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides are
consistent with the anticipated yield increases. Farm tractor and machinery costs were based on the lines
of equipment needed for 100 ha of each crop, and 1995 prices quoted by the company that supplies the
equipment. 0 & M for on-farm irrigation works were also included.
D. Econoniic Analysis
6.14          Economic rates of return have been calculated for nine of the sub-projects in the core
program. The net benefit and cost streams were then aggregated to arrive at overall calculation for all
nine sub-projects. Costs for the economic analysis includes the full economic cost of reconstruction and
reclamation works, the cost of the agricultural component, and estimated incremental operation and
maintenance charges. The economic costs range from US$850 to US$5,800 per hectare for sub-projects
that include comprehensive irrigation and drainage works. Rates of return for the eleven sub-projects
range from 15 to 54 percent with the overall rate of return for the nine sub-projects estimated at 27
percent with an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. The net present value of the nine projects is
estimated at about US$31 million.

6.15       Switching values were calculated for each sub-project for decreased benefit flows and
increased costs. As would be expected, the sub-projects with relatively low rates of return were the most
sensitive to changes in benefits and investment costs (Table 6.2). Since investment costs can be estimated
with reasonable accuracy and the sensitivity analysis shows that the sub-projects are relatively robust in
face of increased investment costs, the following risk analysis focuses largely on the benefit stream.

E. Risks
6.16          A major risk facing the project is that the expected yield increases will fail to materialize.
The estimated benefit stream for the sub-projects involving comprehensive on-farm rehabilitation of
irrigation and drainage depends to a large extent upon the farms achieving much higher yields. While
the with-project yields assumptions are well below what is technically feasible based on agro-climatic and
soil conditions, results from research stations, and yields in similar conditions elsewhere, they are still
much higher than what was achieved in the past. To realize these higher yields will require an adequate
incentive environment as well as the availability of inputs, fuel, machinery spare parts and financing.
It appears that the government's price marketing and trade reforms are already improving the incentive
structure in agriculture and the government is committed to completing the reform process as quickly as
possible. Also important is the need for information and training in improved technologies, and better
farm and water management practices. The project addresses this issue directly through the agricultural
component which is intended to strengthen farm management and provide information and training on
improved agricultural and water management practices. To test for sensitivity to reduced yields, the with-
project yield assumptions at full development were reduced by 25 percent for the seven sub-projects
involving comprehensive irrigation and drainage. All the sub-projects remained viable under the reduced
yield assumptions (Table 6.3'

6.17          Another risk for the project benefit stream arises from price uncertainty. There are two
issues. First, is the financial risk that government price, trade and marketing policy would continue to
drive a wedge between domestic and world market prices. For the financial analysis, prices were kept
the same as for the economic analysis under the assumption that the current pace of government reform
would be sustained, so that by the time the first year projects are completed in 1998, no significant gap
would remain. The experience during 1995 of apparently significant improvement in farm prices supports
the assumption that domestic markets will become fully integrated with international markets well before
that time.
6.18          The second issue relates to the price levels assumed for the economic and financial
analysis, particularly for crops considered to the non-traded. There is considerable uncertainty about the
magnitude of the expected correction for the undervalued real exchange rate of the tenge (para. 6.10).
In the analysis, it was assumed the prices of non-traded fruits and vegetables would rise faster than the
prices of traded goods. It is possible that because of the relative price changes, commodities such as
fruits and vegetables that are now not traded could potentially become traded. It is also possible that a
production response to higher prices could dampen domestic price increases. To test for such uncertainty,
prices of non-traded fruits and vegetables were held constant at their 1995 level while local investment
costs were inflated at 15 percent per annum throughout the investment period. The results show that one
of the projects with an ERR's near the opportunity cost of capital are sensitive to such price changes and
become unviable (Table 6.3).
6.19          Another financial risk is that Government is unable to provide the estimated $20 million
as its contribution to project costs. The project has been scaled to a level commensurate with likely
availability of Government resources to cover local costs. The Government has also placed a high



- 47 -
priority on such rehabilitation efforts and assurances were obtained at negotiations that adequate budgetary
provisions will be made in the budget.
6.20          An institutional risk arises from the fact that the proposed executing agencies may not
have the capacity to administer such a large and diverse reconstruction effort to the international standards
required. The project would address this risk through two different measures. First, consultants will be
recruited to assist the PIU in overall project management and planning. The consultants will also be
responsible for supervision of construction. Second, the project will provide training to the local
construction agencies expected to participate in the project in bidding procedures, understanding the
bidding documents and arrangements for construction supervision and bid preparation. To assess the
impact of this risk, the overall rate of return was tested for sensitivity to delays in project implementation.
A one year delay in project benefits decreased the ERR from 27 to 19 percent.
F. Financial Analysis
6.21          Financial analysis was undertaken to asses the ability of all the sub-project farms to pay
for the investments in on-farm works. For the analysis, financial prices are assumed to be the same as
economic prices as government price, markets and trade reforms currently implemented are expected to
remove remaining distortions well before construction of works are completed. Investment costs as well
as costs for inputs are adjusted by including the value-added tax and import duties.

- 48 -
6.22             The results show a range in FRR's of 11 to 41 percentL5'. The analysis suggests that sub-
projects at the lower end of the range would find it difficult to pay cost-recovery fees based on full
recovery of investment costs including the value-added tax. However, the Government has decided that
calculations of the cost recovery fee would exclude the value added tax, Moreover, because of expected
externalities arising from the on-farm investments, the Government will set the cost recovery fee rate
between 70 and 80 percent of on-farm investments. Under these assumptions, the financial rates of
returns for all sub-projects would be satisfactory.
15/     Akkumsky is just below the proposed cut off but will be retained in the investment program because of the parallel pilot activities
to be undertaken on the farm with grant financing.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
FARM PRIVATIZATION
1.            A Social Assessment was undertaken by a local private research firm prior to the mission.
The assessment focused primarily on the issues of privatization and participation. There were five main
components to the social assessment. One component, consisting of a series of rapid farm assessments,
was conducted by a Bank social scientist. The other components were undertaken by the local private
research firm: in-depth interviews with the managers of 30 farms being considered for inclusion in the
project; a socio-economic survey of 495 households on 10 of the 30 farms located in 5 oblasts; focus
group discussions in 5 of the 10 farms, each of which has experienced some degree of restructuring; and
an overview of the roles and relationships of other institutional stakeholders at the national, oblast and
district level, particularly the Ministry of Agriculture and the Committee for Water Resources. The
Mission made use of preliminary data from the management interviews and survey; final data will be
available in late July and a full report will be completed thereafter. This brief note concentrates on the
privatization and participation issues that most immediately affect the decision to proceed with project
preparation.
Privatization
2.            Since 1992, 1,700 state farms in Kazakstan have been privatized. The remaining 425
farms are scheduled to be privatized by the early 1996. It is very clear, however, that privatization is
a process, not a discrete event, and formal registration is only the beginning of the process. When the
members of state farms decide on the structure of a new privatized entity or entities and adopt appropriate
by-laws, they take the first step in a longer process that will continue to evolve over time. Consequently,
the proposed project will not influence privatization policies or the implementation of basic policies, but
it will contribute to the evolution of the privatization process and, as appropriate, the subsequent
restructuring of former state farms.
The Formal Process
3.            By all accounts, formal privatization has been a lengthy procedure, largely directed by
officials of the oblast administration under the oversight of the State Committee for Privatization. The
basic process unfolds as follows:
*      before privatization the Committee assesses the value of property on a farm,
allowing for debt, inflation and depreciation, and establishes a standard "land
share" for each farm member that will eventually materialize as a certificate.
*      farm  management generally undertakes an informal consultation process to
establish the basis for consensus on the structure of the new farm, as well as the
allocation of land and property shares.
*      this is formalized in a meeting of the general assembly during which working
members of the farm choose the model of privatization, establish by-laws, decide



- 53 -                                   Annex A
on the allocation of assets--property shares and land certificates--and elect a
manager.
*      distribution arrangements vary--working members receive both property shares
and land certificates; they also decide whether or not to issue land certificates to
"social workers," pensioners and others, as well as a formula for allocation.
*      subject to the decision of the assembly, a manager who has been on the farm
more than 20 years is entitled to receive 10 percent of the land, as well as
temporary use of another 10 percent that can be converted into ownership if
production improves significantly over 5 years.
4.            Farm members actually choose the structure of the newly privatized entity or entities,
sometimes against the recommendation of management.  Through farm  managers, each oblast
administration has promoted a particular model, invariably based on the establishment of a single large
commercial farm that essentially maintains the previous management structure. The oblasts also provide
model by-laws that the farms adapt and submit to the State Committee for approval.
Practice and Results
5.            In practice, administrators have only been partially successful in their attempts to manage
the process. Although most farms adopt the model being promoted by the oblast, the interpretation of
the model varies from one farm to the next and appears to be subject to change over time. That is,
despite the efforts of oblast administrations to limit farm restructuring, it is nevertheless occurring.
Likewise, some farm managers have been elected to remain in their previous positions, but others have
been replaced immediately, generally by a member of the farm. Members of many farms refuse to grant
eligible managers the 10 percent share permitted by decree, even if they retain them. Invariably, the new
farm has an overall management structure that resembles the previous state structure; however the
appearance is somewhat deceptive, as management roles are rapidly evolving in response to new rules
and new clients. Although they have limited choices, farm members ultimately assume an active role in
the deliberations and decisions, frequently surprising managers and officials. Whatever structure is
chosen, members legally are guaranteed the right to exit a larger group and obtain their own share of the
land, and managers are accountable to the membership.
6.            Of the 30 farms subject to management interviews, 22 have already been privatized and
7 more will be privatized before the end of the year. Only one farm, a research farm, is not slated to
be privatized and thus will be excluded from the project. Privatization has taken several forms, most of
which are basically collectives or associations of smaller cooperatives and/or private family units. Each
has retained some elements of the previous management structure either as the management entity or as
an umbrella, coordinating entity. They fall roughly into five categories:
*     joint stock companies (8), in which members receive shares with the right to
dividends, as well as debt obligations, in proportion to their property shares;
operationally members and/or brigades work under an annual contract, which
specifies production obligations as well as the responsibilities of farm
management.



- 54 -                                    Annex A
*      collective enterprises (7), covering a wide spectrum of arrangements from an
aggregate of small units to a large unit which may preserve the former
management structure with the exception that the manager is elected by farm
members; if the latter, land certificates do not relate to specific holdings unless
a member separates from the group and establishes a separate farm.
*      farmers associations (6), which can include individual farms, cooperatives and
farms and combinations; the overall management increasingly provides services,
rather than direction.
*      comrade associations (3), similar to collectives except that individual farmers
execute annual contracts with management and share profits related to effort as
well as success at meeting targets.
*      private enterprises (4), which include both single ownership farms and other
arrangements under which farm members essentially function as employees.
7.            Nineteen of the 30 proposed project farms have already restructured to some degree.
Joint stock companies are the least likely types to restructure. Fourteen of the restructured farms have
a single large unit or association and a number of small units, either individual family farms or small
cooperative units that generally aggregate the holdings of an extended family. The range extends from
a cooperative and 3 small units to an association and 2032 small units. All of the farms that privatized
in 1992 have restructured somewhat; in one case, at least, small family units broke away after two years.
We expect this pattern to become common, but it is still too early to determine whether or not this will
be the case. The other five of the restructured farms have both individual farms, larger units that may
or may not correspond to the previous brigade structure, and an umbrella association.
Assessment
8.            The situation is very fluid. The privatization experience is either recent or emerging on
the proposed farms, and it will take a few years to establish clear patterns. It is too early to expect major
restructuring to be widespread, but it is clear that new management pattems are getting established and
the adoption of one structure does not preclude changing it over time. On balance, the mission concluded
that the environment is basically positive and dynamic. There seems to be a tendency toward greater
variation in type of ownership over time, rather than less, and farm structures will continue to evolve.
Similarly, farm management will become more accountable as farmers get used to making more decisions
and increase their demands on managers.
9.            The first step in the privatization process has been neither as open, informed or
transparent as it could have been, but it is clear that farmers ultimately chose a course for their future
and managers understand what it means to be accountable to their members. Consequently, the important
issue to consider is the future of the privatization and restructuring processes. Next steps will depend
very much on the results of experience, as well as a number of external factors beyond the control of
either farmers or farm managers. Ultimately, the real test of privatization is the extent to which the new
farms, collectives and enterprises are financially viable and improve the standard of living of farmers and
farm members. Further evolution of farms, and more restructuring can be expected to result from either
or both of two scenarios:



- 55 -                                    Annex A
*      a positive experience encourages new farm entrepreneurs to emerge, leading to
the creation of new units that are appropriate scale for local conditions, including
markets; or
*      a negative experience prompts members to break away from larger units to create
subsistence units over which they have some modicum of control, however
limited may be the prospects for future prosperity.
10.           A third scenario poses a particular threat to the privatization process, as well as
restructuring: land consolidation in the hands of a few families or managers. Some farm managers and
brigade leaders have already begun the process of aggregating land certificates in the attempt to create
large operating units or to gain sole ownership. Until a land market develops, and until the economic
situation improves in Kazakstan in general, and on particular farms, both farms and farmers are extremely
vulnerable. Given the legacy of the state farms, it is reasonable to expect cooperative and collective
tendencies to persist among members of the farms, particularly because most of them were actually farm
workers, not farmers; furthermore, even without the state farm legacy, it is unrealistic to expect most
farm workers to become independent farmers. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to expect new farmers to
emerge over time. But until they have gained experience, it is premature to expect most farmers to be
able to make informed choices about their future roles as members of a large group or independent
entrepreneurs. Farners now appear to be subject to exploitation by managers who have better access to
information and real management experience. If farm managers are permitted to take advantage of the
current vulnerability of farm members and consolidate land holdings, this process may be irreversible,
thus precluding other members of the farm from making choices in the future. Our interviews suggest
that farm members are not passive and may be able to resist such exploitation in some places, but this
should not be left to chance. Until the privatization process has matured and people clearly have more
options, efforts to accumulate use right certificates in few hands should be discouraged.
11.           Some concern has been expressed that providing support to farms in Kazakstan,
particularly for longer term assets, would impede further evolution of the farm restructuring process.
This does not appear to be a serious concern for three reasons:
i      First, economic uncertainty currently makes farmers reluctant to be innovative,
thus infrastructural investments that improve irrigation and drainage will enhance
the economic status of the farms and offer new opportunities to farmers. This
will promote further changes, rather than impede them.  The training and
information components of the project will also support this by increasing the
level of skills needed for independent farming.
*      Second, mechanisms that promote participation and ownership, such as the
consultation process to be introduced in the project, will also encourage promote
entrepreneurship and restructuring. This will be included in the project.
*      Finally, irrigation fields are small enough to accommodate restructuring without
requiring additional investment.



- 56 -                                    Annex A
12.           In sum, the proposed project will support the ongoing process of farm restructuring.
Training and Information
13.           Farmers are reluctant to break away from new collective or corporate farms for a number
of reasons: acceptance of existing management forms; lack of management skills that would enable them
to operate new farms; lack of effective marketing structures; lack of operating capital and access to credit;
and limited availability of inputs, spare parts and information. Although marketing, capital and inputs
are critical issues, they are beyond the scope of the project. Farm management is important for the
project, however, as it will affect the potential for increasing agricultural production that is created by
the project. It is also important for the privatization process because management skills will affect the
willingness of individuals or groups to risk establishing new units, as well as the survival of the new units
that are established. The project will develop a number of practical training courses on production and
management issues, demonstrations of improved water management and production technologies and
create broader information dissemination mechanisms. This management training component--both
financial and technical--will support privatization very concretely by assisting new family and small
cooperative farms, as well as larger units that consider restructuring.
Participation
14.           A critical stage of farm privatization is when the farm  (managers and/or farmers)
extricates itself from the web of external controls and assumes responsibility for all aspects of farm
operations, undertaken either individually or collectively.  To strengthen the process of sharing
responsibility the mission developed a multi-step consultation process to incorporate into the project
design and implementation plan. This will engage both farmers and managers in making decisions and
assuming responsibility for farm assets to be affected by the project. This iterative consultation process
will broaden the prevailing concept of farm management and will contribute significantly, although
indirectly, to making further steps in the privatization process more open, more transparent, and more
informed.
Water User Associations
15.           The current management structure on most farms is adequate to deal with water-related
issues without requiring the creation of new organizations. However, as farms restructure, water user
associations will be useful to fill institutional gaps. Appropriate models for Kazakstan will be developed
under the PPF that build on and strengthen community bonds. The project will then launch pilot efforts
on farms already restructured to test and refine the models.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN
IWGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
OVERVIEW OF INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Organization of the Sector
1.           A number of ministries, agencies, and organizations are responsible for managing and
administering the water resources and environmental policies effecting the water and irrigation sectors
in the Republic of Kazakstan. Since 1991, with the transition to a market economy, a number of
organizational and structural changes have taken place within the Government.  The Ministry of
Reclamation and Water Management was eliminated in 1991 and replaced by the Committee on Water
Resources. The Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources (MOEB) was established in 1992 as the
successor to the State Commnittee on Ecology and Nature Use and the Ministry of Forestry. Other changes
may be expected in response to changing demands on the Government. The major institutions of the
Government of Kazakstan concerned with the irrigation sector include:
*     Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the
development of agricultural policy.; implementation of a program for the
development of the agro-industrial complex; preparation of an investment policy
for agriculture; promoting the rational use of farm lands; registration and
management of the Land Fund. There are 16 subdivisions and 40 lower divi-
sions in MOA throughout the Republic. Under the umbrella of MOA there are
regional and district agricultural agencies funded by local budgets, union associ-
ations, and numerous related but independent organizations.
-     Kazak Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The Kazak Academy of Agricultural
Sciences contains 32 scientific institutes, which conduct research on resources
related to agriculture, including forest management, range management, fisheries
development, water management, and agro-economics.
*     Ministry of Geology and Protection of Underground Resources (MOG). The
Ministry is the key state authority in the field of geological prospecting and
protection of the underground resources, including water; sector policy-making
and programming; licensing of underground resources; and enforcement of
relevant legislation.
*     Committee for Water Resources (CWR). Its main responsibilities are to main-
tain and operate the existing interfarm system for delivery of irrigation and rural
drinking water through regional and district water resource committees; control
the quantity and quality of water through the supervision of eight river basin
water management agencies; set national water management policies; and
administer international river systems with respect to water sharing.
*     Water Management Design Institutes. There are a number of design institutes
in Kazakstan with experience in the planning and design of irrigation and



- 58 -                                    Annex B
drainage projects. Most of these are now joint stock companies still depending
on the State as a client. The capability of these institutes has been greatly
reduced over the last several years because of a lack of funds. Kazgiprovodkhoz
(DI) is the former central water management design institute for Kazakstan and
still works closely with the Committee on Water Resources. Most of the regional
institutes have been placed under administrative control of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
*      Construction Organizations. There are general contract construction organiza-
tions known as industrial unities (ICU) in each of the oblasts. Production and
construction capabilities of these organizations have been cut way back. These
former state construction companies are in transition from ownership by the State
Committee for Property to private joint stock companies. They all have a similar
organizational structure that includes a mobile mechanized fleet, a production
engineering department, a specialized section for start up and fabrication, and
separate plants for production and fabrication. Each region has facilities for
producing prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and metal works.
Although there are several cement factories and a pressure pipe factory in
Kazakstan, many items such as pvc drainage pipe, pumps, and irrigation
sprinkler equipment were manufactured in Russia.
*      Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources (MOEB). It is an environmental
policy planning, management, monitoring and enforcement agency mandated to
promote the protection and rational use of natural resources. The Ministry is
responsible for EA environmental protection and rational state control for use of
natural resources that includes land resources, soil, water, forests, wildlife and
fisheries. MOEB establishes and administers limits on use of natural resources;
issues and regulates licenses and permits; determines acceptable limits on waste
products and regulates their discharge in terms of quality and location; reviews
the standards and limits established by other agencies; and assesses the environ-
mental effects of projects and programs, prior to their construction or recon-
struction.
-      Committee on Forestry (CF) is responsible for forestry policy making, program
development forest cadastre and standard setting; forest protection and refores-
tation, developing economic incentives and mechanisms for forest protection and
use.
*      Hydrometeorological Service (HS). The Hydromet is the principal authority in
the field of hydrometeorology and pollution monitoring, including weather,
water, soil, climate, etc. forecasting for agricultural purposes, conducting
weather modification activities and keeping an environmental pollution data bank.
*      Ministry of Construction, Architecture and Housing. The Department of Non-
Agency Expertise under this Ministry has responsibility to enforce construction
norms and standards in all construction activities. The Ministry reviews all



- 59 -                                  Annex B
projects involving new construction and rehabilitation of existing facilities to
ensure that Government standards and norms are met.
*     Ministry of Health (MOH). State Sanitary-Epidemiological Service (SanEpid)
under the MOH has the responsibility for standards setting determining, preven-
tion and mitigation of negative impacts of environrnental pollution on human
health.
*     State Committee on Land Relations and Organization of LAnd Use (SCLR).
SCLR is the main government agency entrusted with developing and implement-
ing unified state policy on land management and ensuring land reform in the
country. Other responsibilities include: state control for use and protection of
land, land monitoring and state land cadastral, preservation and rehabilitation of
soil fertility.
*     State Council on Ecology (SCE). SCE was created in 1993 in order to ensure
cross-sectoral coordination on environmental issues and enforcement of imple-
mentation of environmental protection activities and legislation. Unfortunately,
the Government resolution remained mainly on paper.
*     Ministry of Economy. This Ministry is responsible for preparing, approving,
and recommending technical projects for government funding. The State Price
Committee which sets the level of prices for sale of commodities to the State is
located in this Ministry.
Legal Framework
2.            There are a number of special codes and separate laws on water. However there has
never been any legal arbitration dealing with the water laws, regulations or codes. Some of the major
laws and codes involving the water resource and agriculture sectors include Law "On Environmental
Protection" (June 1991) which establishes state ownership of the natural resources, including land, water,
minerals, forests and wildlife; "Water Code" (March 1993) with the purpose of regulating water for
domestic industrial and agricultural use and to ensure meeting environmental requirements; "Forestry
Code" (January 1993) which describes the aims and scope of forestry legislation and introduces the
concept of forest fund and forest fund lands and clearly states that forests are exclusive property of the
Republic; decree on "Land" (December 1995) which elaborates on land ownership and classifies lands
depending on the purpose of their use; Law " On Land Reform in Kazakstan" (June 1991) which states
the objectives and conditions for land reform and its major directions; "Code on Underground Resources
and Processing of Mineral Raw Materials" (May 1992) which defines underground resources as State
property; and the Law "On Sanitary-Epidemiological Well-being of the Population" (July 1994) which
declares the right of the people for healthy environment and establishes administrative, disciplinary,
material and criminal liability for violation of Sanepid legislation.
Law "On Enviromnental Protection" June 18, 1991
3.            This is the umbrella environmental legislation in the country. The law establishes state
ownership of the natural resources, including land, water, minerals, forests and wildlife. The law



- 60 -                                    Annex B
mandates SEE for proposed development programs and projects to ensure environmental sustainability
and provides for public participation.
4.            Three types of environmental protection instruments are provided by the law: a permit
system; emission standards (for air and water pollution and waste disposal); pollution fees and fines for
use of natural resources and emission of pollutants.
5.             Liability for environmental damage is supported by a provision of the following sanctions:
disciplinary; administrative; civil and criminal.
"Water Code" March 31, 1993
6.            The aim  of the water legislation is to regulate water for domestic industrial and
agricultural use and to ensure compliance with environmental requirements. Regulations on pollution
prevention and water conservation are stipulated. Principles of state registration and planning of water
consumption, settlement of disputes and violations are included. Water resources are in the exclusive
property of the state. Priority water use is for drinking and communal purposes. It is prohibited to put
irrigation and drainage systems into operation without adequate measures designed to mitigate waterlog-
ging, flooding, salinization, erosion, etc. as well as without installation of relevant hydro-technical
facilities. The payment for water use is introduced. There are two types of water use: general and
special. Water quality and quantity protection is given high priority.
"Forestry Code" January 23, 1993
7.            The code describes the aims and scope of forestry legislation and introduces the concept
of forest fund and forest fund lands. It is clearly stated that forests are in the exclusive property
(ownership) of the Republic, but there are also provisions for different forms of ownership of forest land
plots. Reforestation, forest protection, enhancing forest productivity and sustainable forest management
are amnong major responsibilities of the forest land owners. Vertical and horizontal levels of forest
management authority are being established in the code. Different types of forest utilization and users
are defined as well as forests are being divided into two categories. Forest which have mainly protective
functions, including watershed protection, soil and wind erosion protection, greenbelts, etc., are in the
first category. Requirements for commercial forest harvesting relationships, financing of forest sector,
conducting forest cadastre and forest monitoring are being defined in this legislation. Liabilities for
violation of forestry legislation, dispute resolution and superiority of international legislation are
established. [Payments to reimburse for losses of forest production and when forest covered lands are
taken away from their prime purpose of use are also introduced].
"Land Code" December 22, 1995
8.            The new land code defines various categories of property rights, the circumstances and
procedures for granting and transferring these rights and the role of the state in the process. Passage of
the land code is an important step in securing rights to lands and providing the framework for the
development of a land market. Land protection is considered to be one of the priorities and requires
control, monitoring and enforcement.



- 61 -                                    Annex B
Law "On Land Reform in Kazakstan" June 28, 1991
9.            The law states the objectives and conditions for land reform and its major directions;
establishes a special land fund to be formed on the basis of unallocated land or land unsuitable for
agricultural production; determines the ways and types of privatization of agro-industrial enterprises. It
also provides for establishing rural settlements' boundaries and documentation necessary to ensure land
ownership.
"Code on Underground Resources and Processing of Mineral Raw Materials " May 30, 1992
10.           This legislation provides only for state property for underground resources including
water; defines various types of their utilization and describes institutional responsibilities in the sector;
mandates protection of underground resources and payments for their use; sets requirements for
geological prospecting, licensing, design and construction, processing, state registration system, leasing
rights; supports public participation, safety measures and protection of human health. It also provides
for expert review and analysis of relevant projects and data; enforcement and liabilities for violation of
the legislation.
Law "On Sanitary-Epidemiological Well-being of the Population" July 8, 1994
11.           This law is intended to further support the law "On Protection of Health of Kazakstan
People" and declares the right of the people for healthy environment. It makes prevention of negative
environmental health impacts a priority; mandates compensation for health damages and calls for greater
openness of information. It describes institutional structure as well as responsibilities and authority of
different levels of management in the sub-sector. The law mandates sanitary-epidemiological expertise
(review) and defines its goals, objects and process; public san-epid expertise (review) is also instituted.
The san-epid requirements for economic development, including project design work and construction
of different facilities; food products and use of agro-chemicals; water supply and sanitation; utilization
of wastes, and emergency situations are provided in this legislation. The law establishes administrative,
disciplinary, material and criminal liability for violation of san-epid legislation.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKsTAN
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF SUB-PROJECTS FOR YEARS ONE AND Two
A. Sub-Projects for Year One
Chingeldy Joint Stock Company (Pump Station #2), Chengeldy Massif, Talgar District, Almaty
Oblast.
1.           Comprehensive reconstruction of 2,368 ha of on-farm irrigation systems and 600 ha of
new drainage for the same area on one farm. At present 150 ha are out of production because of salinity
and water logging. The system was originally constructed in 1975 and is located 40 km from
Kapchagai. Major crops are onions, vegetables and fodder crops. Water is currently pumped out of
Kapchagai Reservoir from pump station No. 2. The pump station has sufficient pressure but insufficient
discharge capacity to serve the full 2,368 ha. Proposed work includes reconstruction of the pump station
(5 pumps), partial replacement and reconstruction of the two parallel main pipelines (3.5 km / 7 krm), and
partial replacement and rehabilitation of the existing ferrocement flume distribution system. A small night
storage reservoir is being proposed. Polyethylene closed pipeline systems are to be constructed to
deliver water to the fields. It is expected that the system will remain under surface irrigation. Land
leveling will be carried out where required. Drainage works will include construction of subsurface field
drains (150 m to 200 m spacing) and closed collectors. Drainage flows will be managed using a
combination of reuse and recycling, evaporation ponds and discharge into Kapachagai Reservoir.
Kyzi-Agash JSC, Kopalskiy District, Taldy Korgan Oblast
2.           On-farm irrigation reconstruction on 1,415 ha . The system was a non-technical system
originally constructed in the mid 1960's and is located 49 km from Taldy Korgan. Major crops are
potatoes, vegetables, sugar beets, and fodder crops. Water is to be diverted from the Kyzi-Agash River
at a location 10 km downstream from the newly constructed Kyzl-Agash Reservoir completed in 1990.
The diversion structure originally designed to serve 7,800 ha was started in 1991 but never completed
because of lack of funds. A 2 km inter-farm closed pipeline system (two pipes; diameter 400 mm) will
convey irrigation water. Proposed work includes upgrading the surface irrigation by replacing the
existing earth network with a closed pipe system under gravity pressure and providing hydrant turnouts
down to 15 ha. Surface drainage water is discharged into local depressions.
Verfical Drainage, Golodnaya Steppe, Makhtaral District, South Kazakstan Oblast
3.           Rehabilitation of 70 vertical drainage wells on 7,777 ha out of 43,288 ha. This area was
selected because of salinity problems. The system was originally constructed between 1968 and 1972 and
is located 40 km from Tashkent. Major crop is cotton. Average depth of wells is 60 m (average drain
discharge is 40-601/s) each serving, 110 ha. Drainage return flows will average 41.2 MCM/year.
Proposed work includes replacing existing wells with new wells, including drilling of new wells,
installing piping, access roads, dismantling old wells, and providing new power lines. All drainage will

4.            Reconstruction of 835 ha of an on-farm irrigation system and construction of new
drainage on 498 ha for a separate area which already has 50 ha of existing drainage. At present 663 ha
are out of production because of salinity and alkalinity. The system was originally constructed in 1980
and is located 90 km from Karagandar. Major crop are potatoes and fodder crops. Water is pumped from
the Irtysh-Karagandar Canal and conveyed through a closed pipe system (a maximum of 10 km) to several
booster pumps. Proposed work includes replacing the main above ground steel pipeline with buried pipe
(8.7 km), replacing the thin walled steel pipe distribution system with concrete and steel pipes, and
replacing side roll with center pivot sprinkler systems for 835 ha. Subsurface drainage works (60-100 m
spacing) are to be constructed on 448 ha, including rehabilitation of drainage on 50 ha. A closed
collector system will convey water to Kokebai and Gayazurkin Rivers.
Akkumnsky Farn (Pilot Demonstration Rotation Block #6), Dzhalagash District, Kzyl Orda Oblast
5.            A two field rice and 4 field lucerne rotation is to be introduced on 1,069 ha. This block
now has six crop turn rotation fields that rotate three rice and three lucerne crops. Original system was
constructed in 1963 and is located 60 km from Kyzl Orda. Water is diverted from the Syr Darya River
at the KyzI Orda diversion barrage into the Left Bank Main Canal and conveyed to the Akkumsky farm
turnout. Proposed irrigation works include rehabilitation and partial lining of the existing earth canal on-
farm delivery system and reconstruction of the existing on-farm collector drain system. Drains will
discharge into the North Collector Drain (Left Bank).

7.           Comprehensive reconstruction 1, 144 ha and new drainage on 654 ha of this same area.
The new works are within the boundaries of the existing irrigation system. No area is out of production
because of salinity and water logging at this time. The system was originally constructed in 1941 and
is located 10 km from Chu. Major crops are sugar beats, vegetables, melons and lucerne. Water is
diverted from the Chu River 8 km below Tashutkul Reservoir at the Tashutkul Diversion works, into
the Right side main canal (unlined; serving 3,805 ha) to one of the four on-farm turnouts which serve
Dzhambyl JSC Farm serving 654 ha. The Tashutkul Main Canal, a separate source of water diverting



- 72 -                                  Annex I
directly from Tashutkul Reservoir delivers water to an on-farm turnout which serves 480 ha on Dzhambyl
JSC Farm. Proposed work includes providing lining and constructing parabolic flumes for the existing
irrigation distribution system and upgrading and constructing new works to provide surface irrigation
down to 15 ha. Drainage works will include construction of 6 vertical wells up to 40 m depth, with an
average discharge of 50 I/s, and serving an area from 75 to 160 ha. and /or closed horizontal drainage.
Closed collectors will be constructed to convey the drainage flows back to the Chu and Kookiest Rivers.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT
1.           To justify the investments in irrigation and drainage rehabilitation in a large number of
large-scale farming enterprises, the economic productivity of these farms have to be increased. To this
end, an Agricultural Development Component, as reflected by the proposed "Farmers' Participatory
Training and Information Services Pilot Program", has been included in the IDIP Project to intensify and
improve present agricultural production systems and facilitate even further the commercialization and
privatization of those farms which have been selected for rehabilitation of their irrigation and/or drainage
systems. Under this pilot, an embryonic extension service in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) will be
set up and tested through a "Farmers Information Services Desk", which will eventually reach a much
broader agricultural community through video, radio, TV, technical brochures and a 'Farmers' Weekly"
paper editions in Russian and Kazak languages.
2.           It is foreseen that after the pilot phase, a national Agricultural Services Project might be
developed, covering not only irrigated, but rainfed agriculture and rangelands management as well. Under
this follow-up project, it is anticipated that a more farmers' oriented (public and private) agricultural
research and extension services system would emerge.
3.           The main elements and base project costs of the Farmers' Participatory Training and
Information Services Pilot Program, are:
(a     Participatory Training: US$180,000;
(b)    Demonstrations: US$160,000;
(c)    Farmers' Information Services: US$470,000; and
(d)    Consultancy Services: US$1,125,000.
Farmers' Participatory Training and Information Services Pilot Program
4.            The program consists of three main activities: (a) training of specific target groups, in
various agro-technical fields and commercial farm management; (b) demonstration of improved and
modern technologies to increase production, improve water use efficiencies and reduce environmental
degradation; and (c) provide relevant information through different means (pamflets, video's, radio, tv,
weekly papers) to farmers to advise them how to make their farms more productive and more sensitive
to emerging market demands.
5.            For this last aspect, a Farmers' Information Services Desk will be set up in MOA.
Participatory Training
6.            The training program and information services should be oriented towards solving farmers
problems and to facilitate the privatization and commercialization of the farms. Such training is not
currently provided by the traditional education institutes and requires therefore special training of the
trainers. Therefore the training program will start with the "Training of Trainers" from MOA, the



- 74 -                                   Annex J
Kazakstan Institute of Management Economics and Strategic Research (KIMEP), Universities, and other
institutes and participating individuals. A selected group of individuals, as well as the consultant's local
counterpart staff, will be trained in modern training approaches and methodologies by the project
consultants, in order to become "Facilitators" and "Trainers of other Trainers" at the same time. Under
the supervision of the Project's Implementation Unit (PIU), local technical staff and consultants of MOA
and the former Academy of Agriculture Science (AAS), now under the National Academy of Sciences,
and with the assistance of international training and farm management consultants, the necessary training
modules for the four identified target groups will be developed and used by the "Trainers" and
consultants themselves. These modules will be mainly elective short courses and to be modified when
necessary to suit the participants' needs best. Initially the primary responsibility for the quality of the
training program will be with the consultants, assisted by PIU and relevant training counterpart staff in
MOA. This responsibility, however, will be gradually transferred within two years to a more permanent
training set-up/unit within MOA .
7.            The four target groups and their specific training needs are:
(a)    National. Oblast and Raion government staff involved in the project will be
receiving the necessary basic orientation and training to implement the project
successfully and assist farms in their efforts to become more economic farm
enterprises and thereby making agricultural production more sustainable under
the prevailing conditions, and helping the process of farm restructuring;
(b)    Farm Directors and Managers of Joint-Ventures and Cooperatives in the project
will receive training specifically in commercial farm management, accounting and
agro-business and be subjected to discussions on case studies how to start their
own private business in the presently non existing agricultural inputs/outputs and
marketing services sector. This target group is considered to have the most
potential candidates for establishing such a private agricultural services sector in
Kazakstan. In some parts of the country, some farm managers are already
attempting to realize this approach by establishing national and international
market contacts and organizing the collection and transportation of wheat, milk
and onions (Chengeldy) to the prospective clients;
(c)    Technical Farm and Production Specialists, Brigade Leaders in the project will
receive extra training on the application and transfer of improved and new
technologies to farmers to increase production in sustainable ways and will be
subjected to discussions on how to establish their own private agricultural
consultancies. It is expected that members out of this target group will form the
source of specialists for the eventual private and public extension services in the
country; and
(d)    Individual Private Farmers and Farm  Workers will be the biggest group
benefitting from the participatory training. Since most individuals from this group
have mainly high school education and only limited skills as farm hands, tractor
drivers, herds men, milkers, mechanics etc. they need the broadest training in
technical crop and livestock production and basic farm management. In the short
term, they would remain dependent on the advisory services of the technical



- 75 -                                    Annex J
specialists and the Farmers Information Desk Services of the MOA. Eventually,
independent private farmers would emerge from this group, while others would
be quite happy to remain farm hands or otherwise. For this group, short training
courses of several weeks each would be channelled as much as possible through
existing agricultural training facilities in winter time and "on-farm" evening or
week-end classes in summer time. They would particularly benefit from the
scheduled on-farm demonstrations.
Training Courses
8.            The specific special Training Courses, number of beneficiaries and their costs for the
various groups as described above are shown in Tables 1 to 3 for three consecutive years from 1996/97
to 1998/99. These tables provide a menu of courses from which the most relevant ones will be selected
for the various different groups of beneficiaries.  It is envisaged that at the end of two years of
implementation and monitoring, the whole training program and its costs will be reviewed in a workshop
organized by the consultants (before their departure) with MOA/PIU, to include lessons learnt by that
time and to make the program more applicable to reach a larger segment of the farming communities,
specialists and agricultural entrepreneurs. This updated training program could then become part of a
possible national Agricultural Services Project. Under the IDIP project, however, it should be realized
that the three elements of training, demonstrations and information services will be totally integrated into
one approach and action plan towards the participating farmers in the project, and in coordination and
synchronization with the implementation schedule of the irrigation and drainage rehabilitation activities
in the sub-projects.
9.            The total base training costs over three years, including those for travel/transportation.
accommodation, meals, training materials and local trainers fees (US$20/day), have been calculated on
the basis of the cost estimates in Table 4, while for new training equipment an additional US$36,000 is
required. Tables 4 and 5 indicate the separate training costs per person day and the training equipment
items to be procured. However, most training activities will be carried out under the ministry's regular
training program and where possible charged to the beneficiaries, thus reducing the training costs to the
project considerably to about US$144,000. In cases where farmers are not able to pay for the special
course expenditures, the ministry will bear the extra costs under the project up to US$144,000. including
the fees for 2000 trainer-days. In total some 46,000 beneficiaries are targeted for special training under
the project. MOA would also be responsible for the provision of transport, where necessary. Under the
project, the ministry will be reimbursed by the Bank for the above mentioned extra costs on the basis of
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs), while the procurement of additional training equipment will be done
locally by PIU on the advise of the consultants.
Demonstrations
10.           As part of the technical training and to increase production, new and improved local crop
production technologies for major crops (cereals, sugarbeet, onion, maize, sunflower or other oilcrop,
potato) will be demonstrated in selected sub-projects and on demonstration farms. The objective of the
demonstrations is to teach farmers to evaluate improved practices/machineries and become more self
reliant and commercially oriented. These demo's would make use of special equipment (local improved
and imported) already introduced and (partly) fabricated by the private sector in some parts of the
country, including the use of the latest generation of fuel efficient 4WD tractors. In some cases, private



- 76 -                                  Annex J
companies might be invited to demonstrate new production technologies. It is estimated that some 50
demos of 10 ha each (to a total of 500 ha) will be organized over three years (e.g. 10-18-22), applying
economic optimal rates of agricultural inputs of fertilizers, seeds, agro-chemicals and fuel. Better on-farm
water management practices will also be demonstrated, including some improved sprinkler components.
Table 6 shows the estimated base costs of production inputs per ha for various crops, which vary from
US$1 10/ha for cereals to US$2,275/ha for potatoes. Assuming that the onion and potato demonstrations
will be carried out on a much more limited scale as compared to the other crops, the average base costs
of production inputs per demonstration of 10 ha is estimated at US$3,200 or some US$160,000 for 50
demonstrations over 3 years. Where justified, demo's can be smaller or larger than 10 ha. Extra financial
benefits to the farms, as a result of the demonstrations, will be ploughed back and used by the farms
themselves for further adoption of the technology in the subsequent years' and to gradually buy the
recommended equipment and crop production inputs.
11.          The demonstration plan for each year indicating what type of demo and how many will
be where executed, will be drafted and monitored by the consultants and training team, together with
PIU. These plans will be developed in consultation with the sub-project Farm Boards and WUAs, who
will then execute the demo's themselves as much as they are able to do. In other cases, some farms may
need more direct assistance from the consultants and MOA to set up a viable demo. PIU/MOA,
however, will remain responsible for making available the necessary demo equipment and for the
procurement of the necessary production inputs as recommended by the team. The consultants will also
be responsible to organize "Farmers Field Days" on the demonstration sites in consultation with the
farmers concerned and those nearby. These field days should be held at least once per cropping season
at the most appropriate time to maximize the demonstration effect of the practices recommended and
shown. At these field days, the demo's will be evaluated in comparison with existing practices and
analyzed for their cost-benefit ratios. New successful practices should be widely publicized by MOA's
Farmers Information Services Desk through the common news media and "Farmers' Weekly" news paper
editions for broader adoption. Farm demo production inputs will be procured through prudent local or
international shopping.
Farmers Information Services Desk
12.          In conjunction with the training and demonstration components, there is a crucial need
for farmers' information on many agricultural issues, in particular by emerging farmers. Up till now,
however, this information has not been readily available and accessible by the smaller private farmers,
in particular information on more efficient crop and livestock production technologies, farm management
and accounting practices and market information. Most information in the past came from research
institutes directly to the farm directors and specialists, who applied the recommendations by order of the
State. However with the on-going privatization and farm restructuring, the need for broader and more
farmers' and markets' oriented information has increased considerably. To meet this need, MOA will
establish a central farmers' information services desk under the project to provide regular information
on critical agricultural issues related to production and marketing through the existing news media of TV,
radio, video, brochures and "Farmers' Weekly" paper editions.
13.          The agro-technical topics and contents (copy) for the broadcasts and papers will be
generated by the consultants and technical specialists of MOA and staff of agricultural research institutes,
who will pass it on to the newly established Information Services Desk and the MOA Press Center. This
center has already experience in providing TV and Radio broadcasting to farmers and is very eager to



- 77 -                                    Annex J
participate in the Project. It also prepares press releases on behalf of MOA. Under the project, page space
will be bought for the "Farmers' Weekly" edition on a weekly basis for three years from the two (poorly)
existing private agricultural papers "Selskaya Nov" (Rus.) and "Auyl" (Kaz.), which are now sold in
only limited numbers (resp. 18,000 and 3,000 copies/week). It is foreseen to distribute these papers to
all agricultural education schools as well to be used as training material. Eventually sufficient agricultural
information will be readily available to farmers so that these papers do not need direct support from MOA
any longer but take over the full responsibility of publishing all the demanded farmers' information
themselves.
14.           Under this component special equipment (estimated at US$30,000) is required to upgrade
the present MOA Press Center's facilities, including those for the preparation of video's and technical
bulletins. Table 7 shows the breakdown of requirements and base costs to a total of US$470,000 over
three years. Training videos will be prepared locally, reflecting the basic thrust of the training program
and broadcasted through MOA's regular agricultural transmission hours. The procurement of all the
equipment and materials will be carried out through Local Competitive Bidding procedures by the
consultants with the assistance of PIU.
Technical Assistance and Consultants Requirement
15.           To implement the Farmers' Participatory Training and Information Services Program, the
PIU is assisted for two years by international farm management and agricultural training consultants and
local specialists or consultants. Under the project a total of US$1.1 million will be available to cover the
base costs for some 50 foreign and 250 local consultants man-months to implement the Pilot Program.
The consultants will be fully responsible for all the training, demos and technical farmers' information
services within the first two years of the project, after which the responsibility for the daily
implementation of the program is transferred to MOA and the consultants. Local specialists/consultants
may be subcontracted in consultation with PIU under Kazak salary guidelines, norms and conditions.
The foreign lead consultants will also be responsible to train their local counterpart consultants and
continue to provide their services up till the end of the second year of the project. Table 8 gives a
breakdown of the expected foreign and local technical expertise required.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL SUB-COMPONENT
A.    Institutional Development and Training
Institutional Development and Strengthening
I .           Environmental Assessment (EA) is a process by which alternatives, environmental impacts
and costs associated with development programs or investment projects are identified, analyzed ahd
evaluated. On the basis of this analysis, monitoring and mitigation measures are usually proposed for
incorporation into the design of such programs and projects. EA is best carried out early in the planning
and design phases of development programs and projects, allowing time to make design changes and to
explore environmentally cost-effective alternatives.
2.            While project-specific EA is used to examine the environmental impacts of specific
investment projects,  sectoral EA is used in designing sector investment projects and programs,
particularly for examining investment alternatives, policy changes, and institutional aspects of a given
sector. Sectoral EA may cover some of the requirements of project-specific EA; however, projects and
sub-projects also need project specific EA to address any important issues not covered by the sector EA.
3.            Kazakstan has no previous experience in conducting either project-specific or sectoral EA
for agricultural development, including irrigation and drainage.  The country still uses the FSU
environmental, design and construction standards.
4.            The Kazakstan law "On Environmental Protection" provides the broad legal basis for State
Ecological Expertise( SEE) (review). The legal framework and practical adaptation of Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA), which should serve together with the project design as the basis for the SEE
is still not mandatory and inadequate ; in fact, it does not exist for the agricultural sector. There is a lack
of environmental institutional capacity in the MOA on the federal, oblast (provincial) and local levels as
well as lack of implementation coordination and enforcement of EIA and SEE recommendations. In the
lack of clear EIA/SEE legislation, procedures and guidelines, the MOEB fills in the gaps by issuing
directives, the applicability and validity of which are not always clear. To eliminate the shortcomings
of the existing situation, clear rules as well as institutional capacity in the sector for environmental
management, including EIA, are urgently needed.
5.            The project objectives are to: (i) support introduction of applicable legal practice of EA
(EIA/SEE) adopted in foreign countries by developing EA procedures, guidelines and manuals relevant
for the agricultural sector, and irrigation and drainage in particular; (ii) assist the MOA to build-up its
internal environmental institutional capacity on the federal level; (iii) establish and strengthen procedural
arrangements for implementation of EA (EIA/SEE); and (iv) work out procedures for cross-sectoral
coordination of implementation and enforcement of EA (EIA/SEE) requirements.

Training
6.            This sub-component is intended to develop and expand the professional skills and
capacities of the staff both in public and private organizations involved in implementing the project. It
will create a critical mass of well-educated environmental professionals at various levels and institutions,
who would share a common understanding and jointly contribute to the environmentally sustainable
modernization of the irrigation and drainage sub-sector.
7.            Participants in the training program will include: (i) managers, irrigation/drainage and
environmental staff, and farmers. The training' will comprise: (a) one annual course of one week
duration for national/provincial managers, irrigation/drainage and environmental technical staff. The
purpose of these courses is to upgrade existing knowledge and to introduce new concepts about
environmentally sustainable agriculture, including irrigation and drainage; (b) short courses, seminars,
and study tours to be offered by national institutions; (c) a series of one-day courses on various aspects
of irrigation and drainage such as environmental management and economics, monitoring, EIAs, water
management, maintenance, problem solving, etc.; (d) field days for farmers. These would promote
modern on-farm irrigation and drainage technologies and increase farmers awareness of environmentally
sustainable good water and integrated pest management practices. The field days will be organized by
provincial environmental coordinating units. Maximum use will be made of the pilot and research
projects, EIA and other relevant manuals.
8.            The overall design and coordination of the training and professional development program
will be under the responsibility of the PIU, which with the help of the MOA and the MOEB which could
contract for the services of established training institutions and universities in Kazakstan. A team of
international and national experts will develop the content of curriculums and training materials for the
different courses.
Environmental Assessment (EA)
9.            EA, as it is known in international practice, is not generally carried out in a unified way
in the Republic of Kazakstan. The legal framework, regulating its application as well as its procedures,
are ambiguous. Consequently, the following could hinder the cooperation between the Bank and the
Republic of Kazakstan with respect to the Bank's rather extensive medium-term lending program: (i) the
lack of knowledge of internationally practiced EA procedures in general, and the Bank's EA requirements
in particular; (ii) incompatibilities between the EA procedures used by the Bank and Kazakstan regarding
classification of projects; and (iii) differences in the timing of EA in the respective project planning
cycles.
10.           For this reason, it was agreed by the Bank and the Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources
(MOEB), that an Environmental Assessment Harmonization Seminar (EA Seminar) (3 days) will be
organized in Almaty with participation from the Bank, MOEB, sector ministries, Government, Parliament
MOA, and non-government organizations (NGOs).
Monitoring indicators for the training program will be developed and listed in the PIP. Details of the
training program will be prepared during the bridging operation and agreed upon during appraisal.



- 92 -                                    Annex K
11.           The objectives of the EA Seminar are to (i) improve the understanding of the environ-
mental, economic and social issues involved in EA; (ii) provide an overview of the Bank's generic and
technical principles and procedures concerning EA; (iii) review the present legislation, regulations and
procedures of the Republic of Kazakstan to determine areas of future cooperation and assistance; (iv)
discuss ways to avoid delays in project processing in various lending sectors; and (v) carry out cross-
sectorial discussions of EA issues.

12.           Activities to be implemented under these programs will be of importance for project
implementation and supervision and will support environmental quality monitoring, data collection and
analysis, feasibility and EIA work, project design, performance monitoring, etc.
13.           Under the current situation in Kazakstan, physical and professional capacity of agricultural
and environmental agencies is deteriorating fast. Relevant agencies are suffering from under-funding and
under-staffing. Therefore, considerable strengthening effort is urgently required. This will be achieved
through staff training, as described above, and operational support such as for laboratory and electronic
equipment, vehicles and chemicals for analysis.
14.           It is also of great importance to evaluate current environmental monitoring programs
(surface and ground water, soil, etc.), management systems, standards and methods used for
enviromnental analysis and their relevance for the project, and provide advice for necessary adjustments.
15.           Implementation of this program will substantially increase the responsibilities and the
work-load of the offices of the agricultural and environmental agencies involved. Although the Bank
would not finance all related costs, a review of the work program would be undertaken during the
bridging period. Any new tasks may require additional qualified staff and funds, including salaries,
travel, operation and maintenance, and office supplies. Government's commitment will be sought that
the necessary budget allocations will be made available.
16.           Activities under this sub-component will also require: (i) strengthening and coordination
of cost-effective regional water/soil quality monitoring systems and establishment of new monitoring
stations or field sampling where necessary; (ii) Provisions of four different types of equipment: (a)
equipment for agro-meteorological, and soil/water chemical analyses; (b) electronic equipment, such as
computers, plotters, printers, copiers, fax machines, etc.--this equipment is required for data processing
and management, calculation, mapping and report writing; (c) vehicles, i.e. pick-ups, or jeeps for use
in the field; and (d) spare parts and chemicals for laboratory analysis; and (iii) training of personnel in
calibration of equipment, sampling techniques, and standardized methods for data collection, analysis on
personal computers, and interpretation.
C.    ElAs Preparation and SEE Review
17.           This sub-component's objectives are to: (i) further improve EA capacity in the country
through the joint work of international and local EA experts; and (ii) conduct ElAs and SEE for the
remaining sub-projects to be implemented under IDIP, based on the approaches applied in the SEA and
two EIAs that have already been prepared, as well as the SEE recommendations thereon.



- 93 -                                  Annex K
18.          The World Bank Policy on Environmental Assessment [Operational Directive 4.01:
Environmental Assessment (EA)] requires EAs of proposed investments to improve decision making and
to help ensure that project options under consideration for Bank financing are environmentally sound and
sustainable. The EA evaluates a project's environmental impacts in its area of influence and identifies
ways of improving project design and implementation by preventing, minimizing, or compensating for
adverse environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts.
19.           This project has been classified into EA Category "B" which requires an environmental
analysis, as its potential adverse environmental impacts are not irreversible and would not significantly
affect human populations or environmentally important areas; its activities are limited to rehabilitation
of existing irrigation and drainage systems and improvement of their operation, and mitigatory measures
can be easily designed.
20.           The Government's requirements for EA  cover two stages of incorporation of
environmental concerns into the decision making that are expressed in different terms: Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA)[or, in Russian, Otzenka Vozdeistviya na Okrujajushuiu Sredu, OVOS, which
is the responsibility of a project proponent], and State Ecological Expertise (SEE)[or, in Russian,
Gosudarstvennaya Ecologicheskaya Ekspertiza, which is mandatory for all investment projects, for foreign
investments in particular, and which constitutes a process of state review of the project's design together
with the EIA]. The SEE is required under the law "On Environmental Protection", while the EIA
process is instituted through a number of instructions and guidelines issued by the MOEB. The process
should also be supported by requirements stipulated in sectoral EIA guidelines.
21.           Unfortunately, the Kazakstan history of implementing and enforcing strict SEE
requirements is rather limited, while there has been no experience of conducting EIA for agricultural
development projects, including irrigation and drainage.
22.          In order to overcome this situation and to build initial EA capacity in agricultural and
environmental sectors in the country, it was suggested and agreed, by MOEB and the Bank, that a team
of international and local EA experts would conduct, as part of project preparation, a Sectoral Environ-
mental Analysis (SEA) and two pilot project specific ElAs. Both the SEA and the two project specific
EIAs have been informally reviewed by MOEB and are being further improved under the PPF. This
work should form a basis for further project specific ElAs and SEEs to be accomplished through project
implementation.
D.    Support for Special Envirornental Studies
23.           The project objectives are to: (i) support implementation of appropriate water/soil quality
monitoring and agro-meteorological programs focused on the irrigation and drainage sub-sector but
limited to the scope of the project as recommended, by the SEA and further relevant analysis under the
PPF; (ii) provide continuous monitoring of the project's performance environmental indicators; and (iii)
provide a basis for planning a coordinated environmental system for the sector, that can be implemented
when the economy improves.
24.           To ensure environmentally sustainable agricultural development and effectively protect,
manage and use water, land, forests, etc., the condition of the resources (soil, water, etc.) must be
known. This condition is in constant change, so that monitoring is necessary.



- 94 -                                 Annex K
25.           Kazakstan has inherited a vast environmental monitoring system, including programs,
analytical methods and standards from the FSU. One of the distinctive features of this system is that a
number of agencies are involved, through stationary data collection and field sampling. Coordination of
these programs, their methods and standards is rather poor. Another feature is that environmental
monitoring has not been specifically designed to monitor performance of agricultural activities, including
irrigation and drainage projects.
26.           Currently, Kazakstan is not able to provide adequate budgetary resources to sustain
environmental monitoring. Agencies involved in these activities are forced to significantly cut staff, pro-
grams, and the number of monitoring stations and sampling for analysis. This will affect the capabilities
in the country for sustainable agricultural development and the monitoring of environmental impacts and
changes which could occur due to implementation of IDIP.
27.           Implementation of the project will substantially increase the responsibilities and the work-
load of the concerned oblast offices of agricultural and environmental agencies while new monitoring
stations may also have to be opened. These new tasks may require additional qualified staff and funds,
including salaries, travel, costs for operation and maintenance, and office supplies. Government's
commnitment should be sought to budget any funding gaps to cover these operational expenses.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
PARTICIPATION GUIDELINES
1.            This annex discusses the background and rationale for the participatory approach used
in the project, as well as the five-step consultation and decision-making mechanism that will ensure that
beneficiaries have the final say in technical and financial decisions that affect them.
Background
2.             Widespread experience throughout the world has demonstrated that actively engaging
stakeholders, particularly beneficiaries, in the design and implementation of development projects has
short-term and long-term benefits. In the short term, participation promotes ownership and speeds
implementation; over the long-term it promotes sustainability. This consideration is particularly relevant
when there are multiple stakeholders, when participating institutions have different levels involved, and
when there are new stakeholders or stakeholder roles are changing. In such cases, it is important to
include different stakeholders in appropriate ways at various states of project preparation and
implementation. In this context, stakeholders include the gamut of institutions and individual that have
an interest in the irrigation and drainage investments, from officials in different institutions to irrigation
and agricultural technicians, legal experts, contractors, owners, direct and indirect beneficiaries, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and funding agencies.
3.            Currently, World Bank participation literature identifies four principal levels of
participation that vary from simple consultation with stakeholders to empowering them to make basic
decisions:
i      Information Sharing. Shareholders are informed about the process of project
preparation and the nature of the project that is emerging.
e      Consultation.  Shareholders are engaged in a two-way dialog in which their
opinions and priorities are solicited and used to define project parameters.
*      Joint Decision-Making.  Relevant stakeholders jointly make major decisions
relating to the project.
*      Empowerment.  Stakeholders (especially beneficiaries) are given primary
responsibility for major project decisions.
4.             These participation levels are cumulative: consultation involves sharing information, and
joint decision-making includes both information sharing and consultation, for example. All levels will
be utilized in the project.
5.            This project has been participatory since its inception. It started as a central government
initiative, based on information and requests generated at the oblast and district levels from agencies and
farms. Since the time the local requests were aggregated into a long-term irrigation and drainage



- 107 -                                   Annex P
investment plan, some of the stakeholders have changed structure, status and roles, and others have
emerged. The project itself will precipitate additional changes, the most profound of which is the
transformation of farmers from subjects to clients. Consequently, the project must take into account the
changes and lay the groundwork for future evolution.
The Project
6.            Ultimately, the project will promote the empowerment of water users on three institutional
levels: first, they will decide on the nature of onfarm investments to be made; second, they will be
involved in establishing and managing water user associations (WUAs); and third, in at least one area
they will become shareholders in an inter-farm canal management enterprise.
7.            The Irrigation and Drainage Improvement Project will involve a number of different types
of stakeholders, most of whom are in the process of re-defining their roles and responsibilities, as well
as their rights. On the surface, the project will appear to be "business as usual": central, oblast and
district officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Committee for Water Resources will oversee a
program of investments to improve irrigation and drainage infrastructure on and between state and
collective farms, based on the work of design institutes. The visible participants, as during the previous
administration, will be the officials, design engineers, farm managers and construction enterprises.
8.            Below the surface, however, the undertaking will be anything but "business as usual"
because each institutional participant will be working within a qualitatively new framework that offers
both constraints and opportunities. The decisions and actions of each of the visible participants--officials,
engineers, farm managers and contractors--will be constrained by the participation of two new types of
stakeholders who have heretofore been rather invisible--the shareholders of former state and collective
farms and independent farms who have broken away from the former state farms. Both of the new
groups are expected to repay the cost of onfarm investments, thus they must agree to make the
investments. To gain the commitment of these new players, therefore, the visible participants will need
to inform stakeholders about the program and its intended benefits and mutual obligations; provide
options and explain the financial and O&M implications of each; prepare detailed designs according to
their wishes; ensure that the work is complete as promised at the specified cost; and prepare them to
assume responsibility for subsequent operations and maintenance.
9.            This decision-making process may take more time than a process that only involves the
visible stakeholders, and it may result in the adoption of the most conservative, least-expensive
technologies, despite recommendations of officials and technical experts. On the other hand, the process
may lead to the adoption of new irrigation and drainage approaches to deal with innovative cropping and
management patterns that are designed to increase the financial prospects of the farms under new
economic circumstances, patterns that are more imaginative, far-sighted and pragmatic than those
promoted by the agricultural officials who are used to setting policies and programs.
Participation Rationale
10.           The most important element of the project's participatory approach is a 5-step consultation
and decision-making process that will require project staff to interact with independent farmers and farm
shareholders on each farm at five specific stages in the rehabilitation and improvement process. The
objective of the 5-step process is to empower beneficiaries to be actively involved in making decisions
that affect them and to prepare them to assume obligations inherent in their decisions. The overall



- 108 -                                  Annex P
program reflects currently acknowledged best practices in the sector, with specific elements added to deal
with Kazak circumstances, prompted by findings of the project social assessment.
11.           Through interviews with managers of over 30 farms, household surveys on 10 farms and
focus group discussions on 5 farms, the social assessment concluded the following:
*      farmers appear to be poorly informed about the privatization process in general,
as well as their specific rights and responsibilities regarding farm management,
ownership and their ability to liquidate their own shares; indeed, many on
privatized farms do not know they have been privatized and others on farms that
still remain under state control believe that they have been privatized.
*      farm managers are somewhat better informed about the privatization process and
the implications of the management form adopted on their particular farms, but
they know little about alternatives and they still find themselves subject to formal
and informal orders issued by district and oblast officials.
*      farm management structures appear to be evolving, tending toward restructuring
to some degree, at least; most of the sampled farms that were privatized 2 or 3
years ago, have changed management pattern at least once, and most have spun
off one or more independent farm units.
=      farm managers appear to make most farm-level decisions, but they seem no
longer to have the final word on all decisions; ultimately, they report to the
general assembly of shareholders who can replace them and, with increasing
frequency, do so. The latitude of decision-making by managers is somewhat
ambiguous, however; managers feel hand-tied and farmers feel powerless
because the decision-making process is neither transparent nor consistent.
*      farmers increasingly question the motives of farm managers, and do not trust
them to make financial commitments on their behalf.
*      neither farmers nor farm managers appear to understand the ownership status of
the irrigation infrastructure, and the implications of ownership for concomitant
operation and maintenance responsibilities.
*      independent farmers feel themselves to be marginalized in many ways, but
particularly with regard to irrigation water, to which they feel that their access
is irregularly and arbitrarily granted.
*      for the most part, farmers are unaware of their right to withdraw from former
state farms and turn their land use entitlements into specific plots; in some cases,
the right is not recognized by farm the bylaws of the new management entity.
12.           Given the need to increase the quantity and quality of information available to farmers
and farm managers, to increase the level of trust on the major farms, to narrow the growing rifts between
the management of major farms and the independent farms, to deal with the uncertain tenure of farm
managers, and to reflect the vested interests of both independent farmers and farm members, it is



- 109 -                                    Annex P
essential to entrust the decision to participate in the project to all farmers, rather than farm managers.
Moreover, project related decisions need to be taken in an iterative fashion at several stages in the
rehabilitation process. The 5-step process was designed to meet these needs.
The Five-Step Process
13 .          The participatory framework for major project decisions focuses on 5 discrete steps design
and implementation that require informed decision-making and/or consent. At each step, a project
delegation will go to each farm to meet with the general assembly of farm members and all independent
farmers on the former state farm property to explain the decision(s) to be made, present alternatives, if
appropriate, explore implications and answer questions. Although the initial plan is to conduct one
meeting at each stage, experience will determine if one meeting is adequate or if each decision should
have a two-stage (information meeting, followed by decision meeting) meeting sequence. At each step,
the meeting must produce a document that identifies participants; records discussion topics and various
positions and questions; records the votes on decisions; as relevant, reiterates previous commnitments and
participation requirements; and acknowledges the future commitments implied by the current decisions,
particularly regarding cost recovery and O&M. The 5 steps are as follows:
14.            Step I: Initiation. The first step is a consultation meeting in which project staff describe
the project, participation requirements and limitations, the sequence of events, residual responsibilities
and cost recovery mechanisms.  Farmers and farm  management assure compliance with project
requirements, particularly the easy exit clause in bylaws or outline steps that will be taken to assure
compliance and identify priority areas for intervention and/or choice of technology. Note: this step will
apply to the second set of projects, not the first set that were included in the project appraisal list for year
I and year 11 projects, as they have already progressed beyond this stage.
15.            Step I1: Fixing the Package.  At the second step, project design staff will present
alternative packages of interventions that respond to the priorities expressed in step 1, describing the
nature of each, their estimated cost and operations and maintenance implications, as well as the cost
recovery burden that each would impose. At the end of the step, farmers will report specific choices and
reiterate their understanding of the estimated cost, cost recovery estimates, and the operations and
mainteniance implications of the choice. A Letter of Intent would be signed by farmers' representatives,
indicating their agreement, in principle, to a specific project design, related costs and repayment terms.
16.            Step III: Final Design. The third step will be a detailed presentation of the final design,
along with more detailed cost,  cost recovery and O&M  implications. At the conclusion, farmers will
consent to the design or specify modifications to be made, and reiterate their understanding of the cost
and O&M implications. If the farmers agree, a formal Letter of Agreement will be signed.
17.           Step IV: Tendering. At the fourth step, farmers will be informed about the tendering
process and either agree or disagree to the timing, cost and sequence of events, specifying parameters
within which changes can be made without requiring additional consultation and approval by the general
assembly. If the tender cost is too high, farmers have the option to terminate the process at this point.
18.           Step V: Performance Testing. At the conclusion of construction, before the work is
handed over to the farmers and the final payment is made, farmers must participate in a performance test
to determine the extent to which construction meets design and performance specifications.  Any



- 110 -                                   Annex P
differences between specifications and actual measurements must be identified and agreement must be
reached regarding how to handle them--ignore them, modify O&M parameters or require remedial work.
The report of the exercise details the issues and decisions, as well as responsibility and timetable, both
for the works and the concomitant cost recovery and O&M responsibilities. At the conclusion of this
exercise, the designer will present an O&M manual that is satisfactory to the farmers.
19.           This 5-step process will institutionalize new roles and responsibilities for different
stakeholders. It establishes farm members and independent farners as irrigation clients, rather than
subjects; it relegates farm managers to technical and advisory roles, rather than decision-making roles;
it recognizes the rights and responsibilities of independent farmers, and integrates them into the decision-
making process; it requires technical people to be patient and articulate, responsible to user clients, rather
than officials; it creates broad and deep channels for the flow of information about water management,
farm management and technologies for each; and it provides the form for developing new working
partnerships between independent farmers, farm members and officials, based on common interests,
differences and interdependencies. In effect, the 5-step process will ensure that farmers who choose to
benefit from the project have adequate voice and informed choice, based on sound technical information.
20.            Successful execution of this 5-step process will require new communications patterns
between farmers and officials and technicians which, in turn, calls for officials and technical people will
need to acquire new communications skills. They need to learn to facilitate discussions, rather than
dominate them, and they need to practice mediation and consensus building, rather than commanding
acquiescence.   The process will require both patience and discipline to carry through to the end.
Technical assistance advisors will coach and train staff in the required skills.
WUAs and Irrigation Canal Company
21.           On successively higher institutional levels, the project will also promote water user
organizations. The WUAs will bring all farmers into an institution that manages water, thereby offering
independent farmers a mechanism to protect their interests, as well as to integrate their needs into the
broader context of farm-level water management. On the canal command level, the proposed pilot canal
company will similarly offer farms and independent farmers an opportunity to manage local water
resources according to their common interests, and to ensure that the inter-farm system is operated in
response to their needs, rather than to the demands of an external bureaucracy. The arrangements for
both levels of institutions will be worked out in more detail during project implementation.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
MNISTRY OF AGRICULTURE (MOA) ORGANIZATION
1.           Responsibilities. The responsibilities of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) are defined
as follows:
*      The development and elaboration of concepts and perspectives for the various
aspects of agricultural production.
*      Implementation of the State program for the development of the agro-industrial
complex and the investment policy for agriculture.
*      Promoting the rational use of farm lands.
v      Registration and management of the Land Fund.
*      Proposing and administering environmental legislation in the agricultural sector.
2.            Organization. The Ministry of Agriculture was established by a resolution of the Cabinet
of Ministers. There are 16 subdivisions and about 40 lower divisions in MOA throughout the Republic.
In addition, also under the mantle of MOA, there are regional and district agricultural agencies, funded
by local budgets, union associations, and numerous related but independent organizations. A general
organization chart of the MOA and related organizations functioning in agricultural water management
is presented in the attached Table.
3.           It maintains an Environmental Department, which is charged with developing and
recommending measures for the protection of land resources.
4.            Capability.  During the period of transition to a market economy, all institutions
dependent for funding on the Treasury of the Republic have undergone severe financial restrictions, which
have negatively affected their ability to meet their primary and secondary responsibilities. In the case
of the MOA, priorities have dictated the continuance of direct support for agriculture, but research work
formerly carried out by its scientific institutions and agro-chemical laboratories has essentially stopped
and some facilities have been shut down. The remediation of environmental problems resulting from past
agricultural activities has been nonexistent, since this sort of problem is well down on the list of
priorities. Even the issuance of information bulletins and catalogues of statistical information has been
severely curtailed.
5.            The ministry has no section dedicated to the analysis and management of the
environmental effects of new projects.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
MINISTRY OF ECOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES (MOEB) ORGANIZATION
Responsibilities. The Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources (MOEB) was
established by Presidential Degree No. N 679, 16 March 1992 and a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers,
No. N 216, 11 March 1992. It is the successor to the State Committee on Ecology and Nature Use and
the Ministry of Forestry. It is a planning, management, and monitoring agency mandated to promote the
protection and rational use of natural resources. It has the following functions:
*     pursuing unified State policy in respect of environmental protection, regulating
rational nature use and conservation and reproduction of natural resources.
*     organizing and implementing of State control in the area of environmental protec-
tion and rational nature use in accordance with the Law "On Natural Environ-
ment Protection in the Kazak SSR".
=     adopting measures stipulated by the Law for remediation and improvement of
ecological situation, living conditions, preserving ecosystems, landscapes, and
other environmental facilities in the territory of Kazakstan.
*     developing of long-term state complex and special programs, indicative plans on
environmental protection and rational natural resources use.
developing, implementing and improving of economic mechanism for nature use.
*     implementing State Ecological Expertise of projects, standards, projections, pre-
planning, and project documentation.
coordinating of study and control over radio-ecological situation in the Republic,
organizing collection, processing, transportation, and disposal of radioactive
waste.
*     organizing of ecological knowledge dissemination within the society, encouraging
citizens' awareness and activity for environmental protection and resources
conservation.
*     providing scientific, methodological, and organizational guidance for rational
bio-resources use and environmental activities in the Republic.
*     maintaining international cooperation in the field of environmental protection.
2.           Organization. The Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources has a vertical structure,
with divisions at the national, oblast, and district levels. It has divisions for ecological inspection,



- 123 -                                  Annex T
wildlife protection, fisheries management, scientific research. The total staff of the ministry at the
national level numbers around 100 persons. The oblast offices contain 25 to 50 persons each, district
offices 3 to 5, and city offices 10 to 15. The ministry manages seven national parks.
3.            Capability. The MOEB is a relatively young organization and as such has had little time
to chalk up real accomplishments. It inherited some capable staff from its predecessor agencies, with
considerable knowledge of the resources for which the ministry is responsible. Like its sister agencies,
it depends on the national treasury for funding and is severely curtailed in all aspects of its mission.
4.            The ministry has undergone four reorganizations since its founding. The acquisition of
trained specialists for most divisions remains a problem, and is likely to continue until the economy
improved; then it is likely to lag behind some other line agencies. Laboratory facilities are reported to
be antiquated and ill-equipped, hindering the accomplishment of basic data gathering and enforcement.
State Ecological Expertise ( SEE )
5.            The law "On Environmental Protection" has provided for mandatory SEE prior to making
any development decision; public and private financing of a project could start only after obtaining a
positive conclusion of SEE. Supportive implementation guidelines and requirements are provided in a
number of Government resolutions and MOEB instructions. All development programs, plans, project
designs, rehabilitation and improvement projects together with environmental impact assessments are
subject to SEE. All projects with foreign investments are subject to SEE at the national level.
6.            MOEB Main Department for SEE and Radiological Safety is responsible for normative
requirements and guidelines for EIA and SEE. The department has about 25 regular high level and
technical staff and also contracts external experts to conduct SEE. Each MOEB oblast committee has a
SEE unit with 3-5 staff in it and they serve both municipalities and rural areas. It is the Government
resolution which provided for payments for conducting SEE by a projects proponent
State Ecological Inspection ( SEI )
7.                   SEI is a organizational entity within MOEB with the prime responsibility for state
environmental control to ensure compliance with existing legislation, standards, requirements and
conclusions of SEE. SEI issues licenses and permit for use of natural resources, disposal of industrial,
municipal and other wastes, emissions and discharges of pollutants. It assesses fees and fines for use of
natural resources and for pollution of the environment, as well as clears on behalf of MOEB permits for
special surface and underground water use, importing of agro-chemicals, etc. SEI controls: handling,
storage, transportation, use, distribution, etc. of pesticides, herbicides and other agro-chemicals; ensures
compliance with national environmental legislation in order to prevent pollution. It also controls
compliance with water legislation and appropriate operation and maintenance of irrigation and drainage
systems
8.            National office of SEI has about 20 people grouped into four divisions and there are SEI
units in all 19 oblast committees of MOEB with total staff of about 350. SEI also runs a number of
analytical laboratories.

IRRIGATION AN) DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Economic Annex
Economic Analysis
1.           Quantifiable benefits for the analysis are derived primarily from increases in agricultural
production due to: (i) increased efficiency in water use through improved water delivery and irrigation
practices; (ii) reversing the declines in yields from water logging and salinity build-up through improved
drainage; (iii) expanded area cultivated through reclamation of some abandoned areas; and (iv) higher
agricultural productivity as a result of farmers honing water management skills, adopting improved
cultural practices, and switching to improved varieties and higher value crops.
2.            Yield. For the with-out project conditions used in the analysis are assumed to equal the
average for the three years, pre-independence period 1988-1990. Yields since independence have
declined significantly since this period due to the protracted economic crisis that has affected input use,
fuel supplies and equipment availability. However, broad-based reforms are now underway and for the
analysis, it is assumed that by the time the first sub-projects are completed yield levels for the entire
sector will return to their historical high levels (Table 1).
3.            For the with-project scenario two different sets of assumptions were used:
*     (Comnprehensive On-farm Imgation and Drainage (seven sub-projects). Yields
are expected to increase by between 20-100 percent depending on the crop and
climatic and agronomic conditions in the areas where each sub-project is located.
Most yield increases are in the 40-60 percent range in the areas where sub-
project is located. The with-project assumptions are based on yield assumptions
used in original government feasibility studies which drew on data from research
farms. These data were then vetted and adjusted during preparation by a team
of local and international agronomists. The resulting yields are well below what
is considered to be technically feasible and what is achieved under similar
conditions elsewhere in the world. It is assumed that full yields in the with-
project situation would be achieved in the fifth year, starting from with-out
project yields in year one. To test for sensitivity to yield assumptions, rates of
return for the seven sub-projects involving comprehensive rehabilitation and
drainage were also calculated with yields at full development that were 25
percent lower than in the base case (Table 1).

*      On-Farm  Drainage Works (two  sub-projects).  Incremental production is
expected from two sources. First, without the investment in drainage, yields
would decrease due to increased salinity and water logging. The gradual build-
up in salinity could eventually reduce yields to zero. For the analysis it was
assumed that the without project yields would decline by one percent per annum
over a ten year period and stabilize thereafter. Second, with improved drainage,
yield increases could be anticipated.  With-project yields were assumed to
increase from 10 to 20 percent depending on the crop over the first five years.
4.            Area Under Irrigation. The project is limited to rehabilitation of existing irrigated areas
so that the area under the with-project assumptions does not include any expansion to newly irrigated
areas. However, several sub-projects will involve reclamation of some lands, abandoned because of
salinity and/or water-logging. In total about 2200 ha's are expected to be reclaimed (Table 2).
5.            Cropping Patterns.  Cropping patterns in the with-project scenario were originally
developed by local agronomists based on existing cropping patterns, agronomic practices, and crop-
rotation practices.  These assumptions were reviewed by consultant agronomists during project
preparation. Cropping patterns in both the with and with-out cases include considerable amounts of
fodder crops. The sub-projects farms have been traditionally mixed livestock and crop operations. This
mixed pattern of production is assumed for the analysis to be maintained. Also, fodder crops figure
prominently in crop rotation patterns.  No attempt has been made in constructing with-projects
assumptions to anticipate changes in cropping patterns in response to emerging market signals. However,
an optimization procedure was conducted for one of the sub-projects and the results suggested that the
assumed cropping pattern may indeed be sub-optimal.
6.            Prices. The prices used in the economic analysis are summarized in Table 3. The
monetary unit for the analysis is the US dollar. Wheat, rice and cotton are export crops and the relevant
price is world market price adjusted for transport to Russian markets. Sunflower, soybeans, and sugar
beets are import substitutes and the relevant prices is the import parity price. Kazakstan is a traditional
exporter of meat and dairy products and the value of fodder crops (barley, sorghum, maize, silage, and
alfalfa) is based on the calculation of estimated net returns to feeding sheep, beef cattle, and dairy
cows.  The value of livestock products used to estimate the price of fodder units are based on
international market price. Each of the fodder crops is converted into fodder units using appropriate feed
conversion ratios. Farm gate prices for tradable commodities were derived by using the World Bank
projections for year 2000 in 1990 constant price, using the G-5 Manufacturing Unit Value Indices for
inflation adjustment.
7.            Non-traded goods in the analysis are assumed to include all the fruit and vegetable crops.
Prices for the non-traded commodities were updated using the 1995 prices from local markets. The
prices of non-tradeable goods and services in Kazakstan are expected to increase significantly in the
medium term relative to internationally traded goods to correct for the substantial undervaluation of the
real exchange rate of the tenge. The magnitude and timing of the correction is uncertain. For planning
purposes and for the economic and financial projections, it is assumed that local costs and prices will
increase at a rate of 15 percent per annum over the project implementation period relative to the increases
in foreign costs of importable goods and services. Since the analysis focuses on project starts in the next
two years and since project construction for each sub-project is expected to take two to three years, all
local prices have been adjusted from 1995 levels to the year 2000.

8.            Given the considerable uncertainty attached to these assumptions, sensitivity analysis was
undertaken to test for changes in price levels for local commodities. In the analysis, it was assumed the
prices of non-traded fruits and vegetables would rise faster than the prices of traded goods. It is possible
that because of the relative price changes, commodities such as fruits and vegetables that are now not
traded could potentially become traded. It is also possible that a production response to higher prices
could dampen domestic price increases. To test for such uncertainty, prices of non-traded fruits and
vegetables were held constant at their 1995 level while local investment costs were inflated at 15 percent
per annum throughout the investment period.
9.            Economic Analysis. Summary tables showing the economic analysis for two sub-projects
are presented below (Tables 4-6). More detailed tables for all sub-projects are available in project files.
The calculation of the combined ERR for all eleven sub-projects is shown in Table 7.
10.           FinancialAnalysis. Assumptions used in calculating the FRR include: (i) financial prices
for output are assumed to be equal to economic prices; (ii) investment costs are adjusted by including
value-added tax and import duties to the economic investment costs and subtracting out costs of the
agricultural component allocated to each sub-project; and (iii) price of purchased inputs are adjusted to
include VAT and import duties.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
SECTOR ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Summary
1.           This report has been prepared at the request of the Government of Kazakstan as part of
the environmental program of the Kazakstan Irrigation and Land Reclamation Project in preparation to
meet environmental assessment requirements of Kazakstan and the World Bank. It is intended to evaluate
current environmental conditions in the irrigated agriculture sector of the Republic of Kazakstan and to
predict environmental benefits and mitigation of adverse effects that may be expected to result from
ongoing and proposed improvements in irrigated agriculture on as many as 24 farm systems covering
126,577 hectares.
2.            Kazakstan may be considered a steppe nation, with large areas of short-grass plains and
hills, bordered on the south by mountains. Lying near the center of the Eurasian land mass, it has a
typically continental climate, with cold, dry winters and hot dry summers. Annual precipitation (Map
3) in the agricultural lowlands varies from less than 150 mm in the extreme southwest oblast of
Manghystau, the lower Syr Darya basin, and the edge of Lake Balkhash to nearly 450 mm in the foothills
of the southern mountains and a few areas in the north and east. In a most areas, some rain falls in every
month, with greater amounts in late winter or early spring. In the far northeast of the country, the peak
tends to be later, in July or August. On average, two out of five years are considered drought years,
requiring irrigation for viable cropping. On the basis of rainfall and temperature (degree-days above I0`C
and frost-free days), the country is divided into nine agro-climatic zones, with some subdivisions.
3.           The majority of Kazakstan's rivers are contained in the closed basins of the Caspian and
Aral Seas and Lakes Balkhash and Tengiz. Only the Ob, Ishym and Tobol basins drain into the Arctic
Ocean. The largest,the Irtysh, Ural, Syr Darya, and Ili, originate in the mountain systems (the Altai,
Urals, Trans-Ili, Alatau, and Tian Shan) that border the country or are in the neighboring states. Nearly
all types of flow regimes are represented in the rivers of Kazakstan. In central and western Kazakstan
the rivers are shallow and flood in spring, but dry out in summer or are reduced to salty stretches. Many
depend largely on snow melt and flow into desert lakes that become highly saline or dry out entirely in
summer. Such rivers tend to have two periods of flooding, in spring and in late summer. With storage
reservoirs, these glacial rivers have great industrial and irrigation potential, as well as producing
hydroelectric power. In such rivers, rainfall and groundwater outflow may provide only 5 to 15 percent
of the annual discharge.
4.            Glaciers represent large reservoirs of clean fresh water. In the Republic, glaciers are
found in the Altai, Dzhungar, Terskey Alatau, Transilik and Kirghiz Alatau, and Talas Alatau.
Collectively, these mountains contain 2,724 glaciers more than 0.01 km2 in area, with a total area of
2,033 km2. They contain approximately 100 km3 of water and yield about 2 km3 (2,000 million cubic
meters) of meltwater annually with about 0.04 g/L of salts. Most glaciers are gradually melting back.
5.            Not counting the Caspian and Aral Seas, Kazakstan has 48,262 standing water bodies one
hectare or more in area. Collectively, they contain more than 190 km3 of water. The 21 largest contain



- 144 -                                  Annex X
26,886 km2 of surface area, approximately 59 percent of the standing water surface of the Republic.
Research in northern Kazakstan by the State Hydrologic Institute (St. Petersburg) showed that the
diversion of water from lakes is possible only in years with medium to high rainfall. The smaller lakes,
therefore, cannot be a guaranteed water supply for industry, cities, rural settlements, and irrigation
systems. Most lakes in Kazakstan are not suitable for drinking, and many are unsuitable for irrigation.
Less than 30 percent can be considered completely fresh (less than 1 g/L total salts), while slightly over
half are weakly saline (1-5 g/L) or moderately saline (5-25 g/L).
6.            Due to the highly irregular flow of most rivers, their development for economic uses is
only possible through streamflow regulation by storage reservoirs. Many rivers, especially the larger
ones, have been provided long-term and seasonal regulation by reservoirs and storage ponds. Large
reservoirs such as Buhtarma, which is among the largest in the world, with a capacity of 44.6 km3 and
a surface area of 5,490 kM2, were developed with advanced construction technology. In addition to their
primary objectives (water supply for industry, population centers, energy production, or irrigation) most
also are used for fish production and recreation. At present Kazakstan has 204 reservoirs, with a total
capacity of 95.5 km3 and a total area in excess of 10,000 kmn2, including 22 that provide long-term water
supply.
7.            Groundwater is more protected than surface water and is less affected by human activities.
Out of 601 identified aquifers, 556 are suitable for drinking and household water supply. The remaining
45 are not suitable for drinking but are suitable for mineral baths and other medical purposes. The
reserves of fresh and slightly mineralized groundwater could supply 42.5 million m3/da, most of which
is located in the southeast portion of the country (Taldykorgan, Almaty and Dzhambyl Oblasts).
8.            A total of 7 million m3/da of groundwater is diverted for human use, including 50.5
percent for drinking water supply, 31.5 percent for industrial needs and 18 percent for irrigation. Most
groundwater use occurs in South Kazakstan, Almaty and West Kazakstan Oblasts, especially near the
foothills and mountain depressions and around rock and sand rock massives. There are 2,200 artesian
wells with a total capacity of 1.2 million m3/da. Irrigated agriculture is among the main sources of
groundwater pollution, along with industry, mining and mineral processing, cattle breeding farms, storage
of solid and liquid wastes, and petroleum products. Agricultural pollution of ground water is most
prevalent at Taldykorgan Oblast (Karatal, Kerbulak, Alakul and Panfilov Massives) where organochlorine
and organophosphate pesticides occur at concentrations of 0.003 to 0.03 ppm (mg/L).
9.            Kazakstan also may be divided into eco-climatic zones, on the basis of natural climax
vegetation. The most frequently used classification for lowland regions recognizes forest-steppe, steppe,
arid steppe, semidesert, desert, and foothill desert.  Designated forest areas constitute only 3.7 percent
of the total area of the Republic. Some planting of trees on state land is underway, with the stated goal
of the Forest Institute the increase of area to 4.6 percent of the national area.
10.           For ecological purposes, soils may be considered in terms of eco-climatic zones. In
northern Kazakstan, the prevailing zone is forest-steppe, with gray or black highly weathered soils
characterized as Chernozem soils. In the central part of the country, covering some 30 percent of the
total area of the Republic, are soils that are dark to light chestnut in color. In the south, occupying
approximately 40 percent of the national area, are brown to gray-brown, "takyr-like" desert soils. The
content of organic matter declines from 7-8 percent in the north to 0.3-0.5 percent in the south. Gross
nitrogen and phosphorus levels drop from 0.4 and 0.12 percent to 0.01 and 0.01 percent, respectively.
Cation exchange capacity declines from 40-45 to 10-15 mg/eq/100 gm. Over the same distance, the soils



- 145 -                                  Annex X
tend to become more alkaline, pH rising from near neutral (6.8-7.0) to moderately alkaline (7.5-8.3).
In the drier areas, the salt content of the native soil increases, leading to a vulnerability to surface salinity
problems under conditions of poor ground water management All the soils of Kazakstan are weak in the
hydrolyzed compounds of zinc, molybdenum, and cobalt, average in copper, and well provided with
manganese. In South Kazakstan, some areas show high levels of boron and/or soda-sulphate.
11.           Studies of Kazakstan soils indicate that 26 percent of the surface of the country may be
considered erosive (Borovsky, 1976). This means that slightly more than 700,000 km2 of land is
vulnerable to erosive loss. Of this area, the fraction subject to wind erosion, about 525,000 km2, is about
three times larger than that subject to water erosion, about 177,000 kmi2, as might be expected in a
country with relatively low rainfall. In the few oblasts where erosion by water predominates, the total
percentage of erosivity is not high, less than 2 percent, whereas in the drier oblasts 5-8 percent of the
area is considered vulnerable to erosion.
12.           Kazakstan has an average population density of 6.4 persons per square kilometer, making
it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. Its place at the meeting of the Slavic and
Moslem worlds has contributed to its ethnic diversity. Of the 14 ethnic/national groups represented in
the Republic, the dominant ones are Kazaks (42 percent), Russians (37 percent), Other Slavs (5 percent),
and Germans (5 percent); the remaining 11 percent is made up of a large variety of national origins.
Kazaks are the most numerous in rural areas of the southern, southwestern, and southeastern parts of the
country, while ethnic Russians make up 80 percent of the population in the northern, western, and eastern
parts. Forced resettlement of Germans occurred until 1954, largely in the rural areas of western,
northern and central Kazakstan. Uigurs are strongly represented in the southeast, especially in Almaty
and Taldykorgan Oblasts.
13.           The concept of providing an artificial water supply for agriculture dates back to ancient
times, but the quantification of irrigation requirements began officially around the beginning of this
century. In 1915, 696,000 ha of land was considered to require irrigation. By 1988 this had increased
to 2,321,000 ha. In the 1970's and 1980's there was not only an increase in the area irrigated but also
technical upgrading of existing systems: lining of earth canals to prevent seepage, land grading to improve
efficiency, mechanized application using broad-armed sprinkler systems, and the construction of closed
irrigation systems. The engineers began to include soil water salinity predictions and optimization,
analogue computation of ground water flow, and computer data treatment in planning new systems.
Predictions of water quality and environmental protection began to enter the planning in the 1990s and
in 1991 the assessment of environmental impacts became a mandatory part of the planning process.
During this era the reuse of irrigation drainage water became a requirement.
14.           Water losses through seepage, poorly designed, poorly maintained, or absent drainage
systems, and the use of high salinity water have caused severe deterioration of growing conditions on
many farms. Waterlogged and heavily salinized lands can be found in all regions of the country, although
the distribution of such conditions is irregular. Even in the northern parts of the country, deterioration
of land accounts for 5-10 percent of the area; in the southern regions the figure is 30-40 percent.
15.           Declines in the amount of total harvest and sharp declines in harvests of valuable fish
species occurred during the period of intensive development of agriculture, industry and hydroelectric
power. Consumptive water uses caused decreases in water levels, pollution, mineralization of water, and
drying of many shallow lakes that were formerly valuable fish nursery areas. A lack of fish protective



- 146 -                                   Annex X
devices on some headgates and ineffective use on others resulted in losses of young fish that were carried
along with water withdrawals.
16-           The most adverse fishery impacts of irrigation were observed at the Aral-Syr Darya Basin
anid Lake Balkhash. The Aral-Syr Darya Basin has lost its industrial importance. The harvest has
decreased to one sixth of the tonnage during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Balkhash Lake harvests in
the 1960s were 16,000 tons per year, but were only 9,422 tons in 1991.
17.           Water resources of the Syr Darya basin are almost exhausted. Discharge from Chardara
reservoir on the Kyrgyzstan border is limited by channel encroachments on downstream settlements.
Thus, when water exceeding this limited capacity is available, it is diverted to evaporate in Lake
Aydarkul. a blind basin in the desert. Four additional dams in Kazakstan also do not have the capacity
to pass high flows.  During the past several years, water has not reached the mouth of the Syr Darya
river, whiclh has resulted in serious changes for delta wildlife. The delta has not flooded since 1964.
18.           Ground water in the lower Syr Darya basin regularly is found to contain residues of the
insecticides l)DT and benzene hexachloride and the herbicide 2,4-D in excess of allowable limits. A
smnall percentage (less than 0.3 percent) of foodstuffs from the same region analyzed in 1992 also
contained DDT in excess of allowable limits. The presence of these chemicals more than two decades
after their supposed removal from use is indicative of serious indifference on the part of farm managers
to the environmental and health effects of the chemicals. Frequently the chemical applied, the method
of application, or the timing is inappropriate for the target pest, but the chemical is used because it is
available where the needed one is not. The training of field agronomists has not kept up with advances
in pest control, and new chemicals often have been distributed without adequate instructions and cautions.
The UNEP notes that during the 1980s in the Aral Sea drainage, the application of pesticides in general
remained heavier than elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. In much of Kazakstan, the decline of
pesticide use in recent years has been due to shortages of funds, problems of supply, and lack of operable
equipmenit.
19.           Fortunately, there already is considerable interest on the part of the public and of
governmenit officials in the newer methods of biological or integrated pest control. The overall outlook
for Kazakstan with regard to agricultural chemicals gives cause for environmental optimism. The
remiiaining years of this century are likely to see a continuation of the present low levels of pesticide
applications, with decreasing use of the ecologically damaging chlorinated hydrocarbons as existing stock
rull out. As the economy of the country improves and foreign manufacturers begin to provide stocks of
the newer and more effective chemicals, pesticide use is likely to increase. This increase brings with it
a renewed possibility of improper use, over-application, storage risks, and increased residues in the food
of humans and livestock.
20.           Considerable concern has been shown in recent years over the incidence of human
diseases that appear to be linked to the quality of food and water consumed. The main culprits in these
cases appear to be nitrates and heavy metals (HM) derived from irrigation water through vegetables and
possibly meats.
21.           The land under full irrigation is likely to increase as a result of an expanding population,
scarcity of other inputs (pesticides, fertilizer, machinery), and failure to charge or collect full value for
the water consumed. Scarcity of other inputs has reduced agricultural production, so additional irrigation
has become one of the few options available for maintaining or increasing production. Provided that



- 147 -                                     Annex X
energy supplies remain available at reasonable cost, more irrigation is likely to be applied by sprinkler
because it makes more efficient use of the water and also produces less soil erosion than surface
irrigation.
22.            Expanded use of wastewater, especially on fodder crops, is highly likely. Kazakstan
avoids water pollution by strictly limiting discharges. Wastewater, or even reservoir water that cannot
be passed downstream, is often diverted into natural depressions to evaporate. Obviously, this practice
cannot long continue in areas that are short of water. Thus, wastewater must be applied for its best
available use. With chemical treatment to kill pathogens, sewage effluent could even be applied to
irrigate edible crops.
23.            Improved drainage, especially in areas prone to waterlogging, is a concern of very highi
priority for residents of irrigated areas. Several sites were observed where houses had to be abandonied
because the structural integrity of mud brick construction was compromised by waterlogged soils. Crop
losses due to inadequate drainage are widespread. Discharges of return flow may be directed into sinks
or rivers, into reservoirs for reuse, or into on-farm recycling. The receiving waters for return flows may
be major environmental issues.
24.            Return flows carry fertilizers and pesticides that are applied to crops. Concentrations of
these compounds will increase in the future as use of these inputs returns to, or exceeds former levels.
However, these waters are less mineralized than many waters that are in the lower reaches of many of
the river systems. Discharge of return flows into rivers could be used as part of the strategy to control
the salinization of the Aral Sea and Lake Balkhash.
25.            The Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources (MOEB) is the principal agency tor
environmental protection in Kazakstan, but numerous ministries contribute to the planning, monitoring
and environmental review of this project, including the Ministry of Agriculture, the Kazak Academy of
Agricultural Sciences, the State Committee on Land Relations and Land Management, the Ministry of
Geology, the State Committee for Water Resources, the Hydrometeorological Service, and the Miinistry
of Public Health. All ministries suffer from an acute shortfall in funding, prohibiting them from carrying
out many of their basic functions.
26.            As of the end of 1994, there was no special environmental law  requiring impact
assessment for irrigation development projects. In the middle of 1994, the MOEB issued "Temporary
Instructions for the Assessment of the Ecological Impacts of Farm Development."  The "Instructions"
are still considered in force, pending the adoption of more detailed guidelines. Such guideliles were
prepared by the authors of this SEA and presented to MOEB for possible adoption. The "Instructionis"
call for a report in which available data on the resources likely to be affected by a project are analyzed
in terms of scope and intensity, so that further research can be performed as required. An environmental
assessment (EA) report is to be prepared by the project proponent and included with the feasibility report
when this is submitted to approval. The report is to provide a brief description of ecological and social
resources, and trends in agriculture. Natural resources that are especially sensitive to change should be
identified, along with potential environmental problems. The report is given public review and then
presented to Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources. MOEB reviews the EA and its comments (Stnic
Ecological Expertise) are forwarded to those considering the project for approval. Similarly, SanitafN
Expertise is carried out by the Ministry of Public Health.

27.           Currently there is no entity (unit) within the national office of the Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) responsible for environmental issues in the sector, although there is an environmental specialist
in the Project Implementation Unit for this project. The MOA is responsible for self control and
monitoring of reclamation land conditions on irrigated and drainage systems within the boundaries of
state, collective and private farms.  There are three regional monitoring units called Hydrologic
Amelioration (or Hydrogeologomelioration) Expeditions under the MOA. They are responsible for
monitoring of cropped areas, irrigation water use, soil and groundwater salinity and quality, preparation
of water balance calculations and maps for all major irrigation systems in their region.
28.           Surface water monitoring for developments under this project will be carried out by.
Drainage and subsurface water monitoring will be performed by Hydrogeologymeliorative expeditions
of MOA in Almaty, Zhambyl, Kzyl-Orda, Taldy-Korgan and South Kazakhstan oblasts, and by the
Hydrometeorological Service in other oblasts. Land monitoring, as well as monitoring of agricultural
products will be made by the agricultural chemical laboratory of Joint Stock Corporation "Kunarlylyk".
They will also make plans for fertilizers application and, jointly with stations of plant protection, use of
chemicals.
29.           The project has many positive impacts, most notably a reduced use of irrigation water
as a result of increasing the efficiency of irrigation systems. Proper design and practice of irrigation and
drainage will also ameliorate soil in the fields and improve crop yields. In a simple sense, drainage
removes pollutants from soil and transfers them to groundwater, which may need to be drained away
from the fields. Quality of water to be drained from fields has been tested, and feasibility studies will
include provisions of designs to maintain water quality suitable for fish production in any natural waters
that receive drainage from sub-projects. Alternatively, drainage water of suitable quality may be reused
for irrigation of crops. Water of poorer quality may be used to water forest belts adjacent to fields. If
quality of drainage water is not sufficient for irrigation of forest belts, and it cannot be discharged into
a natural water, drainage water must be diverted to an evaporation basin. This is the least preferred
alternative, but newly created lakes may enhance regional ecology and economy.
30.           The research and design agencies of the republic have proposed plans to mitigate
environmental effects of sub-projects. The State Committee for Forestry and its forest reclamation
stations are ready to design and construct forest reclamation belts to prevent wind erosion.
"Kazmekhanobr" has proposed a method of cleaning of drainage discharge. The National Academy of
Science proposes biological reclamation of salinized irrigated areas in rice fields by composting rice
