INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Senegal for the equivalent of US$15.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance an education project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of Senegal" (212-SE) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on September 10, 1973. Country data appear in
Annex I.
Past Development
3.        During the 1960's, the Senegalese economy experienced virtual
stagnation, as real output increased less rapidly than population, and per
capita GNP declined. Two factors were responsible for this situation. First,
with independence, Senegal lost its privileged position as the center of French
West Africa and therefore had to adjust to reduced economic, administrative,
and political dimensions. Secondly, the difficulties of adaptation to the
new situation were compounded in the latter part of the decade when ground-
nut production fell by 50 percent due to unfavorable weather and falling
export prices. In 1971, a combination of several favorable factors includ-
ing the recovery of weather conditions, increased incentives for rural pro-
duction, promising results of rural diversification, and a successful drive
to promote industrial exports seemed to mark the beginning of a period of
considerably higher growth. As it turned out, the economic upturn was
brief as 1972 brought the Sahel's most severe drought in this century.
4.        In 1972, agricultural and livestock production fell by more than
25 percent, setting back the standard of living of the rural population
(representing 70 percent of the total) below the level reached in the early
1960s. Food emergency operations helped avoid widespread starvation, but
notwithstanding this aid both the fiscal and balance of payments situations
sharply deteriorated in 1973 and early 1974.
5.        During 1973, the balance of payments situation was characterized
by substantial reserve losses. At the end of the year, net reserves stood
at minus US$28 million, the lowest level since independence. The main under-
lying factors in 1973 were a sharp drop in groundnut production and exports and



- 2 -
a continued increase in imports, mainly of foodstuffs. Even unusually high
aid inflows, including substantial food aid, were not sufficient to finance
the deteriorating trade balance. In 1974, both imports and exports increased
markedly, by an estimated 37 and 57 percent respectively, following rapidly
rising prices and slightly higher quantities of Senegal's major exports
(groundnuts, phosphate and petroleum products) and imports (food, petroleunm
and general imports). The more rapid climb in exports will result in a nar-
rowing of the goods and non-factor services deficit from an all-time high of
US$88 million in 1973 to an estimated US$50 million, still a high figure for
Senegal. With the help of a US$18 million drawing under the IMF oil facility,
the net reserve position of Senegal is expected to remain unchanged in 1974.
6.        During 1972 and 1973, under the impact of the drought public fin-
ances also took a serious turn for the worse. Public savings net of amortiza-
tion, which had substantially improved during the preceding years, w7ere all
but wiped out in 1972/73 and 1973/74 as revenues were affected by the decline
in economic activity and recurrent expenditures were further increased by the
consequences of the drought. Thus, at mid-1974 and in spite of a 70 percent
increase in groundnut export prices, a large part of which was transferred
to the Stabilization Fund, the public finance situation was more tense than
it had been since 1960. A marked increase in salaries to compensate for the
rapidly increasing cost of living, substantially higher debt service payments
and perhaps miost importantly, heavy consumer subsidies to dampen the effect
of sky rocketing food import prices, were mainly responsible for this situation.
Prospects
7.        Faced with this difficult financial position, the Government took
a number of steps in November 1974 which are expected to bring about a very
substantial improvement in public finances.
8.        Consumer prices for rice, sugar, and groundnut oil were raised to
bring them more closely in line with world market prices. Thus, the rice
subsidy was completely eliminated (an increase of 70 percent in the consumer
price), the price of sugar was increased by 90 percent (leaving a subsidy of
about 20 percent) and that of groundnut oil was raised by 43 percent (leaving
a subsidy of about 20 percent). The remaining subsidies are to be eliminated
at a later date. At the same time, producer prices for groundnuts, rice, and
cotton were increased substantially (40 percent for groundnuts, 35 percent
for cotton and 20 percent for rice) to stimulate production and offset the
effects of accelerating inflation. Also, Government salaries were raised
by 16 percent on the average, but ranging from 60 percent for the lower
salaries, to 3 percent for the higher salaries, to compensate for the rapid
increase in basic commodity prices.   It is estimated that the net effect of
these measures will be to save about US$25 million for the Government in FY75,
and US$35 million in FY76, or 12 percent of the Central Government current
revenues.
9.        Also, following the five-fold increase in world market phosphate
prices and the revision of the tax agreement between the Government and the
major phosphate mining company in the country, Government revenues from this



sector will be considerably increased in the coming years. The good 1974/75
harvest will improve the Government revenue picture further.
10.       Thus the public finance situation in FY75 is expected to show a
marked improvement as compared to FY73-74, although Government participation
in the financing of public investments will remain small for the rest of this
fiscal year. In the following years, however, the public sector should be
able to finance about 20 - 25 percent of public investments, and sustain a
rate of increase in investments of about 5 percent p.a. in real terms. In
view of the magnitude of Senegal's external capital requirements and the
severe constraints on Government's ability to mobilize additional domestic
resources, it will continue to be necessary for external lenders to finance
a portion of the local costs of high priority projects.
11.       The measures mentioned above will also have a favorable effect on
the balance of payments situation in 1975. In that year, as the good 1974/
75 harvest will more than offset the effects of an expected deterioration
in the terms of trade, the balance of payments is expected to be in equili-
brium. For the period 1976-78, it is estimated that the terms of trade
index for Senegal will continue to fall, mainly as a result of an expected
drop in groundnut oil and phosphate prices of about 20 and 30 percent respec-
tively between 1975 and 1977. Therefore, as no major increase in the export
volume is anticipated, Senegal's exports are expected to stagnate in the
coming years, resulting in an estimated annual average balance of payments
gap of about US$20-25 million during 1976-77. After 1978, a new phosphate
mine is expected to come into production, while phosphate prices are expected
to resume their upward trend. These prospects combined with a more favorable
long-term outlook for groundnut production could result in a healthier balance
of payments position towards the end of the seventies.
12.       Weather conditions will remain critical to Senegal's growth prospects.
But with the rapid development of irrigated agriculture which started in the
1960s, the agricultural development of areas less affected by rainfall fluc-
tuations (Casamance, Eastern Senegal) and substantial gains in industry,
tourism and fisheries, by 1980 weather conditions should be a less decisive
factor than today. The Fourth Development Plan (1973/74-1976/77) continues
to give highest priority to rural development (36 percent of the total),
housing/public utilities (18 percent) and transport infrastructure (16 percent).
Industry and tourism, quite justifiably, see their share increase from 5 to
10 percent of the total. Assuming average rainfall conditions, Senegal's
growth in real terms in the remainder of the 1970s will be of the order of
4.5 percent or about 2 percent per capita, which is still a considerable
improvement over the past decade.
Creditworthiness
13.       The terms of foreign aid to Senegal have been progressively harden-
ing over the years. The proportion of grant aid declined from 85 percent in
the mid-sixties to 50 percent in FY72. Faced with a severe shortage of public



- 4 -
savings, the Government borrowed heavily on the Eurodollar market in the past
two years, in order to avoid a slowdown in public investments and to finance
acquisitions and participations by the public sector. Starting in FY74, this
led to a substantial increase in the public debt service which is expected
to absorb about 60 percent of public savings in FY75. This ratio should
decrease again in the coming years, following the marked improvement expected
in the public finance situation. As far as the balance of payments is con-
cerned, at 5-6 percent of export earnings, Senegal's external debt service
is still very low. But Senegal will have to remain prudent in its public
debt management particularly with respect to Eurodollar-type borrowing, given
the manageable but still difficult balance of payments and foreign exchange
reserves situation expected in the coming years.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SENEGAL
14.       The Bank Group has had 19 operations in Senegal to date.    Total
lending amounts to US$84 million (net of cancellations), including eleven
IDA credits, four Bank loans, one blend of Bank and IDA funds and three IFC
operations. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of October 31, 1974 and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.
15.       Execution of these projects, apart from the Railway Project and
the Site and Services Project, is moving forward without exceptional delays.
The Procurement for the railway has been slow due to time consuming contract
approval procedures, but most project components have now been received or
ordered. The railway's operating and financial deterioration has been stopped
and measures taken by Government have resulted in a slight improvement. The
Site and Services Project is about one year behind schedule. The main causes
for the delay were the unexpected need to pass a law, rather than a decree,
to reorganize the executing agency (OIILM), the delay in recruitment of
technical assistance and the difficulty experienced by OHLM in getting prompt
cooperation from other ministries and government agencies involved in project
execution. Terracing of the first sub-site for Dakar was finished 17 November
as opposed to the earlier estimate of August and with an unexpected cost
reduction. There is a possibility that some families will, therefore, be
able to take formal possession of their sites by February 1975.    Some of the
agricultural projects, such as the Terres Neuves Project and the Casamance
Rice Project, were hampered by delays in receiving the Government's counter-
part contribution; however, owing to efforts of the project authorities,
physical implementation of these projects is proceeding generally according
to schedule.
16.       In view of Senegal's need for substantially higher capital inflows,
the scale of Bank Group lending is expected to increase significantly in the
future. The Bank Group share of foreign aid disbursements is expected to
increase from 10 percent in 1969-71 to 25 percent by 1979. The Bank Group
would continue to be the third largest aid donor (after France and the
European Economic Community).



-5-
17.       The objectives of Bank Group project lending in Senegal fall under
four main headings. Top priority will continue to be rural development, in-
cluding intensification of groundnut production and diversification into new
crops and new regions (e.g., the proposed Sine Saloum and Livestock Projects).
As in the past, our agricultural lending is expected to exceed one third of
the total. Secondly, we shall assist diversification of the economy by lending
for the growing sectors of tourism, industry and fisheries (e.g., the proposed
tourism infrastructure project on the Petite Cote and a possible Ship Repair
Project, based on studies financed under Loan S-3SE). Thirdly we shall con-
tinue investment for modernizing and expanding the country's infrastructure
(e.g., two proposed highway projects and a proposed fishing wharf at Dakar
Port). Finally we shall continue lending to reorient and expand the country's
education system, as in the proposed project.
PART III - EDUCATION IN SENEGAL
18.       In the past, education in Senegal, largely patterned on the French
system, has been oriented towards the preparation of a small minority for
higher education rather than towards the needs of the majority of students
for a functional education relevant to the practical needs of everyday life.
Only 38 percent of the 6-12 age group were enrolled in primary school in
1973 and even this relatively low participation rate conceals significant
regional disparities. This means by the year 2010, 62 percent of those in
the 42-48 age group will not have had even the barest formal education. The
primary school enrollment rate is expected to reach only 50 percent of those
eligible by the year 2000. Lower secondary schools in Senegal suffer from
large classes and high repeater rates and lack the facilities, materials and
trained teachers for science and practical subjects. The recruitment of
students for upper secondary education on the basis of national examinations
continues the bias in favor of the urban, better-off students in contrast to
rural areas which have been traditionally less favored.
19.        The output of Senegal's education system at the lower skill level
exceeds quantitative requirements. However, there are also qualitative im-
balances. About 11,000 of the 16,000 students who complete primary school
each year do not go on to secondary school and are thus likely to seek employ-
ment, particularly in urban areas, where their lack of maturity and specific
skills makes it difficult for them to find employment in the modern sector.
In rural areas, primary leavers stand a better chance of employment on family
farms, especially if part-time training programs, designed to strengthen the
students' ties with the rural sector, can be implemented. Research and
development are required to make primary education cheaper and more relevant
for both urban and rural sectors and also to develop non-formal training
programs to equip primary leavers with skills to make them more employable.
At the middle level, given the need to fill some positions with experienced
personnel upgraded from the skilled level, there may be a slight surplus from
the education system. However, shortages of trained personnel, in particular
for new economic activities, justify the creation of new training facilities.



- 6 -
And at the upper level, output from the University, the new Ecole Polytech-
nique and the IDA financed IUT (Institut Universitaire de Technologie)should
be sufficient to meet requirements of the modern sector particularly since a
proportion of high level manpower requirements must be filled by upgrading
of existing experienced staff.
20.       The major constraints to educational development in Senegal are in
the following areas:
i.   Senegal's recurrent expenditures on education repre-
sent    about 25 percent of the national recurrent budget.   Therefore,
possibilities for additional allocations to the sector are limited. The
Government is already taking measures to reduce financial pressures by
shortening the length of the primary program by one year. It will be
important in the future to maximize the use of existing facilities and
teachers and to establish imaginative low cost programs in areas where
expansion is important.
ii.   Planning and management are weak and must be improved to up-
grade the content and efficiency of the existing system, and to explore new
types of educational structures and programs.
iii.   The lack of practical, employment-oriented programs in secondary
education and of teachers to implement them are serious obstacles to producing
students whose knowledge is relevant to the country's needs.
iv.   The absence of practical education and training programs for
children not selected for further education beyond the primary level.
21.       In general, the government's strategy is coherent from economic,
social and pedagogical viewpoints and attacks priority areas. Specifically,
the Government seeks: the qualitative improvement of the lower secondary
program by the introduction of practical scientific and technical courses
which prepare for further education, formal and on-the-job training or family
care; the development of vocational training/upgrading programs presently
lacking; the development of education programs for rural and urban primary
school leavers and illiterates in the same age group; and the exploration of
alternatives to the ill-adapted, long and expensive primary program. It also
seeks to improve the planning, management and evaluation of ongoing and pro-
posed education/training programs. The strategy is also tactically and
pedagogically sound. Basic education aims at providing the minimum skills
and knowledge for participation in development and the lower secondary
programs seeks to extend and complement this minimum program by giving a
practical, scientific and technical orieuitation to those students who will
enter the system's higher levels and eventually find employment in the modern
sector. At the same age level, primary leavers require more specific prepara-
tion for work and the Government intends to pursue the development of non-
formal education programs for both rural and urban areas. Measures to correct
inefficiencies at the other levels of the system are also in order: the
management of upper secondary schools, for example, must be improved; the
University of Dakar requires progressive adaptation to the country's needs;



- 7 -
and technical and vocational education requires consolidation and closer links
with employment. However, qualitative improvement, in particular, giving a
more scientific and technical bias to upper secondary and university education,
depends on improving the level of entering students, particularly in practical
and scientific knowledge and skills.
22.       The Bank Group has previously been involved in the development of
the Senegalese educational system. The first education project (Cr. 253-SE,
for US$2.0 million) was designed to rehabilitate existing training facilities
for skilled manpower for industry and agriculture and to provide the ex-
panded facilities needed to train upper level technical staff. The project
comprised the construction and equipment of an upper level technician training
institute, equipment for two existing technical lycees and for the National
Marine Training School, and construction and equipment for an existing agri-
cultural school. The first project would have been broader in scope if evolv-
ing plans for educational reform had been further advanced at the time of its
appraisal. After delays in the appointment of architects, agreement on archi-
tectural designs and the appointment of acceptable consultants for the reorgani-
zation of the National Marine Training School, project implementation is now
proceeding satisfactorily.
23.       France has been the major source of external assistance in Senegalese
education, principally in the form of salaries of expatriate teachers. France,
Canada and FED have also assisted in financing the recurrent costs of the Uni-
versity of Dakar. Canada is contributing Can.$7.4 million towards the construc-
tion of a 350-place higher polytechnical school which will begin graduating
business administration/management students in 1978.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       The project was prepared by a UNESCO mission in April, 1973, and
appraised by the Association in May/June, 1973. In order to commence work
on designs so that construction could begin shortly after approval of the
credit, the Government requested the Association to reallocate funds under
the First Education Project (Credit 253-SE) to finance the design work under
the Second Project. This reallocation was approved in October 1973. Consult-
ing architects, acceptable to IDA, have consequently been selected and con-
tracts signed. Negotiations for the project were held in December, 1974.
The Senegalese delegation at these negotiations was led by His Excellency
Mr. Ousmane Seck, Minister of Plan and Cooperation. A credit and project
summary is attached as Annex III. The appraisal report (No. 518 SE) is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Description of the Project
25.       The Second Project would reinforce and expand the scope of the First
Project in meeting modern sector requirements through the introduction of more



- 8 -
practical and scientific programs in lower-secondary education, through speci-
fic vocational training, and through better planning and management of the
education system. The project would also address the need for formal and non-
formal education in rural areas.
Lower Secondary Education
26.       The project includes, by way of assistance to lower secondary
education:
(a) construction and equipment of eleven lower-secondary centers
for the teaching of science, technology and domestic science,
together with technical assistance for program development and
training/upgrading of teachers (US$5.0 million);
(b) the construction and equipment of four lower-secondary schools
in departmental capitals to replace existing temporary facilities
and also provide them with practical facilities for the teaching
of science and technology (US$1.7 million)
27.       The introduction of the science/technology centers represents a
major qualitative improvement of lower secondary education, by shifting
from theoretical instruction towards practical training which would provide
a foundation for further education and for later employment. The centers
would each serve several schools, so as to permit close pedagogical super-
vision and economies of scale in the use of facilities, teachers and equip-
ment. WThen the centers and schools become fully operational they will serve
about one quarter of the lower secondary school population, or 14,000 children
per year. A tracer system would monitor later educational progress and employ-
ment of students trained. (Section 4.03, draft Credit Agreement).
Vocational Training
28.       The project includes, by way of assistance to vocational training:
(a)  a Hotel/Tourism training and upgrading center, for 380 trainees
and a 50 room "hotel d'application", to be located in Dakar
(US$1.4 million);
(b) conversion of facilities, minor construction and equipment at
an existing Dakar Vocational Training School (CQID) to house
a new industrial upgrading program. Technical assistance for
instructors and scholarships for national trainees would also
be financed (US$1.2 million);
(c) Mtinor construction and equipment for the National Marine Training
School to permit the implementation of reorganized programs
(US$0.2 million).



-9-
29.       The Hotel/Tourism center would help ensure the orderly development
of Senegal's rapidly growing tourism industry by improving the quality and
conditions of training. The proposed center, to be located on the western
corniche at a suitable tourist site, would be operated in close coordination
with the industry, which would select the trainees, supervise training and
participate financially in the center's recurrent cost, of which 20 percent
would be met by the anticipated profits of the "h6tel d'application". Tech-
nical assistance will be needed to assist the Government in operating the
center. The Government has requested that the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) provide the services of experts for this purpose.
30.       The existing industrial training center (CQID) is adequate to handle
Senegal's pre-employment vocational training needs. The main shortcoming of
industrial training is the need for upgrading the skills of those already
employed. The present project would take advantage of the under-utilization
of CQID's physical facilities and equipment *and convert some of them to house
new upgrading courses. The center for upgrading would have a capacity of 400
employees for 6-8 week courses. To ensure constant adaptation of programs to
employers' needs, an advisory boars would be established. (See Section 4.03
of the draft Credit Agreement).
31.       The proposed credit would provide US$239,000 for rehabilitation of
buildings and for equipment at the National Marine Training School, an item
included originally under the First Education Project (Credit 253-SE). In
light of delays in the selection of consultants to perform a study of cur-
ricula, equipment and selection procedures required before the detailed pro-
grams and equipment list could be finalized, the Government requested and the
Executive Directors approved (Memorandum IDA/R73-108 of October 17, 1973) that
the proceeds (US$ 210,000) be reallocated to the financing of architectural
designs, preparation of equipment lists and the design of initial training
programs for teachers for the proposed project.
Non-formal Rural Education
32.       The project would also provide for the initial phase of an experi-
mental scheme of village education centers (Enseignement Moyen Pratique - EMP)
to offer primary school leavers and youths or adults who had never attended
primary school with a blend, as appropriate in each case, of practical train-
ing in agricultural and related occupations and in the elements of literacy
and numeracy. This scheme would include: construction and equipment of 30
experimental rural education centers; equipment for an instructor training
center and regional and departmental staff training and supervision teams;
and specialist services to aid in program development and initial instructor
training (US$2.2 million).
33.       Enseignement Moyen Pratique is designed to deal with the practical
educational needs of youth living in rural areas. Because of the limited
absorptive capacity of the modern sector and the relatively few students who
enter secondary school most young people have to seek employment or self-
employment in the traditional urban or rural sector, particularly the latter.



- 10 -
During the 1970s about 11,000 primary school graduates and 60,000 young people
with incomplete or no primary education will enter the labor force each year.
EMP would reinforce the education primary school graduates have already received
and orient them towards rural employment by teaching practical skills, crafts
and other occupations useful to the rural community. For those without primary
education whose practical experience already equips them for rural work, non-
formal education would allow them to acquire new skills to take advantage of
agricultural development schemes. The basic principle of the EMP curriculum,
adopted by the Government, is alternation between theoretical courses and
practical work, the EMP center and the village. The practical training would
usually be activities directly benefitting the village. Centers would be
established throughout Senegal in areas where development schemes are under-
way or planned in order not to raise aspirations about progress which cannot
be fulfilled. Villagers themselves would be active in the EMP's management
to ensure the centers' relevance to genuine community needs. Although the
expenditure required to equip the centers is high relative to a primary
school, it is essential in this initial phase to explore a broad range of
training courses and to use a variety of inputs to discover the most economical
and effective combinations of equipment and personnel. By the third year of
operations, about 3 to 5 percent of the equivalent age group in rural areas
would be involved in EMP. Because of its experimental nature, evaluation would
be a critical part of the EMP project in order to extend the concept in the
future to larger numbers of people. The Government has recently begun the
preliminary preparation studies for a practical, non-formal community-based
urban program for the EMP age group. At the request of Government part of the
specialist services to be provided under this credit would be used to assist
in these studies. (See Section 3.09 of the draft Credit Agreement).
Basic Education Study
34.       Consultants would be financed to aid the Directorate of Planning and
Research in its studies related to the reform of primary education, partly on
the experience gained from EMP (US$0.2 million). The objective is to define
a cheaper, more relevant form of basic education which might to some extent
use national languages and allow local populations to participate in the
management of the education system.
Educational Planning
35.       Technical assistance (US$0.3 million) would also be financed for
the newly organized Directorate of Planning and Research of the Ministry of
Education to help in the organization and management of schools, program
evaluation, analysis of educational costs and the interpretation of manpower
data for educational planning.
Management and Implementation
36.       The existing project unit (headed by the Director of Public Works)
would provide technical services for project administration: recruitment of
specialists, contract administration, procurement, and supervision of project



implementation by the consulting architects and other design and equipment
consultants. An engineer to act as Deputy Director with day-to-day decision
making powers related to project implementation, has been appointed to reinforce
the project unit, together with an additional building engineer, a site super-
visor and appropriate clerical staff. Responsibilities for design and equip-
ment specifications, determination of specialist profiles, as well as all other
decisions concerning pedagogical matters, would be entrusted to officials of
the Ministries or agencies concerned with individual project items.
Costs and Finances
37.       The proposed IDA credit of US$15.0 million would finance the US$8.1
million foreign exchange costs of the project as well as well as US$6.9 mil-
lion of the local costs or 79% of the US$19.0 million total project cost net
of taxes. Remaining project financing would be provided by the Republic of
Senegal.
Procurement and Disbursement
38.       The civil works (US$7.6 million), for the construction of the 47
buildings required for schools would be widely dispersed and too small to
attract the interest of overseas bidders. Such contracts would therefore
be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally, in
accordance with local procedures which are acceptable to IDA. Furniture,
equipment and teaching materials, estimated to cost about US$2.5 million,
would be procured where possible through contracts of at least US$100,000
which would be placed following international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA's guidelines. Small orders of less than US$5,000, up
to an aggregate of US$150,000, would be placed following quotations obtained
from suppliers. A preference of 15 percent or the prevailing tariff, which-
ever is lower, would be given to local manufacturers of equipment, furniture
and teaching materials.
39 .       The credit would be disbursed against (i) 100 percent of the c.i.f.
costs, including delivery, of imported furniture, equipment and materials;
(ii) 100 percent of total expenditures for locally produced furniture, equip-
ment and materials net of taxes; (iii) 63 percent of total expenditures for
civil works; and (iv) 100 percent of total expenditures for specialist services,
technical assistance and scholarships. Any undisbursed balance of the credit
at project completion would be allocated for goods and services related to the
project and mutually acceptable to the Government and IDA.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
4∞ .       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association and
the Republic of Senegal, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the
draft Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately.



- 12 -
41.       The features of the draft Agreement of special interest are
described in paragraphs 28, 31 and 34 of this report.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECONMENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors of the Association approve
the proposed credit.

Projects in Execution 1/
Cr. No. 140   First Agricultural Credit Project;    US$6.0 Million and
Ln. No. 584   US$3.5 Million
Credit of February 10, 1969 and Loan of same date (cancelled);
Closing Date: March 31, 1974
The credit will be fully disbursed.
Cr. No. 198   First Highway Project; US$2.1 Million
Credit of June 19, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The first highway project provided for construction of feeder roads,
purchase of highway maintenance equipment, and a study of road improvement and
maintenance. Execution of the project has been satisfactory. Actual costs
are within appraisal estimates and surplus funds available were used to provide
additional maintenance equipment.
Cr. No. 252   Casamance Rice Project; US$3.7 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The rice production program is progressing satisfactorily. The
number of supervised farmers, as well as the paddy production and yields,
are above appraisal estimates; however, participating farmers marketed
through the project authority only a negligible part of their production.
The feeder road construction program is now in progress.    Due to inflation
factors, the financing of the ongoing project will be exhausted in late 1975
or early 1976. Government intends to propose to the Bank to finance a new
project in early 1976. Present staff situation is adequate. The channelling
of funds to the project is improving. The preparation of the FY 1977 second
phase project is getting underway.
Cr. No. 253   Technical and Agricultural Education Project; US$2.0 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: October 1, 1976
Several changes to the architectural design of the main construction
component of the project and the resulting delays in the procurement of furniture
and equipment made it necessary in June 1973 to lengthen by about six months the
original implementation and disbursement schedule. Implementation is now with-
in the revised schedule and progressing well. The initial delays in implemen-
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

tation, the effect of the US dollar devaluation, and recent abnormal price
increases all result in a cost overrun of about US$500,000.
Cr. No. 254   Terres Neuves Settlement Project;   US$1.35 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Physical execution of the project is progressing satisfactorily and
first year's results (1972) are in line with the appraisal report estimates.
Administrative difficulties in making STN (the State Corporation in charge of
the project) operational held up Government's contribution to project financ-
ing. STN is now operational and the procedural difficulties in providing
Government's contribution to project costs have been resolved and project
implementation should continue as scheduled.
Loan 835-SE/Credit 314-SE      Second Railway Project:  US$3.2 Million and
US$6.4 Million Credit and Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date June 30, 1975
Initial planning of details and procurement has been slow because
of difficulties in getting bids on a sufficiently wide international basis
and because of time consuming procedures for evaluating and approving bids.
Procurement for track renewal is now complete and about 90 percent of equip-
ment for workshop rehabilitation has been ordered. Construction and track
renewal is expected to start soon about a year behind schedule. Poor manage-
ment, inadequate use of locomotives, lack of spare parts and cumbersome
financial restrictions have prevented the railway from satisfying the demand
in Senegal for rail transportation. However, in the last six months Govern-
ment has taken measures to assist the railway, including tariff increases,
subsidies for unprofitable lines and,a study to reorganize technical assist-
ance; the railway had its first positive cash flow in many years in 1973/74.
At Government's request US$1.5 million has been reallocated under the project
for the immediate rehabilitation of locomotive power and rolling stock and for
other high priority investment items in order to increase the railway's capacity,
particularly to carry phosphates for export and international traffic to Mali.
Cr. No. 336    Site and Services Project;   US$8.0 Million
Credit of September 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Although credit effectiveness for the Site and Services Project was
delayed mainly as a result of an unexpected need to pass a law, rather than
a decree, to reorganize the executing agency (OHLM), recruitment of technical
assistance and the difficulty experienced by OHLM in getting prompt cooperation
from other ministries and government agencies involved in project execution,
which has not been satisfactory. Terracing of the first sub-site for Dakar
was finished by November as opposed to the earlier estimate of August 1974 and,
with an unexpected cost reduction. There is a possibility that some families
will, therefore, be able to take formal possession of their sites by February
1975.

Ln. No. 866   Telecommunications Project; US$6.25 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is part of the 1973-1976 telecommunications rehabili-
tation and development program of OPTS (Senegalese postal and telecommunications
organization). It provides for the expansion and modernization of local and
long distance facilities in Dakar and in the northern region of Senegal.
Bids were opened on July 15, 1974, for telecommunications equip-
ment and installation. Because of high prices due to inflation and lack of
international competition among equipment manufacturers, the proceeds under
the loan will not be sufficient to cover the project as appraised. Conse-
quently, the borrower requested the Bank's agreement to the realization of the
most urgent parts of the project. A memorandum to the Executive Directors
seeking approval to reallocate funds and cancel parts of the project is under
preparation.
Ln. No. 867   Airport Project; US$3.0 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This loan for the extension of Dakar airport runway was made effec-
tive on May 22, 1973. Bids were opened on January 8, 1974 for the civil works
for runway and apron improvements. Site work will be completed by June 1975.
Lighting equipment is being purchased and will be installed shortly by ASECNA.
Cr. No. 350   River Polders Project; US$4.5 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project became effective early in June 1973. Procurement is
now completed for the main components of the project and contracts have been
awarded. Construction of works is progressing satisfactorily. The Senegalese
authorities have requested that the Debi/Lampsar components of the project
be deleted from Credit 350-SE and be reformulated within the broader frame-
work of integrated development of the Senegal River Basin. The proposed
reformulation was agreed upon by IDA and an engineering credit for Debi-
Lampsar was appraised in December 1974. Because of price increases and US
dollar devaluation, the proceeds of Credit 350-SE would not be sufficient to
cover the project as appraised, despite the deletion of the Debi-Lampsar
component. Government is presently seeking a supplementary financing of
about US$1.2 million to complete the project.
Cr. No. 366   Second Highway Project; US$8.0 Million
Credit of April 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Implementation of the maintenance program and engineering studies
started about six months behind schedule, but satisfactory progress has since
been made. Bids for pavement strengthening were opened in April 1974, and
the Government is in the process of negotiating a contract. Work is expected
to start during the last quarter of 1974, a delay of about one year. Rapid
inflation and delays in project execution have contributed to raising project
costs for maintenance and pavement strengthening items by about 15% (US$1.5
million) above appraisal estimates (including contingencies).

Cr. No. 404   Second Agriculture Credit Project; US$8.2 Million
Credit of June 7, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Area planted to groundnuts in 1973/74 was about 7 percent below the
previous (drought) year but production was much higher because only small
losses occurred. Production of millet/sorghum was about average, but 50
percent above the previous year. Demand for medium-term credit remains
stronger than anticipated, and available credit funds may not be sufficient
to cover the 1975/76 cropping year. The subsidy on fertilizer has not been
reduced, as required, but the scheduled study under Credit 404-SE should pro-
vide a basis for policy review. Major problems still exist at ONCAD on the
organization and on the financial side despite the strong technical assist-
ance provided since 1969. Government has taken steps to remedy that serious
situation by strengthening ONCAD management with more financial autonomy.
Loan No. S.3-SE     Ship repair engineering loan: US$0.6 million loan of
September 20, 1973; Closing Date: March 6, 1976
The project consists of carrying out of the studies essential to
determine the feasibility of a dry-dock project, including:
A.   Technical studies including those of physical and geophysical
factors affecting site situation.
B.   Economic studies including a market survey, a revision of the
drydock project feasibility study and survey formulating a
training program.
The loan became effective in February 1974 and the studies are
proceeding satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 446-SE Drought Relief Project; US$3.0 tillion Credit of December 7,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is part of the Senegalese plan to help people in drought
affected areas to re-establish their self-sufficiency by assisting them to
redevelop and improve their farms and lands.
The credit became effective in February 1974. All sub-project plans
have been approved by the Bank, Orders were placed in late 1973 for all project
items, most of equipment is already in place and initial delays in disburse-
ments should be reversed shortly.
Ln. No. 987-SE SOFISEDIT Project; US$3.0 Million Loan of May 24, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This development finance company project would meet SOFIDESIT's
financial requirements for financing industrial and tourism projects through
1976.

Procurement
Arrangements: Orders for furniture, equipment and teaching materials,
estimated to cost about US$2.5 million, would be bulked where
possible and contracts would be placed following inter-
national competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank Group
guidelines. A preference of 15 percent or the prevailing
tariff, whichever is lower, would be given to local manufac-
turers of equipment, furniture and teaching materials. Civil
works contracts for the construction of the 47 buildings
required, estimated to cost about US$7.6 million, would be
widely dispersed and too small to attract the interest of
overseas bidders. They would therefore be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance
with local procedures, which are acceptable to the Bank Group.
Foreign suppliers of materials required for the project
should be represented locally and small orders of less than
US$5,000, up to a maximum of US$150,000, would be placed
following quotations obtained from these suppliers.
