EVALUATION OF PROJECT ALTERNATIVES AND COST-BENEFIT
ANALYSES
1. Project Alternatives
Several ministries within the Govemment of Bangladesh have previously evaluated project alternatives as
part of their individual planning and development activities. Following a sequential-step analyses, this
alternatives evaluation surnmarises the findings contained within these reports to formulate a set of
project-specific conclusions pertaining to the preferred:
*   project site location;
*   project fuel resource;
*   generation technology; and
*   mode of transportation for project materials.
This evaluation also includes an overview of the need for a modern electrical transmission system in
Bangladesh as well as the supply of natural gas fuel to the project site. All of the alternatives reviewed as
part of this project are summarised below
1.1 Site Locations
Due to its concentration of population and industry, Dhaka City has the greatest demand for electricity
within Bangladesh. As such, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) has indicated that
new (private sector) power plant development should first occur in the vicinity of Dhaka City (Power
Cell, 1996).
To assist in the development of private sector power plants a consortium based group was formed,
consisting of members from Power Cell, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB),
Petrobangla, and Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited (Titas), and conducted site
visits to seven altemative site locations near Dhaka City. The results of their studies are summarised in

In addition to the consortium's evaluation and ranking of the altemative sites, ESG also conducted a desk-
top review of the seven alternative sites as part of the AES Haripur Power Project (ESG, 1999). Based
upon available information, the desk-top review identified the consortium's evaluation and ranking as
acceptable.
Of the top four sites (i.e., Haripur-KA, Haripur-KHA, Haripur-GA, and Meghnaghat), three sites are no
longer available for developmnent activities. A summary of the current political and/or construction
activities occurring at these altemative sites is provided below.
Haripur - K4
The Smith Cogen Project was tendered in 1997 by the BPDB. This barge-mounted power plant is in
close proximity to alternative site 4 and as such, BPDB removed this site from its list due to the
possibility of cumulative environmental effects. As such, this site has been removed from further
evaluation.

AES Haripur Pvt. Ltd. concluded the signing of the LLA, PPA, GSA, IA, and other agreements in the
winter of 1998 with the relevant GOB ministries. Site filling, grading, and general construction works
began following the signing of the agreements and submission of the EIA to the World Bank and DOE.
Consequently, this site is no longer available for development and has been removed from further
evaluation..
Haripur - GA
The BPDB also discarded alternative this alternative as a possible site for power plant development due to
problems with construction in the local area. Construction of the power plant on this site could adversely
impact the use of the Haripur Substation, making expansion or use of the substation impractical for future
use. ln addition, incoming transmission lines would significantly limit the layout of the power plant.
Consequently, this site has been eliminated from further evaluation.
Meghnaghat
Considering these development proposals and activities, in relation to the four preferred alternative sites,
alternative site 7 (i.e., Meghnaghat) is the only remaining site of those considered and has been selected
as the preferred site for this project. Selection of the Meghnaghat site for power plant developrent is
further supported by the findings of the 1985 and 1995 Power System Master Plans, produced by Acres
International, which identify this site as the next probable large site for development (Acres, 1995). The
Project Sponsor has subsequently signed the LLA, PPA, GSA, IA, among others with the relevant
ministries of the GOB in 1999.
1.2  Fuel Resources
Indigenous natural gas was identified as the preferred fuel for the MPSA by Acres in the 1995 Power
System Master Plan (PSMP) based in part upon:
* availability;
*  certainty of supply over a project's lifecycle;
*  transport distances and costs; and
*  spent fuel emissions.
Confirmation of the fuel selection for Phase I of the MPSA has since been provided by the Project
Sponsor. The following discussion provides an overview of the various fossil fuel sources currently
available in Bangladesh.
Natural Gas
Petrobangla is the responsible government agency for the production of all liquid and gas hydrocarbons.
Under the supervision of Petrobangla eleven onshore gas fields are operated by two of its subsidiary
companies. Occidental of Bangladesh Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Unocal, USA, also operates
an onshore gas field. Offshore, one gas field in the Bay of Bengal is operated by Shell Bangladesh
Exploration and Development B.V., Netherlands. Collectively, these gas fields are currently producing
natural gas with a current daily production capacity of over 1,300 rmillion standard cubic feet per day
(mmscfd). Titas is among one of the three subsidiary distribution and marketing companies owned by
Petrobangla and will supply natural gas to the Project Sponsor under the terms and conditions of their Gas
Supply Agreement.
ESG INTERNATIONAL INC.                                                                B- 3

FINAL ENVIRONMENtAL IMPCAT ASSESSMENT
At Meghnaghat, there is an existing gas connection 400 metres from the boundary of the MPSA. It is
anticipated that this connection can supply enough gas to support power generation facilities up to 1,200
MW (MEP, 1997).
In Bangladesh, the costs of extracting and delivering natural gas are significantly below the costs of using
coal, peat, or crude oil. As for emissions, a natural gas-fired boiler typically releases 56,100 g/GJ of
carbon dioxide (CO2), 17 g/GJ of carbon monoxide (CO), 1.4 g/GJ of methane (CH4), and 67 g/GJ of
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (World Bank, 1998).
Using the most conservative estimates of the existing reserves, Petrobangla has identified proven,
recoverable reserves of natural gas totalling 10.2 trillion cubic foot (Tcf) with a current delivery rate of
1,100 million cubic feet per day (mmscfd). In the fiscal year ended June 1996 the consumption rate of
natural gas for power generation was 100.18 billion cubic feet (Bcf) or 40.2% of that year's production
rate. In the fiscal year ended June 1998, gas consumption for power generation was 137.5 Bcf against the
country's total consumption of 307.23 Bcf (44.75%). It shows that share of natural gas in power
generation is gradually increasing. With the continued exploration and development of new proven and
recoverable natural gas fields in Bangladesh, the country has no immediate or foreseeable supply
shortages. With the recent discovery of a new gas field by Occidental of Bangladesh Limited at Bibiyana
in the Sylhet area with a recoverable reserve of 3.0 Tcf, the country's proven gas reserve has increased to
around 13 Tcf and Unical is planning to develop this gas filed in the near future.
coal
The MEMR is responsible for the overall development and management of coal and other comrnercial
energy resources, while the Bureau of Mineral Development (BMD) is responsible for issuing leases for
coal exploration and development. As of 1995 no coal mines were in operation in Bangladesh, however,
economnically-viable areas have been identified and are currently undergoing development by private and
public sector organizations.
Coal development is a relatively recent phenomenon in Bangladesh. Until recently, deposits were only
known to exist at depths between 650 to almost 3000 metres. Most recently deposits have been
discovered at depths of 75 metres, thus making extraction much more feasible. It has been estimated that
there are 1,782 million tonnes of coal in Bangladesh. The coal mine at Barapukuria is presently under
exploration by Chinese Machinery Consortium (CMS). This mine is expected to produce I million tonnes
of coal beginning in 2001. The coal from this mine will mainly be used in a power plant to be located near
the mnine site.
Along with its limited availability, coal is one of the least environmentally preferred fossil fuels. Coal-
fired boilers release 94,000 g/GJ of carbon dioxide (CO2), 93 g/GJ of carbon monoxide (CO), 2.4 g/GJ of
methane (CH4), and 329 g/GJ of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (World Bank, 1998). For these reasons, coal is
not considered to be a practical nor suitable fuel for the Meghnaghat power plant.
Peat
The 1985 PSMP identified peat as a possible resource fuel for power generation. Since 1985, however,
minimal work has been undertaken in regard to this fuel source as extraction of this resource is difficult
due to the low-lying nature of the Bengal terrain. Further, extraction of such a resource is very labour
intensive that is offset by the low-energy produced from peat. Consequently, this fuel source was
excluded from further evaluation
ESG INTERNATIONAL INC                                                                  B- 4

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPCAT ASSESSMENT
Crude Oil
Traditional liquid fuels used for power generation in Bangladesh include superior kerosene oil (SKO),
high-speed diesel (HSD), light diesel oil (LDO), and grade one heavy fuel oil commonly referred to as
furnace oil (HFO). SKO, HSD, LDO, and HFO are typically imported directly or derived from imported
crude oil refined at Chittagong and distributed throughout the country. The majority of crude oil in
Bangladesh is supplied from the Arabian Gulf.
As a result, crude oil is an expensive source of fuel. In 1995, its estimated cost was US $17/barrel in
constant 1995 dollars (Asian Development Bank, 1995) against the current market price of approximately
US $29/barrel. Additionally, wastes from crude oil combustion include particulates (including heavy
metals), sulphur and nitrogen oxides, and in some cases volatile organic compounds (World Bank, 1998).
For these reasons, crude oil was excluded from further evaluation.
Summary
As noted by the World Bank (1998), the use of coal, peat, and HFO fuels for power generation typically
results in a greater potential for adverse environmental effects when compared to natural gas. Further, the
combustion products of natural gas are the least objectionable of the common fossil fuels. Throughout
most regions of the world, and indeed in Bangladesh, natural gas is the least-cost alternative fuel for
power generation. This makes natural gas the preferred fuel for the Meghnaghat Power Project.
1.3 Generation Technology
As part of the 1995 PSMP, Acres identified combined cycle engines as the preferred, least-cost generation
technology for large thermal power plants (Acres, 1995). Combined cycle technology provides the
mZ        highest thermal efficiency rating while having the lowest generating costs of all fossil fuel plants
operating above 40% load. Consequently, this technology has become the preferred power generation
method around the world, especially where natural gas is available for fuel. In comparison to a steam
turbine plant, a combined cycle plant can be built faster, constructed at a lower cost, and situated on a
smaller land area; all three factors are important for power generation development in Bangladesh.
When operating on natural gas, the environmental impacts of a combined cycle power plant are low in
comparison to oil-fired steam and coal-fired power plants (e.g., lower emissions are produced from
combined cycle technology). In addition, since quantities of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter are
typically negligible in the natural gas fuel, so too are the associated emissions. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx),
cooling water discharge, and noise are generally the main emissions of concern.
To reduce air emissions, several methods can be used to limit the formation of NOx in the turbine
combustors, and include: use of special combustors, keeping air-gas mixtures lean, injecting water or
steam in conjunction with the fuel into the combuster, and selective catalytic reduction devices which
apply an ammonia reactant which converts the NOx to nitrogen and water vapour. With such reduction
methods available, combined cycle technology is the preferred method for power generation.
1.4 Modes of Transportation
All heavy project equipment manufactured outside of Bangladesh (e.g., gas turbines and heat recovery
steam generators) will be shipped to the country's second largest port at Mongla via ocean going vessels.
The country's primary port at Chittagong will not be used for heavy equipment transfer due to congestion
and frequent labour slowdowns. Additionally, any heavy equipment unloaded at Chittagong Port would
need to be carried on shallow barges across the Bay of Bengal, which often experiences unfavorable

marine weather conditions during the monsoon season. Light cargo, consisting of minor construction
materials and spare parts, could efficiently be unloaded at Chittagong Port for transport via road to the
MPSA.
Consequently, the review of alternative modes of transportation is limited to the in-country infrastructures
of rail, river, and road networks. Each mode of transportation is discussed below.
Rail
Based upon desk-top and in-field surveys, there are no existing rail lines in the immediate vicinity of the
MPSA (e.g., within 35 kilometres), nor are there any plans to construct such facilities. As a result, this
transportation option was discarded from further analysis.
River
The Meghna River remains navigable throughout the year, with access to the Bay of Bengal and other
rivers extending up to Mongla Port. Heavy cargo can be shipped through this waterway system, from
Mongla Port to the MPSA, on shallow barges on a year round basis. The Project Sponsor is currently
seeking approval from the Bangladesh Inland Water Transportation Authority to construct a temporary
jetty at the MPSA to facilitate removal of the heavy equipment once it arrives at the project site. This
mode of transportation is the preferred mode of transportation for heavy equipment.
Road
The MPSA is located adjacent to the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the BPDB has constructed of a
small access road from the highway to the MPSA. The Dhaka-Chittagong Highway is one of the
Country's major transport arteries connecting the capital city with its primary port at Chittagong.
Consequently, road transport offers a practical mode of transportation for imported lightweight project
supplies with no additional or supporting infrastructure required from the Project Sponsor.
However, heavy loads cannot be carried on this highway route due to limited load bearing capacity of the
road, its associated bridges, and dimensions (e.g., width). For these reasons, the highway will only be
used to transport light cargo from Chittagong Port to the MPSA.
1.5 Electrical Transmission System
In Bangladesh, 132 kV and 230 kV transmnission lines are the standard high voltages. The 1995 PSMP
noted that in order to increase the efficiency of the existing transmission system, while expanding
delivery capabilities throughout Bangladesh, two key tasks required completion:
* a 230 kV nrng around the Dhaka; and
* a 230 kV transmission line from Chittagong to Cornilla and on to Meghnaghat and Haripur
(Acres, 1995).
These two recommendations are currently in various stages of construction by the Power Grid Company
of Bangladesh (PCGB). Environmental reviews and funding for these undertakings have been provided
by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
Since the 1995 PSMP, the PGCB has been formed as an entity under the BPDB and charged with the
responsibility of constructing electrical lines. With funding from ADB, the PGCB has embarked upon
several projects throughout the Country; generally following the recommendations of the 1995 PSMP..

Power Supply in Bangladesh
As noted (Acres, 1995), Bangladesh is in need of a modern electrical transmission system capable of
___/     transporting ppwer throughout the country. Three principal electrical utilities are currently operating in
Bangladesh: the BPDB, Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority (DESA), Dhaka Electric Supply Company
(DESCO) and the Rural Electrification Boards (REB). Although each of these utilities has similar
mandates, to supply power, the market and function of each utility is different. All three utilities are
regulated by the MEMR.
BPDB, established in 1972, is the largest of the four electrical utilities and is responsible for planning,
construction, and operation of power generation and transmission facilities throughout the Country,
except for Dhaka. As such, they operate most of the high voltage grid with sales accounting for
approximately 49% of the total direct electricity sales in Bangladesh.
In 1990, BPDB transferred the responsibility of power supply to DESA for the urban area of greater
Dhaka, including the Dhaka Metropolitan City. DESA does, however, still purchases power from the
BPDB. Today, DESA supplies approximately 450,000 direct end users, accounting for approximately
38.5% of electricity sales in the Country. However, the differing market mandates of each agency has
partially attributed to an overloaded, inefficient power supply system in and around the Dhaka area.
The REB, established in 1977, is responsible for the distribution of electricity in rural areas through a
system of co-operatives known as Palli Biddyut Samities (PBSs). REB purchases power from both
BPDB and DESA and serves about 2 million customers. REB accounts for approximately 12.5% of the
Country's electricity sales.
Collectively, these utilities had an electrical generation capacity of 3,300 MW with an annual output
>         capacity of 2,000 MW in 1997; a meager increase of roughly 200 MW since 1995 (Huda, 1999; Canadian
High Commission, 1995). The actual power output is currently in the range of 2500 MW to 2,700 MW.
The difference between generation capacity and output capacity is partly attributable to the fact that most
existing power plants are approaching or have exceeded their useful life and to system loss through the
illegal acquisition of power.
1.6 Natural Gas Pipeline
Titas will supply natural gas to the project site via a NPS 20 steel pipeline as per the terms and conditions
of the GSA. Only a small, spur pipeline is required totalling 400 metres in length. Gas to the MPSA will
mainly be supplied by the Titas and other gas fields located in the northern region of Bangladesh. The
country is producing gas at the rate around 1,000 mmscfd, which exceeds that the present rate of
consumption. The gas supply situation in Bangladesh has recently improved after the Jalabad gas field
was brought into production by Occidental of Bangladesh in 1999. Additionally, the offshore supply of
natural gas has increased from the Sangu gas field operated by Shell Bangladesh.
Gas to the project site will be transported through the Ashuganj-Bakhrabad and the Bakhrabad-Demra gas
pipelines. The Bakhrabad-Demra gas pipeline has a capacity of over 200 mmscfd. The daily gas
consumption of the project would be approximately 80 mmscf, which is much less than the total supply
capacity of the gas pipeline. As noted, Titas will build the 400 metre long interconnecting gas pipeline
through a local contractor, and the regulating and the metering station (RMS) by foreign contractors.
Funding would originate from Titas itself and/or the Government of Bangladesh. The RMS will, be
designed to handle a maximum gas delivery capacity of 125 mmscfd to provide for flexibility in the
system.

2. Cost-Benefit Analyses
This cost-benefit analyses utilizes previously published data from Acres (1995) and Mott Ewbank Preece
(MEP) (1997). Where appropriate, these data have been refined to reflect the project-specific conditions
of the Project Sponsor's undertaking.
Review of the Acres and MEP reports, coupled with a exarnination of project-specific costs and benefits,
supports the alternative conclusions (Section 1) that the least-cost option for a new large thermal power
plant includes implementation of:
* Phase I of the MPSA;
*   indigenous natural gas; and
* combined cycle technology.
The following sections are provided in support of the above conclusions.
2.1 Project Costs
A financial analyses, associated with the development of new, private sector funded fossil fuel power
plants in Bangladesh, was undertaken by Acres as part of the 1995 PSMP. Selected results from this
study are shown below in Tables 2 and 3 for capital costs and operation and mnaintenance costs

new project-specific design as identified by the Project Sponsor and the EPC Contractor (Table 4).
Note that the values provided in the table are only associated with the costs of compliance and do not
account for any project benefits. While the benefits of the various design and mitigative measures are
apparent, they are not easily quantifiable without further detailed analyses which are beyond the scope of

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPCAT ASSESSMENT
2.3   Project Benefits
Construction and operation of the power plant will also provide a number of local, regional, and national
benefits, including:
*   contribution of a reliable source of electrical power to the national grid, potentially reducing the need
for load-shedding by the BPDB consequently attracting additional foreign investment;
*   the efficiency of the CCGT, coupled with the use of indigenous natural gas fuel, will allow power to
be produced at the lowest rate in the World while rninimising harmful air emissions and creating
secondary jobs in the gas sector;
*  short-term employment of a large local work force during construction;
*   long-term employment for operations and maintenance personnel;
*   local and regional benefits associated with the procurement of domestic goods and services; and
*  direct foreign investment into Bangladesh and its power sector.
Where local or regional dis-benefits occur as a result of the is project, the Project Sponsor will apply
appropriate protective and mitigative measures and/or compensatory packages.
In addition to these benefits, the comparative evaluation of fossil fuelled power plants undertaken by
Acres (1995) indicates that combined cycle generation technology, while having a moderate installation
cost, provides the highest thermal efficiency. Further, corribined cycle technology offers a wider operating
range (i.e., annual duty) when compared to other fossil power plants (Table 5).

Notes: A capital costs vary widely with type of fuel and emission control requirements.
B assumes a 2+2+1 configuration.
C for smaller, isolated centres only.
2.4 Cost-Benefit Summary
Review of the identifiable project costs reveals that least-cost alternatives (e.g., combined cycle
generation technology fuelled with indigenous natural gas), also have fewer adverse environmental
effects when compared to other large fossil fuelled power plants. The analyses further indicates that
construction of a CCGT power plant at the MPSA will have positive benefits for local and regional
economies while contributing a reliable power source to the national grid. Should local dis-benefits
occur, the Project Sponsor will undertake the appropriate steps to reduce and/or alleviate the identified
adverse impacts.

Reference:  Lease! Licenses for Use of Foreshore Land for Construction of
Unloading Wharf for Barges and Other Infrastructures on
Meghna River
Dear Sir:
We are pleased to inform that AES Meghnaghat Limited ("AESM") entered into an
Implementation Agreement with the Government of Bangladesh ("GOB") on July
29, 1999 for the development of Meghnaghat 450 MW Combined Cycle Power
Plant (the "Project") on a Build Own and Operate basis. The site for the Project is
located at Char Ramjan Sonaullah Mouza under Sonargaon Thana of the
Narayanganj District on the northem bank of the river Meghna.
In order to construct and operate the power plant, it is essential for us to use the
foreshore of the river for the construction of an Unloading Wharf and other
77,re tP0cw;r      infrastructures. The Wharf will be used for unloading the machinery and other
equipment for the Project. The location of the wharf shown in the provisional
construction plan may change when the design is finalized.
A Water Intake Structure will be built to withdraw necessary water from the Meghna
River mainly for use as cooling water for the plant, which will be circulated back to
river at a point downstream through an Outfall Structure. Both the Intake and Outfall
Structures will be constructed within the Project premise and will be connected to
N=<z\-          the river through canals. However, the Outfall Structure will have an erosion
protection structure that will extend 32 meters inside the river from the high river
'bank.
As part of the requirement, we are enclosing the following attachments:
1. Provisional Site Layout (General Arrangement)  (Fig. 1.A)
*  Construction Plan of Unloading Wharf        (Fig. L.B)
*  Construction Plan of Intake Structure        (Fig. I.C)
*  Construction Plan of Outfall Structure      (Fig. L.D)

-2. Money Receipt for the Application Form
.    



We, therefore, request you for lease / license for a period of three years for an area
of total length of 200 meters along the shoreline for the construction of the above
mentioned structures.
If you have any questions, please call Enamul Latifi, Project Manager or myself at
913-2361.
Thank you.

reduce the sound power level from the piping to a value that can be neglected in comparison
with the other Plant noise sources.
The specified noise criteria shall be met under all operating conditions including Start-up,
Shutdown, normal operation and lifting of safety, relief and vent valves. An exceedance of the
Noise limitations will only be allowed during bypass operation (limited to 100 decibels) and
emergency operating conditions where physical damage to the Plant or physical harm to an
individual may result, this shall include the lifting of safety relief valves.
All single frequencies generated (including transformers) may be significant and require
abatement. The Contractor shall ensure that this is included in the noise assessment.
All Plant shall run without undue vibration and with the least practicable amount of noise in all
modes of operation.

INTRODUCTION
It is accepted that industrial development contributes to economic growth, but now it is
universally recognized that it brings along with it a host of environmental problems. In
Bangladesh where the density of population is one of the highest in the world, the impact of
environmental degradation will be significantly more compared to other less densely populated
areas of the world.
The need to create more jobs and raise productivity through industrialization in order to
alleviate poverty is essential for less developed countries like Bangladesh but it is equally vital
that the environment or the eco-system is conserved.
In Bangladesh whatever industrialization has taken place, due attention to the environmental
aspect was not given. In the wake of further industrialization by local entrepreneurs, joint
ventures and Direct Foreign Investment, the environmental issues can not remain
unaddressed.
Therefore, time has come to choose the path whereby degradation of the environment is
mninimized and at the same time the process of industrialization can continue by giving
emphasis on choice of technology, internal and external economics of production and extent of
environmental impact and its mitigation.
Recognizing the changed circumstances and the potential degradation of the environment, the
GOB found it necessary to upgrade the Environmental Pollution Control Ordinance 1977. The
Environmental Conservation Act was passed by the Parliament in February 1995 and came
into force in June 1995 repealing the Environmental Pollution Ordinance Act 1977.
In order to enforce the Act, rules and regulations were required. The Ministry of Environment
and Forest under GOB in a gazette notification published the Environmental Conservation
Rules in August 1997. The rules specify the powers and functions of the DOE and the
responsibilities of industries to ensure conservation of the Eco-system.
The World Bank commissioned BCAS to translate the Act and the Rules and prepare a
guideline with a view to enable industry to have quick access to the requirements of the
Environmental Conservation Act '95 and the Environmental Conservation Rules '97, a
question and answer format is used to make it as user friendly as possible.
A brief description of waste and waste management and aspects of Initial Environment
Examination (IEE), Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), Environment Management Plan
(EMP), and Environmental Management System (EMS) have been covered for appraising
industries of the terminologies used by environmentalists and in the laws on environment.

43            NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
4.3.1        Introduction
In recent years, environmental management has assumed a higher priority in the political agenda of
Bangladesh due to the recognition of the environmental and natural resource pressure exerted by the
nation's growing population. As a result. the govemment has developed a detailed policy framework that
incorporates environmental considerations into all economic development planning. The key policy
docunents are listed below;
*  National Environmental Policy (1992)
*  National Environmental Management Action Plan (NEMAP), 1995.
* National Conservation Strateg,y. 1992
*  Fifth Five Year Plan (1997-2002)
I Environmental Gutidelinesfor lIndustries (Juine 1997)
Each of the above is briefly discussed in the following paragraphs, in relation to the proposed project.

4.3.2          National Environmental Policy
The Bangladesh National Environmental Policy (1992) establishes a framework for environmental action,
together with a broad set of sector-specific actions. Certain general objects are embodied:
*  The need to maintain the ecological balance and to aid development through the protection of the
environment
*  The need to protect the country from natural disasters
*  The need to identify and regulate all types of polluting industry
*  The need to ensure sustainabie utilisation of natural resources
*  The need to promote active association with all environment-related intemational initiatives.
The above objectives represent broad goals that do not specifically apply to industrial development. In
addition to these, the pollution potential of industry is recognised with additional "National Environmental
Policy Objectives". For instance, the Policy recognises the need to conduct Environmental Impact
Assessments for all new public and private industries. It also identifies the need to ensure sustainable use
of raw materials and natural resources.
Finally, the  Policy acknowledges that the Energy and Fuel Sector has significant potential for
environmental impact. In order to limnit such impacts, the government aims to reduce and discourage the
use of those fuels that pollute the environment with particular reference to firewood and agricultural
residues. By contrast, the policy encourages the use of renewable sources.

4.3.3         National Environmental Management Action Plan
The National Environmental Management Action Plan is a wide-ranging and multi-faceted plan that
expands upon the statements given in the National Environmental Policy. The Action Plan was developed
to address issues and management requirements during the period 1995 to 2005, and sets out a framework
within which the recommendations of the National Conservation Strategy are to be implemented.
Its broad objectives are as follows:
*  To identify the key environmental issues affecting Bangladesh
*  To identify actions necessary to halt or reduce the rate of environmental degradation
*  To improve the natural or built environment
*  To conserve habitats and biodiversity
*  To promote sustainable development
*  To improve peoples' quality of life.
In addition, the Action Plan also identifies environmental problems posed by the industrial sector. These
cover issues such as economic constraints on pollution abatement, and lack of incentives for pollution
control.
The plan recognises that unplanned development has resulted in high concentrations of industry adversely
effecting the local environment. In other instances, unplanned development has encroached on to/near to
residential or agricultural land with serious impacts on local people.
2.3.4         National Conservation Strategy
The National Conservation Strategy was submitted to the Government in early 1992. And has undergone
j)             a number of modifications in the years since then. Final approval is expected during 1998. [Is tJzis
statemenz up-to date ??f
The main focus of the strategy is to encourage sustainable development in the industrial sector. In order to
achieve this, strict control whould be placed upon the import of technologies and materials with
environmental significance.  Whilst the import of environmentally sound technology whould be
encouraged, it is recognised that complete dependence on imported technology is unlikely to encourage
environmental and economic sustainability. The strategy also states that hazardous or toxic wastes should
not be imported for use as raw materials.
4-3.3         Fifth Five Year Plan
The Fifth Five Year Plan (FFYP) was formally published in March 1998. It represents one of the most
important planning and policy documents of the government, because it covers all major sectors of
development and intervention.
Within this document, a separate chapter is devoted to 'environment and sustainable development'. This
chapter identifies the major environmental issues of the country. the areas of special concern, the need to
address pollution hotspots. the role of public and private sector co-operation, the level of Government-
NGO co-operation. and financial and disaster management issues. In terms of the goals and objectives. the
plaa calls for promotion of:

a) sustainable environmental management in pursuit of a quality livelihood and to alleviate poverty;
b) participatory, community-based environmental resource management and environmental protection;
C) active participation of the poor, especially women, in environment protection activities;
d) environment-friendly activities in development interventions;
e) preservation. protection and development of the natural resource base;
f) capabilities in the public and private sectors to address environmental concerns;
g) control and prevention of environmental pollution and degradation related to soil, water and air;
h) public awareness for participation in environment promotion activities; and
i) conservation of non-renewable resources and sustaining auto and eco-generation of renewable
resources.
4A .          ENERGY AND POWER POLICIES
The need to develop a reliable system that supplies electricity at a reasonable cost and that overcomes the
country's chronic power shortages and its very low level of electrification, is well acknowledged in the the
govemment considerations of energy policy and the development of the industry in Bangladesh. The
current National Energy Policy was formulated in 1996 by a high level committee headed by the Energy
Secretary. Included amongst its objectives are the following environment-related aims:
-  To ensure sustainable operation of energy utilities
- To ensure rational use of total energy resources
*  To ensure environmentally sound sustainable development programmes causing the minimum damage
to the environment.
In addition to the general incentives offered to private investors in industry, the government has come to
recognise the role that private investment will necessarily have in the energy sector in terms of providing
the level of finance required to ensure that electricity demand is met. Therefore, it has introduced fiscal
incentives to encourage foreign investors into the power sector.
4.3            ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION
4.5.1         Introduction
Althouch a considerable amount of legislation has been established in Bangladesh to (I) protect
environmental health; (ii) control environmental pollution, and (iii) conserve natural resources, only a
small proportion of this legislation will be of direct significance for the proposed project. The legislation
likely to be most important to the project is discussed below.

4-5.2         The Environmental Conservation Act, 1995
The Environmental Conservation Act, 1995 represents the principal legislative framework document'
relating to environmental protection in Bangladesh. It repealed the earlier Environmental Pollution Control
Ordnance of 1977.  The main objects of the Act are the conservation and improvement of the
environment; and control of environmental pollution by taking into account the following:
*  Declaration of ecologically critical areas, and restrictions on the processes which can be carried out in
the ecologically critical area
*  Regulation in respect of vehicles emitting smoke harmful for the environment
*  Regulation of the industries and other development activities using discharge permits
*  Promulgation of standards for quality of air, water, noise and soil for different areas and for different
purposes
*  Promulgation of standard limits for discharging and emitting waste
*  Formulation and declaration of environmental guidelines.
The Act is currently being implemented by the DOE who have wide ranging enforcement powers. For
.instance, the DOE has the authority to suspend industrial activities that are harmful to human life or the
environment. However, the operator has the right of appeal. In instances where environmental damage is
atributable to a particular source, the DOE can insist upon rectifying arrangements by the polluter.
The Act also requires that project Sponsors secure environmental clearance from the Director General of
the DOE, prior to construction. The environmental clearance procedure is described in the following sub-
sections.
Z43I3          Environment Conservation Rules 1997
These represent the first rules. promulgated under the Environment Conservation Act 1995 and establish
a) the National Environmental Quality Standards for ambient air, atmospheric emissions, water, industrial
effluent and noise- and b) the procedures for preparation of an Environmental Impact Assessment and an
Initial Environmental Evaluation and for securing Environmental Clearance.
4.5.4         EIA Guidelines for Industry 1997
The DOE have developed a set of guidelines for carrying out Environmental Impact Assessments. as a
result of the project entitled " To Develop and Apply Sector-wise Industrial Guidelines and Standards and
Standards and to Monitor Compliance".  The guidelines explain the environmental and planning
requirements for developers and highlight the requirements of the Environmental Conservation Act.
4.6            ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS
4.6.1         Introduction
As described above, the appropriate national environmental standards are those applied under the
Environmental Conservation Rules, 1997. No specific requirements for the power sector currently exist in
Bangladesh, but they are being prepared (Ensture this statemnent is up-to-datel

However, because financing for the proposed project is likely to be sought from the World Bank, via
IDCOL. it is important that the scheme also satisfies the appropriate World Bank/IDCOL environmental
criteria for approval of funding.
4.6-2          National Environmental Quality Standards
The National Environmental Quality Standards, conmnonly referred to as the environmental quality
standards, are legally binding across a range of industries.  In addition to these general industrial
standards, the DOE also apply a number of sector-specific ones, covering the following industries;
fertiliser, tannery, integrated textile, food and cement. However, no specific power project standards exist.
The general emission standards have particular reference to oxides of nitrogen in relation to gas based
power plants of different capacities; and to sulphur dioxide emissions, but only from coal fired power
stations. The appropriate Environmental Quality Standards are given at the end of this section.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.   Infrastructure Development Company (IDC), Bangladesh. has been established by the
Government of Bangladesh (GOB) as a Company under the Companies Act to facilitate private
investment in infrastructure development. Using credit made available to the Govemrnment of
Bangladesh by the International Development Agency (IDA), IDC will provide part financial
support to private investors in the power, gas, telecommunications, port, water, waste
management and the highway sector. Private project sponsors are expected to raise at least 60
percent of the required financing in the form of equity and commercial debt.
2.    The Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) has been designed by GOB to provide
IDC with an overall framework to guide the identification, preparation, appraisal and
implementation of environmental and social concerns at the project and at the organizational
level. The ESF reflects the environmental and social guidelines and standards of IDA, since such
guidelines and standards for infrastructure projects in Bangladesh are yet to be developed.
3.    The ESF was prepared, on behalf of the GOB, by the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced
Studies. a leading non-governmental organization active in environmental and social issues. The
report was prepared with desk research on legal and institutional framework, analysis of priority
issues in the infrastructure sector, requirements of the operational directives of the World Bank
Group, and best practice lessons from countries such as India and Sri Lanka. There have been
discussions with NGOs and other interested parties during the preparation of this report.
s    Environmental and Social Policy of IDC
4.    The environmental and social policy of IDC is enshrined in three cardinal principles:
(a)   Enhance the quality of life and environment in and around project locations;
(b)   Prevent adverse environmental and social impacts; and
(c)   Mitizate possible adverse environmental and social impacts.
Environmental and Social Assessment Process
5.    The Environmental and Social Assessment for IDC has been designed taking the
following factors into consideration:
(a)   The legal and institutional setting, and the requirements of the Govemment of
Bangladesh agencies;
(b)   Major environmental and social issues that could be expected in projects to be
financed by IDC;
(c)   IDC's project cycle;
iv



(d)      Requirements of the World Bank's Operational Directives:
(i)     OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment;
(ii)     OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement; and
(iii)     OD 4.20 on Indigenous People
The Environmental and Social Assessment Process is outlined in Table 1. These procedures will
dovetail with the project cycle of IDC. Once the details of the IDC project cycle have been filly
developed. the Environmental and Social Assessment Process will need more definition. The
ESF should be viewed as a dynamic document that should be periodically reviewed to ensure
that it reflects changes in business practices of IDC and the external environment.

CHAPTER I
PURPOSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
Background
1.1   The Infrastructure Development Company (IDC) is a Government Owned Company
established by the Govemment of Bangladesh to promote private investment in infrastructure
development. IDC is being established through the IDA-assisted Private Sector Infrastructure
Development Project (PSIDP).
1.2   The PSIDP will have a mix of technical assistance and lending. Technical assistance will
assist the Government to develop enabling policies and regulation in the power, gas,
telecommunications, port, water, waste management, and highway sector.  The lending
component will address project financing through the provision of long-term subordinate debt
financing through the IDC. The IDC shall contract an Investment Manager (IM) to carry out the
sub-project evaluation, negotiation, recommendation for approval, implementation monitoring,
and supervision on behalf of IDC.
Purpose of the Environment and Social Framework
1.3   The Environment and Social Framework (ESF) is the core policy document on
environment and social issues for the IDC and outlines the operating procedures for addressing
environment and social issues associated with sub-sector projects. The main purpose of the ESF
is to provide IDC with an overall framework to guide in the identification, preparation, appraisal
and implementation of environmental and social concems at the project and at the organizational
level.
1.4   As the executing agency for the PSIDP. IDC will ensure that the contractual framework
for each project complies with the provisions of the ESF prior to obtaining approval of its Board
for financing the project.
1.5   As a detailed guide on principles and procedures for incorporating environmental and
social issues into project preparation, the ESF would be a useful reference to potential project
sponsors and other financing agencies likely to participate in future IDC operations.
Users of the ESF
1.6   As a core policy and procedural document for the IDC. the ESF is designed for use by the
following actors:
(a)   IDC staff: as a document enshrining operating principles and guidelines to ensure
that projects are adequately assessed to ensure compliance with environmental       )
and social standards;
I



(b)   Project sponsor: as a document that spells out requirements with respect to
environmental and social issues that need be met for financing from IDC; and
(c)    Proiect associates (other shareholders, consultants, lenders, etc.): as a document
that explains the compliance requirements for environmental and social
requirements for projects that receive financing from IDC.
(d)   Other relevant government agencies. including DOE for reference.
Structure of the Report
1.7   The ESF is divided into eight Chapters.
*  Chapter 1 explains the purpose of preparing the ESF;
*  Chapter 2 summarizes the environmental and social principles which constitute IDC's
Policy on these issues;
*  Chapter 3 outlines the Legal and Institutional setting of implementation of
environmental and social mitigation plans in Bangladesh and provides the legal basis
for establishing the environmental and social standards/guidelines proposed in the
ESF;
a  Chapter 4 briefly describes some of the major environmental and social issues that
could be expected in the priority infrastructure sub-sectors;
*  Chapter 5 describes the procedural framework for processing candidate projects with
respect to environmental and social issues. including preparation of the
Environmental and Social Assessment Report:
*  Chapter 6 explains the interface between IDC and IDA at various stages of the project
cycle;
*  Chapter 7 outlines the environmental and social risk management in IDC;
*  Chapter 8 describes the institutional structure for facilitating compliance with ESF
provisions.
Preparation of the ESF
I.8   The ESF was prepared by the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS). a
leading NGO in Bangladesh. for the Infrastructure Development Company (IDC). The policy and
2



operating procedure outlined in this report will be reviewed after a year. and if necessary,
revised, based on experience with implementation.
1.9   The report was prepared with desk research on legal and institutional framework, analysis
of priority issues in the infrastructure sector, checks with the operational directives and
guidelines of IDA, discussions with NGOs and relevant government agencies.
1.10 The ESF has been formally approved and adopted by the Board of Directors of IDC.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIAL POLICY OF INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
COMPANY
.1   Infrastructure Development Company is committed to promoting private participation in
infrastructure development in Bangladesh with the understanding that promoting environmental
protection and social development is an integral part of the corporate mission. Environmental
and social issues will be handled through a consultative process integral to IDC operations, along
with policies and procedures which facilitate sustainable development.
2.2    The environmental and social statement of IDC is embodied in the following principles.
(a)    Enhance the quality of life and environment in and around project locations, by:
(i)    conserving and protecting natural resources: and
(ii)    addressing the legitimate concems of relevant stakeholders. especially the
project affected persons.'
(b)    Prevent adverse environmental and social impacts, by
(i)    minimizing the release of pollutants into the environment;
(ii)    reducing pressure on natural resources towards preserving biological
diversity and ecological equilibrium
(iii)    avoiding  or minimizing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement through
appropriate location and design of projects.
(iv)    ensuring protection of vulnerable groups, such as the economically and
socially disadvantaged. women, children. physically handicapped and
indigenous people.
(v)    minimizing health and safety hazards.
(c)    Mitigate possible adverse environmental and social impacts by
(i)   integrating   waste   management  measures  and   maintaining  the
environmental quality of project locations.
(ii)    ensuring that the standards of living and income levels of project affected
persons are improved, or at least restored after project implementation.
This would be facilitated by participatorv resettlement and appropriate
economic rehabilitation of project affected persons.
For the IDC. Project Affected Persons (PAPs) are defined as- all persons. residing in. cultivating or carryin, out
economic activities within the areas required for the project. prior to a formallv recognized cut off date"

CHAPTER 3
LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SETTING
3.1   The institutional and legal setting in Bangladesh provides the context in which the
environment and social assessment procedure for IDC is developed. It is imperative that IDC
financed projects be aware of and respond to the legal and institutional requirements of
Bangladesh.
Environmental Aspects
Constitutional Provisions
3.2   Rights to life, personal liberty and property are enshrined in article 31 and article 32 of
the Bangladesh Constitution, 1972, as fundamental rights. Such provisions exist in many
national constitutions of the world. In India, for example. the right to "life" has been interpreted
by the Supreme Court of India to include, inter-alia, the right to a decent environment to sustain
life with dignity. It is presumed that in an appropriate case dealing with environmental matters,
the Supreme Court of Bangladesh may resolve to make a similar interpretation of right to life,
and if this is done so, then a gross deprivation of the standard environrmental condition would be
endorsed by the said Court under its extraordinary jurisdiction (Art. 102) as a fundamental right.
In a recent High Court ruling, it has been established that well known Non-Govermnental
Organizations can lodge com'plaint in a court of law in case of interference with any public
interest This was endorsed by High Courts Extraordinary Jurisdiction provided in Art. 102 of
the Constitution.
Environmental Legislation
3.3   The umbrella legislation is the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act. 1995 (refer to
Annex I for an unofficial English translation). This Act of 1995 was developed on the earlier
Environment Pollution Control Ordinance, 1977, and came into force on June 5. 1995. through a
notification of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (dated May 31, 1995). However, a total
of 23 laws have been identified which contain provisions regarding conservation of environment
and control of pollution from various sources. For example, the Penal Code, enacted as early as
1860. has provisions to check pollution to the atmosphere: the Fish Conservation Act. 1950.
provides for measures to ensure undisturbed spawning grounds; the Bangladesh Wildlife
(Preservation) Order. 1973, prohibits certain dealings with specified species of wildlife. etc.
Table 3.1 lists some of the major legislation which regulate environment in Bangladesh.

Major International Conventions, Treaties and Protocols (ICPTs)
3.5     There are a number of ICPTs in the field of environment, dating back to as early as 1933.
Not all of them have the same significance or relevance for Bangladesh. A list of the ICPTs that
have relevance to Bangladesh are listed in Annex 2. IDC will strive to be current on the
evolving climate of intemational agreements, and implications for projects to be financed.
Regulatory and Institutional Framework
3.6    In 1989, the Ministry of Environment and Forest was established to address the emerging
environment related issues. In 1995, the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act (BECA) was
enacted, the Department of Environment (DOE) was established, and the Director-General
(DOE) empowered to undertake activities for the "conservation of environment,.development of
environmental standards, and environmental pollution control and reduction which may be
appropriate and necessary under the provisions of the Act". The DOE is operational. though the
complete organizational structure is yet to be established. However, several line Ministries have
legal and regulatory power related to the Environment as shown in Table 3.3

3.7   The National Environmental Policy of 1992, provides policy guidance for environmental
protection and preservation. In 1992, the National Conservation Strategy was drafted, and in
1995. a National Environmental Management Action Plan (NEMAP) was prepared.  The
National Environmental Policy Statement underscores the emphasis on maintaining a balance
between development and conservation of the environment and natural resources:
*     Maintenance of ecological balance along with overall progress and development
of the country;
*     Protection of the country against natural disasters;
*     Identification and control of all types of activities leading to pollution and
degradation of the environment;
*     Environmentally-sound development in all sectors.
*     Sustainable, long-term and environmental congenial utilization of all natural
resources, and
*     Active association with all environment-related international initiatives.
Rules, Guidelines and Standards
3.8   Rules, guidelines and Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) in different sectors are
being framed. Some sectors such as water, rural infrastructure development, etc. developed
environmental assessment guidelines before the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act of
1995 was enacted. However, since the enactment of the BECA, all development projects fall
under its umbrella. Under section 20 of the BECA, the DOE/MOEF is mandated to formulate
the regulatory framework, rules, procedures and EQS. To date, guidelines for Environmental
Assessment in the Industrial Sector (discussed elsewhere in the Report) and a draft EQS for the
industrial sector have been developed.
3.9   The DOE has formulated the draft environmental quality standards for the industrial
sector comprised of the following.
*  water quality standards
  treated sewage standards
*  industrial effluent standards
*  ambient air quality standards
*  air emissions standards
*  motor vehicle exhaust emission standards. and
*  noise standards.
The proposed EQS for Bangladesh and a comparison with other countries in the Region is shown
in Annex 3. Surface waters are classified into seven categories of beneficial use: (1) drinking
water source: (ii) recreational, (iii) fishery; (iv) industrial;  (v) irrigation:  (vi) livestock
watering; and (vii) coastal waters. Three sets of general effluent standards have been specified in
the draft EQS -- for discharge to inland surface waters. discharge to sewers connected to effluent
10



treatment plants, and discharge onto land for irrigation. The draft EQS proposes four sets of
ambient air quality standards to be applied to the following areas:
Category                                    Type of Land Use
A                                           Industrial and mixed use
B                                           Commercial and mixed use
C                                           Residential and rural
D                                           Sensitive areas
Environmental Assessment Process in Bangladesh
3.10  The BECA, 1995, stipulates that "no industrial unit or project shall be established or
undertaken without obtaining environmental clearance from the Director General (DG),
Department of Environment (DOE) in the manner prescribed by the Rules. Further, the Act has
bestowed DOE with the rule-making power vide section 20 of the Act; clause (2) (f) of this
section requires that rules be made to " evaluate. review the environmental impact assessment
(EIA) of various projects and activities and procedures be established for approval". These Rules
are expected to be promulgated vide government notification, following completion of the
preparation of industrial guidelines, and will describe the procedure to be followed to obtain
environmental clearance. According to the guidelines, the project proponent is responsible for
preparing the EIA, either with in-house resources or by employing the services of a consultant.
3.11   There are slightly different procedures for industrial projects, and projects in other
sectors. The EIA procedure for industrial projects consists of three stages: (I) screening; (ii)
initial environmental examination (IEE); and (iii) detailed examination. The EIA Process for
Industrial Projects is described in Annex 4.
3.12   Currently, for non-industrial projects. either EIA's are done by the project sponsor and
then sent to the DOE for environmental clearance by the sectoral line agencies of the
govemment. or sometimes project proposals are sent by the line agencies to the DOE for
environmental clearance without an EA. In both cases. DOE reviews the projects and conducts
environmental screening and decides whether the projects require an Initial Environmental
Examination (IEE) or an EIA, or no EIA. For reviewing both industrial and non-industrial
projects and providing environmental and site clearance, the DOE has constituted a technical
committee chaired by the Director (Technical), and comprised of Deputy Director
(Enforcement). Deputy Director (Research), Joint Director (Biodiversity) and Project
Coordinator. For the non industrial sector project there is no clear cut guideline for preparation.
and review of environmental assessments. Thus the procedure followed by the DOE for giving
environmental clearance of the projects in the non industrial sectors is still very much on adhoc
basis. In practice. committee uses the draft industrial sector guidelines and guidelines of some
many multilateral institutions as guidance while reviewing the non industrial sector projects.
though there is no executive order of the government to do so.
It may be mentioned here that in some sectoral EA guidelines are being prepared such as gas and
oil sector. inland water transport, etc. However, in many of the sectors, EA guidelines are yet to
ll



be developed. It may be recommended that in absence of any sectoral guidelines, the DOE
should make one environmental clearance procedure for the non industrial sector, by combining
J )    the EA  guidelines of the World Bank. Asian Development Bank, etc., until guidelines in other
sectors are prepared.
World Bank Operational Directive on the Environment
3.13    The World Bank's Operational Directive 4.01 (OD  4.01) outlines policy and procedures
for environmental assessment of projects funded by the World Bank Group (which includes
IDA). Key characteristics of OD 4.01 include categorization of projects based on potential
environmental impact, the EA process throughout the entire project cycle, the consultation with
affected groups and public disclosure of EA reports. For details of OD 4.01, refer to Annex 5.
Operations of IDC will conform with the requirements of OD 4.01
Comparison of Bangladesh Requirements with OD 4.01
3.14    The EIA  process under both the legislation in Bangladesh and OD 4.01 have their own
requirements. which do not necessary match. A  comparison is made to identify similarities and
differences, so that a process meeting more stringent of the requirements can be applied to IDC
projects.   Table 3.4  lists some  key  comparisons, and  discusses the requirements  for the
Bangladesh law with OD 4.01. In general, OD 4.01 requirements are more comprehensive when
compared with the requirements of Bangladesh legal system.

Social Aspects
3.15   The laws, regulations and guidelines that are applicable to projects involving land
acquisition, resettlement and other social issues in Bangladesh are discussed below. These laws
and  guidelines  and  the  World  Bank's  Operational Directive  number 4.30  (Involuntary
Resettlement) and 4.20 (Indigenous Peoples) have been taken into account while preparing the
ESF. Preparation, processing, implementation and monitoring of the social issues component of
the specific sub-projects will be carried out in accordance with the specific provisions of the
ESF.
Constitutional provisions
3.16   The fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of Bangladesh indicate the
general guideline for a policy on resettlement/rehabilitationof citizens affected adversely (whatever
be the mechanism) due to any activity of the State. However, there is a certain ambivalence.
Article 40 states categorically that every citizen has the right to practice any lawful occupation
which implies that anything that impedes such right should either be not done or there should be
supplementary   measures   to   make   Food   the   losses   incurred   by   the   citizens.
Resettlementlrehabilitation of adversely affected people due to infrastructure development very
clearly falls within such supplementary measures.
3.17   The Constitution. however. restricts the right of citizen categorically when under Article
(42). sub-clause (2) it states that no law with provision of compensation for acquisition of land can
be challenged in a court on the ground that such compensation has been inadequate.
13



Land Acquisition Acts
3.18  In 1982. the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, came in force.
This law replaced the earlier law. The Land Acquisition Act. 1894 (I of 1894) and others that have
been in force between 1947 and 1982. and. is the major basis for all the present actions regarding
acquisition. resettlement and rehabilitation. The relevant and salient points of the 1982 law are as
follows:
*     "Property" means only immovable property (land and building) and includes any
right in such property.
*     "Owner' includes the occupiers;
*     Matters to be considered in determining compensation include
-     the market value of property
-     damage to standing crops or trees due to acquisition
-     damage due to severance of acquired property from other property at the
time of actual taking of permission by concerned authorities
-     damage to other properties or earnings
-     expenses for relocationof residence
-     damage due to lowering of profit of the property to be acquired between the
serving of acquisition notice and actual acquisition.
3.19   While the rules under the Act 'appear' fairly generous, problems often arise in.
implementing the provisions of the Act. Determining market value and damage to property or
income are difficult to establish in normal circumstances. It becomes more so in an emotion
charged situation such as acquisition of land in a land-scarce and agricultural-dependent society.
Arbitrariness is almost certainly likely to result. The situation is not helped by assigning by the
government to itself sweeping powers in matters of acquisition. Read with the Article 42. sub-
clause (2) of the Constitution referred to above, there is every chance that the acquisition may not
be entirely necessary. that compensation may be rather inadequate or paid such later than actual
acquisition.
3.20   To sum-up the legal context. while there are constitutional and legal provisions for
acquisition and payment of compensation for acquisition of land and other immovable property for
state-determined purposes. there are also uncertainties in the actual practice because of lack of clear
guidelines. sweeping power given to Deputy Commissioners who actually serve notice and take
possession of acquired property and the denial of legal instruments to citizens against such actions.
3.21   Of late. however. there have been certain changes in practice. Thus, one finds a very large
resettlement and rehabilitation scheme for the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge (JMB) financed among
others by IDA. In this case a very large group of people has been affected due to acquisition of
land. A ResettlementAction Plan (RAP) to address the issues of resettlementand rehabilitationof
14



this and other. groups of project affected people (PAP), more or less in line with the IDA's      N
operational directive on involuntary resettlement. has been prepared and put in operation. The
legality of such actions depend on the Jamuna Bridge Ordinance. Other infrastructure development
Projects such as the Coastal Embankment Rehabilitation Project II or the Second Road
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project have in various degrees followed a similar resettlement and
rehabilitation scheme. While these are positive development the fact remains that these are all ad-
hoc measures.
3.22  The present laws, acts, regulations and rules are not very explicit regarding resettlement and
rehabilitationof project affected people (PAP). One can. however, as indicated earlier interpret the
spirit and letter of these laws (including constitutional provisions) and rules to imply that
resettlementand rehabilitationof people adversely affected due to the project is the responsibilityof
the project authorities. As a result, in recent years there have been several instances where attempts
have been made and are being made to take affirmative action. In all such cases the core idea is to
prepare an entitlement matrix based upon an entitlement policy. Entitlement here means the rights
of the persons adversely affected by the project to receive certain benefits from the project
authorities to compensate for their losses which may include land and other immovable property,
income. standing crops. occupation etc. The compensation is often in terms of cash grants but also
includes training and credit facilities and other necessary facilities in resettlement and
rehabilitation.
3.23  The most widely referred to and the most comprehensive in terms of size and scope is the
resettlement plan under the Jamuna Bridge Project (JBP). Others include the Second Road
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP-I[), Coastal Embankment Rehabilitation Project-1l
(CCERP-Il). River Bank Protection Project (RBPP) and Second Rural Roads and Markets
Improvement and Maintenance Project (RRMIMP-2) of LGED. Other such plans or experiences
include those of the Occidental Petroleum Company in development of gas fields in the Jalalabad
Franchise Area. The proposed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), Entitlement Matrix (EM) or Land
Acquisition Plan (LAP) for IDC incorporates the spirit and experiences of these projects and
activities.
World Bank Operational Directives regarding Social Aspects
3.24  The World Bank's Operational Directives OD. 4.30 and OD 4.20 describes the Bank's
policies with regard to involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples affected by projects
financed by the Bank. Refer to Annex 7 for these Directives. Salient points from these Operational
Direciives are discussed below:
(a)    World Bank OD 4.30 (Involuntarv Resettlemen). This directive explains the Bank
policies and procedures on involuntary resettlement and the conditions that
borrowers are expected to meet in operations involving resettlement. The overall
objective of the Bank policy is to ensure that the population displaced by a project
also benefits from the project and that the standards of living are improved. or at a
minimum. maintained. It emphasizes the development approach in planning and
15



implementation of resettlement action plans. with the participation of the affected
groups.
(b)     World Bank OD  4.20 (Indihenous Peoples).  This directive describes the Bank
policies and procedures for projects affecting indigenous peoples - social groups
with a social and cultural identity that is distinct from the dominant society. The
objective of the policy is to ensure that development programs are socially and
culturally compatible, that they take place with the informed participation of these
groups; and that indigenous people do not suffer from adverse impacts. For a project
that affects indigenous peoples. an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) is
required. This is to be prepared in consultation with such groups.
Comparison of Bangladesh Rcquirementswith ODs 4.30 and 4.20
3.25    While Bangladesh law  provides for land acquisition. the regulations and rules are not very
explicit regarding the resettlement and rehabilitation of PAPs. The World Bank ODs. on the other
hand, are more comprehensive and stringent. requiring, among other things, the following:
-   paymentofcompensationfor various losses at replacementvalue
-   rehabilitationto ensure improvementlrestorationof the standard of living
-   public consultation during the entire process of social assessment and disclosure of
information.

.CHAPTER 4
MAJOR ISSUES IN PRIORITY SECTORS
4.1   IDC is committed to ensure that environmentally and socially sound practices are followed
in preparation. implementation. and operations of projects financed by the company. This section
describes briefly the generic environmental and social issues that could arise in projects financed by
IDC.
Environmental Issues
4.1    Recently Bangladesh has forrnulated a National Environmental Management Action Plan
(NEMAP) through the participation of all sectors and wide range of professionals and people at
grass root level. The plan has arrived at a consensus in respect of key environmental issues in the
major sectors. The following is an assessment of the key issues in the sectors of projects likely to
be financed by IDC, and also presents a list of environmental impacts generally associated with
such projects
Power
4.2   Owing to constraints in the expansion of alternate sources of energy, there is tremendous
stress on the country's biomass resources leading to rapid deforestation,loss of soil fertility and soil
degradation. In order to relieve the environmental stress from the biomass resources, the NEMAP
has proposed, among others, sourcing energy from renewable resources such as wind, solar etc. and
increasing the power generating capacity by establishing new power plants, focusing on gas-fired
plants, and updating the existing ones. The environmental impacts which normally associated with
establishment of power plants are:
*     Change in landuse.
*     Air pollution due to emission.
*     Therrnal pollution of water resources.
*     Noise pollution.
*     Change in aesthetic environment.
*     Soil contamination, sediment and dust pollution during the construction
phase.
*     Interference with path ways of wild life and birds.
In the power sector projects incorporation of environmental aspects are being seriously considered.
In recently in some thermal power plants in Bangladesh. environmental considerations have been
incorporated in the project forrnulation.
17



Gas
4.3   In gas development projects, both off shore and on shore, different activities are carried out
from prospecting stage to development. production and transmission. Each of these activities have
wide ranging environmental impacts depending on site and technology used. Some of the generic
environmental impacts associated with gas development, production and transmission project are
listed below:
Land Occupation (for seismic surveys. drilling, site treatment. plant. access
road etc.) resulting in involuntary movement of people, crop damage,
occupational disruption. landuse changes etc.
*     Erosion and sedimentation, - atmospheric impacts.
*     Disturbance (nuisances such as noise, traffic congestion, interruption of
services).
*     Change in water quality and water resources base.
*     Impacts flora and fauna.
-     Soil contamination.
*     Impact on cultural heritage including landscape and visual impact.
3     Impact on waste management.
-     Socio-economicimpacts.
-     Safety and health related impacts.
4.4   Though the gas sector has been developed for a long time in Bangladesh, consideration of
environmental impacts has begun only recently. In the recent past, an environmental clean up of
eight old drilling swamps was conducted by a donor agency who funded the drilling when
contamination of surrounding environment was reported. Recently the Govemment has granted
concessions to the foreign companies under Production Sharing Contracts. These companies are
proactively undertaking environmental assessment of their activities in response to their own
corporate environmental guidelines and participating financial institutions. Petrobangla, the
govemment agency for overseeing gas and oil development in the country, has recently established
an environmental division which has started preparing environmental guidelines for the gas sector.
Telecommunications
4.5   Impacts associated with telecommunication development are generally as follows:
Standing crop loss during construction of transmission lines.
Interferencewith the passage of wild life and birds.
Disruption of farming activities.
Loss of prime agricultural land due to construction of infrastructure.
Soil erosion and sedimentation on agricultural land due to earth works
associated with construction activities.
Interference with the aesthetics of the environment.
18



Port
4.6    Activities associated with port development in Bangladesh could lead to several
environmental impacts depending on the scale of operations including, among others. the
following:
*     Impact on fish fauna.
*     Impact on benthic fauna.
Impact on sensitive ecosystems such as intertidal zone, mangroves etc.
*,    Pollution of marine water due to oil spills and ship and wastes.
Landuse changes
*     Soil erosion and increased sedimentation due to civil construction,jetty construction
and management of dredge spoils.
*     Change in the hydraulic behavior of the estuarine regime due to maintenance
dredging.
*     Interference with fishing activities
*     Disturbance of spawning and nursery grounds of the estuarine and marine
fish species.
No environmental assessment has so far been conducted in the port development sector in
Bangladesh. However, environment guidelines are being prepared for the inland transport and port
operations.
Water sector
Sewerage
4.7    The following are environmental problems common to community sewerage and excreta
disposal systems (CSEDs) which may not be considered in usual project planning and design in
Bangladesh:
(a)    Problems related to siting of facilities such as:
(i)    Routing of sewers
(ii)    Selection of sites for treatment/pumpingplants
(iii)    Historical/cultural monuments/areas
(b)   Problems related to design phase. such as:
(i)    Overflow hazards
(ii)    Receiving water standards

(iv)    Sludge disposal
(v)    Discharge of hazardous materials into sewers
(vi)    Control of industrial waste discharges to sewer system
(c)    Problems during construction stage, such as:
(i)    Control of silt runoff during construction, (may require use of temporary
holding ponds).
(ii)    Resurfacing/replantirg of exposed areas, both to avoid erosion and to
preserve environmental aesthetics.
(iii)    Other construction stage hazards as appl icable.
(iv)    Monitoring construction (to ensure that contractor complies with specified
constraints).
(d)   Problems during operations stage, such as:
(i)    Health and safety hazards to workmen
(ii)    Operations monitoring
(e)    Environmental Problems for use of subsurface leaching systems for individual

(i)    Overflow hazards
(ii)    Groundwater pollution hazards
(iii)    Dislodging service
(iv)    Disposal of sludge
Water SupPly
4.8    The following are some of the environmental problems commonly associated with
community water supply (CWS) systems which may not normally be considered in project
planning and design in Bangladesh.

(iv)    Monitoring
(d)   Problems resulting from O&M inadequacies
A draft EQS has been prepared by DOE which provide standards for different types
of water but strict compliance is yet to be established in Bangladesh.
Waste Management
4.9   In the context of growing urbanization, waste management has been identified as one of the
key environmental concerns. The local govemrnment authorities who are responsible for the
management of urban waste have serious limitation of institutional capacity and resources to
address this environmental problem. The environmental impacts associated with waste
management, among others, are:
a  poor handling of waste leading to pollution of sunToundi ng environment.
*  occupational health hazards.
*  hazardous spill/fire/exposition.
*  poor management sludge and ash etc.
*  air pollution through emission.
v  contanination of ground and surface water.
*  depreciation of environmental aesthetics.
*  effect on adjacent properties.
*  blockage of wildlife passage.
*  degradation of wetlands.
In Bangladesh waste management. particularly in the Urban sector has been identified as a major
environmental issue. The National Environment Management Plan (NEMAP) has also taken this
issue into accounts and has proposed actions to undertake environmentally sound waste
management practice. setting guideline for compliance.
Highway
4.10  In a low lying country like Bangladesh . environmental impacts due to development in the
highway sector would be tremendous. In the past, development projects in this sector did not
consider environmnental impacts. The types. magnitudes and levels of environmental impacts would
22



vary according to the location. type of the project, technology etc. In Bangladesh. environmental
consideration in projects in this sector started receiving attention in the 1980s as a requirement
imposed by funding agencies. Under highway projects. a guideline to consider environmental
impacts has been developed. The Roads and Highway Department recently established an
environmental cell to look into environmental aspects of projects in this sector. The environrmental
impacts of the development project in this sector are, among others, the following:
*  degradation of wetlands.
*  impact on wild life.
*  impact on forests and wood lands.
*  soil erosion.
*  blockage of passages for wild life.
*  change of land use.
*  loss of top soil.
*  impact on ecologically sensitive areas.
v  drainage congestion and increased floatability.
*  loss of standing crops during the construction phase.
*  accident hazards.
*  dust, noise and vibration.
*  increased lead pollution.
*  increased air pollution due to vehicular emissions.
Social Issues
4.11   The major social issues related to infrastructure projects include: (i) involuntary
resettlement; (ii) protection of marginalized and vulnerable groups; and (iii) public consultation.
participation. and consensus building. Each of these are discussed briefly:
(a)   lnvoluntarv resettlement. Often. large infrastructure projects involve involuntary
resettlement of people. One of the primary tasks in resettlement is to identify an
appropriate site for resettling affected population. Once selected. infrastructure
development, conservation of cultural practices. capacity of the new site to
support the population in terms of resource availability etc. have to be factored in.
Timing of transport to new site, assistance during transition. and rebuilding are
very important. While there is often a preference for a land-for-land
compensation, opportunities for cash compensation. and skill assessment and
development need to be considered. The issues of host communities already
living in the new site also needs to be addressed.
(b)    Protection of marginalized and vulnerable izroups. Some infrastructure projects.
may affect marginalized and vulnerable groups such as economically and socially
disadvantaged groups; the elderly, women and children; physically handicapped:
and indigenous people. Social mitigation strategies have to take such groups into
consideration and prepare plans with their participation.
23



(c)   Public consultation. The best conceived projects can fail if project preparation and
implementation does not involve the concemed stakeholders, including affected
people and beneficiaries. A whole range of social issues can be effectively
addressed if a transparent and participatory process is followed through the entire
project cycle. For each project, a combination of methods may be used, based on
the specific project situation. Annex 8 provides some suggested methods.

CHAPTER 5
OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL
ASSESSMENT
5.1   This section describes the operating procedures that will be followed by IDC in each of
the infrastructure projects that it finances. The underlying principle followed in developing these
procedures is that environmental and social issues are best addressed when they are made an
integral part of the project cycle.
5.2   IDC is expected to follow the project cycle as described in Table 5.1. Since IDC is yet to
establish its detailed operating procedures for the project cycle, the table presents a typical
project preparation, appraisal, and implementation cycle in a project financing company. The
Environmental and Social Assessment Process is designed based on this project cycle.
The IDC Project Cycle
5.3    As the executing agency, the primary task of IDC will be to appraise projects and provide
financial support provided the projects are commercially viable as stand-alone entities, and are
able to meet the financial, technical, environmental, social and organizational requirements as
outlined in the operating manuals of IDC.
5.4   The IDC project cycle contains various stages as described in Table 5.1. As the concept
of private sector sponsored investment in large infrastructure projects is novel in Bangladesh,
IDC will be required to guide the sponsors through the project preparation process. However,
responsibility for preparation and all documentation rests with the project sponsor. At the
conclusion of the project preparation phase, IDC will undertake an independent and
comprehensive appraisal of the project to ensure that it meets the requirements of IDC, prior to
approval of the project.
5.5    As a first step in the project cycle. IDC will screen the project. The objective of screening
is to decide whether the project should proceed to the next stage, or be screened further, or be
dropped.
(a)    where project preparation has been sufficiently rigorous and comprehensive and
is consistent with the requirements of IDC, the project will be appraised and
approved for financing.
(b)    where a project is under-prepared. IDC shall require the project sponsor to
undertake further preparatory activities/studies in line with IDC requirements.
prior to undertaking an appraisal of the project.
5.6   The overall objective of project preparation is to make sure that the project sponsor
provides IDC with a well researched and documented report(s) on the project. so that IDC can
assess the creditworthiness, and concomitant risks of the project. During appraisal. IDC will

verify all project documentation, establish viability of the project, and finalize the contractual,
institutional, legal framework  for establishment and  operation  of the project, prior to  project
approval.

5.7      During implementation, IDC  has the responsibility to ensure that the project complies
with the standards, agreements and benchmarks agreed during project approval. Besides
requiring the project sponsor to submit periodic progress reports, IDC shall undertake field visits,
and interact with local govemments, public and other stakeholders to appraise progress on the
ground.
5.8     The Environmental and Social Assessment Process will dovetail with the IDC  project
cycle in such a manner that at each stage of the project cycle, environmental and social issues
will be addressed concurrently. Based on these principles, the rest of this section details the
Environmental and Social Assessment Process to be followed.
Environmental and Social Assessment Process
5.9     The Environmental and Social Assessment Process for IDC  is described in Table 5.3.
The process is based on:
(a)     The Environmental and Social Policies of IDC as described in Chapter I
(b)     Legal requirements in Bangladesh
(c)     Operational guidelines and requirements of IDA
(d)     Priority  Environmental and  Social issues in projects expected  to  be financed
through IDC. and
(e)     The project cycle for IDC, as outlined in Table 5.1.
27



5.10   Processing of envirornental and  social aspects of the candidate projects will be
integrated with processing of other aspects of the project according to the IDC project cycle. The
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Process is the main vehicle to ensure that the
IDC's environmental and social development objectives embodied in the ESF are achieved in the
process of specific project implementation. The main objective of the Environmental and Social
Impact Assessment process is to ensure that (i) measures are incorporated in project design to
prevent, minimize and mitigate possible environmental impacts; and (ii) the standard of living of
project affected people and others living in the vicinity of the project site(s) is at least restored. if
not improved after project implementation. In order to ensure achievement of this objective. a
comprehensive process to identify, study, plan for, mitigate, and monitor enviromnental and
social impacts has been designed under the IDC. The process consists of the following steps:
1.     Environmental and Social Screening
2.     Environmental and Social Scoping
3.     Finalization of the terms of reference of Environmental and Social Assessment
Studies
4.     Appointment of consultants
5.     Environmental and Social Assessment Study
6.     Review of Environmental and Social Assessment Report (ESR)
7.     Translation of agreements into legal instruments
8.     Project monitoring.
9.     Environmental and social audit.
5.11   An Environmental and Social Assessment Report (ESR)) will be prepared as part of this
process. The format for an ESR is shown in Table 5.2. A detailed outline is provided in Annex
10.

5.13    Each project that comes to IDC for financing will follow  the procedures as outlined in
Tablc 5.3. For each stage of the Environmental and Social Assessment Process, the details are
described below:
5.14    Environmental and Social Impacts Screening:  As soon as the locational and design
parameters of candidate projects are known, an environmental and social impact screening
should be carried out by the Project Sponsor. The screening process will:
-7 a(a)                 examine broadly the likely environmental impact of the project;
(b)     outline the environmental mitigatory measures required;
(c)     check consistency with govemment regulatory requirements;
(d)     make a preliminary assessment of land acquisition requirements
(e)     verify whether the land required for the project falls into forest/tribal or other
special areas.
(f)     Define project stakeholders
(g)     describe the potential benefits of the project to the people living in the vicinity of
the project.
5.15   The screening report will be prepared by IDC staff/consultant based on a desk review of
project information provided by the project sponsor and verified through field visits. For
environmental issues. IDC will follow the proiect classification and EIA reguirements as outlined
in OD 4.01. (Refer to Annex 6). Upon completion of the screening process, the responsible IDC
staff / consultant will advise [DC management whether to proceed ahead with the project or
otherwise. The recommendation will be based on identification of certain highly adverse
environmental and/or social consequences of the project whose mitigation may not be possible.
IDC will share the screening reports of the candidate projects.
5.16   Environmental and  Social Issues ScoDing. Based  on  feedback received  through  the
screening process. the Project Sponsor is required to seek public opinion and build consensus on
30



the scope and extent of the environmental and social assessment required to be carried out. A
consultant may be engaged to conduct the scoping exercise.
(a)   Environmental Scoping: The outline Terms of Reference (TOR) for an
environmental assessment will be developed from an understanding of the project
location, project component, environmental attributes to be impacted, previous
studies, suggestions received during screening, and reference to regulatorv
requirements and World Bank OD requirements. The outline will be developed in
consultation with appropriate GOB agencies, and the public. The methods used
for public consultation may be a combination of those described in Annex 7.
(b)   Social Scoping: Based on the feedback received through the screening process.
the project sponsor and local authority will outline the scope and extent of social
assessment required to be carried out. The social scoping exercise will be carried
out based on the needs of the project affected persons. other stakeholders. special
needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups, past experience in the sector and
reference to the national regulatory requirements. The scoping outline developed
will be discussed with the appropriate public authority to incorporate their
concerns. The details of the scoping and the follow up process will be agreed with
the appropriate public authority at this stage.
5.17 Finalization of TOR for Environmental and Social Assessment Report (ESR). The
objective at this stage of the project cycle is to finalize the TOR for the Envirorrnental and Social
Assessment Studies. After completion of the scoping exercise, the project sponsor and the local
authority will prepare the TOR for the Environmental and Social Assessment Studies. The TOR
will provide the technical components of the study as identified during the screening and scoping
stage, a brief description of the project, the methodology to be adopted, expected outputs.
qualification of the consultants, and details of issues to be addressed in the ESR. including the
required mitigation plans (EMP, RAP. IPDP), and the details of the public consultation process.
The TOR should be checked for consistency with the ESF. The TOR will be submitted to DOE
for its clearance. TORs of all proiects to be financed by IDC will be reviewed and cleared bv
IDA.
5.18  Selection of Consultant for Social Irrpact Assessment Consultant. The Project Sponsor
will appoint a consultant. in accordance with IDC business practice. to prepare an Environmental
and Social Assessment Report for the project.
5.19  Environmental and Social Impact Assessment and Preparation of Mitigation Plans. The
consultant will prepare a comprehensive Environmental and Social Assessment Report (ESR)
consisting of information on environmental and social issues and the necessary mitigation Plans
to address the adverse environmental and social impacts identified.  An outline of the
Environmental and Social Assessment Report is given in Chapter 5 and in Annex 10. The social
mitigation plans will be prepared in accordance with the entitlement framework described in
Annex 8. and the Bank's ODs 4.30 and 4.20. In addition to the mitigation plans. which are
mandatory in nature. "area development plans" to increase the effectiveness of beneficial
31



initiatives of the project sponsor in the project area may also be prepared. The mitigation plans
to be prepared as part of ESR may include:
(a)   Environmental Manazement Plan (EMP) containing detailed mitigation measures
to address the environmental consequences associated with the project.
(b)   Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) to address the adverse impacts on project
affected persons. A proposed outline of the RAP is attached in Annex 8. The
resettlement entitlement policy to be followed in implementation of candidate
projects financed by IDC is given in the resettlement entitlement matrix given in
Annex 8, Table 1. The various likely categories of impacts have been identified,
and the resettlement entitlement policy for each category is described. A
description of the proposed resettlement entitlements for the various categories of
impacts are also given in Annex 8.
(c)   If ethnic minority communities are affected by a project. an Indigenous Peonies
Development Plan (IPDP) for tribal communities to address specific concems
related to them would need to be prepared. A proposed outline for an IPDP is
given in Annex 8.
5.20   The mitigation plans should contain detailed implementation monitoring plans, clear
allocation of responsibility among project sponsor, govemment agencies, community-based
organizations. and the IDC for implementation and monitoring of mitigation plans, and should be
developed in consultation with affected people, public authorities and other stakeholders.
5.21   Review of ESR. Upon preparation, the ESR needs to be reviewed by IDC for ensuring
compliance with the ESF. The Consultant or other responsible staff of IDC will review the ESR
and mitigation plans and submit their report to the Investment Manager(IM) of IDC, regarding
consistency of the ESR with the provisions of the ESF2. If the IM is satisfied with the ESR, then
it is submitted to the relevant Govemment agencies and IDA for review and clearance. Clearance
from IDA and statutory clearance from relevant GOB agencies is necessary for approval of the
project by IDC, and subsequent implementation.
5.22  Implementation Responsibility for Mitigation Plans. Although the primary responsibility
for implementation of mitigation plans (EMP/RAPI IPDP) rests with the respective project
sponsors. the oversight responsibility vests with IDC. However, in the concession agreements
between government counterpart agencies and the project sponsor. altemative arrangements (for
example. implementation of mitigation plans by the govemment) might be agreed. All
mandatory permit requirement and clearance in respect of project will have to be procured by the
project sponsor. IDC will also carry out regular supervision and monitoring to ensure that all
project agreements are complied with. The specific nature of this responsibility would vary with
2 In practice, the project sponsor will submit an initial draft ESR to [DC for review. and after incorporating
comments bv IDC will submit final draft ESR to the [DC.
32



the type of arrangements for land acquisition and resettlement with the counterpart government
agencies. The three possible scenarios are as follows:
(a)   The project sponsor purchases the required land from willing sellers with clear
ownership titles. Land transfer through such regular market mechanism does not
require any resultant resettlement, unless the land so purchased has encumbrances
such as squatter settlements or tenants. In case the land has encumbrances,
resettlement will need to be carried out by the project sponsor in accordance with
the provisions detailed in the ESF.
(b)   The counterpart government agency under a formal agreement with the project
sponsor, arranges to acquire the land under local land acquisition procedures and
transfer it free of all encumbrances to the project sponsor. In such cases, since
mitigation measures need to be completed before transfer of land, the cost of
mitigation would initially be borne by the counterpart goverrunent agency.
However, the cost could be reimbursed to the government agency or could form
the government equity in the project. Mitigation would still need to be carried out
in accordance with the provisions of the ESF.
(c)   The counterpart government agency, under a formal agreement with the project
sponsor, arranges to acquire land under the land acquisition procedures and
transfer it with all encumbrances to the project sponsor. In such cases the
responsibility for mitigation will rest with the project sponsor under the oversight
of IDC. The agreement between the government and the project sponsor should
clearly reflect the division of mitigation responsibilities.
Whatever implementation arrangements out of the above possible scenarios are agreed upon,
they would need to be clearly reflected in the project legal agreements.
5.23   Translation of Anreements into Lecyal Instruments. The objective of this step is to ensure
that the measures suggested in the various components of the ESR, especially the mitigation
plans, are incorporated into legal instruments that govem project implementation. The
obligations of the different stakeholders with respect to environmental and social issues as
described in the ESR will be translated through specific provisions in the following legally
binding documents. The order of agreements shall be as follows:
(a)   Concession Agreement will record the respective obligations and responsibilities
of project sponsor and Government in respect of, inter alia. environmental
standards to be met, acquisition of land. transfer of land to the project sponsor.
implementation of the mitigation plans and other arrangements. As it may be
necessary to discharge some of these obligations prior to the execution of the
concession agreement. the sponsors and the Govemment may decide to enter into
a Memorandum of Understanding at the initial stage of project development in
order to allocate responsibilities on these aspects.
33



(b)   Shareholders Agreement will confirm the project sponsor's obligations as spelt
out in the Concession Agreement and will conform to the IDC ESF.
(c)   Construction Agreement will record the respective obligations of the Contractor
Consortium and the Project Sponsor with respect to actions related to mitigation
of environmental and social impacts during the construction phase.
(d)   Operation and maintenance (O&NM) Agreement will record the respective
obligations of the O&M consortia and project sponsor with respect to
environmental and social management action during the operation phase.
(e)   Lenders Agreement between the project sponsor and IDC will take on record,
inter alia, the Concession Agreement, Shareholders Agreement, Construction
Agreement and O&M Agreement. and shall be executed after all the
aforementioned documents have been executed.
5.24  Monitorinz of Mitigation Plans. The project sponsor would include a satisfactory
monitoring plan in the EMP and IFC would supervise its implementation. The consultant could
be the same as those responsible for review of ESR. Each mitigation/development plan will
specify the schedule and indicators for monitoring. Corrective action, if necessary, will be
proposed to the Investment Manager and the project sponsor. Follow up actions initiated by the
project sponsor will be reviewed in subsequent monitoring exercises.
t      5.25   Periodic Social Audit. The IDC may conduct periodic Social Audits of various projects
under implementation to provide an independent assessment of performance on social issues.
This process can be useful in providing feedback on ongoing and new projects. An independent
consultant will undertake this review on the basis of project documentation, including all the
components of the ESF, project agreements. and the various monitoring reports. The consultant
will submit its audit report to the Board of Directors of IDC. The audit report shall be shared
with IDA. and can be released for disclosure to public.

IDC - IDA INTERFACE
6.1   As a financial intermediary, IDC may access funding from a variety of lenders including
multilateral agencies, such as IDA. In order to ensure that the preparation of the candidate
projects is in conformity with IDA requirements and IDC business practices, IDC will submit the
following documents for review by IDA. Though the suggested interface is applicable only to the
interaction of IDC with IDA, other financiers are encouraged to follow a similar process while
reviewing candidate projects financed by them.
6.2  In order to ensure that its infrastructure projects are in conforrnity with IDA's OD
requirements and business practices, IDC shall submit the following documents for IDA review.
Table 6.1 outlines the institutional interface matrix.

proceeding to the next stage. However. when the capacity of IDC is established, IDA
concurrence and approval will be required only for the TOR, and ESR (EMP. RAP. IPDP) and
the associated agreements, prior to approving finances for candidate projects. In all cases where
more than 200 persons are affected by land acquisition and I or resettlement. or an IPDP is
required. the RAP and/or IPDP will be sent to IDA for review and approval.

CHAPTER 7
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
7.1   Infrastructure projects have a range of associated environmental and social risks and
liabilities. IDC's project management procedures will include provisions to handle these risks
and the liabilities that could fall on IDC as a lender. However, IDC will remain exposed to
several risks: risks of interference by govemment, political stability, legal and regulatory risks.
environmental and social risk etc. While some of these risks are identifiable, others are often hard
to recognize.
7.2   IDC will approach environmental and social risks by a principle of Avoid, Reduce, Limit,
Control, and Share. IDC will work with project sponsors to use insurance schemes and contracts
to effectively allocate, manage and mitigate risks. A simple risk identification and management
process is outlined in this chapter.
Environmental and Social Risks
7.3   Environmental and Social Risks are often caused by non-recognition of a problem, not
taking measures to deal with it, design failure, non-compliance and unforeseen incidents. A
typical list of risks associated with infrastructure projects is described below:
3    Environmental
a Catastrophic explosion in a gas-based thermal power station
* Source for a water supply project is contaminated
*  Environmental standards in the country made more stringent
*  Increased floods due to reclamation of flood plains for a project
Social
*  Non-compliance with RAP/IPDP
*  Accident during construction/operation
*  Severe impacts on most vulnerable groups
*  Sustained opposition to project from non-govemmental organizations
Risk Evaluation Process in the IDC Environmental and Social Assessment Process
7.4   The IDC risk management strategy will consist of four steps: (i) risk identification: (ii)
risk assessment: (iii) risk allocation, and (iv) risk management. These steps are incorporated as
part of the IDC Environment and Social Assessment Process (outlined in Table 5.3). At each
stage. IDC will ensure that project confirms to the process. Table 7.1 outlines how the risk

CHAPTER 8
9}                             INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT FOR ESF
8.1   IDC will establish an institutional structure capable of implementing the provisions of the
ESF. This main principle for institutional development in this regard is that the environmental
and social objectives of IDC (as embodied in the ESF) are best achieved when they are made an
intrinsic part of the project cycle. The institutional support and development reflects this intent.
8.2   The main objective of developmcnt of IDC's capacity on environmental and social issues
is to ensure that projects submitted for financing conform to the ESF. lDC's responsibility is
limited to review and monitoring of ESR submitted by project sponsors in order to ensure that
implementation is in accordance with ESF objectives, principles and procedures. In order to
achieve the objective described above, IDC shall:
(a)   Integrate the Environmcntal and Social* Assessment process with the IDC project
cycle:
(b)   Ensure that the Investment Manager's Unit has the capability to address
environmental and social issues.
(c)   Appoint consultants, as necessary, to undertake special assignments with respect
to environmental and social issues.
8.3   IDC shall build capacity in the IM's unit (or through consultants) for the following
activities:
-  Screening of projects.
*  Finalizing the terrns of reference for ESR.
*  Advising project sponsors on appointment of consultants for preparing ESR.
*  Review of completed ESR.
*  Translation of mitigation agreements into enforceable instruments
*  Monitoring project implementation.
*  Conduct periodic Environmental and Social Audit.
8.4   In order to facilitate conduct of above tasks:
(a)   IDC's Investment Manager will be the operational manager with overall
responsibility for implementing the provisions of this ESF.
(b)   IDC will initially engage consultants for implementing the different stages of the
Environmental and Social Assessment process -- for the purpose of reviewing the
ESR. IDC will retain a corporate consultant to advise on environmental and social
issues.
38



(c)   Increase awareness among all departments /staff of IDC regarding the importance
of addressing environmental and social issues through integration with the project
cycle. A training program for the invest manager and other staff of IDC to
familiarize them with the provision of the ESF and their application. I

emphasize the use of cleanerfuels wherever these are economicallyfeasible, and focus on the operational
performance of controls as well as their design standards. In the exceptional circumstances where new plants are
proposed to be located in significantly polluted areas, the guidelines require that an Environmental Assessment

INrTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION FOR PROJECTS
IN THERMAL POWER
1.   The initial environmental examination (EE), as indicated in the checklist,
shows that the project involves potential sexious adverse environmental impacts
which must be given careful attention in the planning, design, construction, opera-
tion and monitoring of the projects in order to minimize and offset adverse effects,
and therefore a follow-up EIA is required.
2.   The feasibility study for the project, to be done by the Project Consultant,
should include an EIA (FS/EIA). The FS/EIA should include a study of each of the
environmental effects found by the IEE to be of significant importance. (These are
items D2, D3 and D4 marked on the checklist.) For each of these items, the Con-
sultant will conduct a study, as part of the overall EIA, sufficient.
(a) to make an assessment which delineates the significant environmental
effects of the project;
(b) to describe and quantify the effects;
(c) to describe feasible mitigation measures for minimizing, eliminating, or
offsetting unavoidable adverse effects; and
(d) to recommend the most appropriate mitigation and/or enhancement
measures.
3.   The selected significant environmental impacts (SEls) to be studied, as part
of the overall EIA, are the following:
A. Environmental Problems Due to Project Location
1. Disruption of hydrology

CHECELIST ANNEX
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED
WIT PROJECTS IN THERMAL POWER
(EXCLUSIVE OF MINING OF FOSSIL FUELS)1
Significant adverse environmental effects which have resulted from develop-
inent projects in thermal power in the past include the following:
A Environmnental Effects Due to Project Location
1.  Disruption of hydrology: Changes in the hydrology of waterways inter-
cepted by the project, without careful planning, can result (1) in creating
or intensifying local flooding problems, and (2) in affecting aquatic ecol-
ogy including fisheries. Through evaluation of the local hydrology, such
potential adverse impacts can be identified and the planning/design ad-
justed to minimize the effects.
2.  Resettlement offamilies displaced byproject:
See Annex M/2.
3.  Encroachment into forests/swamplands:
See Annex E/5.
4.  Encroachment on historical/cultural monuments/areas:
Need to avoid/minimize/offset such effects by careful design.
5.  Cooling water abstraction: Are the available water supply resources in
the region sufficient to meet project needs for cooling water without dis-
ruption of existing beneficial water uses?
6.  Regional flooding and drainage hazards: Will the structures be
secure against regional flooding hazards? Is the regional drainage
1 See separate guidelines ror mining operations.
36



pattern inadequate to meet project needs? Should the projectbe enlarged
to obtain additional flood protection?
7.  Waste emissions problems: Is this siting appropriate with respect to
achieving proper disposal of liquid or gaseous or solid wastes (keeping in
mind that many environmental pollution problems stem primarily from
poor siting)?
B. Environmental Problems Relating to Planning and Design (including
assumptions on quality of O&M [see Annex 11.4])
1. Cooling watersystem. For 'once through' coolingwater systems, is the
design appropriate considering other water rights allocations and effects
of plant processing (heating, mechanical abrasion of microorganisms, and
chemicals added to the cooling water) on downstream beneficial water
uses? Is the cooling water intake design adequate for screening out fish?
2. Pollution control equipment: Is the selection of sophisticated equipment
for controlling pollution emissions consistent with realistic expectations
on O&M quality levels for the DMC, including provisions for training?
3.  Pollution control
(a) surface wwaters: Does the design take into account all existing
downstream beneficial uses and furnish suitable protection to these,
including provisions for monitoring based on realistic environmen-
tal standards? The wastes include the fossil fuel bottom ash residues
after burning, salts and toxic chemicals in blowdown from recirculat-
ing cooling water systems (see Annex 11.4, 11.6).
(b) groundwaters: If the groundwater is used for water supply, does
the design for management of liquid and solid wastes afford ap-
propriate protection to this resource, including provisions for
monitoring?
(c) air environment: Does the design for control of fly ash and other
air pollutant emissions furnish appropriate protection to environ-
ment considering local and regional air mass movements, including
provisions for monitoring?
37



(d) noise: Does the design afford appropriate protection for both
workers and neighbors?
(e) boiling sludges (bottom ash): Does the design provide for proper
disposal of steam boiler sludges when these are periodically cleaned?
This can be a serious pollution problem (Annex II.5). If access to the
open sea is feasible, it may be advantageous to dispose of this at sea.
Usually disposal is by landfilling.
4.   Occupational health. Does the projectplan provide for a reasonable oc-
cupational health program for protection of the workers' health and
safety?
5.  Hazardous spills/fires/explosions: Does the design take these hazards
suitably into account, including provision of emergency action measures,
for appropriate protection of workers and nearby residents and
properties?
C. Environmental Problems During Construction Stage
1.  Silt runoffduring construction: Does the construction plan include ade-
quate provision for control of silt runoff during construction, including
use of temporary holding ponds and other measures if necessary?
2.  Erosion of unprotected exposed areas: Does the construction plan in-
clude provisions for replanting or other resurfacing of exposed cut-and-
fill areas to prevent continuing excessive erosion following construction?
3.   Other construction stage hazards: Does the project construction plan
incorporate provision for other potential adverse effects during construc-
tion such as described in Annex m sections including: (1) runoff erosion
during rains from unprotected excavated areas resulting in excessive soil
erosion, (2) safety of workers from accidents, (3) communicable disease
hazards from lack of proper sanitation at workers camps, (4) com-
municable disease hazards, especially malaria, from imported worker
vector carriers, (5) hazards of slum formation following construction,
(8) dust/fume/odor hazards, (9) noise and vibration hazards, (10) quar-
rying/blasting hazards, (11) hazard of disrupting other utilities service
lines, (12) disruption of street traffic for prolonged periods, (13) pollution
of groundwater from dumping of construction spoils, (14) local flooding
38



- by use of excessive flushing water, (15) dredging/filling in waterways
areas.
4.  Monitoring during construction: Does the project construction plan
provide for necessary construction stage monitoring?
D. Environmental Problems Relating to Operations
1.  Adequacy of O&Mfunding: Assuming a realistic O&M plan, is it realis-
tic to assume adequate funding will be made over a continuing basis?
2.  Occupational health and safety: See Items (b) (v) and (vi). Given ade-
quate plans, will the provisions/budget for O&M be able to implement
them?
3.  Nuisancesfrom haulingfueL  WiU the noise, traffic and dust emissions
along access routes be excessive?
4.  Surface runoff from plant yard: Wil this runoff contain sufficient
amounts of pickup of fuel, oils and other pollutants so that treatment of
the runoff will be needed?
5. Operations monitoring: Does the project operations plan and budget in-
dude provision for minimum necessary periodic monitoring to ensure
that all essential environmental protection measures are being done, and
to recommend needed corrections?
E. Realization of Feasible Enhancement Measures: Does the project plan
take advantage of opportunities for feasible modifications in the plan-
ning/design for incorporating special measures which wil significantly en-
hance environmental values, thereby serving both to offset unavoidable
adverse impacts and to improve the project's overall benefit/cost ratio? Pos-
sibilities which have been feasible for large industrial plants include provision
of good water supplies for rural villages in the vicinities, and for power plants,
rural electrification in the plant vicinity or subregion.
F. Impacts from Power Transmission Facilities
1.  Encroachment onprecious ecology: Same as for A(3) above. (See Annex
III/5.)
39



2.  Depreciation of environmental aesthetics: Siting and design should
minimize any adverse effects, including use of trees for screening.
3.  Erosion/silt runoffduring constructiorL  Same as Item C(1) above. (See
Annex m/1.)
4.  Continuingerosion from exposed areas: Exposed areas not replanted or
covered have been a common serious problem in the DMCs (same as for
Item C(2) above).
G. Overall Critical Environmental Review Criteria (Policy Issues)
1.  Will the project cause unwarranted losses in precious/irreplaceable
natural or other resources?
2. Will the project make unwarranted accelerated use of scarce resources in
favor of short-term over long-term economic gains?
3.  Will the project result in unwarranted hazards to endangered species?
4.  Will the project tend to intensify undesirable migration from rural to
urban sectors?
5.  Will the project tend to increase the income gap between the poor and
the affluent?
H. Other Potential Environmental Problems These include aspects
which will normally be accounted for in project planning by the Bank staff
specialists in engineering, economics axid finance, as discussed in Annex m,
Section 2.

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
1. Introduction
The primary purpose of the 1995 Power System Master Plan (PSMP) was to design a 20-year
management plan to ensure the efficient, and timely development of Bangladesh's power system.
To this end, the 1995 PSMP noted that in order to increase the efficiency of the existing
electrical transmission system, while expanding delivery capabilities throughout Bangladesh,
two key tasks required completion:
* a 230 kV ring around the Dhaka; and
* a 230 kV transmission line from Chittagong to Comilla and on to Haripur via
Meghnaghat (Acres, 1995).
As a result of these recommendations, and the proposed development of the Meghnaghat Power
Sites Area (MPSA), the Government of Bangladesh entrusted the Power Grid Company of
Bangladesh (PGCB) with the responsibility to connect the Comilla North sub-station to the
Haripur substation via the MPSA; to facilitate the demand and supply balance between the
eastern region of the country with central and western region as well as to export power
generated at the MPSA.
The PSMP also recommend construction of another high voltage line from the MPSA to
Hasnabad to be able to dispatch all the power to be generated at the MPSA in the future
(attachment 1). Routes were selected based upon a previously prepared environmental report
(MEP, 1997) and technical considerations of the PGCB. Funded with development capital from
the Asian Development Bank (ADB), tower construction along the routes is currently on-going
by the PGCB (attachment 2).
The PGCB is responsible for land acquisition, compensation, construction, and maintenance of
these high voltages transmission lines. Further, since development capital is being provided by
the ADB, the PGCB will comply with their environmental and developmental policies. The
Project Sponsor is not involved in any way with this process.
Since direct information was not available regarding the common construction practices of the
PGCB, the following overview was compiled to provide reviewers with a basic understanding of
the anticipated PGCB construction and operation activities.
2. Tower and Conductor Design
The 230 kV lines exporting power from the MPSA will be a double circuit, three-phase line with
twin conductors per phase and two overrunning earthwires supported on steel lattice towers
(MEP, 1997). The towers will consist of galvanized high tensile steel angles and bars.
Aluminium conductor steel, reinforced with 795 minimum circular mills having a current rating
of 770 amperes, will be used to connect the towers.
It is expected that both straight and angle towers will be required. Typical tower height will be
around 40 metres (i.e., 131 feet) with conductors being strung on the same vertical plane with a
2.5 to three metre (i.e., 8 - 10 feet) gap between them. River crossing towers are generally much
taller than the normal towers utilized on plain land, and depend upon the width of the river. The

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
height of the tower that will cross the Meghna River at the MPSA is 134.8 meters. The clearance
from the highest flood level will be approximately eight metres (i.e., 26 feet). The PGCB will
have to design both towers and lines against cyclonic type winds that can reach speeds of up to
200 km/hr for short durations (Acres, 1995).
Tower construction may also require a workspace of approximately 25m2 at the base of each
tower with suitable access for the construction equipment required to excavate foundations,
insert footings and/or pilings, and to deliver steel tower sections and cable conductors.
Considering the above design criteria, concrete may be used for tower foundations and footings.
All towers will require the support of piles and the piles will be constructed on-site. The
contractors engaged by PGCB are responsible for securing all materials such as bricks, sand,
reinforcement rod, and cement related to tower construction. From previous experience, it is
anticipated that 10 to 12 m3 of concrete will be required for the foundations of each tower.
3. Environmental Considerations
3.1    Construction Impacts
Typically, environmental impacts associated with construction of electrical transmission towers
and lines are linked to the involuntary resettlement of people, transportation of materials along
the route corridor(s), the preparation of foundations, installation of infrastructure such as
transformers, and the erection of safety fencing. Further, in many areas of Bangladesh tower
construction activities are limited to the dry season as flood conditions during the wet season
generally preclude such construction activities.
The impacts commonly associated with transmission line construction are summarized below
based upon previous experience and the anticipated actions of the PGCB.
3.1.1 Tower Routing
Based in part upon the ADB Guidelines (1993), and assisted by an environmental report (MEP,
1997), the PGCB has identified their preferred route corridors. To the extent possible, it appears
that urban areas have been avoided, other linear corridors paralleled, and route length minimized
(attachment 2).
Such alignments should minimize any short-term adverse effects of noise, dust, and construction
traffic. It is anticipated that the PGCB will deal with other construction impacts such as excess
waste (e.g., soil material and packaging) in one of three ways: i) reuse any such materials; ii)
make them available to local communities; or iii) dispose of them in accordance with existing
regulations.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
3.1.2 Impact Assessment
- f   It is anticipated that the PGCB will complete, if they have not already done so, an environmental
impact assessment sufficient to meet and/or exceed the requirements of the ADB. Various
components of such a report are discussed in general below.
Involuntary Resettlement
It is expected that all land acquisition and requisition will occur under the supervision of the
Bangladesh Ministry of Land. Additionally, since the PGCB is receiving development capital
from the ADB, is expected that they will implement the resettlement guidelines and policies of
the ADB where appropriate.
It is also expected that any economic dislocation (e.g., loss of agricultural land at tower base)
that may result from transmission tower construction will be compensated by the PGCB as per
the ADB's requirements.
Surface Waters
In order to minimize and/or avoid potentially adverse environmental effects near surface waters
such as rivers and streams, it is anticipated that the PGCB and its contractors during construction
will take special care when crossing any surface waters. Such actions may include:
changing oils and lubricants in pre-designated/authorized areas;
*  prohibiting the cleaning of any vehicle and/or equipment near surface waters;
*  minimizing the use of equipment in close proximity to any surface water feature;
. restricting the amount of vegetation clearing on and adjacent to surface waters; and
* not allowing waste material to be discarded into surface waters.
General Safety Measures
Various safety measures will be implemented by the PGCB, in accordance with both ADB and
Government of Bangladesh requirements. Such measures may include:
*   the installation of protective sheathing around the wires as well as inspection chamber
installed to facilitate monitoring;
*   measures to prevent vehicle collision may be placed on towers located near road access
points; and
* signs indicated Danger: High Voltage and restrictive fencing may be placed around the
newly installed towers to prevent unauthorized third parties from climbing on the towers in
areas of easy public access.
Local Employment
Construction of the transmission towers may involve the use of unskilled labour and skilled
engineers and planners. Should the PGCB not have such personnel on staff, it would be possible
to hire local persons on a short-term contract basis; providing a local positive economic impact.

Prior to construction, and pending the hiring of local personnel, the PGCB may wish to
undertake a training program in order to educate all construction staff in accordance with the
policies and procedures required as part of the project. This may include the requirements for
proper construction area preparation, compliance with waste disposal practices, surface water
protection, and occupational health and safety measures, among others.
EPC Contractor
The Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) Contractor, on behalf of the PGCB, may
undertake site-specific monitoring measures during the construction process in the following
geographical areas:
* rural areas - proper implementation of erosion control devices, topsoil segregation and
storage, drainage replacement, etc.
* urban areas - installation of protective safety fencing, limiting construction activities to the
easement lands, etc.;
water bodies - limited work within and on surface water banks, prohibition on fording
(i.e., driving through watercourses), maintaining existing vegetative bank cover to
minimize the possibility for sedimentation, etc.; and
* easement - restoration of construction work areas.
3.2  Operation Impacts
The operational impacts of electrical transmission lines are generally limited to visual intrusions,
ecology, community severance, electromagnetic fields, and maintenance. Each impact is
summarized discussed below.
3.2.1 Ecology
Each transmission corridor will require some type of permanent access route at various places
along the corridor. Although such access routes would be a permanent feature, it is anticipated
that the PGCB would utilize existing road networks and agricultural trails to the extent possible.
3.2.2 Community Severance
Generally, electrical transmission facilities do not present a barrier to the movement of people.
To ensure this, the PGCB may wish to consider locating the transmission towers as far away as
possible from residential and commercial areas to avoid the visual perception of community
fragmentation.
3.2.3 Electromagnetic Forces
Electrical transmission lines are often a source of public debate over the potential impacts that
electromagnetic fields may have on human health. However, according to the American Cancer
Society, electromagnetic fields "have not been shown to cause cancer..." (ACS, 1997).          )
Additionally, the Government of Sweden formally declared that "the research findings presented

hitherto afford no basis for and cannot be said to justify any limit values or other compulsory
restrictions on low-frequency electric and magnetic fields" (GOS, 1996).
Therefore, based upon the available literature, the publicly debated effects that electromagnetic
forces may have on human health are not anticipated to be an issue for the PGCB. However,
should local persons raise this as an issue, it is the responsibility of the PGCB to resolve the
issue.
3.2.4 Maintenance
The maintenance of transmission towers and lines is generally infrequent and limited to times
following an adverse event (e.g., lightening striking the tower). Further, it is anticipated that
corridor maintenance such as vegetation clearing will also occur infrequently and only on an as
needed basis by the PGCB. It is highly probable that local persons will continue agriculture
activities under the transmission lines, minimizing the need for extraneous vegetation removal by
the PGCB.

The Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited (Titas) will supply natural gas to
the Meghnaghat Power Sites Area (MPSA) via a 500 metre long NPS 20 spur pipeline (i.e.,
nominal pipe size of 20 inches). The steel pipeline will termninate at Titas' Regulating and
Metering Station (RMS), which will be constructed on the AES Meghnaghat project site.
Specifically, natural gas to the MPSA will be transported through Titas' existing Ashuganj-
Bakhrabad and Bakhrabad-Demra pipelines. For reference, the Bakhrabad-Demra gas pipeline
has a rated capacity of over 200 mmscfd while the daily gas consumption of the AES
Meghnaghat power plant is estimated to be 80 mmscfd; much less than the total supply capacity
of this gas pipeline.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline and RMS is expected to originate from Titas and/or
the Government of Bangladesh. The RMS will be designed to handle a maximum gas delivery
capacity of 125 mmscfd to provide for flexibility in the system. Titas will construct, operate, and
maintain the pipeline in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the Government of
Bangladesh.
Titas will undertake any land acquisition, associated compensation, construction, and
maintenance activities associated with the gas pipeline and RMS. The Project Sponsor is not
involved in any way with Titas' works or activities. However, since direct information was not
available regarding the common construction practices of Titas, the following overview was
compiled to provide reviewers with a basic understanding of the anticipated Titas construction
activities.
2. Natural Gas: Demand - Supply Scenario
Natural gas will mainly be supplied from the Titas gas field and other associated fields located in
the northern region of Bangladesh. According to the 1995 Power System Master Plan (Acres,
1995), the country is producing gas at the rate around 1,000 mmscfd, which exceeds the present
rate of consumption. However, to ensure the long term, continuous flow of natural gas to key
end-users, various studies have been undertaken to assess the growing demand for natural gas in
Bangladesh (attachment 1) as well as the country's natural gas reserve/supply potential
(attachment 2).
Although results are mixed, it is a commonly held belief that with increased exploration and
development, natural gas production will coincide with the forecasted demand (Khan and
Imaduddin, 1999). In the short term, however, the gas supply situation in Bangladesh further
improved following the commissioning of the Jalabad gas field by Occidental of Bangladesh in
1999. Additionally, Shell of Bangladesh has been able to increase their offshore supply of natural
gas via their Sangu gas field.
In 1999, the US oil and gas exploration company Unocal, discovered a large reserve of natural
gas at Bibyana, located in greater Sylhet aream with a reserve of around 5.0 trillion cubic feet.
Development of this field may start soon if gas supply from existing operating fields is found

insufficient compared to the demand and/or if permission is given to export gas to the
neighbouring India.
3. Construction Characteristics
Although Titas has indicated that it plans to construct the pipeline parallel the existing access
road to the MPSA, the final route for has not yet been officially confirned by Titas. However, to
construct the pipeline, it is anticipated that Titas will acquire a permanent easement of six metres
(i.e., 20 feet); simnilar to the easement acquired by Titas for the Haripur Power Project. Titas may
also temporarily requisition an additional six metres, on one side of the easement, during
construction to provide for the movement of construction equipment and a workspace. It is
expected that all land acquisition and requisition will occur under the supervision of the Ministry
of Land, through the Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Narayanganj District.
Similar to the AES Haripur Power Plant, Titas will employ a turnkey contractor to construct the
RMS. On August 17, 2000, Titas invited international bid for design, procurement, and
construction of the RMS under the financing of the Government of Bangladesh. It is anticipated
that the design and procurement of all RMS equipment (e.g., gas measuring metre, pipes, valves,
fittings, etc.), their installation and commissioning would occur within eight to ten months from
the award of the contract.
The Natural Gas Safety Rules, 1991 (Rules) identify safe distances between pipelines operating
at various pressures and the development of civil works. The Rules also set out minimum depths
of cover for pipelines with respect to operating pressures. It is anticipated that Titas will follow  e
the development criteria contained within these Rules (attachment 3).
4. Environmental Considerations
4.1 Construction Impacts
Typically, environmental impacts associated with construction of gas pipelines and facilities are
linked to the transportation of materials along the route, the preparation of pipeline trench,
installation of required infrastructure such as valves and the RMS, and the erection of safety
fencing. The impacts commonly associated with pipeline construction are summarized below
based upon previous experience and the anticipated actions of Titas.
4.1.1 Pipeline Routing
It is probable that Titas will route its spur pipeline immediately adjacent to the recently
constructed access road to the MPSA. Such an alignment should minimize any short-term
adverse affects of noise, dust, and construction traffic to this area. It is anticipated that Titas will
deal with other construction impacts such as excess waste (e.g., soil material and packaging) in
one of three ways: i) reuse any such materials; ii) make them available to local communities; or
iii) dispose of them in accordance with existing regulations.

4.1.2 Economic Dislocation
As discussed, it is expected that all land acquisition and requisition will occur under the
supervision of the Ministry of Land. Therefore, it is expected that any economic dislocation
compensation will occur under the laws and regulations of Bangladesh.
At the present time it is understood that there will be no involuntary resettlement associated with
construction of the pipeline and RMS. To assist Titas with their planning activities, persons
affected by the RMS have been identified within the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) prepared
by AES Meghnaghat Ltd. (AES). Further, it is anticipated that virtually the same landowners
and persons affected by the construction of the MPSA access road will also be affected by
pipeline construction. The names of these persons have also been documented in the AES RAP
and are available to Titas upon request.
4.1.3 Local Employment
Construction of the pipeline and RMS may involve the use of unskilled labour and skilled
engineers and planners. Should Titas not have such personnel on staff, it may be possible to hire
local persons on a short-terrn contract basis; providing a local positive economic impact.
4.1.4 Personnel Training
Prior to construction, and pending the hiring of local personnel, Titas may wish to undertake a
training program in order to educate all construction staff in accordance with the policies and
procedures required as part of the project. This may include the requirements for proper
construction area preparation, compliance with waste disposal practices, and occupational health
and safety measures, among others.
4.1.5 Grading and Excavation
During site preparation and construction activities, Titas may implement the following
protective/mitigative measures to reduce the associated construction impacts:
grading should only occur on those surfaces where construction will occur;
*   topsoil may be stockpiled during construction and stored separately from any subsoil
encountered during trenching activities;
*   where necessary, topsoil piles should be protected from wind and water erosion via the use
of tarpaulins and/or vegetative cover;
all open trenches should be clearly identified with flags, barriers, plastic tape, etc. to
prevent third party injury within the work areas;
* trenches should be backfilled as expeditiously as possible to minimize the potential for
both human injury and pipeline damage; and
* if appropriate, temporary drainage channels should be constructed so as not to affect the
adjacent agricultural activities.

fINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
4.1.6 Trenching and Laying of Pipe
To the extent possible, Titas should minimize the width of the trench, while ensuring sufficient
room to safely install the pipe, in order to reduce the potential for any unnecessary disturbance of
adjacent soils and land-uses. Titas should also consider the schedule for both the handling and
laying of pipe so as to minimize the amount of time the trench is open and exposed to the
environment. As noted, trench backfilling should occur expeditiously and with the materials
excavated from the trench.
4.1.7 General Safety Measures
During the construction phase of the gas pipeline, Titas may consider implementing the
following general safety measures:
* any changing and handling of oils and lubricants, as well as machinery maintenance,
should be conducted in designated areas only and not on adjacent agricultural lands; and
* any fuel storage should be within designated areas, away from residences and high traffic
areas.
4.1.8 Spill Prevention
Should an accidental spill occur during construction, Titas may wish to consider implementing
the following procedures:
*  all spills should be immediately contained and remediated;
*  contaminated material should be safely stored prior to transport to an accredited recycling/
disposal facility;
*  personnel should be properly trained in containment practices and equipped with the
necessary supplies (e.g., absorbent materials, shovels, storage containers, etc.); and
*  fuel storage should be limited to areas with secondary containment mechanisms such as
berms.
4.1.9 Hydrostatic Testing
Hydrostatic testing should be conducted on the pipeline prior to its operation in order to ensure
its ability to withstand the operating pressures. Typically, testing is done by pressurizing the
pipeline with water at a minimum of 150% of its normal operating pressure over a given period
of time (e.g., 24 hours). As the pipeline will be 500m long, a limited amount of water will be
required for this hydrostatic test. Considering the location of the Meghna River, and its known
flow volumes, this would seem to be an appropriate source for the test water. As water
withdrawal for this purpose will be temporary only and insignificant compared to the flow, Titas
would not likely require permission from Bangladesh Water Development Board.
Since a large volume of water is required, the water should be recycled to the extent possible by
Titas. One such use may include the provision of the test water to local farmers to assist in the
watering of crops. However, if the test water is laden with rust and sediment, it should be
directed to a temporary settling pond prior to its use by a third party and/or discharge back into
the Meghna River.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT
4.1.10 Post Construction Restoration
Once construction and hydrostatic testing are complete, the original soil horizons should be
restored to their original profile sequence and surficial grading undertaken to reinstate the pre-
construction topography. Any fuels, oils, or lubricants utilized during construction should be
properly collected and sent for recycling and/or disposal at an accredited facility. Additionally,
any other extraneous waste material should also be collected and sent for recycling and/or
disposal.
4.2 Operation Impacts
The operational impacts of the pipeline and the RMS should be generally limited to accidental
contact with the pipeline, community severance, and maintenance. Each impact is summarized
below.
4.2.1 Pipeline Contact
As the pipeline will be buried around one meter below the ground and clearly marked with
identifying concrete posts, accidental contact with plough is a remote possibility. As the pipeline
will be laid close to the access road, and Titas personnel will be regularly coming to the MPSA
to monitor the operation of the RMS, topsoil stealing is not anticipated. As a result, accidental
pipeline contact is not considered to be a significant issue for Titas.
4.2.2 Community Severance
Generally, pipeline facilities do not present a barrier to the movement of people. To ensure this,
the Titas is considering locating the pipeline parallel to the existing access road easement to
avoid the visual perception of community fragmentation.
4.2.3 Maintenance
The maintenance of pipeline, as it will be laid below grade, should generally be infrequent and
limited to periodic required reviews. Further, since the RMS is located within the MPSA,
adjacent communities will not be disturbed by its maintenance requirements.

The gas transmission flow analysis attached hereto has been made for the existing and near
term- planned expansion of the gas transmission system of Bangladesh keeping in view the
projected demand-suppiy position of 2004-05 by using Winflow program. Following is the
summary of the analysis:
1. Gas Demand Projection:
The analysis is based on the following projected demands by varous sectors of consumption
uncler the franchise areas of Petrobangla operating companies:
Company    Power   Fertilizer   Non-bulk    Total
TGTDCL    547        152        359         1058

Total      1708      279        497         1484
Breakdown of the above projected demands include the following new demands by the up-
coming major power stations in the public and private sectors over and above the demands by
the existing power stations:

City Gate Stations.
2. Field-wise Production:
To match the above projected demands, the following production/supply levels are expected
to be in place from various sources:

Total :1496 mmcfd
Major considcrations used in arriving at the above production estimates from various sources
are as follows:
(a) Excepting Bibiyana field, all the other fields have the required facilities to maintain
the above projected levels of production.
(b) Out of 200 mmcfd production capacity of Sangu gas field. 160 mrnctd has been con-
sidered for the analysis.
(c) Bibiyana field has been considered to supply additional 200 mmcfd by the year 2004-
05.
(d) Alternative to (c), Jalalabad and Kailastila fields together could be considered to de-
liver 200 mmcfd by the year 2004-05 if the sarne could be transported to Ashuganj
depending on extension of the Ashuganj-Rashidpur loop-line to Kailastila.
(e) Bakhrabad gas field has been excluded from the analysis in view of pressure deple-
tiolL
3. Pipelines
All existing high-pressure tansmission line parameters have been used as inputs for the
analysis. Aniong the upcoming pipe-laying programs, the Ashuganj-Habiganj section and
Habiganj-Rashidpur section of 30" Ashuganj-Rashidpur loop-line which are scheduled to
be completed by June 2001 and June 2002 respectively are taken into account for the pres-
ent exercise.
4. Findings
The gas transmission system together with the planned expansions that will have been com-
pleted by FY 2004-05 will ensure supply of the relevant quantities of gas to all the major
power stationA upeoming in the above time open at pressurc luvele which will be quite above
the contractually required delivery pressures such as:
(a) Transmission line pressure available at Meghnaghat location will be norrnally around 500
psig ; and
(b) that at Haripur location will be normally around 400 psig.

MIDTERM GA S DEMAND - SUPPLY SCENARIO AND GAS
RESERVE OF BANGLADESH
1.0 INTRODUCTION
History of the natural gas industry in Bangladesh started in 1955 when gas w-Js
discovered at Sylhet. Soon after the discovey of gas at Chhattak field in 19.t,|
production was started from this fieid by supplying gas trough a 4 inch 19 km pipelife|
to the Qhhattak ceme:tt factory, This was followed by gas supply to Natural C^as I
Fertiliz r Factory in Fechugani in 1962 through an 8 inch 43 i,m  pipe0ine and l
Shiddlsirganj Power Station in 1967 through a 14 Inch 83 km pipeline. Since then, tile I
industr. has seen extensive progress both in terms of extension and volume: Industial
and ini astructure growth contributed towards diversified use of gas. Tvday the industry
supplif:;  more than 900 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmcfcf) to more than 887,000
custon 'irs comprising LF power stations, fertiflzer plants, Industries, commercial clients
and dc- nestic users through a network of about 12000 km transmission, distribution and
servic;; pipelines.
The gfr--emment formulated and promulgated a NatIonal Energy Policy (NEP) in 1995
setting !he objectives and strategy for energy sector of Bangladesh up to the year 2020.
The Nl:P has stipulated that in order to achieve economic development, per capita
energy consuimption has to be increased, and the energy consumptitn rate would be
about i .4 times the GNP growth rate. -This indlcates energy growth vste of 8.77%-by
year 2.100 to achieve a GNP growth rate of 6.4%, which is equivalent to 12 million tons
of oil. I.:nergy demand in 2005 would be 19 MTOE. representing energy growth rate of
9.86% 'o achieve GNP growth of 7.2%. Per capita consumption of commercial energy in
Bangtv lesh in 1995 was 67 KGOE (World Bank 1998/99), which increased to 78 kgoe
in 19957198 of which per Capita gas consumption is about 2.5 Mcf (56 kgoe). Currently.
nature' gas accounts for more than 70%/ of the total comnmercial ene;gy consumption.
The rt -'or part of the future energy demand would be met from natural gas.
2.0  ,;URRENT STATUS OF GAS DEMAND -SUPPLY
In 199.'. gas sector of Bangladesh just crossed about a decade long supply crisis. The
crisis v!as mainly due to (i) delay in completing some developmnent drilling program. (ii)
infrast 'cture ltmitation and (iii) production fall in Bakhrabad gas field. The gas
infrastr'cture limitation wras attributed to the absence of Ashuganij  Bakhrabad gas.
pipelin *. At present 12 gas fields under public and. private sector are in production.
having a production capacity of 1025 mrnifd from 44 wells. Gas supply varies between
900 - 130 mrncf per day depending on customer dem-and, mMinly fr.irn power sector.
After  long interval the supply side is able to cater to the demand witthout any gas
supply rationing. Power sector, however, is not being able to consune -ts allocation.
mainly dLre to forced Loutages and frequent raintenance shut downs. As of 12 May
1999. -.jas consumption scenario was: power 405 mmcfd. fertilizer 256 mmcfd and
others 254 mmcfd. totaling 915 mmtrfd. Current customerprofile is shown in Table 2.1;

Over _'e past decadr3z demand for gas as' en economic and convenient fuel ihas
lncrea ,-d manifolds. Total gas consumption in the country was only 63 bilrion cubic feet
(ctf) f 'r the period 1I960 to 1970. This increased to 280 Bcf for the 70's, 106B acd in the
80's a, iJ about 2000 3t:f in the 90's. In 1999 alone the consumption wifl exceed 300 BEf.
Since  981 ges sector has seen an annual growth of over 111%. 1listorical trend of
secto-rise gas consumption is given In Figure 3.1.
Dema l for gas will continue to increase and a conservative aeralysis of curreit
projec"I ns indicates that total demand will increase from 948 mnmcfd (avg.y 1112
mmefd ,peak) In 1999r2'00O0 to about.1450-nmmfd (ayg.)/ 1700 mrnmfd (max.) in 2004/A5
and 1S '0 mmcfd (;avg.)' 2250 mmcfd (max.) in 2009/10.
Power sector is and will (emain th1e runaway leader in consumption. Gas demand
projec:'!n for power sector follows the analysis of the Power System Master Plan. Tile
option !-',-3 of PSMP considered gas reserve of 10 Tcf and followed the NEP stipulastion
that 45  50% of gas would be allocated for power generation. The plan indicated thalt

projectiorn includes c.ommitment for power plants till 2005 according to Plan A-3; gas
supply c n imitmerit for new power plants after 2005 can not be ensured on the basis of

6.0   '.;AS RESERVE,AND DEPLETION SCENARIO
At pre e.nt Bangladesh have 21 discovered gas fields of various dizes. Of these the
latest tiscovery irn Bibiyana is still under appraisal but Is expected to be a major fild.
The c'tner 20 yas fields have a total Gas Initially In Place (GIIP) of about 25 Trlion
Cubic t eet (TCF). Of these four major fields. Kailashtila. Rashidpur. Habiganj and Titas
contai, 13.7 Tcf or 55% of the total GIIP. Major share of gas reserve were discovered
by Inte, national Oil Companies Working -under different legal and finaricial-regime. Gas
fields -: Bangladesh and their reserve are shown in Table- 6.1.
SanglFdesh gas resaryes have been studied by a number of groups. The last one by
IKM ih? 1989 is being 'ised as the official figure. This study however covered only 9
fields, 'or the rest, reserve figures have been calculated by BAPEX or others. In most
cases ihe reserves of IlYe gas fields have been estimated on deterministic method and
on a s igle well basis. The reserve figures need to be updated urgently for pragmatic
long te m planning, as tIie figures in many cases do not coincide with reality any more.
For ex: mple Chattak field, on the basis of a single well, is shown to conitain in excess of
1 Tcd l'3 coverable gas. whereas, this field was abandoned after producing only 26.5 Bcf.
Similar.r, Bakhrabad field was developed to produce 200 mmcfd from 8 wells dn the
basis ef the then reserve estimate, In practice the.field is now limited to produce 50
mmnrmd due to excessive water and sand production after recovering only 39% of GIIP.
The re'-overable reserve of the fiild was estirnated to be 61% of GIIP i.e., 0.867 Bcf. It
is to 1-' mentioned here that the eiht wells in this field are drilled irn the crest of the
structu i   in close proximity. Reserve potentiality of this field need tc, be reassessed.
F8ni vo J Kamta fields were abandoned after recovering onFy 30 % aid 6;5% of GIIP.
Furthr: nore, recent development drillings in Habiganj and Rashidpui indicate that the
previo- .Ay considered extent of reservoiLs do not hold ar.y more and the reServe uf
these  -!lds may downscale significantly. The largest field Titas has a (;lIP of 4.132 lTcf.
consid-- ting a reoovery factor of 51%eg the recoverable reserve was calculated at 2.1 Tcr.
The fie   has already produced 1.567 Tcf with insignificant pressure drop. This indicateS
that t-,K field eitter has a rnuch larger GIIP or it is a clear cut wsater drive case. Three

The rese-rve estirnatiotr therefore need an immediate review on the basis of new-|
production, teMperatUre and pressure data and the true remaining recovery potential of
the discvvered fields need to be ascertained. As a first approximation It seems prudeit
to estir,;w 'ite that the remaining reserve of the country is about 9 Tcf.
Over tI'! last two decadas gas consumption in the country has increased to the extenit
that dciletion has beeii almost equal to new discoveies. This, togeUier with the fst';4
that ye. rly consuinptioin has increased sharply, has resulted In a steep decline of the'
Reser!< to Production Ratio (RIP ratio). Whereas RP ratio was more thian 200 years in
1980, i' declined to 56 vears in 1990 and 31 years In 1998. Even if we add the upside
reservei o  Bibliyana gas field, the ratio will still show a continued- downWard trend
consid-IZng the passible- depletion from this field associated with its developmenL
Under *ihe clTrrent projection, cumulative gas consumption between 1999 - 2005 will
amoun' to about 2.7 Ttf. From 2005 the existing installations at that time would require
for thr-  25 years economic life another 15 Tcf. This does not Include the Increasitig
trend fa om 2006. Considering the fact that current pragmatic remaining reserve is abcut i
9 Tcf e xdudinq Biblyana. we must discover and prove another 7 Tcf recoverable g;as
(inclu0-teg Bibiyana) Jupk to retain a stable position by 2005. It may be mentioned .that
under he current projeetion the existing reserve of 9 Tcf will be exhausted by 2012. Thie
depleli,n and required replenishment scenario is shown in Table - 8.2 and Figure - a. 1.
Realis foa:ly the actua! local demand in the 25 years subsequent lo 2005 would he
higher {f gas consumrrion in the western zone expands quickly and substantially. The
currev?' trend In explore'lon Is yet to indicate extensive discoveries in ternrs of volume. In
this cc 'text, our presant gas reserve need to be preserved for our own use rather th-en
consi& 'ring any other stiort terrn option. The government's declared policy has no
optior or pipeline exp,irt of gas. This policy should be continued so that value addition
on tht-c gas resources Oan be attained. If and only if very substantial new reserve can be
discov: red and proved by 2005, whic'h can ensure the projected incieasing demandi of
the nional economy and guarantee adequate additional resirme for exerniSl
custoi iers, the declared policy may be considered for any tnodification.

7.0   FUTURE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT
*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~: I  A
Since c.it -,own demand for gas as source of energy is projected to groew at a fast pa(:,.   -
and ths. current reservr, of gas would fail to meet this demand In the long teri',
expedit us effort is neeiled to discover and prove new reserve of gas. Exploration for
oil and -Ias is botli cos-Iy and risky. As such, intensive exploration activity is neithr
desiralt'f, nor affordable by the govemment using public fund. Even development n:
discovr ed gas fields together with construction of associated infrastructure is capita}
intensi- '.The demand Projection indicates that to achieve a sustained supply side atrJ
infrastri 'Ature the Bangladesh gas sector will require massive expansion. If the
govern ient or the public at large decides to keep at least a part of the gas sector in tho
ACIblic r:omain. it will st'il have to approach the private sector in gerteral and foreign'
investr 'ent in particular, to make up the balance.
In the' -sstream side, the govemrnment has already involved foreign investment throupsh
the pC 's to explore, discover and develop natural gas. In the downstream side a lot .nf 
investw ent is required to transrnit gas to the various load centreR. Private sec'or
partici:-;4tion lin the dc-.'nstream will -be necessary to cater the mrnssive expansifin
envis-.' 9d to ar,hieve aA'd stable an efficient network.
Gas  - -nand is basically a derived demand. The whole projection for gas demand acid
supply is based on the orojected growth of the gas consuming sectors, espedially pow^!er
and f- ;tifizer sector. if these -sectors fall to implement their respective projec.;ed
expar-i:ison. the gas dernand projection will not hold. On the other hpnd, if the sec'wrs
can irplement the plenned expansion at a fast pace, gas demand w!ll further IncrWese
and is nPply scenario will have to be modified accordingly.

Environmental Baseline Conditions
1.0 People's Republic of Bangladesh
Bangladesh is one of the poorest, most densely populated, and resource limited nations in the world (Gain,
1998). The estimated population is 127,567,002 creating an average population density of approximately 874
persons/km2. The average life expectancy is 56.66 years (CIA, 1998).
The nation faces numerous environmental problems including limited access to potable water, water-borne
diseases, flood-prone living conditions, water pollution, intermittent water shortages, soil degradation,
deforestation, and severe overpopulation. Along with these problems, the nation's people are regularly
victims of grave natural disasters such as droughts, cyclones,.landslides, and floods (CIA, 1998).
Bangladesh is located in southeast Asia between 200 31' to 260 38'N and 88 01' to 92 41' E (Figure 1.1 of
the main report). Although India surrounds the majority of the country's territory, it shares 193 kilometres of
border with Myanmar to the east. To the south, Bangladesh has 580 kilometres of coastline along the Bay of
Bengal. In total, Bangladesh has 144,000 square kilometres of territory - 133,910 km2 of land and 10,090
km2 of water. The country is mosdy a flat alluvial plain, with the exception of the hill tracts in southeast. The
lowest point in elevation is at sea level, while the highest point is 957 metres above sea level (CIA, 1998).
2.0 Physical and Biophysical Features
Much of Bangladesh lies within the broad deltas formed by the Padma, Jamuna, and Meghna Rivers. These
rivers drain parts of Tibet, most of the Himalayas, and much of the mountain foothills north and east of
Bangladesh. The latter hills first capture the moisture-laden clouds of the summer monsoon and wring from
them several hundred inches of rain in a period of three months. Most of this water ends up flowing down the
AV      complex and ever-shifting system of rivers in the Bengal delta, bringing rich alluvial deposits onto what
geologists believe are the thickest beds of alluvial material anywhere in the world. The geography of
Bangladesh has developed, and is continuing to evolve, through the continuing process of silt deposition
(Bigelow, 1995).
Bangladesb has a tropical climate. It supports a cool, dry winter from October to March, a hot, humid
sunmer from March to June, and a cool, rainy monsoon season from June to October. During the monsoon
season, the country is often subject to severe floods. In 1998, Bangladesh experienced one of the worst
floods in the country's history. Its timing, magnitude, and duration were unlike any other. Approximately
75% of the country was submnerged. The number of people directly affected by the flood was over 30 million.
Out of 64 administrative districts, 52 faced serious consequences due to flooding. Approximately 353,000
houses were destroyed and 1.4 million homes damaged by floodwaters. More than a quarter of the country's
people were left homeless. In total there were 748 deaths caused by drowning, snakebites, capsized boats,
nudslides, house collapses, electrocution, diarreah and other water-borne and communicable diseases (i.e.,
malaria, hepatitis, and typhoid) (Grameen Bank, 1998). In addition to monsoon floods, the Bay of Bengal
regularly spawns cyclones and their associated tidal surges and floods.
Unique agricultural patterns and practices have evolved under the country's extreme climatic conditions.
Different varieties of crops have been adapted to suit not only minor variations in soil types, but also
seasonal variations. For example, rice can be grown under various moisture regimes (e.g., some floating rice
varieties have stocks extending six metres in length). Agriculture remains an important role in most of
Bangladesh and in 1995 approximately 60% of the country's work force was involved in farming. This
represents about 40% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (Bigelow, 1995).

Landraces and old cultivars play a significant role in Bangladeshi agriculture. However, no studies have been
carried out within the country attempting to categorize the species that inhabit these areas or understand their
role in the country's natural environment. Farmers grow and maintain these cultivars mainly due to the non-
availability of improved seed varieties and their adaptation to specific ecological niches, resistance to pests,
specific qualities, and low input requirements.
Bangladesh has a long history of settlemnent and a high population density. Thus, it is no surprise that
significant natural habitat areas are limited to isolated pockets scattered throughout the country. World
Heritage sites and key protected areas include the Sundarbans in the southeast of the country, which supports
a population of Bengal Tiger and the Chittigong Hill Tracts to the southeast, which supports Asian
Elephants. Forest cover in Bangladesh is between five and six percent of the country's total land area. It is
estimated that approximately 8,000 hectares of forest are lost annually due to processes of urbanisation and
deforestation (Gain, 1998).
In the past 100 years, Bangladesh has lost 10% of its mammalian fauna, 3% of its avifauna, and 4% of its
reptiles. There are more than 50 critically endangered species in Bangladesh, 23 of which are declared as
endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The
country's most endangered mammalian species include the elephant, tiger, wildcat, leopard, serao, and
dolphin. Endangered bird species include the white-winged duck, comb duck, stork, crane, pheasant, and
partridge. Endangered reptiles include the crocodile, python, monitor lizard, roofed turtle, soft turtle and all
marine turtles (IUCN, 1999).
Bangladesh supports approximately 260 species of finfish in the inland open waters (Rahman, 1989), all of
which are imnportant nutritional, social, and economic factors (Ali, 1997). However, fish resources are
shrinking rapidly. Today, there are thirty species of fish at risk, which include the chitol, kalbaus, tatkini,
and aeer. Further, it is suspected that the indigenous swarputi, aleng, and barnosh species are already extinct.
Bangladesh also supports approximately 4500 floral species out of which 300 species are being cultivated,
over 80 species awe endangered and 100 species threatened. Unsustainable harvests and habitat destruction
are the two main reasons behind species depletion (Gain, 1998).
3.0 Socio-Economic and Cultural Features
India's State of West Bengal has been the centre of rnany vibrant and prosperous kingdoms since the timne of
India's first great empire-builder Ashoka the Great, in the second century B.C. Over the centuries, as the
rivers shifted eastward, central and later eastern Bengal became home to important states and principalities.
The accounts of Bengal by Arab, Chinese, and European travellers and diplomats in the centuries after the
Muslim conquest of Bengal (1204 A.D.) provide a picture of great wealth and productivity, together with
political and commercial links as far as the Middle East in the west and China in the east.
In the sixteenth century, Sonargaon and Chittagong were handling huge grain and cotton surpluses produced
in southeastern Bengal for export as far as the Moluccas and Goai. The fine woven muslin of Bengal was
highly valued throughout the world and was known as Dhaka as far away as Central Asia. The project
region, Sonargaon, is renown as having been a major exporter of nation's best muslin (Dunn, 1986; Eaton,
1993).
Eaton (1993) notes in his study of the region's history that large areas of eastem and southeastem Bengal,
around Sylhet, Comilla, Noakhali, Patuakhali, and Chittagong, were only settled from five hundred to two
hundred years ago. This was the result of land grants to Muslim Sufi preceptors (pirs), who organised their
colonisation around Muslim religious centres using co-operative forms of social organisation. The arrival of
the Muslims and the resulting agrarian development in rural Bangladesh absorbed earlier rural organisations
that had evolved over centuries. This amalgamation incorporated the Bengal peasantry's ability to thrive in a

land where vast seasonal inundation was as much a part of life as the unavailability of "dry" land (Eaton,
1993).
As with many regions in the southern hemisphere, conditions for the average Bangladeshi began
deteriorating during the colonial period. Between the Census of 1872 and that of 1981, population density in
the largely agrarian northeast and southeast grew by 376 and 269 percent, respectively. This made Bengal
one of the most densely populated regions in the world and put ever-growing pressures on land, inland
fisheries, and other natural resources. For most Bengalis, this has resulted in a lowering of many key
development indicators such as average daily caloric intake.
Despite the productivity of the land, and the great skill of the peasant cultivators, the agrarian sector cannot
be regarded as a major future growth sector for Bangladesh. In some areas, cash cropping, such as jute for
the mills and vegetables for urban markets, or shrimp farmning, can enhance incomes in areas that have the
right conditions and location, but without industrial development, the prospect for the rural areas is for
growing unemployment and declining standards of living.
Much of the recent sociological literature on rural Bangladesh has focused on the intense competition for
land in East Bengal and increasingly on control over water bodies. Although Bangladesh is not an
abnormnally violent society, social scientists have concluded that to a significant degree violence in rural
areas is engendered by conflicts over land.
The most vulnerable groups are the lowest strata of landowners; poor peasants who have a small plot of land
and lack the resources and power to protect themselves from predatory land grabbers. In the south, in
Barguna and Patuakhali for example, some of the latter are acting on behalf of entrepreneurial shrimp
farmers, who produce shrimp for export by closing off and flooding formerly cultivated areas.
Other issues also produce conflict. Chars, which are low islands formed and reformed by erosion and
deposition of sediments, are frequently subject to control by armed groups who hold newly formed chars by
force. This is true even when the new land is still only an uncultivable sandbar. Those who may have lost
their land to erosion in the same reach of the river, have no rights to the newly formed land, which as rivers
move, is usually on the other side. (Hartman and Boyce, 1990; Jahangir, 1990; Jansen, 1987).
Increasingly, water bodies are also proving to be sources of conflict. Traditionally, inland water bodies,
including the rivers, oxbow lakes, old riverbeds, and village fishing ponds, were regarded as common areas
and resources. Indeed, such bodies of water were the ultimate social safety net in the traditional system, as
fishing required little capital investment. In the last decade, however, due to well-intentioned, but perhaps
maladroit efforts by donors to modemize fisheries and to implement licensing and franchise programs, major
portions of the inland water commons have been taken over by entrepreneurs who come into conflict with
local people over issues of access.
It is perhaps not surprising that rural folk in Bangladesh are sensitive to real or imagined threats to their land
and water resources. Indeed, entrepreneurs who threaten these vital resources often find rural communities
closing ranks in opposition, a demonstration that the old co-operative community values may still be present,
despite the more evident overlay of factionalism. Projects that withdraw land or water resources from the use
of the community will be carefully scrutinised for the value they may or may not bring to local people.
Project development that respects such concerns and involves local leaders in mitigation planning has the
best chance of gaining local support.
Despite its golden history, prosperity is not a word usually associated with Bangladesh today. Indeed, the
image of Bangladesh for most people is one of deep poverty. For its 127 million people, Bangladesh
averages an annual per capita GNP of US$283.00. This places the country economically with Cambodia,

Laos, and Kenya. The current overall growth rate is 4.7 percent, which lags behind an inflation rate of 4.9
percent.
According to World Bank statistics, approximately 83% of the population lives in rural areas, almost half of
who live under moderately poor conditions (Bangladesh Institute for Development Studies, 1997). This
rural-based population does not have sufficient income or household production to meet the World Health
Organisation's minimum daily caloric intake of 2112 Kcal (Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1997). This
problem is perpetuated by a population growth rate of about 1.8 percent annually.
Agrarian prosperity is no longer an option for a country with as little land area as Bangladesh. It has been
accepted that industrialisation will be the key component of revitalisation. Currently the Country's industrial
growth is estimated at 8.7 to 8.9 percent. The Country's development should continue to accelerate as long as
industrial progress is not hindered by lack of resources (e.g., electrcal power). The growth experienced is
based in part on the discovery of substantial reserves of natural gas and the government's current effort to
increase the country's supply of reliable power. Unfortunately, the Bangladeshi energy crisis has lead to the
slowing of industrial production and international investment (see attachment). An environmentally sound
increase in power production is essential for Bangladesh to continue to build on its rich past.

Curse of Power Failure
Frequent interruptions in the supply of electricity to industries in and around Dhaka city
have terribly upset the owners of industrial units. The situation has become insufferable
due to several power dislocations in a single day.
It transpires from the DESA version that PDB, the supplier of power to DESA, has been
generating less electricity than required and asking DESA to make do with the short
supply. The DESA, on its part, is not sympathetic to the industrialists' request to give
priority to the mills and factories in matters of giving them relief from loadshedding. A
lot many owners of small factories in the industrial estates have expressed their
dissatisfaction and frustration to The Daily Star staffer over the highly erratic power
supply. They rightly felt that this led not only to damage of the plants and machinery but
also an enormous drain on the raw materials imported at a huge cost to the foreign
exchange reserve. The report cited examples where the owners either shut down their
factories or sold them out. Apart from the maladies of job loss and fall in the output, the
owners of these industries are thrown into an uncertain future as many of them are likely
to turn into bank defaulters for no fault of their own.
For the last three years we have heard a lot about failure of the previous government in
terms of power generation and management of power distribution in the country. It is
high time the criticism was replaced by performance.

Power failure takes toll on mills, factories
By Staff Correspondent
Mills and factories are the worst sufferers of frequent power failure which has pushed
many manufacturing units towards "sickness" and even closure, industry operators said.
The Dhaka and its adjacent areas have been suffering a shortage of 100-200 megawatts
every day for the last few weeks, according to DESA sources.
"Power goes off 10 times a day on an average," said Insan Ali, head electrician of
General Engineering and Foundry Limited in the BSCIC industrial estate at Tongi. He
said that the power supply situation had worsened recently and disruptions often
continued for several hours.
"Power supply was disrupted as many as 17 times in the industrial estates on a day last
week," he said. "Failure to ensure normal power supply is causing serious disruptions in
production, wastage of raw materials, loss of work hours and damage to the machines,"
said Anwar Hossain, owner of Selim Rabbar and Plastic Industries.
He said: "We urged the government many times to ensure uninterrupted power supply at
least to the BSCIC industrial estates. But no body paid any heed to our plea."
"If the situation does not improve, many factories would be forced to stop production," he
said. Only the larger industries are surviving because they have been able to set up their
own power generation system. "Others are on the verge of collapse," he said.
"Earlier, our factory could produce as many as 100 tube wells every a day but now we
cannot make even 50," Insan Ali informed The Daily Star.
Frequent power failure has caused a loss of around Tk 25 lakh to an engineering factory
in Shyampur, Postagola in a year. "The factory is now closed and the owner is thinking to
sell it off," said Abdul Hamid Bhuiya, manager of the factory, United Traders.



http:l/www.dailystarnews.com/1 9991 0/26/n9 1 026Q1 .htm#BODY2
"It became almost impossible to continue production because we never knew when
power would go off. Sudden disruptions caused loss of huge raw materials," he added.
"The factory deals with iron and steel materials which cannot be processed at a required
temperature without continuos power supply. If power is off for more than one hour after
crushing iron sheets, they become cold and nothing can be produced from the raw
materials," Ahmed explained.
The power supply situation was almost same yesterday as Dhaka and its adjacent areas
suffered 100 megawatt power shortage. The DESA got allotment of 900 megawatt from
the Power Development Board against it's requirement of more than 1,000 megawatt.
A DESA official admitted that priority is not given to the industrial belt in distribution of
power. The industries areas suffer power failure as much as the market and shopping
centres do, the official admitted.
Tongi, which houses around 500 mills and factories alone, had a power shortage of three
megawatts yesterday. Its requirement is around 19 megawatts, the DESA source said.

AES Meghnaghat Ltd                    General Socio-Economic Household Survey
Socio-Economic Survey
at the Surrounding Villages of Meghnaghat Power Plant
Introduction
This report embodies the outcomes of the socio-economic surveys conducted as a part of EIA
of the Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Plant. The survey seeks to find out the general socio-
economic condition of the surrounding villages by focussing on the most pertinent features.
The result of the survey would help ascertain demographic character of the concemed
population apart from the educational, occupational, health and other important background.
There will be also brief discussion on income, agriculture and social support of the
community.
The seventy-acre site for the AES-Meghnaghat Power Plant, one of the upcoming threes, is
surrounded by a cluster of villages located in the vicinity. The entire plant area sizing two
sixty-four acres used to be winter crop and vegetable field and monsoon fishing ground
before its acquisition by the Bangladesh Government a few years ago.
The most closely located two villages are Islampur and Ganganagar while relatively distant
ones include: Dudghata, Korbanpur, Pachari, Char Goaldi. The linkages of these villages and
their residents with the plant site are discernible bearing out socio-economic and
environmental implications.
While certain differences among the villages do not escape attention still they represent the
typical features of the Bangladeshi countryside. Of the six villages Islampur is relatively most
prone to iver erosion owing to its location right on the mighty river Meghna. A very large
number of the residents of this village include the settlers from the neighboring villages
already washed away by the river erosion. Clustered homes of the absolutely landless raised
on the government khas land further illustrates the scale of the impact the villagers are
exposed to river erosion. Physical proximity of the surrounding low lying villages to a very
big river like Meghna clearly suggests annual flood almost regularly affect the people's
livelihood in a substantial manner.
Methodology
The following socio-economic profile delivered from a sample study of sixty households, ten
from each of the six villages. The sample size was determined in advance in order to cope
with the scope of the work, given constraints which was later approved by IDCOL - the main
financier for the project. In order to ensure representativeness of the sample complete
household census was undertaken in each village. The largest was found Dudhghata with 425
households and the lowest Ganganagar with 70.
For each village independent sampling frame was prepared. Then the procedures of
systematic random sampling was applied in order to ascertain Kth interval by dividing total

households by ten. For each village the respective sampling proportion was expectedly
dissimilar. To identify the first sample from the first interval random table was used.
Questionnaire was finalized after a number of drafts and pre-testing. The field investigators
were sent to field after desk and field level training. Before computerization the field-in
questionnaire adequate editing was carried to figure out possible errors. Necessary tables and
other output derived from the computerized database.
Demography and Social Structure
Household size and sex distribution: Average household size is 5.68 in the surrounding
villages with 52.5% male and 47.5% female. Large household size indicates higher
population concentration. Proportion of children (below 15) stands highest - 37.63%. The
proportion of the peoples aging more than 45 years is 16%. Uneven sex distribution of
different age groups manifests in varying male and female proportions in different age
groups.

Literacy: Literacy level of the population is relatively better because the proportion of the
illiterate is less than what it is at the national level (more than 40%). Only 24% cannot read or
write. As many as 24.3% are school graduates.
Occupation: Formal salaried job is the leading among all occupations and 26.7% household
heads are engaged in it. It is followed by fishing (16.3%), small trade and cultivation (15.00/o
each). More than 6% are daily wagers both in agriculture and non- agricultural sectors. Most
villagers work in the village or in the vicinity. Some work in the nearby Meghnaghat while a
few in Dhaka city.

Community: Each village consists of traditional institutions like para (neighbourhood),
gushi (lineage) and samqj (community). For example Dudhghata has seven paras what
include Purbapara, Sharkerpara, Bhuiyapara, Sikdarpara, Faldrpara, Sarderpara and
Madhyapara. In those there are nine lineages. For each samaj here is also a leader who
renders commanding influence on the community members. In Bangladesh the role of
community leaders is quite significant particularly from the point of view of social control
and power structure. A consolidated table is presented below to depict the community profile.
Selected Community Features

Economy
Land ownership: Small land owners predominate the village agrarian structure. The
proportion of the owners who do not individually cross 50 decimals is more than 63%,
however, it should also be noted that dependence of the households on agriculture for their
livelihood is not very large. Only 8.3% households own more than 100 decimals but none
own more than 300 decimals. Average land ownership is 43.63 decimals.

Livestock: About 38% households own cattle. These cattle owning households own 2.72
cattle on average. However, as many as 58% households own poultry and on average 6.34
chicks.
Income and wa e: More than 400/c of the households annually earn at the range of Tk 15,000
to Tk 40,000 while less than 2% households below Tkl5,000. There are 104/o households
who earn annually more than Tk. 100 thousands. This income pattern indicates the population
of the surrounding villages are economically well of. Average annual income (agriculture and
non-agriculture together) is Tk 68,856. In the light of the poverty line income particularly
(roughly Tk. 15,000 annually for a 4 member household) estimated average income signifies a
relatively satisfactory situation.

Housint structure: Most houses (90%) are built of tin and none completely by bricks,
however, walls of 5% are built of bricks with the roof by tin. There are some completely mud
houses (1.70/!). Predominant housing structure indicate the residents of these villages are
relatively better than other similar villages where bamboo thatched houses predominant.
Starvation: In rural Bangladesh starvation characterizes the poverty situation. Meghnaghat
villages are not exception although the scale is low. Only 20% households have reported to
have experienced starvation in the last seven days of the interview. More than 81%
households reported to take fish in the last seven days of the interview. This is also a sign of
good economic condition.
Agriculture
Location of agricultural plots and irrigation: More than 48.590!o of the agricultural land
owned by the surveyed households now are located in the villages of residence while the rest
in the outside.
More than 67%/. of cultivable land is under mechanized irrigation indicating fair spread of
imgated agriculture compared to national average (not more than 400/!). The rest is irrigated
by traditional methods (swing basket and others). In mechanized irrigation low lift pump or
surface water irrigation is the most popular one followed by shallow tube well and deep tube
well ground water irrigation. Higher propensity of surface water irrigation owes to close
proximity to river. This is not unlikely that deep tube well irrigation has reduced to less than
10%/. since other methods are more cost effective.

CropDine Dattern and yield: Paddy is the most popular crop. More than 88% of the
agricultural land was cultivated. It was followed by wheat (20.84%/o), oil seeds (20.72%4),
vegetables (18.541%) and jute (9%/e). Wide popularity of paddy signifies its subsistence value
to the villagers.
Per decimal output of paddy is 23 kilogram. This complies with the standard rate. Per
decimal wheat cultivation is 31 kilogram, this is also high level yield. Oil seeds are produced
32.66 kilogram in one decimal of land - satisfactory figure. Vegetable yield is 40 kilogram
and jute is 23 kilogram in one decimal of land.
Different crops are marketed in the following manner: paddy 28%, wheat 28%, oil seeds
12%, vegetable 26% and jute 82%/e.
Health and Leisure
Infant and maternal mortaliti: Both infant and maternal mortality is minimum in the
surveyed villages. Infant (under 5) mortality is only 1.70/ in the last year (1998) and same is
also maternal mortality at the time of delivery. Both figures strongly indicate satisfactory
situation with regard to MCH-FP and immunization program.
Source of food: Although many households derive paddy, wheat, vegetables and others from
own field the dependence of them on market to procure food is substantial. It implies their
requirement is much higher than what are produced.
More than 63% households obtain rice from market, more than 91% households obtain
vegetables from the market and for 70%/o households market is the source of fish. However,
21. 7/o households completely depend on river for fish. Such dependence on market to obtain

food implies that cash income determines to a large extent how effectively the surveyed
households would obtain food.
Modes of treatment: Modes of treatment in the health-seeking behavior of the villagers
portrays the practice of 'medical pluralism'. More than 76% report to have visited hospital to
seek treatment while 43.3% report visiting folk healer. There are many over-lapping cases
combining modern and traditional treatment both.
Households' Source of Drinking Water and Sanitation Type
From HIand Tubewell    Using Slab Latrine
Source of drinkin! water and sanitation: More than 91% households use hand tube well to
obtain drinkcing water. This indicates the existence of health awareness. On the other hand,
only 33.3% households use slab latrines for the purpose of sanitation showing a large
proportion do not follow hygienic defecation practices.
Use of contmaeeDtive: Conitraceptive prevalence rate is 51.7%/, a slightly lower figure than
the national average. Among different methods pill is the most popular, followed by
condom, tubectomy and others.
Leisure: Villager-s spend their leisure time mostly by gossiping, visiting neighbors or sitting
in the village tea stalls. Almost 90%/ report of spending leisure time in the above way. So
many of them also watch television and listen to radio. Such percentage amounts to about
50%o. In other words these households spend their leisure time in a multitude of ways.
Social Support
Association with NGThs: Many of the surveyed households are associated with the support
from the NGOs. 25% have received credits from different NGOs. However, a limited number
has received skill training - only 10%.on
Loan from other banks: Apart from NGOs villagers also take loan from other commercial
banks. The scale is comparatively limited. About 20%il households have reported to obtain
loan from commercial banks.

Attitude to the Power Plant
Information and attitude: As many as 85% households have heard of the fact that power
plant is coming up in the vicinity. This is likely since earth filling is taking place mobilizing
large equipment and workers. Most villagers think (75%) that the upcoming plant will not
affect them.

Conclusion
Certain features of the Meghnaghat villages are not different from the average countryside of
Bangladesh, particularly population concentration and household size. Bangladeshi villages
on average contain one-fifty households and five is the average household size. More than
four villages of the Meghnaghat consist of more than the average number of households.
Average household size is plus five.
However, Meghnaghat villages are relatively prosperous and exposed to urban influences.
Literacy rate is higher, as well as salaried job is widespread. Income level is also relatively
high rendering different from the average poverty stricken Bangladeshi village. Although
small agricitural holding is predominant, modem technology is very much prevalent,
particularly the fact of more than 67% agricultural land are under irrigation. Infant mortality
is less although morbidity is not known. Open sanitation may have caused high morbidity in
consideration of the fact that about two third households do not use any hygienic latrines.
Future intervention may take place to improve existing sanitation practices.

1.          SOCIAL  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT  OF  THE  AES  MEGHNAGHAT
POWER PROJECT
1.1        Introduction: Project Region and Site
The AES-Meghnaghat Power Project is located in Narayanganj District, about 22 kilometers
south-east of Dhaka. The project area is part of Sonargaon Thana, the subdistrict tier of
administration, and comes under the Pirozpur Union Parishad, the unit of local government in
Bangladesh. Sonargaon Thana is in the south-eastern part of the district, bounded on the east by
the Meghna River. Pirozpur Union Parishad lies on the western bank of the Meghna and is
roughly bisected by the Dhaka to Chittagong Highway. Comilla Division begins on the other
side of the Meghna. Meghnaghat itself is the old ferry station on the Dhaka-Cornilla-Chittagong
Highway, the ferry having been replaced by the high level Meghna River Bridge in 1997. Given
its relative proximity to Dhaka and locus on the highway, Meghnaghat also serves as a river port
and landing, principally for bulk cargoes. (See Map: Plane Table Survey, Scale 1: 10,000.)
The project lies in a region undergoing transition from a largely agrarian economy, based on
paddy cultivation, to a mixed economy, which includes growing business and industry, and the
local bazaar and small business development that is a spin off of these changes. The presence of
the main highway and ferry ghat meant the development of some bazaar and small service
enterprises over the years, but the recent improvement of highway communications and filling up
-       of industrial sites farther west along the Sita Lakhya has engendered considerable industrial
development on both sides of the river at Meghnaghat.
Agriculture and fishing, the foundations of the traditional peasant economy of the site and still
the key livelihoods of the local population, remain important, but both have lost somewhat in the
present scheme of things: fishing because of the impacts of industrial pollutants, and agriculture
due to the loss of cultivable land. While this kind of development does have negative impacts on
land and water resources, particularly if not properly mitigated, the positive aspects of
industrialization should not be ignored, providing as it does higher incomes and new
opportunities to those fortunate enough to find work in this sector.
The project site is on a riverain island (char), marginal agricultural land that remains submerged
during the summer monsoon and only fully emerges during the winter low flow period. The
boundary of the project site begins about half a kilometer below the old Meghnaghat jetty, on the
west (right) bank of the main Meghna Channel and extends another 680 meters down along the
river bank. The entire site is 254 acres, of which 145.5 acres is privately held, 85.3 is
government-owned (kas), and the remainder (13.3 acres) is being created out of the river as the
whole site is raised some 8 meters above the current high point. The AES Meghnaghat Power
Project is the first of three projects planned for the larger site, which also will include the
Metering Station (RMS) for the gas supply and the corridor for the cooling water channel. The
latter two facilities eventually will serve all three power plants. Additional land is being
acquired for the access road, also for the whole site. The AES MPP site will itself encompass 62
acres.

1.1.1       Historical Significance
lThe locale surrounding the site for the AES Meghnaghat Power Station is in the heartland of the
Bengal Delta, an area intimately connected with key centers of political and economic power
from pre-Muslim times to the present. The proximity of Sonargaon, only four kilometers north
of the site, and of Dhaka, some 22 kilometers to the north-west, places the Meghnaghat area well
within the orbit of those states that dominated the central delta region and which, from time to
time, extended their sway throughout much of the area of contemporary Bangladesh and beyond.
Founded by the Hindu Sena dynasty, Sonargaon became the third great capital of Bengal, and
remained the commercial and cultural hub of Bengal until 1612, when the Mughals shifted the
capital of their Bengal Suba to Dhaka. Sonargaon had become a Muslim capital in 1281, when
the Senas surrendered to Sultan Balban of the Dehli Sultanate. In 1542, the great Sher Shah Suri
made it the eastern terminus of the Grand Trunk Road.
Although Sonargaon declined after 1612, enough remains of architectural and archaeological
treasures-palaces, fortresses, sufi shrines, bridges--to firmly establish the cultural brilliance of
Sonargoan, particularly under Isa Khan, whose political antecedents were spun off from the
Suns, and whose architectural contributions are especially significant. Reports by Arab (Ibn
Batuta), Chinese, and European travelers attest to the commercial and cultural importance of
Sonargaon, and to the extraordinary wealth of its political and conmmercial classes. Musa Khan,
son of Isa Khan, was the last independent Muslim ruler in central Bengal. For much of his reign,
he fought a series of land and naval battles in and around the Dhaka region, eventually ending in
a last stand along the line of the Sita Lakhya River. He submitted to the Mughal Govemor,
Ismail Khan Chishti, in 1611, clearing the way for the Mughals to consolidate their hold on
central Bengal during the emperorship of Jahangir.  (See: AES Meghnaghat Limited,
CULTURAL AND ARCHEOLOGY SURVEY, Ten Km Radius Around Proposed Project Site,
DPC Group of Consultants, Dhaka, 1 September 1999.)
Although somewhat eclipsed by the shift, under the British, of political and industrial power to
Calcutta in the western margin of the delta, Dhaka remained the major urban center in eastern
Bengal. The region regained its importance with independence in 1947, but even more so after
the Liberation War in 1971, when Dhaka became the capital of independent Bangladesh. The
project region has benefited from subsequent development efforts, such as the upgrading of
roads, construction of bridges, and spread of industry, as well the development of social and
human resources.
Clearly, the Dhaka to Chittagong Highway is a major asset in the project region, wherein, one
presumes, transportation has long been a key economic activity. The Meghna has always been a
major transportation waterway between the Sonargaon/Dhaka area and Chittagong. In the mid-
fourteenth century, Ibn Batuta sailed up the Meghna on his way to meet the great sufi saint,
Sayyid Jalal, at Sylhet, stopping at Sonargaon on his way back to board a vessel for Java.
Rennells map and road survey of 1778 clearly shows the Dhaka-Comilla Road aligned through
the project region. Upgraded over the years, this road is now the major transportation link
2



between Chittagong and Dhaka. In the past decade, the ferry ghats at the Sita Lakhya and
Meghnaghat crossings have been replaced by modem, high level road bridges. Further, with the
crowding out of both banks of the Sita Lakhya, new industry has been moving to Meghnaghat,
and even across the river.
1.2         Land and Water: Characteristics of the Project Area
The actual project site is on a riverain island (char), Char Ramzan Sonaullah, located between
the main channel of the Meghna River to the east and two side channels of the river to the west.
(See Map: Plane Table Survey, Scale 1:10,000). Although some erosion is visible along the
bank at Islampur, Char Ramzan Sonaullah is a relatively old and stable island. In this the middle
reach of the Meghna, between Bhairab Bazaar some 65 km upstream and the downstream
confluences with the Dhaleswari and Padma, the Meghna is a meandering and braided stream,
between six to twelve kilometers wide and consisting of numerous channels and islands. These
channels and islands are stable and the river banks low and shelving.
This has been the case since the period 1780 to 1830, when the Brahmaputra shifted its main
channel to the Jamuna stream, which flows into the Ganga/Padma west of Dhaka. Today, the
Old Brahmaputra still carries part of the flood overflow of the Jamuna down to its confluence
with the Meghna at Bhairab, but generally the Meghna bears very little silt and is a much clearer
stream than the silt-laden Dhaleswari and Padma Rivers. Moreover, in contrast to the Jamuna,
where erosion is severe and chars highly unstable, the Meghna is a quieter river, flowing in a bed
formed well in the past by the much larger Brahmaputra. Erosion and deposition do occur, but it
is a slower process along the Meghna. These conditions make the Meghna the most important
fish spawning grounds in Bangladesh, although, according to local fisher folk, this historically
rich resource is beginning to be affected by industrial pollution.
Human life in the project area long ago adjusted to the annual cycle of summer inundation, often
in quite complex ways. The project site itself (Char Ramzan Sonaullah), the low lying paddy
lands along the side channels of the Meghna, and extensive areas leading father inland beyond
the line of villages (Dudhghata, Kurbanpur) along the westernmost branch of the Meghna, are
flooded for anywhere from four to nine months of the year, depending on the strength of the
sumnmer monsoon and the height of the land. The villages are built on platforms a few feet above
the normal high inundation level, anchored by trees and other vegetation. These undoubtedly
were raised by hand filling long ago, a process still visible where new residential or bazaar land
is being created or older land needs repair. The village platforms provide space for houses, sheds
for cattle, kitchen gardens, medicinal plants, fruit trees, small orchards, a local market, schools
and other public buildings. In this region, a flood means the village platforms themselves go
under water, which forces the people onto their roofs or over to the main highway, which is built
on the highest embankment in the area.
Traditionally, the major economic activity outside the village during the summer inundation was
fishing. According to local informants, fish were plentiful year round until a few years ago, so
much so that fish for a meal could be caught quickly from the nearest water body. Now, fishing
takes more time and requires covering larger areas, even for those households simply looking to
3



supplement their diets. In addition, the whole socio-economic structure of the traditional fishing
communities was wrecked by the now defunct franchising system and has yet to fully recover.
Once the inundation begins to recede, the major traditional occupation is paddy cultivation.
Most of the rice cultivation in the project area is irri boro paddy, both the varieties sown on soft
land and those transplanted from nurseries. The land is not suitable for aus paddy, which is
grown on higher ground not normally inundated, but there is some cultivation of long-stemmed
aman varieties (for example, irri paijung) on the lowest paddy land. There are many varieties of
these three categories of paddy, each fitted for particular soil and water conditions--a rich
resource of plant genetic types. At one time a major crop, comparable in importance to paddy,
jute is cultivated less frequently now, as synthetics have reduced the world-wide demand for jute
products.
Paddy is supplemented by wheat, but more land and effort is put into pulses, oil seeds, and
vegetables, all marketable if production exceeds household use. Fodders are not normally
grown, but are harvested from water bodies--mainly water hyacinth. The paddy stalks also are
fed to cattle. Fuel wood is gathered by combing orchards and other trees in the villages.
Villagers also harvest a woody plant (dhaniancha) that grows in the shallows all along the
Meghna and dry it in the eves.
On Char Ramzan Sonaullah, according to informants, the farmers planted irri boro paddy or
wheat as the crown of the island emerged from the descending water, and irri aman paddy when
the river reached its lowest level in December. In between the two paddy crops were vegetables,
pulses, oil seeds, and increasingly in recent years, ground nuts. In many cases, landholdings on
the char were narrow strips running vertically across the island, from the river side to the inland
channel side. Where this was not the case, farmers held separate plots in various parts of the
char, giving them access to different levels. This enabled farmers to cultivate on the crown and
down both sides of the char as the waters receded and the season progressed--at least in this
aspect, a remarkably equitable arrangement. All of this is gone now, as the site is being prepared
by filling for the construction of the Meghnaghat power projects. The last crops were harvested
in March 1999.
Apart from the strip of houses at Islampur, excluded from the project site, Char Ramzan
Sonaullah was uninhabited. Most of the land was owned or leased by inhabitants of the
surrounding villages, some of which (Islarnpur, Ganganagar, Jauchar, etc.) are in the revenue
estate (mauza) of Char Rarnzan Sonaullah, but away from the project site. Other formner
owners/leaseholders are from surrounding mauzas, Dudhghata (includes Korbanpur), which lies
west across the Meghna side channels, Asharia Char, and Char Bhabanathpur. (See Map: Plane
Table Survey, Scale 1:10,000)
1.3         Socio-Economy: The 1991 Census
The most recent aggregate data on the area, the 1991 Census, albeit now somewhat dated, gives a
reasonably accurate baseline from which to judge current social conditions and trends,
particularly when the 1991 data is compared to that of the project Socio-Economic Survey
(SES), conducted in August 1999 (see below). The 1991 Census was done prior to the         )
4



completion of the high level Meghna River Bridge, probably the major event affecting the
Pirozpur Union Parishad in the past decade.
Made up of 21 mauzas (revenue villages or estates), Pirozpur Union Parishad had a population of
25,817 in 1991, 53.2 percent of which were males. This latter is a fairly standard sex ratio for
Bangladesh. The aggregate literacy rate in the Pirozpur UP of those seven or older was 28.0
percent (35.5 percent for males and 19.7 percent for females). In mohallahs of Char Ramzan
Sonaullah (Jauchar, Protaper Char, Ganganagar, Islampur, Kadigaon) the literacy rate was 26.1
(31.2 for males; 17.6 for females. These literacy rates for a rural area can be contrasted to those
of urban Narayanganj, the District Headquarters and the country's largest inland river port, where
the overall literacy rate was 49.6 percent (55.4 for males, 41.8 for females). The highest rates in
the district were in the Municipality Area of Narayanganj: 60.2 percent overall, with 65.2 percent
for males and 53.5 percent for females.
Other indicators in the 1991 Census show that Pirozpur Union Parishad had reached at least a
middling level of prosperity within the Bangladesh rural context. Although the Census did not
record household income data, one rule of thumb used in Bangladesh to gauge the general level
of rural development is the material quality of roofs. One of the first investments households
usually make as they rise on the socio-economic ladder is in their dwellings. Of the 4,113
houses in the Union Parishad in 1991, 480 (11.7 percent) had old style straw or bamboo roofs,
indicating relative income stagnation and poverty, while only 39 (0.95 percent) had expensive
cement roofs. The largest group of 3594 dwellings (87.4 percent) had roofs of tile, tin, or CI
sheeting, materials which indicate a good step up from the least expensive forms of house
construction.
The occupational structure evident in the 1991 Census also suggests a rural area on the verge of
transition to a more multi-sectoral local economy, although these trends are more evident in the
1999 SES. Table One provides occupational data for 1991 for those actually working, 12,470
individuals out of a work force of 16,080, or 77.5 percent. The non-working 22.5 percent largely
reflects the unemployed, but also includes the elderly and the infirm.

Table One shows the salience of four occupations: household work for the women, and, for the
men, agriculture, transportation and communications, and business. A fifth occupation, fishing,
is not listed separately and presumably comes under "other." These are primary occupations.
Undoubtedly many, probably most, worked in other areas: women in the house and in some
agricultural chores, men supplementing agriculture with fishing or day labor, or visa versa. In
this context, business largely means shop-keeping in the small village bazaars and along the
main highway. Pirozpur, Char Goaladi and Asharia Char are close to the main road, while
Dudhghata is a large village off the main highway, to which it recently has been connected by a
small district road. The very small numbers engaged in industry and construction suggest that
industrial development and the construction of the Meghna River Bridge had yet to occur. The
large number of workers in transportation living in the villages of Char Ramzan Sonaullah
reflects the riverside position of these villages and the involvement of many residents in loading
and unloading and transport up and down the river, and across, using small and medium country
boats.
1.4            Project Socio-Economic Survey (SES)
The socio-economic survey for the AES Meghnaghat Power Project was carried out in six
villages surrounding the project site in August 1999. Two of these, Islampur and Ganganagar
are in the same revenue estate (mauza) as the project, Char Ramzan Sonaullah. Two others,
Dudhghata and Kurbanpur are in the mauza of Dudhghata, while Pachari (Pachani) and Char
Goaldi, are separate mauzas. In all, sixty households were surveyed, ten in each village. The
sample size was determined due to considerations of time and other constraints. In order to
ensure representativeness of the sample, however, a complete household census was undertaken
in each village. The largest was found to be Dudhghata with 425 households (338 in the 1991
Census) and Ganganagar the smallest with 70 households (58 in the 1991 Census). Despite an
attempt to make the sample representative, the data do suggest a slight skewing of the sample to



J     middle and higher income groups. Keeping this in mind, the SES data, backed by field
interviews, is useful in presenting current conditions and trends in the Project area.
IA.1        Demography and Social Structure
Household Size and Sex Ratio. According to the sample, the average household size is 5.68
persons in the villages surrounding the project site. The proportion of male to female is: 52.5%
to 47.5%, respectively. This is a slightly smaller ratio than that reported in the 1991 Census (53.2
for males.) Female infanticide does occur in the rural areas, but is not a major problem. The
data show that females suffer at both extremes of the age tree, probably because boys are favored
with better food and medical care in infancy, while women seem to die at younger ages than men
in Bangladesh. Large household size is not unusual for Bangladesh, although the sample size is
lower than that reported for Pirozpur Union in the 1991 Census (6.22 persons per household). In
the SES sample, the proportion of children (below 15 years old)--37.6 percent--is considerably
lower than the 49.8 percent for this age set reported in the 1991 Census. Even accounting for the
smallness of the sample, these figures--average household size and percent of children could
indicate that population growth is slowing in the project region. The proportion of the old people
aged more than 45 years is 16%.

Literacy. Based on data for educational level in the SES, literacy in the project area appears to
be relatively better than that in the nation as a whole, where more than 40 percent are regarded as
illiterate. In the project area sample, only 24 percent cannot read or write and have no schooling.
Fully 75.5 percent of the sample have schooling. Some 24.3 percent have completed secondary
school (High School), while 4.3 have gone on to higher education. These figures are quite high,
when compared to the 28.0 percent literacy for Pirozpur Union Parishad reported in the 1991
Census. Undoubtedly education and literacy have increased in the past decade, though these
high rates probably reflect socio-economic changes in the project area, as well as a slight
skewing of the SES sample toward middle and higher income groups.

sample:

The SES occupational data in Table Two shows a strong trend toward salaried work, particularly
when compared to the data in Table One (1991 Census). Some 28.3 percent of the household
heads and 27.9 percent of all other working males are in salaried occupations. Movement into
salaried positions clearly shows the greater occupational mobility of younger adults, the effects
of education, and opportunities for some in the development of a more complex, multi-sectoral
economy. The generational aspects of movement are visible in Table Three, where 25 of 37
salaried workers in the sample (two-thirds, or 67.6 percent) are aged thirty or under.

Moreover, the movement into salaried work is coming out of wealthier traditional social groups
in the countryside. For category No. 2 in Table Three, the SES shows that seven of the 19 came
from landholding families, six have fathers who are big traders, and one has a father who is
himself salaried. Of the remainder, three come from indeterminate backgrounds, one comes
from a small trading famnily, and one has a father who is a fisherman. The nexus of landholding
and trade, which has been the socio-economic basis for many of the rising, politically influential
rural lineages, is now putting at least a portion of its younger generation into salaried
-        occupations. Some of these individuals work in Dhaka, easily accessible by bus, provided one
can avoid the daily traffic jams on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway.

Community. The project site lies in a region that still reflects the character of traditional
Bangladeshi rural society. The countryside lacks a true aristocracy or an extended, pyramidal
social hierarchy. The abrogation of the land system inherited under the Permanent Settlement,
the migration of the Hindu zamindars to India half a century ago, and various land reforms since
independence have produced a pattem of small ownership, albeit one which shows considerable
variation within its own narrow limits. Although in no sense a feudal system, kinship identities
and patron-clientism are key elements in the local social and political order. The structure of
local society remains relatively flat, or at least rounded. There most certainly are income
disparities in the villages, but these are neither massive nor of the kind that cut off the wealthier
groups from their roots. Local leadership rises out of lineages that use land, commercial
interests, and access to the administration to build patron-client followings. For the most part, in
Bangladesh, a strong sense of social responsibility informs leading lineages. Many local schools,
madrassahs, dispensaries, and orphanages are founded by powerful patrons and influential
kinship networks.
Set up for administrative purposes, the mnauza, or village revenue estate, is an artificial
jurisdiction and does not reflect a composite community in the rural order. Of far more
importance are the actual residential communities (gram), of which there may be five or six
within the boundaries of the mauza. Each village (gram) consists of traditional territorial
subdivisions like para (neighborhood, also called mohallah), and customary social institutions,
namely: gushti (lineage) and samaj (community). Dudhghata, for example, has seven paras:
Purbapara, Sharkerpara, Bhuiyapara, Sikdarpara, Fakirpara, Sarderpara and Madhyapara. In
these seven paras there are nine lineages. For the most part, each para shelters its own gushti--  S
as in Bhuiyapara for the Bhuiyan Gushti, although in this village two additional lineages are
located in several paras.
For the most part, each gushti has an organization, the samaj, which oversees the range of
customary obligations and serves as a forum for the settlement of disputes. The samaj is
composed of respected seniors and notables and operates informally and by consenus. The
samaj usually has a leader, who can render commanding influence on the members. Some
important samaj leaders in this village include Sirajul Haque Bhuiyan, who is Chairman of the
Pirozpur Union Council, Mostafa Mollah and others. In Bangladesh the role of community
leaders is quite significant, particularly in regard to local social control, political influence, and
the provision of patronage. A consolidated table is presented below to depict the community
profile. (For more detailed information, see: AES Meghnaghat Limited, COMMUNlTY

Summer Inundation and Flooding. The project region is subject to summer inundation, the
seasonal phenomenon that dominates the agrarian economy and cultural calendar. The
inundation is a normal occurrence and can be distinguished from a "flood," the latter occurring
when water invades the villages. In normal years, about 10% of the households, those located on
the village fringes come under flood. In 1998, Bangladesh experienced severe flooding over
much of the country, including along the Meghna. More than 91% village households came
under waist deep water.  Village connector roads were inundated, disrupting the local
communication network.
As noted above, erosion along the Meghna River is not a severe problem in the macro sense, but
it does occur and it does, at times, destroy village lands and habitations. The worst hit areas are
actually along tributaries like the Gumti, which flow out of the Chittagong and Tripura Hills into
the Meghna. Villages like Islampur are partly inhabited by people resettled from land lost to
erosion, as are the settlers who leased the govemment land (kas), now taken for the project.
1.4.2       Economy
Land Ownership. Based on the SES, small land owners predominate in the village landholding
structure. The largest proportion own less than 50 decimals (0.5 acre: 1 acre equals 100
decimals), many of these holding very small plots. It should be noted, however, that most of the
households in the SES sample do not depend on agriculture for most of their livelihood. Only
8.3% households in the survey own more than 100 decimals but none owns more than 300
decimals. As noted from field interviews, however, there are a few land owners in the area who
have more than 300 decimals. According to the SES, average land ownership in the project area
is 43.63 decimals.

Livestock. In addition to cultivation, some 38% of households own cattle and water buffalo. The
average of livestock per household is 2.72, according to the SES. Water buffalo, of course, are
perfectly adapted to the local environment and are common. Cattle are more sedentary during
the inundation season, when they are fed the water hyacinth (kochuri, panah), but are herded  I
through the paddy fields after harvesting in the dry season to browse on the stubble. Goats also
are raised, including the highly productive Bengal Black Goat. Poultry is common, with 58%
households raising chickens and owning, on average, 6.34 adult chickens. Domesticated ducks
also are common in the riverain environment. Cattle and poultry-raising have been promoted by
the Grameen Bank.
Incomes and Wage Data. Income and wage data in the SES suggest the project area people have
acceptable incomes. Only 1.7 percent of the households surveyed annually earn less than Taka
15,000 per year, the presumptive poverty line in Bangladesh. (The Bangladesh Institute for
Development Studies puts the poverty line at Tk 15,000/year for a four person household; the
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics puts it at Tk 12,000/year.) Some 20 percent of the households
have annual incomes between 15,000 and 25,000, which can be described as "subsistence plus."
The next income group, earns 25,000 to 40,000 a year and constitutes 25 percent of the sample.
This group is "making it" economically. Those households earning between 40,000 and 60,000,
or 21.7 percent of the sample, can afford some amenities, while the next group, 60,000 to
100,000, or 10 percent of the sample, can be described as "comfortable." Those few households
earning more than Tk 100,000/year are "well-off."

Housine. Most houses in the SES (90%) are built of tin. Most of these are built entirely of tin,
although 5% have brick walls and tin roofs. There are some entirely mud houses (1.7%). The
preponderance of tin structures indicates that the residents of these villages are relatively better
off than other villages where bamboo thatched houses predominate.
Starvation. In rural Bangladesh starvation--the non-consumption of food for at least a day--is a
feature of the poverty situation. Meghnaghat villages are no exception although the incidence is
low. Only 20% households have reported they had experienced starvation in the last seven days
prior to the interview. More than 81% households said they took fish in the seven days
immediately prior to the interview. This is also a sign that fishing in the area still provides a
food safety net for local people.
1.4.3        Agriculture
Plots and hrrigation. Agriculture remains a major part of the local economy. It has declined only
in relative importance, due to industrialization and the lost of cultivable land, but has only
marginally diminished in real terms. The land is fertile, gaining at least some alluvial deposition
on the inland channels and paddy areas. Areas along the main channel, such as Char Ramzan
Sonaullah, often receive more sand than alluvium from the river. More than 48.59% of the
agricultural land owned by the households surveyed in the SES is located in the villages of
residence, meaning paddy land proximate to the residential area, while the rest is outside the
village, though it may still be within the common mauza.
More than 67% of cultivable land is under mechanised irrigation during the dry season,
indicating a fair spread of irrigation compared to the national average (not more than 40%). The
rest is irrigated by traditional methods (swing basket and others). In mechanised irrigation, the
low lift pump or surface water irrigation are the most popular technologies, followed by shallow
tube well and deep tube well ground water irrigation. The higher incidence of surface water
irrigation results from the proximity of river. Deep tube well irrigation is used on only about 10
percent of the irrigated area, as other methods are more cost effective.

Crovping Pattern and Yield. Paddy is the most extensively cultivated crop in the Project region.
More than 88% of cultivable land is devoted to paddy during the winter-spring season. Paddy is
followed in importance by wheat (20.8% of multi-seasonal cropping area), oil seeds (20.7%),
vegetables (18.5%) and jute (9.0%). Most produce is consumed in the home. On an average,
according to the SES survey, local farmers market the surplus. This amounts to 28 percent each
of paddy and wheat, 12 percent of oil seeds, 26 percent of vegetables, and 82 percent of jute.
Crop yields in the Project area range from average to high. The output of paddy is 23 kilograms
per decimal. This is a little above the national average. Wheat production is 31 kg per decimal,
a high yield. Oil seeds are produced at an average of 32.7 kg per decimal of land, a satisfactory
result The vegetable yield is 40 kg/decimal, and jute is 23 kg/decimal. These averages for the
area show the land is fertile and more productive than average in the country.
1A.4        Fishing
Despite annual declines in the overall catch, the middle reach of the Meghna River remains a
major fishing area and an important resource to the local economy. Based on field interviews, it
is apparent that many households do some fishing, the majority to supplement fish purchased in
the market for household consumption. In the Project SES, more than twenty percent of
households depend entirely on the river for fish, at least half of these being traditional fisherfolk,
who catch both for household consumption and the market.
During the monsoon season, Char Ramzan Sonaullah was an important fishing ground for local
villagers. This included both jhal (net) and jhop (trap) fishing. According to field interviews
with women, fishing around the char could bring in from Taka 300 to 500 per day, when
marketed. The jhop is a loose enclosure in the water, constructed of bamboo and other sticks.
Branches are thrown into the enclosure, which creates a spawning area and attracts fish. After
the fish arrive, the enclosure barrier is thickened and made more secure. Building the jhop
14



enclosure is a joint effort, wherein the catch is shared out. In Dudhghata, according to field
interviews, about 100 persons were involved in summerjhop operations on five favored sites
around Char Ramzan Sonaullah. The fish were harvested three times during the inundation
months, bringing in Taka 70,000 to 80,000 each time.
1.4.5       Health and Leisure
Infant and Maternal Mortality. According to the Project SES, both infant and maternal mortality
is minimal in the surveyed villages. Infant (under 5) mortality is only 1.7% in the last year
(1998) and same is given for maternal mortality at the time of delivery. Both figures strongly
indicate a satisfactory situation with regard to MCH-FP and the immunization program.
Source of food. Although many households derive paddy, wheat, vegetables and other food
stuffs from their own fields, they still depend on the market to purchase food. More than 63%
households obtain rice from the market, more than 91% households obtain vegetables from the
market, and, for 70% of households, the market is the source of fish. However, 21.7%
households completely depend on river for fish. Market purchases show that the local
population is not self-sufficient on their own lands and that cash from previous sale of produce
and from non-agricultural work by household members is available when specific needs arise.
Modes of treatment. According to the SES, local people seek medical attention from both
modem and traditional sources, a practice called "medial pluralism."  More than 76.0%
respondents report they have visited hospital in the past year to seek treatment, while 43.3%
report visiting folk healer. There are many over-lapping cases combining modern and traditional
treatment, as well as more than one source of medical assistance. In the rural market centers,
compounders in medical stores give medical advice, while a number of paramedics still practice
in the project area. These are individuals given a short course in medicine and sent into the rural
areas--a program (Pallichi Krishak) that is now ended.
Households' Source of Drinking Water and Sanitation Type
33.3
From Hand Tubewell     Using Slab Latrine



Source of Drinking Water and Sanitation. More than 91% of households use hand tube well to
obtain drinking water, according to the SES. This indicates the existence of health awareness.
On the other hand, only 33.3% households use slab latrines for the purpose of sanitation showing
a large proportion do not follow hygienic defecation practices.
Use of Contraceptives. Some 51.7 percent of married couples use contraception, a rate that is
slightly less than the national average. Among the different methods cited in the SES the pill is
the most popular, followed by the condom, tubectomy, and others.
Leisure. Villagers spend their leisure time mostly in gossiping, visiting neighbours or sitting in
the village tea stalls. Almost 90% report spending leisure time in the above way. Many of them-
-about 50 percent--also watch television or listen to the radio. There is considerable mobility for
males around the region. Women generally stay closer to home, although they do travel for
weddings and visits to the doctor.
1.4.6       Social Support
Association with NGOs. Many of the surveyed households are associated with the support from
NGOs. Some 25% have received low interest loans from different NGOs. A smaller number,
however, has received skill training--only 10%.
Loan from Other Banks. Apart from NGOs, villagers also take loans from commercial banks, a
more expensive proposition as these are given at commercial rates. About 20% households
report obtaining a loan from this source. Loans also can be taken from moneylenders in the
bazaar, usually a wealthy merchant. These "informal" loans carry a far higher interest rate and
are avoided by local people except in cases of immediate need or dire emergency.
1.4.7       Attitude to the power plant
Information and Attitude. Some 85% of households in the survey have heard of the Meghnaghat
Power Project. This is not surprising, as the site is being filled, involving the mobilization of
large equipment and many workers, and the displacement of cultivators and fishermen. Most
villagers (75%) think the upcoming plant will not affect them.

1A4.8       SES Conclusions
w       Meghnaghat villages are, within the Bangladesh paradigm, relatively prosperous and exposed to
urban influences. The literacy rate is high for a rural area and access to salaried jobs is
spreading. The average income is well above the national average for rural areas, although there
are local variations and a strata of very poor households, albeit a remarkably small one in this
area. Although the small agricultural holding is the norm, modem technology is prevalent,
suggesting a household capacity for savings and investment. Infant mortality is low. Open
sanitation is a problem and probably causes some morbidity among those households that lack
hand pumps on deep wells for drinking water. Future intervention to improve sanitation
facilities and practices may be indicated.
1i          Local Industrial Development
Meghnaghat is a rapidly growing industrial site with development on both sides of the river.
This development started a decade ago. Currently, there are eight rnid-sized industries on the
west bank, employing a total of about 11,000 people. In addition, two factories are under
construction, one for edible oils, the other for United Cement, while at least two factories are
planned, one for Meghna Sugar Ltd., and one a chemical plant for Prime PET Meghna
Industries. Industrial wages are standard for the Dhaka region, at Taka 120/day for unskilled
labor, and an average of Taka 400/day for skilled workers. Working a six day week, an unskilled
worker can make more than Taka 35,000 a year--well above the poverty line--and a skilled
worker can make close to Taka 125,000 a year--a very respectable income. Factory managers
say they can employ more people, provided a reliable power supply is achieved. Currently,
power cuts run from five to six hours in a twenty-four hour period.
17



Despite the benefits of industrialization, local leaders and people say they are not getting an
equitable share in local jobs and want more. As Table Four shows, only 683 or 6.3 percent of
factory workers at Meghnaghat are local. Most of the workers come from outside--from
Narayanganj, Dhaka, and Comilla--, and commute to work daily or rent locally. Labor
syndicates and other networks bring their own people to Meghnaghat. Factory managers train
their work forces both elsewhere and on the job. Local leaders admit that local people lack
skills, but they point out that their own literate youths are just as trainable as outsiders and want
to see a larger share of factory jobs go to locals. Only in the garment factory, is there a major
segment from the Project area, although even here the majority are from the outside. This is

interesting, as, for cultural reasons, village women would not travel very far for work. The large
number of outsiders here suggests a limited local supply of female labor--not all men allow their
womenfolk to work in this kind of environment--and hence the need to recruit outsiders,
probably largely from urban areas. The women who work at Hyundai Cement belong to the
traditional river boat communities, that work up an down the river, often in hard labor and
construction activities.

1.6         Women in the Project Area
By far, the majority of women in the Project area remain encompassed within the household, an
arena still thoroughly regulated by custom and devoted to domestic work and the raising of
children. (See Tables One and Two.) Purdah in the form of strict veiling does not have a strong
hold in the area, although women lack mobility and expeditions outside the home usually require
permission from the head of the household. There is a strong assumption of female modesty and
a consciousness that this is a requirement of Islam. According to field interviews and the
affectee women's focus group session, women do have important roles in the agrarian cycle,
particularly in the care of kitchen gardens, seeds and seed beds, and the processing of paddy
when it is brought in from the fields. These functions are undertaken in the home and women of
the affectee households say they did not visit the char area during the period of cultivation.
Women do not claim to have a role in family decision-making, but their knowledge of the crop
cycle and fishing arrangements indicate otherwise.
Despite a tendency to repeat the conventional view, times are changing for women. Education
and access to credit, the latter provided by organizations like the Grameen Bank and Association
for Social Advancement (ASA), are enhancing the capabilities and roles of women. Literacy and
college attendance are far higher today than a decade ago. Based on the SES, primary school
attendance for girls is nearly universal. Moreover, adult literacy prograns are assisting older
women who bypassed school in their youth to gain at least a smattering of literacy. Of the 46
women who attended the focus group session, only 6 could not write their own name. The fact
that 189 local women work in the garment factory is a significant figure, although for now there
is a reluctance to admit this, perhaps because this kind of factory work is still regarded as
unconventional, suspect, and injurious to their reputations.
1.7         Social Impact Assessment
1.7.1       Regional Impacts
The AES Meghnaghat Power Project is being located in a region already well advanced in
transition from a rural, agrarian system, dominated by its proximity to the Meghna River, to one
increasingly affected by industrial development, with all that that brings in terms of social
change, new job opportunities for some and impoverishment for others. Other than in a general
way, it is not possible to quantify the degree to which the MPP will enhance those processes
already underway. The fact that the plant will not employ a large number of workers suggests
that in some ways the MPP will have a smaller effect than new industries employing several
hundred. Moreover, the plant will not supply power directly to local customers, but will route its
output to the national grid, so that local industries will benefit from increased power generation
only to the extent that the distribution system provides an enhanced supply.
Nonetheless, the MPP is part of the industrialization of the region and has a role in the changes
affecting the region. The most salient of these general changes are as follows:
* Migration. More than 1 0,000 people already have migrated into the region in the past
decade, some to work on the construction of the Meghna River Bridge, but most to
19



work in the new industries. This does not include the numbers coming in to work on
the construction of the project site. The arrival of this number, even if many are
commuters, undoubtedly puts a strain on local infrastructure, housing, govemmental
institutions, and on the pre-existing fabric of social and political relations. "Outside"
interests, considerably more powerful than local groups have acquired a stake in the
Project area, undoubtedly to the disadvantage of the latter. Moreover, more people
means more unregulated development and more waste and pollution going onto the
land and into the river.
* Economic Opportunity. Clearly, the number of jobs being created in the Project area
is extraordinary. This includes tertiary economic opportunities in rentals and small
businesses spun off from the larger industrial development. While this has benefited
some local people, it is also evident that this positive development is limited and in
some ways negated by massive outsider control of new jobs. Local people feel
excluded from an, equitable share of factory jobs, and even more so from unskilled
and semi-skilled work in the initial construction of the Project itself. [Comment:
These next 2 sentences are obviously highly sensitive; wondering if we can edit or
tone down a bit, especially if/until we have a clear understanding of the resolution of
RAP issues? See conmments on last 2 paras (next page), as well. Had the land
acquisition and site and access road construction phases of the project been covered
by a Resettlement Action Plan, completed under nationally accepted guidelines,
project affected people (PAPs) would have been given priority in these jobs. So far in
the MPP, however, these jobs are controlled by a politically-connected syndicate
from Narayanganj, which has pushed the local people, including the PAPs, aside.]
*  Land Prices. One of the key impacts in the local region is the rapid increase in land
prices. Currently, the price for agricultural land in the project area is Taka 400,000
per kanni. (The kanni is the local unit of land measurement and constitutes 30
decimals, or .30 acre. It is a little smaller than a bigha, the more standard measure,
which is a third of an acre.) Engendered by industrial development, this land price
benefits those who have land, but it works to remove land from the agrarian land
market. Farmers who want to expand their agrarian holdings, or landless peasants
who find some means to step up to landownership, perhaps with money from earnings
abroad, will be excluded from buying land locally. Only business and commercial
investors will buy land at these prices. In effect, the land price rise creates a land
bank for industrial expansion and works against the retention of a healthy agrarian
sector in the Meghnaghat area.
1.7.2       Impacts on Land and Water Resources
{Comment: The following 2 paras seem to raise fairly critical issues about the RAPs themselves
and how we distinguish Phase 1 effects from those of whole site (Phases 1-3). I can foresee
issues from both sides, i.e. our project being 'saddled with' issues actually shared with 2na and
third phases; and inversely, our project making commitments or setting precedents that bind
20



future prts in some way. Does our study design/RAP process allow us to separate out such
effects in a way that will be equitable and defensible as possible for all involved parties?]
The withdrawal of 230.8 acres of seasonably cultivable land from the local agrarian economy
and destruction of a monsoon fishing ground already has reduced the livelihoods of more than a
thousand households. In the area set aside for the AES Meghnaghat Power Project, Phase One of
three phases, plus the access road and area for the demised water corridor, an area comprising
___acres, we estimate that almost a thousand households have been affected by the loss of at
least part of their land. Final data on land acquisition, compensation, and household incomes is
being collected and will be available in the Project's RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN (RAP),
currently under preparation.
At a community level, it seems clear that the loss of Char Ramzan Sonaullah has been a blow to
the local economies of at least six villages and to numerous households. The land was used for
the range of crops grown in the area: various types of paddy, vegetables for home consumption
and sale in the market, some grazing, and increasingly the ground nut as a cash crop. Cash
compensation for lost land, even if valued at true market rates and fully paid, is never an
adequate substitute for the loss of a permanent resource. Moreover, the value of the land as a
monsoon fishing ground usually is not factored into land valuation. All indications are, that the
submerged char was an important ground for fishing by net (ihal) and trap-farming (ihop). (See:
AES Meghnaghat, RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN, Appendix - below.)

* The number in brackets denotes the data of BBS, Country Series, 1994.
All the villages are situated in Pirijpur Union Parishad under Sonargaon Thana of
Narayanganj district. There are three colleges, and 15 other educational institutions
(individual information are available in the data sheet provided) in or around the villages
of the project site area. Besides, there are several prayer houses made of corrugated iron
sheets (C.I.Sheets) in each village. Generally, each village is covered with greenery
(avenues of different trees, bamboo bushes) along with the vast tract of agricultural land
filled with green field of vegetables or crops almost the year round.
In each village, the head of each lineage controls over people of his own group. In
addition to that one man becomes head of each village by dint of his leadership capacity,
merit riches and support of the majority of the villagers.
In case of government administration at these village level, one man or woman may be
elected member of Union Parishad (Union Council, bottom level of Government
administration) from a ward (A block of Union Council) formed on the basis of
population of several villages. The elected member keeps proper and legal linkage with
the higher unit of administration like the Union Parishad and the Thana Parishad.

AES Meghnaghat Ltd                              Village Community Profile
In case of population, the ratio of male and female is almost equal. The rate of literacy of
these villages ranges from 45% to 56%.
The mainstays of livelihood of the people of these villagers are 1) Agriculture, 2) Fishing,
and 3) Internal trade & commerce. The purchasing capacity of the villagers is decreasing
day by day due to low income or for want of work.
2.0 Sources of Data Collection
The data presented in the Profile was gathered from both the primary and secondary
sources. Among the secondary sources, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), Country
Series Narayanganj, 1994, LGED prepared Thana Maps (1994-1995) are the main
sources. The primary source is the surveyed data collected by the field mobilized to these
villages.
3.0 Survey Methodology:
Two survey teams were constituted to conduct the survey for the village community
profile. Each team went round each village and collected the required data as per the
questionnaire supplied to the team.
4.0 Survey Implementation
Each team members conducted group discussion with the heads of each lineage and
wrote down the information / data required for the purpose of the survey. The team
members went round each corner of each village for identification of the location and
name of physical, natural, social and educational infrastructure of the villages and noted
down these data in the questionnaire sheets. They also interviewed them about their
occupational and employment status and other related issues.
5.0 Time Period
The Profile survey was carried out during period from 25.July to 25 August, 1999.
6.0 Conclusion
The village profile as well as the settlement pattern is an integral part of our village/
community structure. In our village individual ancestral has been living for centuries and
keeping its own heredity from time immemorial. The greenery of the villages, avenues of
trees, scrubs meadows increase the beauty of nature and enliven the environment by
leaving / emitting oxygen into the air. The trees, plants and scrubs of the villages keep the
ecological balance that is very essential for human habitats, wild lives (Flora & Fauna),
livestock, aquatic animal & plants. Besides, birds are the natural wealth and they are
helpful and useful to us in many ways. Even the birds keep the environment clean by
eating dirty things.

Bridge. There is a small channel on the north of the sitc, extending 7-S km to tEle southwest,
which is then divided into two channels, the western channel joining the Dhaleswair and the
eastem chanmel meeting the main downstream reach of the Meghna River (please see Figure
2.1).
The location of the project area in relation with the Meghna River system is shown in
Fig. 1.1.
1.5 Modeling tools
The computer-programme package developed on the basis of ADI is employed for this
numerical model testing. The package includes four parts. i.e. hydrodynamic model, sediment
transport model, river flow  model and erosion model. The programme package was
developed by CJhina Nanjing Hydratilic Research Itstitute .NHRI) and has been applied for
manv projects with satisfactory results.
The model system requires the following data:
(1) Bathymetric data (including river-bed deposition);
(2) Boundaries current or water level data and sediment concentration:
(3) Hydrological data for calibration:
(4) Design hydrological data;
(5) Information on the site location and size.
1.6 Study Approach
According to the Tender Document, the Design Flood is 50-year recurrence flood with
discharge Q = 1 9845m3 /s and water level 4= 6.63mPWfD. The Design Flood condition is
adopted for the scouring study. The instant simulation, wkhich gives the highest flow velocilt
near the site of the power plant, is selected and the velocitv distribution for the'c6ndition is
extracted and used in the assessment of scouring depth and scope.
The samne flood conditions have been applied in two layout arraneements of Borrow
Areas in order to determine the flow redistribution and analyze the effect of the power plant
site on stability of the river channel.

river bed material adjacent southemn river bank (right bank-) is silt to silty sand with dibeing
around 0.04mm-O.O5mm-
According to the analysis on the characteristics of riverbed materials, upper layer of thj
sediments will be eroded up and carried by the river flow during the flood season (monsoon
season). So the silt content of the river is estimated to be the same as the silt carrying capacity'
of the river flow.

where D is diffusion coefficient, U. is frictional velocitv. a is empirical coefficient.

.   6.4 x 104. The median grain size of the sediment in the Meghna main channel is
0.15mm, the sediment's threshold velocity is very small and easy for scouring, so
M = 1.2 x 10-3 will be chosen in the model.
3.5 Model Introduction
The 2D model's lengyth is l2km, width is 9km. and ordinate is east-north 'O degrees.
Meghna Ghat Power Plant site is approximately in the middle part of the model. Th- model
uses the square grid as calculation unit. The mesh size of the model &S =Orm. and the total
amount of the meshes is 43.200.
The following parameters are chosen for the model calculation. i.e. time steplength > t
20s. average roughness no = 0.01 5 and coefficient K = 0.01.
There are three open boundaries in the model. i.e. one upstream open boundarv and
two downstream open boundaries. The upstream boundary is controlled by flow disclharge
and the dowPnstrearn boundaries bv tidal levels.
The model used moving-boundary techniques to simulate the moving of flow on the
flood plains and the changing of water borderline.  Water depth A h=O. I m is ad6pted for
determination of the moving-boudary.
The model has been calibrated against flow conditions measured on I August 1996.
Data in Appendix 3 and 5 to the Tender Document provided by the client were used as
controlling information. For the discharge's and water level's calibration. the observation
data in cross-sections (MPP-9) upstream of the Meghna Bridge were applied. According to
the field investigation, the two channels on north of the site flow below a bridge on the

highway. Under normal conditions, the flow in the channels are negligible comparing agianst
that in the main river channel, even during flooding period with ove:r-bank flow, the flow
velocity in the channels is also marginal. Therefore, the model simplifies them as blind
creeks, which has little influence on flow calculation of the Meghna River. For the section of
the Meghna Bridge, the project is summarized according to layout of the bridge abutments so
as to guarantee good similarity between modeling flow and the natural flow.
3.6 Calibration Results
Figs. 3.1 and 3.2 give the calibration result of the 2D model for the side flow cross-
section (MPP-9) upstream of the Meghna Bridge and discharge process. Based on the
calculated value in the figure and measured value, and their changing tendencv. the two
values have a fairly good agreement, showino that the boundarv control in the model is
reliable and that the bed resistance coefficient determined bv the model is reasonable. The
model can thus be used for hydrodynamic calculations of related engineering problems.
Fi2. 3.3 shows the calibration result of the model for the instant flow regime of the
*Meghna River. Based on the velocity distribution in the figure, the protruding end on the
north bank of the Meehna Bridge causes the formation of a slow-velocitv area ai the
dowvnstream like a groin-protected area where the power plant is located. Besides. there is a
tributarv with a width of about 2OOm-300m located between the West Side of the proposed
plant site and a small char. connectino with the west channel. Based on the yelocitv
distribution of the area. it is clear that the tributary splits the flow of the river.
Due to the lack of measured sediment concentration data, the sediment movement in
the model can not be calibrated. After analyzing the characteristic particle size of some bed
load in the river charmel, it is found that the sediment movement in the main channel is ver;
strong, that the river bed can be easilv eroded awav andlor silted up, and that adjacent to the
river bank} there is covered with fine-grain sediment which is feature with. good erosion
resistance. Based on the above understanding, specific boundary conditions for the riverbed
in accordance with the conditions of the main channel and riverbank slopes have been
considered in the sediment simulation so as to achieve a reliable result.

Based on the general layout of the Meghna Ghat Power Plant Project and the
arrangements of borrow  areas, the following three plans have been simulated for the

Plani 2: the raised power plant site in combination of dredged borrow areas A and B
(P.S. + A+B);
Plait 3: the raised power plant site in combination of dredged borrow areas A and
Extra A (P.S.+A+A').

4.3 Arrangement of Sampling Positions
In order to get a clear understanding of the impact caused by the site development
project and the dredging in the river channel on the flow conditions of the river as wyell as on
the river bed erosion situation, 4 sampling sections have been arranged in the model (see Fig.
4.1). Besides, 12 sampling pointseand 4 sections have been arranged near the embankrnent of
the power plant site (see Fig. 4.2). All the sampling sections and points can be used to collect
data of velocity, flow direction, water level, sediment concentration and river bed elevation.

5. Assessment of Project Simulation
5.1 Distribution of Cross-sectional Velocity and Changc of Rivcr Bed Elevation
Fig. 5.1(a) to Fig. 5.4(a) show the velocity distributions of Sections I, 2, 3 and 4 before
and after the project respectivelv; Fig. 5.1(b) to Fig.5.4 (b) demonstrate the variation of the
river bed elevation of each section. Based on the variation of each curve in these figures. the
following commnents/results can be obtained:
(1)  Under the action of the 50-year flood, in the-downstream nearby river reach of the
Meghna Bridge, the ma:;. velocity in the main charnel may reach about 1.9m/s
(cross-sections 1 and 2), and gradually decreases after passing the M4eghna Bridge
Section.
(2) Under the action of the 50-year flood. Scouring in the main channel is much more
serious (deep) than that adjacent to the riverbank. Without the site development
(natural condition), the scouring depth in the main river channel may reach 2-3m
(section 1) and the scourine at the char in the main channel of the river may reach
5-6m  (cross-sections 3 and 4) while the scnuriine near the river bank} is obviously
smaller.
(3) After the  site development is implemented. the  cross-sectional velocity
distributions have a tendency of the main stream of the river flow- shifting toward
left, it is especiallv obvious from cross-section 2 down2stream. Along with the
shifting of the main stream, the max. velocity of the mainstream increases to
certain extent. For example, the max. velocities at cross-sections 2. 3 and 4
increase about O.lm/s as compared with that without the site development. While
the velocity near the power plant site becomes smaller as compared with that
without the site development.
(4) The riverbed scouring depth at cross-sections I and 2 before and afte; the project
is almost the same. The riverbed scouring depth of cross-sections 3 and 4 adjacent
to the embankment is approximately the same as that before the project. The
scouring depth of the main channel increases obviouslv as compared with that
without the site development.
(5) Borrow Area B, located downstream of the power plant, produces a strong effect

the river bed, i.e. the flow  velocity in the west part of the two cross-sections
increases and so does the scouring depth: the flow velocity in the east part
decreases and so does the scouring depth. Borrow Areas A and A' do not bring
about much influence on the flow conditions and river-bed erosion in the main
channel.
5.2 Local Scouring near the Embankment (see Fig. 4.2)
Table 5.1 shows the computation result of riverbed scouring at different locations
adjacent to the embank-ment. It can be seen from the table that at the measuring points 4, 5
and 9, located adjacent to comers of t:;e embankmenlt. serious scouring may occur before
implementation of the site developnment. After the implementation of the site development.
the areas around,adjacent to the southwest and southeast corners of the embanklment are still
the deepest scoured areas. As for the places adjacent to the north pan of the west
embankment, there is almost no scouring either before or after the site development. But for
the central part of the south embankment (measuring points 6 and 7). over- I -ni-deep scouring
can be found before the site development, but after the site is completed, almost no scouringz
occurs there.

the dredging), after dredging(soil borrowing), no further scouring is found.
From Fig. 5.5 one can see even more clearly the local scouring distribution in the area
adjacent to the embankment. Profile A in the figure is 70m away from the boundary of the
south embankment, Profile B is 70m away from Profile A, Profile C is 70m away from
Profile B. and Profile D is 70m away from the wvest embankment boundary (see Fig.4.2).
It can be seen from the scouring distribution curves of the above four profiles under
various plans that:
(1) Under natural conditions (without the site development), the scouring depth of
Profiles A, B and C has a tendency of gradually decreasing- from upstream to
downstream. After the development of the power plant site, this tendency remains
almost unchanged, except for the decrease of the scouring scope.
(2) After the site development, the scouring near the east and west ends of the south
embankment is comparatively remarkable, and especially at the east end (upstream
end) of the south embankment, the max. scouring depth mav reach 2.5m at where
140m away from the embankment boundary (see Profile B), and the scouring
becomes even more deep where further outside.
(3) Scouring at the south part of the wvest embank-ment is obvious. and the max.
scouring depth there may reach 2m.
(4) The excavation at the Borrow Area B may lead to the increase of the river-bed
scouring depth adjacent to the south embankment.
The above shows that after the completion of the site development of the Meghna Ghat
Power Plant. under the action of the 50-vear flood. a comparatively obvious local scouring
will still occur in areas adjacent to the east and the west ends of the south embanknment. and
the max. scouring depth may reach 2.5m (about 140m away from the site boundary); the max.
scouring depth in the nearby area about 70m away from embank-ment boundary is generally
about I m; there occurs a 2-m-deep scoured pit near the south end of the west embankment.
Therefore, while considering the protection measures against the local scouring for the
embanklment, more attention should be paid to the east and the west ends of the embankment.
53 Analysis of Flow Regimc
Figs. 5.6 to 5.9 show the plane flow regime of the power plant site river section under
the design flood. Fig. 5.6 shows the flow regime without the site development while Figs 5.7

to 5.9 show the flow regime for Plans 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
The comparison between the flow regime with the Plans and that without the site
development project indicate the following differences:
(1) Under natural conditions (without the site development), the flood from the
Meghna River runs through the Meghna Bridge with its main stream tending to
move westward, and some of the flood overflows over the shoal, at where the power
plant site is located, into the north channel. After implementation of the site
development, the flood will be forced to run downstream along the south
embanklment. After passing by the south end of the embankment, the flow tums
northwestward. Therefore, a significant change with respect to the hydrodvnamic
conditions in this area will occur, which will cause the change in river bed
configuration in this areas accordingly.
(2) As the backfill project of the power plant changes the flow-splitting environment.
the intensity of the split flow over the shoal to the south of a small char located in
the south of the power plant increases obviously and this split flow has a obvious
tendency of moving southward. The development of such dynamic flow conditions
will probably lead to the formation of a new tributary to the south of the small char.
(3) As being protected by the protruding area of the right abutment of the Meehna
Bridge. an eddv-flow area wNill be formed betwveen the right abutment of the brid2e
and the east embankment. which is conducive to siltation. Therefore. no obvious
scouring wvill occur in this area.
(4) After the site development, the water area to the north of the power plant becomes
almost stagnant, where siltation is unavoidable and no scouring mav happen.
6. CALCULATION AND ANALYSIS ON MODIFIED LAYOUT
6.1 Changes of the Plans
To reflect the latest modifications in the model testing, additional calculation and analysis
ave been conducted by taking account of changes in layout of borrow arcas and the
bathymetric data obtained through the contractor's bathymetric survey. The followinc two
additional plans are calculated and analyzed in the model test:

A, B and C (P.S.+A+B+C);
Modified Plan 3(Plan 3'): the raised power plant site in combination of dredged borrow areas
A, A' and C (P.S. +A+A'+C);
The average excavated depth in the borrow areas is 4m, and the modified lavout of the
borrow areas is shown in Fig. 6.1.
The calculation conditions for the modified plans are still the data in Table 4.1.
6.2 Distribution of Sectional Flow and Change of the Elevation of River-bed
Figs 6.2(a)-6.5(a) show the results of the sectional flow distributions for the modified
Plans and Figs.6.2(b)-6.5(b) show the results of elevation variation of the riverbed. From
these figures, it can be seen that:
(1) Velocity distribution of flow and elevation variation of section I are basicallv the
same as those of the original plan (Fig. 5.1), indicating chanee of location of the
borrow area does not affect flow and river-bed near the Meghna Bridge.
(2) Flow Velocity distribution at section 2 has little change as compared with the
original plan, while the riverbed elevation in the middle of the channel decreases
obviously affected by excavation in the Borrow 4 Area B (Plan 2 ).
(3) The modified Borrow Area A' may marginally increase flow velocity and scouring
depth in areas near the south embankment (see Figs. 6.4 &R 6.5).
6.3 Local Scouring adjacent to the Embankment
A comparison of Fig 6.6 and 5.5 shows that with modified borrow areas. local scouring near
the south embankment changes greatly. Dredging in area A-.A' may increase scourino of
riverbed, that of A+B may reduce scouring, especially for the southwest turminsg point of the
south embankment, Dredging of A+A' may lead to a scouring pit over 2m in depth.
6.4 Flow Regime for the Modified Plans
Figs. 6.7 and 6.8 show flow regime for the modified plans. The figures indicate the flow
velocity within all the borrow areas decrease a little (due to excavation), and those near the
area have some increases. Evacuation of the Borrow Area B has obvious effect on diversion
of the main channel and that of Area A' may increase flow velocity of the water area near the
site.

The flow regimes of the river chlannel far away the sitc area are basically the sanme as the
calculation result of the original plans.
7.    Conclusion
According to the requirement of the Contract, a study on the river-bed stability after the
implementation of the Meghna Ghat Power Plant Site Project has been conducted by means
of a combined model system consisting of a 2-D unsteady flow model and a sedimentation
model: leading to the following findings:
(1) The 2-D unsteady flov model of the Meghna River, based on the data provided in
Appendixes 3 and 5 to the Tender Document. has been proved by the calibratior
test to be ideal in simulatinsg the flow Tegime and sediment movement in the
Meghna River and in conducting the computational study of the project options.
(2) Under 50-year-flood conditions, the natural scouring without implementation of
the site development simulated in the model shows that the scouring depth in the
main channel may reach 2-3m. that the scouring depth at the river-center shoal
mav reach as deep as 5-6m and that the scouring depth at the banak shoal is rather
small.
(3) After the implementation of the site development of the power plant. the main
stream of the river flow tends left bank- with its max. velocity increasin2 by about
0.1rn/s. At the same time. the velocitv distribution near the power plant site
decreases marginallv.
(4) After the embankment of the power plant site is completed, the longitudinal    ;'
change of the river-bed scouring will have a tendency of almost no change at the
upstrearn part and some increase at the downstream part while the cross-sectional
scouring will have following characteristics: the river-bed scouring scope adjacent
to the power plant site decreases a bit and that at the riverbed on the east of the
main channel increases to some-extent.
(5) The local scouring near the embank}ment is mainly found in the vicinity of
southeast and southwest comers of the embankment the max. scouring depth at the
location about 140m away from the south embankrment may reach about 2.5m see
Fig. 6.6).
(6) Borrow Area A and Borrow Area A' according to the Tender Documents bring
about little effect on the flow conditions and TivtT-t-d scouring in the Meghna

River. Borrow Area B has some adverse effects on the river-bed scouring depth
adjacent to the south embankment. Besides, the cross-section velocity distribution
of the main channel has produced some effects on the westward movement of the
main channel. The modified Dredging B may strengthen transportation capacity of
the main channel of the Meghna River, correspondingly, it may reduce the flow
scouring to the river-bed near the embankment of the site, and the modified
Borrow Area A + A' may increase marginally the extent and depth of the
southwest local scouring of the embankment.
(7) Layout of the embankment in the present model is determined on the basis of
coordinates provided in the Tender Document.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Analyses of Dredged Soil Samples
1.     Preliminary Analyses
On August 16, 1999 AES Meghnaghat Limited (the Project Sponsor) collected representative soil
samples of the newly dredged river bottom material at two different locations on their project site.
Mott MacDonald submitted the samples for chemical analysis at a United Kingdom based
laboratory; the results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Neither the Government of Bangladesh nor
the World Bank have established criterion for soil quality. Consequently, Canadian and
American soil guidelines have been instituted for comparison purposes.

T Ihe Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) have adopted these guideline numbers as the
Canadian Soil Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Environmental and Human Health - Industrial Land-Use
pl999).
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), Region 9, has adopted these guideline numbers as
their Risk-Based Screening Levels for Industrial Land-Uses. Region 9 (including the states of California, Arizona,
Nevada, and Hawaii) was selected for comparison, since it is understood from the U.S. EPA that this region's standards
are amongst the strictest in the country.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
At Sites A and B, the laboratory analysis indicates that arsenic levels were within the identified
CCME guidelines. However, at Site A the analysis shows a slight exceedance of the U.S. EPA
guideline by 0.25 mg/kg, while the sample collected at Site B exceeds the American guideline by
1.9 mglkg. All other sample parameters were within the guideline limits.
Although both samples were within the CCME guidelines, they do exceed the limit of the stricter
U.S. EPA guideline. Thus, the Project Sponsor again undertook additional soil sampling at Sites
I and 2 (equivalent to Sites A and B respectively) on June 22, 2000. At each site, five samples
were collected and were shipped to Philip Analytical Services Corporation (PSC), of Canada for
detailed laboratory analyses.
2.    Detailed Analyses
PSC is a certified and accredited laboratory under the joint Standards Council of Canada and the
Canadian Association of Analytical Environmental Laboratories (SCC/CAEAL) accreditation
program. The detailed sample results obtained by PSC, as well as the quality assurance and
quality control documentation, are provided in Attachment 1.
In total, five samples were collected at each site by the Project Sponsor and analysed for the
following parameters: metals, TPH, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), phenoxy acid herbicides, organophosphorus pesticides, EPA 608 priority
pollutant pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and asbestos. PSC completed their
laboratory analysis using U.S. EPA standard methods.
The results of the analytical analyses, yielded the following results:
* phenoxy acid herbicides and organophosphorus pesticides were not detected during the
chemical analysis;
EPA 608 priority pollutant pesticides, PCBs, and VOCs were not detected during the
analyses;
various PAHs compounds were detected during the analysis (e.g., phenanthrene, pyrene,
and chrysene), however, all parameters are within the guidelines;
* asbestos was not detected in any samples; and
*   various metals were detected during the analyses and are within the guidelines, with two
exceptions: arsenic and selenium.
2.1    Arsenic
Generally, arsenic exists in the environment in its natural pentavalent form that is less toxic than
the trivalent form of arsenic that is typically associated with anthropogenic introductions. The
primary natural sources for arsenic and arsenical compounds are volcanic eruptions and
biological methylation during soil weathering. Anthropogenic sources include coal combustion,
copper smelting, and gold mining.
Arsenic is a carcinogen to humans and the primary exposure is occupational (e.g., production and
application of arsenical pesticides and smelters). The primary route of exposure of humans to
arsenic is drinking water and inhalation.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Arsenic in soil is not readily available in its soluble form because it strongly adsorbs to clay
articles; groundwater contamination usually occurs after the adsorption capacity of the soil has
been exceeded. Typically, arsenic must be in its soluble form to be bioavailable and speciation of
arsenic is pH dependent. It does not bioaccumulate in either plants or animals.
At sample site 2.4 (i.e., Site B), the chemical value calculated for arsenic was 3.8 mg/kg; 1.4
mg/kg above the U.S. EPA guideline. Once again, consistent with the preliminary analytical
results, the value falls well within the CCME guideline of 12 mg/kg. The CCME guidelines used
for comparison purposes relate to the protection of human health based upon the ingestion of dirt
and is a conservative value among international standards. Subsequently, the Project Sponsor
undertook no additional sampling.
2.2    Selenium
The principle anthropogenic sources of selenium are from copper smelting and refining.
Selenium is also found in paints, varnishes, rubber, solar batteries, glass, fungicides, and
insecticides. It is, however, an essential nutrient (i.e., mineral) for both plants and animals.
While an essential nutrient, selenium can accumulate in plants to levels sufficiently high
(>25ppm) to cause toxicity in livestock. Animal exposure is generally via elevated levels of
selenium in food stuffs and forage, while human occupational exposure pathways generally
include inhalation (i.e., hydrogen selenide).
At virtually all the sample sites, the chemical analysis yielded results that were less than 60 ppm.
The laboratory equipment used in the analysis could not specify levels below 60 ppm, which
makes it hard to derive any meaningful conclusions. Although the CCME guideline of 10 ppm is
exceeded, the U.S. EPA guideline of 8,500 ppm has not been breached. Subsequently, the Project
Sponsor undertook no additional sampling.

Legend:  EQL = Estimated Quantitation Limit for undiluted samples
nd = Not Detected Above EQL
Dup. - Duplicate
Date of sample receipt: June 29, 2000
Date of sample analysis: July 4, 2000
Analytical Method:
The soil samples were analysed by low level purge & trap (US EPA Method 5035) gas
chromatographyl mass specthommtry using US EPA Method 82805.
Report Discussion:
(1) The recovery for methyl isobutyl ketone In the spiked sample was above our inhouse tolerance limits.
However, since this cornpound was not detected In any of the samples, this will not have a significant
Impact on the reported results.
Note: Esimated quantitation limit Is the lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified
limits of precision and accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions.
NOTE: An work recorded herein has been done In accordance with nornal professional standards using

To help reduce the human death toll caused by these violent storms, Bangladesh has been continually refining
its national cyclone warning system. With the assistance of satellite and radar imnaging technology, weather
forecasts and warnings are issued a minimum of 24 hours in advance of landfall by the Storm Warning Centre
of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (Ahmed and Afreen, 1992).
Soon after the formation of significant depressions, special weather bulletins are issued to radio and television
stations, port authorities, the Ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation, national media, the Bangladesh Red Cross
Society (BDRCS), and other concerned agencies/organisations (Ahmed and Afreen, 1992). The Bangladesh
Cyclone Preparedness Program, administered by BDRCS, trains, equips, and manages over 25,000 volunteers
who are responsible for evacuation, shelter, safety of people and property, medical assistance, and post-
cyclone food, clothing, clean-up, and sanitary measures. In the event that local communication services are
disrupted during or after a cyclone, BDRCS maintains a field wireless system.

Rob,
Attached are all the outstanding results for your nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide tubes.
Pleasc note that nitrogen dioxide tubes MTMC N9AA3, N9A.A3 1 and N9AA35 appear to have
been dismantled, as 1 ofthe grids containing the adsorbent was missing, so the results for these
tubes should be treated with caution. Notes regarding sulphur dioxide tubes are at the bottom of the
report (100018987).
Please accept our sincere apologies for the delay in sending the results to you.
Regards,
Paul

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
APPENDIX 18: SUMMARY OF AMBIENT NOISE MONITORING
ESG INTERNATIONAL INC.
SEPTEMBER, 2000






NOISE MONITORING OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
Procedures & Instrumentation
All measurements were taken using a Larson-Davis Model 820 Precision Integrating Sound Level Meter
(SLM). The Model 820 uses a Larson-Davis Model 828 preamplifier and a Larson-Davis Model 2560 precision air-
condenser microphone, that have been factory calibrated with the SLM unit. Calibration was checked before and after
measurements with a Larson-Davis Model CAL200 precision acoustic calibrator.
Meteorological Conditions
The weather conditions during the monitoring periods were generally favourable for the collection of ambient
noise levels.
Monitoring Sites
Noise monitoring was conducted at two sites. The locations used have been identified as the most noise-
sensitive receptors, representing mixed and residential land-uses in the vicinity of the proposed power plant Also
factored into the site selections were proximity to the proposed power plant and security considerations during
measurement. The selected sites are described briefly below:
a)     Location 1 - Islampur Village: This site was selected near residences within the Islampur village which lies
immediately to the south of the proposed power plant on the north bank of the Meghna River. The area is
predominantly residential.
a)     Location 2 - Ganganagar Village: This site was selected near residences within the Ganganagar village which
lies approximately 500m to the northeast of the proposed power plant. The area is predominantly residential.
Noise Measurement Results
Measurement results are summarized in Tables I and 2, and plotted in Figures 1 and 2. Both sites were
influenced by spurious high-level noise events sucb as vehicle homs, animals, human voices, and the Islamic calls to
prayer (Azan). These events serve to increase the Lq values in certain 30-minute periods, however, no particular event
was determined as being more dominant than another.
Location I - islampur Village
Continuous sound exposure level monitoring was conducted between 0900h on September 4,1999 and 0830h
on September 5, 1999. The noise descriptors (Lq, Lgo L.0, Llo, etc.) at Location 1 vary throughout the day, but do
follow a typical diurnal pattern with a night-time "dip" characteristic of urban environments. The daytime levels are
dominated by nearby industrial/commercial sources that operate during the day, road and river traffic, and other
activities within the village. The minimum measured night-time (2200h to 0700h) L,q (lhr) was 49 dBA, and the
minimum daytime (0700h to 2200h) Lq (lhr) was 51 dBA.
Location 2 - Ganganagar Village
Continuous sound exposure level monitoring was conducted between 1030h on September 5,1999 and 1000h
on September 6, 1999. The noise descriptors (Lw, L90, Lso, L1o, etc.) at Location 2 vary throughout the day, but do
follow the typical diurnal pattem characteristic of urban environments. The daytime levels are dominated by nearby
industrial/commercial sources that operate during the day, road and river traffic, and other activities within the village.
The minimum measured night-time ; (lhr) was 45 dBA, and the minimum daytime L., (lhr) was 49 dBA.



Discussion
Table 3 summarizes the measured ambient sound exposures at the noise monitoring locations.

AES Meghnaghat Ltd                                   Ecological Survey
Ecological Survey
1.0 Introduction
Conservation of biodiversity is now a matter of great concern within Bangladesh. There has
been increasing concern over the environmental consequences of unplanned and unregulated
development of residential, commercial and industrial infrastructure: Human population growth
is also placing an increasing demand upon natural resources. Therefore, conservation of ecology
should get priority for the greater interest of the future generations and in recent time
Government has started attaching higher priority to protecting the nature and ecology.
During the last 100 years at least 18 species of wildlife have become extinct from the country
and about 60-70 species are either endangered or threatened. To help conserve wildlife and
habitat, Bangladesh has 14 protected areas such as National Parks, Archaeological Sites and
Recreational Parks, etc.
2.0 Methodology
The study area for this survey consisted of about a 10 kilometre-radius from the proposed project
site. A team under a ecologist visited the study area several times during the period from 24 July
to 20 August 1999 in order to gather information on ecological aspects by direct observations as
well as from interviews with institutional sources and local people. Specialists in relevant fields
in the country were consulted, (see Acknowledgements) and secondary information was
collected from concerned local offices and published books, journals and periodicals (see
-       Bibliogranhv). Population estimates for the various species present in the study area, were made
from direct surveys, observations, and discussions with specialists and local peoples.
3.0 Ecology and Habitat of the Project Area
The Meghnaghat area is a composite of agricultural land, village settlements, and some industrial
units (i.e. a small dockyard, paper and pulp industry, cement/stone processing unit, garments
industry, vegetable oil mills, etc. on the northern bank, and jute mills, packaging/board mills,
cement/ stone processing units on the southern bank of the river). Except for village settlements
and industrial units, the land is primarily used for agricultural purposes, mainly for growing
crops.
The project site belongs to Pirojpur Union of Sonargaon Thana of Narayanganj district. The
proposed location of the power project is approximately 500 meters to the west of the Meghna
Bridge and is adjacent to the Meghna river bank. The villages that surround the site are Islampur,
Ganganagar, Dhudghata and Kurbanpur. These village settlements are relatively recent,
apparently with the formation of 'char land" formed by sediment and silt deposits adjoining the
river-banks.
4.0 Soils and Crop Production
The surface soil is a mixture of sands and clays and is grey in colour. There remains enough
moisture in the soil for growing crops during the dry season. The crops grown in the surrounding
area include rice, wheat, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables (tomato, eggplant, etc.), sweet potato, and

watermelon. These are grown mostly during the dry months (October-November to March/April)
because the agricultural land remains under water during the summer months.
5.0 Terrestrial Habitat
The basic landscape of the study area is flat, with village settlements and industrial units on
raised lands (4- 5 meter above the sea level). The surrounding soil belongs to the alluvial flood
plain type with 'low to medium low' elevation (i.e. about 2 m or less from the sea level). Much
of the agricultural land is subject to annual inundation and remains submerged for 4-5 months
during the summer months. Because of extensive development of the surrounding land for
agricultural, industrial and residential uses, truely natural habitats are absent from the study area.
No designated nature reserves or parkland is present within the study area.
The entire proposed power plant site was used for agricultural uses, primarily paddy land as
much of the land remained inundated year-round. During the dry season, some vegetables, wheat
and oil seeds were also grown on the site. No trees or shrubs were present on the site.
6.0 Aquatic Ecosystem
Bangladesh, being a country of rivers and open to the south with Bay of Bengal, has a diverse
range of aquatic and terrestrial resources. The greater study area, in addition to some permanent
wetlands, has long flood plains on either bank of the Meghna River, with these low-lying areas
becoming a temporary flood plain during the monsoon period. Therefore, the environment within
the Meghnaghat area is very favourable to grow and sustain a diverse group of plants and
animals. Further details of the aquatic ecosystem of the project area have been discussed in the
fishery study report.                                                                        0
7.0 Terrestrial Flora
The project area is no different than many other areas of alluvial delta of Bangladesh with mixed
crop vegetation and monoculture tree plantation and homestead based agro-forestry.
Predominantly a very fertile agricultural area, the study area grows mostly high yielding rice
varieties and rabi crops, similar to other flood plain agricultural activities within Bangladesh,
including vegetables in the winter (dry) season. The villages within the study area contain
backyard trees/forests comprised of species common throughout the country. Perennial species
occur mainly on raised lands: road sides, homesteads and the industrial units.
Low growing grasses, herbaceous vegetation and other common plant communities constitute the
floral habitat in the project area. Data collected from field through visits, observations,
interviews and institutional investigations suggests that the project area contains of a plant
community of 82 floral species. As the project site was used for growing agricultural crops, only
those plants (such as paddy, vegetables, wheat and jute) and some common low growing grasses,
were present on the site itself.
Besides cultivated agricultural crops and vegetables, the major floral species as identified during
the survey are shown in Table-1. The institutional sources and the local community in the
project area reported no vulnerable, threatened or endangered plants in the area.

AES Meghnaghat Ltd                                       Ecological Survey
8.0 Terrestrial Fauna
A thorough investigation and survey was carried out in the field and institutional sources were
consulted (see Acknowledgements) to find out the status of terrestrial fauna in the project area
and its immediate vicinity. During field visits a number of avian species, particularly birds of
common identities, were observed throughout the project area.
The terrestrial wildlife species inhabiting in the project area ranges from small organisms like
insects to large mammals like Asiatic Golden Cats. Like other floodplains of the country, the
project area consists of birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals. The section below will
describe wildlife species separately to reflect the current status of ecological resources in the
area.
8.1 Avis
About 600 species of birds are reported to be found in Bangladesh including about one third
winter migrants (Husain 1997)1. Birds adapted to forests/trees and wetlands have been affected
due to destruction of habitats, especially clearance of forests, felling of trees in village groves
and loss of wetlands. Table 2 provides information on avian species expected to be present
within the ten-kilometre radius of the proposed project site, including those listed as vulnerable,
threatened or endangered. Table 2 also provide names of birds present seasonally and other
species that are typical inhabitants at the local and regional level.
It is reported from the field and institutional sources such as, Department of Forest Department
of Zoology, Dhaka University and National Herbarium that the approximately 35-40 avian
species common in the study area are also common to other parts of the country. The habitat and
breeding ground (i.e., trees) needed by the vulnerable, near to threatened, threatened and
endangered species was absent on the proposed project site as it was use for only agricultural
crops.

9. Terrestrial Animal Species
Bangladesh, being located at the confluence of the zoo-geographical regions of the Peninsular
India, Himalayas and Southeast Asia, is rich in animal diversity.
Like avian species, several terrestrial animal species are also endangered, threatened or
vulnerable in Bangladesh because of habitat destruction and/or human interference (clearance of
forest areas, felling of trees, clearance of village bushes, 'development' of waste land, reduction
of pasture land, etc.). The various animal species expected to be present within the study area
and reference to their country-wide status is discussed in the section below.
9.1 The Mammals
Terrestrial animal species within Bangladesh include 119 mammals. Of these at least 10 species
have been identified as endangered and 5 species as threatened (NCS, 19912).
During field survey and investigations with the institutional sources around 20 wild mammals
were found to be expected in the study area. The common species in the study area are also
common to other parts of the country. Like other flood plains of Bangladesh, the study area has
some common mammals that include species of jackal, rat, cat, mouse, squirrel and others. These
species basically constitute the wild mammal group in the study area.
The Asiatic Golden Cat typically lives in areas of natural vegetation, including trees and bushes.
No Asiatic Golden Cats were seen on the site and no suitable breeding habitat (i.e., bushes,
foxholes) was observed due to the agricultural use of the site and the large number of people in
the area.
A river mammal -Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica) -  is found occasionally in the
Meghna River. The dolphin's range extends to into the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Kamaphuli and
Meghna river systems of India, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh. According to the IUCN, the
populations of Ganges River Dolphins as a whole are considered 'endangered" due to a
population reduction of at least 50% over the last three generations, based on direct observations,
a decline in extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat, and actual or potential levels of
exploitation. Perhaps the greatest threats to the dolphins is dam construction on the Ganges River
(now over 20) which have isolated the population into fragments, boat traffic, pollution, loss of
habitat, and illegal hunting.
The Ganges River Dolphin is about 1.5 to 2.5 metres long and weighs 70 to 90 kilograms. At
birth, calves measure 70 to 75 centimetres and about 7.5 kilograms. Food consists of bottom-
dwelling fish (catfish), mollusks and crustaceans.
The Bangladesh Flood Action Plan (1993) refers to the occurrence of the Ganges River Dolphin
in the North-eastern region in the Kushiyara, upper Meghna and Kalni rivers and their branches.
These regions mark the southernmost range of the dolphins. The dolphin is observed in the study
area particularly in the monsoon season. The dolphin is indicator of deep-water areas with an

abundance of large-sized fishes, and fish migratory routes in river channels, which is very much
true for Meghna river. There is no commercial fishery of dolphin. Fishing nets occasionally catch
some. Its oil is extracted and is thought to be beneficial for human health. IUCN and department
of Marine Biology, Chittagong University confirmed not more than 100 dolphin population in
the whole Meghna region. The total population is less than 5,000.
The list of wild mammals are presented in Table 4, including the threatened, endangered and
vulnerable mammalian species.

10. The Reptiles and Amphibians
The National Conservation Study of Bangladesh (1991) recorded 124 reptiles and 19 amphibians
in the country. Of these at least two amphibians and 11 reptiles are threatened.
During survey and field investigations it was found that 11 reptiles and amphibians species
inhabit in the survey area. Although they are not well represented in terms of individual numbers
the species of reptiles and amphibians present in the study area including river and land turtles,
are quite common in flood plain areas like the Meghna Basin. Lizards are very common in the
survey area like any other part of the country, which is also true for frogs.
Several fresh water species of turtles are commercially exploited in Bangladesh for export and
local consumption. The species of highest economic importance are Trionyx gangeticus, Trionyx
hurum, and Lissemys punactata. The District Fisheries office states that fresh water turtle meat is
widely used as a source of protein in the study area. In most of thewetlands of the estuary the
temporary dry season fishing camps (Khola) are built near the water bodies. Most of the
fishermen living in these camps regularly consume turtle meat which they catch. Resident
fishermen also trap turtles throughout the year either for their own consumption or to sell in the
markets. The Hindu community of the area consume turtles as food and use them as medicine
and on religious occasions.
The species which are common in the area are Roof Turtle (Kachuga tecta), Brahminy Turtle
(Hardella thurjii), Peo Soft Shell Turtle (Aspideretes hurum), Spotted Pond Turtle (Geochlemys
hamiltonii), and Spotted Flapshell Turtle (Lissemys punctata). The remains of the turtles found
near human habitations indicate that the group was part of man's diet for centuries in the Meghna
area and the rest of the country.
The turtles are present in both the wet and dry seasons. They lay their eggs on the gound near by
the water or other suitable place near by the bush or swampy areas in the wetland.
The Gharials travel in the deep water of the entire Meghna River along the main course. They
nornally take rest on the sandbars or shoals in the river. They also stay near by the bushes,
catkin forest (bush) in the shoals in the river. They also stay near by the bushes, catkin forest
(bush) in the shoals of the river. It is also reported that oil from turtles is extracted and used for
medicinal purpose to cure respiratory diseases, rheumatic fever and skin diseases.
Table 6 presents the list and other particulars of reptiles and amphibians inhabit in the area,
including threatened, endangered and vulnerable reptiles and amphibians.

1.0 lntroduction
Bangladeshi is a laind of rivers, rice and rishes. rPish is an important source of protein to the
regular diet of Bang)ndeshi people. Fish were once found everywhere in abundance.
Ilowever, due to adverse effects on aquatic environment andi inadequate governmental and
conmmunity management, the tiatural growtli anid production of fislies are gradually
decreasing. Fish contribetes abouit 64% prote.ini intake to Uangindeshi people. About 19%
people or Bangladesh  are eithfer on full timie or parl time basis living 013 fislhin. A substantial
anmoint of export earniing is also performed by the fishery sector. Ililsba and Prawns are lie
niajor export fish species of Bangladesh, along withi few species from marine fislieries.
Recently, increasing emnplhasis has beenl paid on the development of aquacultuire in the
country.
2.0 Purpose or the Suirvey
In order to collect information on the state of affairs of squatic habitat of Meghba river in the
project atea and deltils about tle fishemien community, including status of the traditionlal
fishing activities, fish market information, and pricing structure, a survey was carried out in
tle flood plain of the Meghna river (Upper Meghna). Also an attempt was made to assess the
quantity the rish catch in the flood plain th}rough gatheting data fom botl prinary and
secondary soutrces. To idenitify the alieo fish species, present situation of pisciculture and to
assess the effect of cross-breeding cultivation of various types of fishes in Whe Meghna
esluary, fwtlicr survey and invesligation wats made in the project area. Institutiontal sources
provided a substantial infonnation to complete thie study.
3.0 Survey Implemen:tation
A teain coumprising four members namiely, Mr Malbbubur Ranmai, Mr MA.Faruque and Mr
Manjurul Islam and I& Shafiqul Islarm was engaged for conducting Rlie suPvey and gathering
data from the ficld and various secondary sources. The field team was guided and supervised
by Mr M A Wahab, a trained Fishery Biologist during the whole process of the field survey,
data collection and study ineluding report preparation. In the flield, the team collected data
fmin the nmarkets, fishermen community, fish traders, markets committees. Again they lhave
collected data from the District and Iliana Fishxeries Ofrices and other institutional sources.
llbe data available withi thie Depadmeint of Fisheries (DOF) and Bangladesb lBureau of
Statistics (13BS) publication were also extensively used for preparing this brief report. During
the process, lte team also consulted tht De.partment of Zoology, DDhaka University alid
Departmenit of Fisheries aid Aquaculture, Bangladesl Agricultural Usiiversity, MIymensingh.

The wetlanid ccosystems are very much) depenEIent to the national economy and lire of the
people of Bangladcsh whose living condiliotis are inextficably linked to lhe productivity and
sustainability of wellainds. Wetlinnds in BangladeslI are characterized by vegetation, aquatic
plants, reeds and algae. In addition, wetlands provide suitable habitat conditions for a large
nuinber fiii-fish, prawnis, crabs, Lurtls, bivalve and gastropod mollusks, birds, etc.
Ballgladesh being country of rivers opeti to the soutl wilti Bay of Dengal, has given a big
room of diverse aquatic resources. The project area in addition to some permanent wvetlands,
has long flood plain on eitier bank of the Meghna river systems and Ihese low lying areas
becmne a lemporary flood plain during the monsoon period. 7Therefore, the environment
prevails in the surrounding of Meginaghat area is very favorable lo grow a diverse group of
plants and aniimals.
5.0 Description or tIim Suirvey Ai-ea
Although generalized pictures of the welland ecosystems of Bangladesh are availab1c,
detailed and specific data and information on tde particular wetland and flood plain of Ike
Meghna River estiuary are not easily available. in the present sLudy we have tried our best to
collect the rlekvant/pertinent data to reflect the aquatic environment of the project area, in
plarticular.
The upper Meghna covers the area from the confluence of the Meghiia-Padma at Chandpur to
i31iairab upstream. A vast tract of wetland and flood plain of the Megiin is the sanctuary for
lisliing. At least 24% or ite total fish species supply to the national and international markets
are from the Meghna basin, particulaily from the study area rurtier tbe Meghna river alone
accounts for approximately 12% of Bangladeshii's inland water total of common grass carp
and mirror carp.
upper Megimna as a whole covers an area of 33,952 lha. whicil is aboul one percent of total
open watet areas of the country. The Meghna esLtary las beeni stretchWed lom Cliandpur to
Bhairab in the downstream and upstream respectively. In the ettreme downstream Haimchlar,
Mlatlab and Chandpur thanas of Cliandpur district on the left bank of tie river, Ilijla Lbana of
Batisal district in the right bank of the river, Munshiganj Sadar, Gazaria thamas hi the district

in tlie tip stream left bank of thle River MegJua. For ithis study, area consist of the Upper
Mvghna Estuary' as illustrated in .a1_1.
6.0 Tope o Fish Species in tIme Sttidy Area
A variety o0 fish species are available in thle [iod plain of the ieglina river. Major species
are lRui, different types of Carps, Prawns, Boal, 3tchat, Data and Siver Carps. Golda
Chingree (Prawnls) used to be most abundant in tie lower and upper Neglmna River and its
adjacent lloodplains. According to Ihe Flood Action Plan (FAP-6) Study done in 1993, the
breeding periods of most species of major carps are in the Megihna flood plains fiom April to

June. The occurrence of major carp spawning in the head water steam of Surma River in the
Barak River basin of India. This indicates thlat the upper Meghna stocks nigiate up steam to
India to spawn there.
A river mammal - Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica) -  is found occasionally in
tbe Meghna River. The dolplpin's range extends to into the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Karnaphuli
atd Meghna river syslems of India, Blhutan. Nepal and Bangladeshi. According to tlle IUCN,
the populations of Ganges River Dolpl)ins as a whole are considered 'endangered" due to a
population reduction of at least 50% over the last three generationis, based on direct
observations, a decline in extetit of occurrence and/or quality of habitat, and actual or
potential levels of exploitation. Perhaps the greatest threats to the dolphins is dam
construction on the Ganges River (now over 20) which have isolated the population into
fragments. boat traffic, pollution, loss of labitat, arid illegal hunting.
The Ganges River Dolphin is about 1.5 to 2.5 metres long and weighs 70 to 90 kilograms. At
birth, calves tmeasure 70 to 75 centimetres and about 7.5 kilograms. Food consists of bouton-
dwelling fisli (catfish), mollksks and crustaceans.
Tihe Bangladesh Flood Action Plan (1993) refers to lthe occurrence of the Ganges River
Dolphin in the North-eastern region in the Kushiyara, upper Meghns and Kalni rives and
their branches. These regions mark dhe southernmost range of the dolphins. The dolphin is
observed in tEie study area particularly in the monsoon season. The dolphin is indicator of
deep-water -reas with an abuidance of large-sized rishes, and fish migralory routes in river
channels, which is vcry much true for Meghna river. I'here is no commercial fishery of
dolphin. Fisling nets occasionally catLch some. Its oil is extracted -and is thought to be
beneircial fur human health. IUCN and department of Marine Biology, Chittagong University
confirnmed not more than 100 dolplin population in the whole Meghna region. Ibe total
population is less than 5,000.
7.0 Fish Catch in tite Meglhn: Estuary
Table I presents fish catch data of the upper Meghna river system for the last five years.
These data collected from.secondary sources suggest a more or less stable catch for all
species except small shrimp during the last five years. But a general trend in catch data shiows
a gadual decline of catch over the last years. As a maUer of concern, catch in 1993-94 (6112
Melric tonncs) compared to yea 1997-98 (2938 Mettric tonaes) is less than half.

B.O Fislueries Comniunity
A major poition of the people residing along Ihe Megluia estuary are either directly or
indirectly involved with rishery activities. Sotme of them deal in fish and some culture fishCe
in the area. Traditionally, a lower caste of Ilindus is involved in fisihing as a community for
centuries. With the change of the national economy the character and composition of
fishermen community has been changed. Now, all people having the fish cultivating land aTe
more or less related with fishiing activily and rtsh trading within the immediate vicinity in the
study Area. A generat esLiatle suggest that about 35-40 villages in the Meghna estuary area
are r-edoninantly fishiLng villages.
9.0 Life and Economy of Meghon Estuary People
The rich and diverse nature of the water environments in the Meghna river flood plain
provide the opportunity to tlhe niajority of the farming population to engage in fishing
sometime during tIie year. In addition lo such fishing, there are some professional activities
for lull-time fishers for whom fishing is even main occupation. Even they fish seasonally and
many or them were dependent upon non-fishing jobs to make ends meet. Onset of heavy rains
in June and July, the breeding move out of the large rivers like the Meghna and farmers begin
to rish in hollows and paddy fields in which was found a large number of smnall fishes.
Many professional fishers are boatmen who weave their nets, transport fish from catching
points to markets, spin ttiread for lines, make missiles, fix anid mobile traps, cure and preserve
fish, manufacture fish oil. The District Fisheries office, Narayangonj lhat more than 12
percent households in the Meghna river system catchlnent area are engaged in fishing
activities. TI,e community life and household economy in remote nural villages are directly
influenced by fishery and related activities. Because of relative familiarity of local people
witb fishing activities, in recent days richer segmentts of fishery community are moving to
cultural fisheries and this has now become quite common in the Meghna river area.
10.0 Aquanlic lRabitals
Bangladeshi possesses 260 species of rresh water fishes, some species of molluscs (so far 20
species have been identifed), arthropods (60 species of prawns), reptiles, 477  mmals and
other invertebrates.
Tlhe upper Mcglua river as a floodplain including wet lands, swamps, canals, haor/ baors,
beels, other water bodies are the important habitats for fisihes. In addition, the excavated
ponds, and compartmenLalized water reaches are also used as rishing grounds for the
cultured piscicultue. Paddy fields during the monsoon become the vast tract of fish habitats
for a definite period from May to December. Moreover, hatcheries, specially protected waLer
pools are breeding grounds of the spawns, fries and shrimps.
11.0 Breeding Nrlod aiid Ground
Bangladesh has the unique advantage of possessing the world's largest delta, the Ganges
DelLa, whliclh offers a vast and varied fisheries potential in its fresh, brackish and marine

Bangladesh are inhabited by 260 indigenous and 1  exotic species of fish (Rahman 1989) ard
25 species of Prawn (Ali, 1992).
Both the Kushiiara and ilhe Surnia river drain into the upper Meglina near Habiganj district
town of greater Sylliet district. All of these rivers and their tributaries and distributors
overflow their banks and flood extensive areas of the low lying lands during the monsoon
from May to October. Bangladesh have 9,300,000 ha of flood plains including 2,834,000 ha
of paddy fields inundated for three to four months of the year. Out of which the Meghna river
syslemns occtupy about 33.592 ha. These flood plains are also important fishi breeding habitats.
According to the Flood Action Plan (PAP 1993), the breeding periods of most of the species
of major carps are April to June. Major carp spawning grounds are located in the headwater
streams of the Surma and Kusliiara rivers and in ille l3arak in India. This indicates that tile
upper Meghna stocks migrate upstream to India Lo spawn tlhere.
12.0 Fisl 1ininrketing tntd Distribution Systeni
12.1 MarILCetillg Structture
Powerful marketing internmediaries are controlling the fish market in the project area. Four to
five influential market intermediaries usually involved in the marketing of bulk quantity of
fisieries products. In general, the fisli markeL is strictured in levels as follows:
Pfimary Maidet
Agents (fissh btokers) which are commonly called as " Dalals/Nikari" approach the primary
producers (the fishermen or the farmers) and procure fishes on btihalf or the primary fish
traders (Mahlajans or Aratdar cumn Mahiajans). In lieu of their services the agents get
commission from Mahajans. PortiDns of the catchi/production are also sold locally in village
markets through fishermen themselves or retailers for local consumption. The Meginaghat
and its surrcounding primary fish markets also operate in the same way, In the irmmediatc
vicinity of the project arca about 7 or 8 suchi markets exists wihich Forms the primary market
strucure of the area.
,Secondary Afarkd
Fish collected througb different sources and places by the collectors (Mahajaxs) are brought
to the nearby thana (or large) mnarkets used as fish selling points. Meghuaghat is one of suclh
fish markets/selling points even in the whole country. At this point, fishes are sold to the next
intermediaries, the fish traders locally known as "Beparies". With the help of commission
agents (ArnLdars), tljey conLrol these sales points. It wu reporied that 4 or 5 fish traders
control 85% of thte total fish marketing volume in the Megliraghat point. Further
investigptions on the total volume suggest that about 80-100 metric tons (MT) fishes of
different species are traded in the Meghnaghat selling point.
Ifigher .Seconrd ayAarket
The lradens (Beparies) of lhe Meghnagbat area carry the fish to Dhaka, Chittagong and other
important market centers by road, rivcr or rail and sell fishes it to the distributors (Paikars)
through tile commission agents (Aratdars), At this point the divergence starts and the

products are chainelised through the distribution channels. A good quantity of Meghna river
fishes like Pramn, l3ilsha etc. are also exported to international markets.
Firh, Pramn and Shirinmp Sparwrn/Fingerlings Marketing
Aquaculture development in tthe country has also catalyzed the growth of the fish, shrimp and
prawn seed industry. Spawn are produced by hatcheries and a1so coliected from natural
sources. Meglinaghat area is known as one of the major fish, prawn and shrimp spawns
supplying sources of tlc coulltty. Recently the small hatcheries have proved to be
econonically viable to tlie local pcople in the area, especially to tlie unemployed youths.
13.0  Fish, Distribuntion Market
Distributors sell their purchase to the retailers. Retailers, in turn, sell their products directly to
the consumer through fixed stalls in city/town markets or by vending on head or by rickshaw
vans. Some of the retailers take it back to the suburban areas or peripheral areas for selling it
to the local consumers.
Consignments of fish or fisheries products are handled by the concerned intermediaries at
different marketing poinits. As and when required, products are cleaned, iced, sorted,
preserved, stored, repacked and transported. Meghnaghat point is one of the major location of
Bangladesh's fish distribution system
Chittagong, Cox'6 Bazar, Barisal, Khulna, Bagerhat, Satkhira and Cbandpur are major
landing and marketing centres for bulk quantity of marine and brackishwater fish and shrimps
species. Bhairab Bazar, Kuliarchiar, Narsingdi, Bhugyakul, Munshiganj, Nilkomal are on the
other hand, myor leading and marketing centres for freshwater fish. Besides these, Lhere are
other landing/collection and marketing centres for fish caught from flood plain areas.
14.0 Fish rood
The availability of supplemenLary feed is one of the key inputs in fish culture for enhancing
fish production. The common supplementary feeds in Bangladesh are rice bran, wheat brmn
oil cake and some other agricultural wastes. As a resource constraints country, there is a
severm competition for these agricultural wastes for raising livestock and as fuel. Therefore,
the fish nutritionists aud aquaculOurists have been exploring the possibility of utilizing
alternative sources like soft plant leaves and aquatic vascular plants. Amongst several aquatic
plants, duckweed (Lenina sp.) whicih normally grows easily in backyard dilches, canals and
derelict ponds everywhere in Bangladesh is being considered as highly feasible provision. A
duckweed-1ed rish ponds appears to provide with a complete, balanced diet for those carps
that consunie it directly, while the faces of duckweed feeding species, are consumed directly
by detritus feeders, or indirectly through fertilization, plankton and other natural food
organisms, provide adequate food for reniaining bottom and column-feeding carp varieties.
15.0 Souree of Fish Constinied
Bangladesh nloodplains are a complex environment with a wide range-of habitats utilized to
varying degrees by most species of fish. Table 2 below shows the sources of fish consumed
in Bangladesh by species grougps. The ability of the species to utilize diverse habitats is a key
feature of the Megbtia floodplain. This has important implications for the long-term survival

16.0  Fishl Migration
Canals play t critical role in fish population dynamics in the Meghhna river floodplain. They
provide the important migration pathways for fish moving from rivers to floodplain during
early life stages and for reproductive purposes. Fish population stability in the floodplain
depends on fvnctioning canals. In the study area, most consumedspecies of fish were
observed to actively or passively migrate into the canals in the beginming of the monsoon
season. Major Carps (Catla catla, Labeo ro/ita, Labeo caclbasu Cirrhiiaus mrigala) begin
their longitudinal migration between March and May from their dry season habitats in beels
and the lower reaches of rivers to upstream spawning areas in the Meghna and Brahmaputra.
They spawvn fom May to August. Of all the rivers in Bangladesh, the Brmhmaputra has the
richest stock of major carps (Tsai and Ali 1986). During the day season, most speaes inhabit
the deeper waler of permanent river systems.
A schematic diagram of fish migration pattems is included as Figure 1.
17.0 Fisli Environment
The importance of fishes in the lives of the people is not surprising in the vast river systems
of the Megihna (the Brahmaputra, the Gumti and the M.eghna). The waters of this river
systems and many branches and tributaries of the river have been central to the lives of both
the fishers anid non fishers. In addition to the low lying area (all kinds of depressions,
wetlands, beefs and haours of the Meghna river flood plains) of the region is tbe fishing
hiabitats. Seasonal fishing durintg the rainy season usually increases due to the regular
flooding which is common for every year.
18.0 Culture Psciculture
In the up stream of the upper Meghna, there are many ponds that are used for the production
of fish. In the ponds, they mainly produce fish fries in the hatcheries. ln the Upper Meghna,
(he hatchleries have been established in the flood plain of the Meghna fiver, in the district of

Comilla district, Kuliarchnr and Bhairab TManas of Kishoreganij district. In order to meet up
the demand of lhe fish the Government has taken initiatives to promote the fish production
providing loans to the fishermen as well as the non- fishermen.
In the project area a number of hatcheries are located in the surrounding of Meghnaghat point
and few important of them are at Baidder Baar (Sonargeon), Daudkandi Bridge upstream
point, ponds sutuated at Basundhara Paper hills Complex etc.

AES Meghnaghat Ltd                                                 Fisheries Survey
20.0   Results of Fisi Survey and lnvestigatiou
A rield survey was conducted among the local people, fisliermen, markel people including
traders, traditional fishermen community and others to know the fishing prMctices, fishing
seasons, approxiniate quantity of catcih by species,,price per kg, fishing grounds u5ed by fish
species etc. During the process of field survey and investigation, in all 30 people were
interviewed and consulted, using a structured checklist (checklisL attached) in the surrounding
ofupper Mcghna river area.
Table 4 summarized the results of the survey and investigation made. It is evident from the
data that out of around 30 listed species, as yet only eight (8) species are cultured in ponds
and the rest are predominantly practiced as captured fislieries in the Meglina river. In the
upper Megina river system, except Rui, Catla, Carp, Catfish, Hilsa all species are in genena
available year round. Most reasonably Ifilsa bas the highest catch in thc catch season
followed by Catla and Carp. Fish prices are in general very high in the Meghna region as
reported by all respondents interviewed and consulted, which is not also unusual to other
parts or the country. Except Catfisih, l-lilsa, and Bata all oLlier fish species in the Meghna
river area uses both river anid flood plain as habitats.

Road Traffic Survey
1.0 Introduction
In Bangladesh the road communication network is not extensively developed. The road
width is narrow with respect to the traffic volume. The road system is connected by
bridges and culverts constructed even sometime within half a kilometer distance in most
of the highways. The incidence of accidents now on the highway is also higher than that
of any other time. The types and models of vehicles plying on the highway are variant
and old. All kinds of vehicle especially the old buses, trucks and tempos and auto
rickshaws discharge black smokes while plying on the road. Even that about 80% of the
vehicles running on the road systems are re-conditioned and sometimes the cars operated
on road are practically out of order emitting black smokes hazardous to public health and
thus polluting the environment. Most of the roads in our country are constructed with
Bitumen-concrete mixture which are susceptible to the tropical climate Bangladesh
experience almost all the year round.
2.0 Purpose of the Survey
With a view to counting the actual numbers of the vehicles plying along the Dhaka-
Chittagong Highway a road traffic survey was carried out. The survey work was also
designed to collect inforrnation during high-traffic time periods. The data is also
supplemented with road accident data collected from secondary sources.
3.0 Methodology
For the purpose of carrying out the survey, a team consisting of three surveyors was
deployed to the survey location. A survey assistant from the locality was engaged for the
purpose of assisting the team especially to continue the nighttime survey work. The
vehicles were counted immediately at the time of passing the station and recorded in data
record sheet. The vehicles were counted simultaneously for both directions.
4.0 Survey Period
The survey period for both motorized and non-motorized vehicles was from 23 July to 24
July and 26 July to 27 July 1999. The survey was conducted continuously over a 24-hour
period on each date.
5.0 Description of the Site
The site of the Meghnaghat Power Project lies at the left bank of the River Meghna that is
about 40 km away from Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. The site is also situated at
the west side of the Dhaka-Chittagong highway in the mouza Char Ramzan Sonaullah
(Village Islampur) of Thana Sonargaon under Narayanganj district.
DPC                                                                 page-1



AES Meghnaghat Ltd                                     Road Traffic Survey
As a result of the construction of bridges over the Meghna and the Gumti rivers the
country's biggest seaport Chittagong and the tourist spot Cox's Bazar have been directly
connected with Dhaka. The recently completed Bangladesh's longest bridge over the
Jamuna River, have been also connected directly with Banglaband, the country's north-
western most land port in Tetulia Thana in the district of Panchagarh. Consequently, the
traffic volume over the highway is being increased rapidly.
6.0 Condition of the Highway
The devastating flood of the last year, 1998 ravaged the three-fourth area of the whole of
Bangladesh. The Dhaka-Chittagong highway was inundated at several points from
Kanchpur to the Meghnaghat. The 1998 flood, the highest catastrophe of the century,
breached the highway at many points. The swirling waters of the Meghna and the
Brahmaputra river-systems washed away the flanks of the highway in a stretch of several
kilometers from Kanchpur upto the Meghnaghat. The highway was seriously damaged
and many pockets, borrow pits and holes were created on the surface. The furies and
bores of the devastating flood eroded the slopes and shoulders of the road and made most
of the old bridges over the highway weak & unrestraint to allow the vehicles over the
road. They were unable to bear the heavy truckloads. The bridges needed to be replaced
for safe and smooth running of the vehicles.
The Government has taken proper initiatives to rehabilitate/develop the road
systems immediately after the recession of the floodwaters. The following types of
construction works are going on in full swing.
a) Bridge Construction
At least three medium-sized bridges over the highway upto the Meghnaghat are being
constructed rapidly. For these reasons many diversions and belly bridges have been
placed at several points of the road.
b) Widening the Road Width
Anticipating the future traffic volume over the highway, the road width is being widened
by filling earth or sand on either side of the road. The bricks, brick bats and concrete
remain heaved up for construction work at the roadside. The earth compaction, dressing
work, shoulders making and finishing work are being accelerated in the meantime. The
road carpeting work will be done just after full compaction & gaining sufficient stiffness.
c) Rise of Road Height
Considering the Highest Flood Level (HFL) of the flood occurred in 1998, the height of
the road is being elevated above the HFL of 1998 and the earth filling work is going on
accordingly. The sand and earth are being brought to the construction site by the
motorized boats and vessels for the construction purpose.

d) Selection of the Site for the Traffic Survey
The site for the road traffic survey was selected at the south tip of the Meghna Bridge.
This is situated at the Chayana Bazar in Gazaria Thana under Munshiganj district. The
vehicles ply on the road for almost 24 hours. Even the pedestrians move on the highway
during the late evening. All kinds of vehicles like Bus, Truck, Minibus, Auto-Rickshw,
Rickshaw, etc. were counted on both directions. The survey was performed for 24 hours.
7.0   Data Processing
The counted and recorded data were classified and formatted/tabulated categorically to
show the traffic profile through computer entry.
8.0   Findings
The vehicles plying on the road are very common in Bangladesh with some exception.
Traffic volume along Dhaka-Chittagong highway is steadily increasing and to help
alleviate the problem, the highway is being expanded from two lanes to four with an
anticipated completion period of 2003 year.
9.0   Road Accidents
A list of road accidents occurred on the Highway were collected from Sonargaon Police
Station for a period from January, 1994 to July, 1999.

River Traffic Survey
1.0 Introduction
The AES Meghnaghat Limited had assigned DPC Group, Dhaka to carry out the traffic
survey. As the Meghnaghat river port is one of the major inland river port and trading
center, the importance of the area is also rapidly increasing day by day due to various
developmental efforts in the region. To asses this increased importance it is essential to
estimate the river traffic volume of the River Meghna to find out the trend of inland
business activities of the locality.
2.0 The Meghna River-
The Meghna river is one of the longest river of Bangladesh. It originates from the
Barrack River passing through Assam Province of India and finally enters into
Bangladesh near Zakiganj Thana of Sylhet district in the name of the Surma River. The
Barrack River has been bifurcated at the point Zakiganj in the name of I) The Surma and
2) The Kushiara. The united courses of these rivers in the downstream near Habiganj the
river system flows southward in the name of the Meghna. The Meghna meets the old
Brahmaputra near Bhairab passes through the present Meghnaghat and flows into the Bay
of Bengal again meeting with the Padma River at the downstream of Chandpur. Many
people (45% of the total population of Bangladesh) residing in the flood plain of the
Meghna live on fishing, in-land trading activities on the Meghna including a substantial
contribution to the agricultural production system of the entire river basin.
3.0 Purpose of the Survey
The survey was carried out to know the traffic volume transported on the river,
particularly at the survey location with a view to estimate the importance of the water
transport system operates in the region.
4.0 Time Period
The river traffic survey was carried out on 27 July and 29 July, 1999. The survey work
was performed for 16 hours in both the days.
5.0 Survey Team
A team consisting of three members was deployed to the traffic counting location in order
to carry out the survey work. One local assistant was hired for the night to support the
DPC team. The team members counted both stream (up stream and downstream) bound
vessels simultaneously.
DPC                                                                 page-i

6.0 Selection of Site for the River Traffic Survey
Based on the maximum availability and accessibility of the vessels at the points over the
scheduled time period, the sites for river traffic survey were selected at some suitable
locations on either side of the Meghna River. The stations were also selected on the basis
of inforrnation of the river traffic volume from the local key informants. The river survey
was carried out at four stations like-I) Islampur 2) Super Board Mills point 3) Ishmanir
Char and 4) Bati Betagir Char.
7.0 Methodology
The survey activity was performed rotatorily by 4 teams (surveyors). The surveyors
counted the vessels for 16 hours from 06 AM to 10 PM continuously. The counting and
recording was performed for both upstream and downstream bound vessels
simultaneously.
8.0 Data Processing
The counted and recorded data was classified and formatted/tabulated categorically and
shown in the traffic profile with the help of computer data entry and processing.

APPENDIX 114:
Disease Vectors in Bangladesh
Malaria, black fever, cholera, and small pox have essentially been eradicated from Dhaka (Bigelow,
1995). Outside of Dhaka, however, parasitic and communicable diseases are more common. The parasitic
and communicable diseases that may be encountered in the vicinity of the MPSA are described below:
> Malaria is an infectious tropical disease caused by the protozoa Plasmodium and is primarily
transmitted to humans by the bite of the Anopheles mosquito, which are most active between
dusk and dawn. However, malaria can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, and by
contamninated needles and syringes. Protection from biting mosquitoes is the first line of
defence against malaria;
. Typhoid Fever is caused by the systemic bacteria Salmonella typhi, which infects the
intestinal tract and occasionally the bloodstream. It is usually transmitted by food or drink
that has been contaminated by feces or urine of an infected person;
H Hepatitis A, B, and C are viral infections of the liver. Hepatitis A is a contagious viral disease
which is most commonly spread from person to person through fecal contamination and then
hand-to-mouth contact, or through contaminated food and water. Hepatitis B and C are
contracted through the transfer of blood products or sexual activities;
D Dengue Fever is a severe, frequently fatal viral disease transmitted by urban Aedes
mosquitos. The principal vector mosquito is Aedes aegypti, a species found living in close
association with humans in most tropical urban areas. The disease is usually benign and self-
limiting after about 7 days. Dengue may also present as a severe and fatal hemorrhagic
disease, called dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). There is no specific treatment for dengue
infection;
. Schistosomiasis (also known as "bilharzia") is an infection by eggs of the Schistosoma
flatworm. The infection may be contracted when a persons skin comes in contact with
contaminated fresh water in which certain types of snails are living. Fresh water becomes
contamiinated by Schistosoma eggs when infected people urinate or defecate in the water;
- Cholera, an acute diarrhoeal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium
Vibrio cholerae, is a major problem in Bangladesh. A person may get cholera by drinking
water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium or through contact with feces-
contaminated water or food. The cholera bacterium may also live in the environment in
brackish rivers and coastal waters. The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but
sormetimes it can be severe.
Vaccination, where available, and prudent behaviour can be a very effective mneans to avoid contracting
these common parasitic and infectious diseases.
