1.0 History and Archaeology of the Area
Sonargaon: For a brief period from 1338 to 1352, Bengal appeared to have been divided into
two provinces of East & West for the first time, each ruled by different Sultans. At that time
Sonargaon (Suvarnagram) became the capital of the East Bengal for the first time. Until the end
of the reign of the Mughal Emperor Akbar (1556-1605), Sonargaon, then reverently called "
Hazrat Jalal Sonargaon" meaning the seat of the Mighty Majesty, was the capital of then east
Bengal. The tract of the country, lying 18 miles north east of Dhaka City, was very expensive,
having the area of 48 miles in length and 20 miles in breadth. Being located at the confluence of
three important rivers, namely Meghna, Brahmaputra and Lakhaya, it acquired considerable
repute as a port city connecting Bengal by sea with the Middle and the Far East countries. From
the writings of the Chinese Voyagers who visited Sonargaon in the 15'h century, it was evident
that it was a walled city with broad roads, temples and bazars. Sultan Sher Shah (1540-1545) of
Shur Dynasty built a highway (well known as the Grand Trunk Road) from Sonargaon to Nilab
(Indus), covering a distance of about 2500 miles on both sides of which there were avenues of
shady trees, wells and inns at important places.
Originally Sonargaon was a part of the Buddhist kingdom of Bikrampur (A Parguna comprised
the vast tract of land of present Munshiganj and Bakerganj Zila). For about a century before the
Muslim conquest it was an independent kingdom under the Buddhist Kings. Since then, this part
of Bengal was ruled over by the different kings of different dynasties like Mourza, Krishan,
Gupta, Deva, Pal, Barma and Sen dynasties since 324 B.C. to 1225 A.D. The period of the reign
of those kings was 324 B.C. to 187 A.D.; 187 to 315; 524 to 647; 650 to 920; 920 to 1100 and
1098 to 1225 for the dynasties respectively mentioned above. The famous kings among those
dynasties in the history of Bengal were Samudra Gupta, Chandra Gupta, Harshabardhan and
Lakhashman Sen. After the tragic fall of Sen dynasty, the Muslim's Rule had been established in
this kingdom. lktyaruddin Muhammad Bin Bakhtiar Khiljee, commander in Chief of
Kutubuddiin Ibek, Sultan of Delhi, conquered Nabadwip (Nadia) in 1203. There is a saying that
on hearing this news that Bakhtiar Khiljee was marching towards his kingdom, King Lakshaman
Sen ran away through the back door of his palace even leaving his family in the palace and thus
the rule of Muslim in this kingdom had been founded permanently. Again in 1281, Sultan
Balaban of Dehli came to the vicinity of this place in search of his rebel governor of Bengal,
Mughisuddin Tughril, and ultimately caught him on the border of Jajnagar in West Bangal. At
this time, one Danuj Ray of Deva dynasty was the king in Sonargaon. It appears that after the
departure of Balaban, his son Bugra Khan (1283-1291) started his eastward push from
Lukhnauti, an old city situated in the Nadia district of West Bengal. The conquest of Sonargaon,
right upto Sylhet was completed by Sultan Shamsuddin Firoz Shah of Lukhnauti (Capital of
Nabadwip kingdom) in Nadia district of present West Bengal of India. After Firoz Shah, his son
Ghyasuddin Firoz Shah ruled over Sonargaon before he assumed sovereignty over the whole of
Bengal from 1322 to 1328.
During the Mugahl (The world famous dynasty of Indian Empire), this kingdom was ruled by
some independent sultans or Subadars who declared independence now and then of this territory
or rebelled against the administrative bondage of Delhi. The famous among them were Isha

Khan, Nawab of the Bar Bhuiyan, Nawab Alibordi Khan ( Nawab of Bengal , Bihar & Orissa)
and Nawab Seraj Ud Doula (Last independent Nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa). In 1757,
Nawab(Govemor) was defeated by the British Forces (Forces of East India Company) at the
battle of Palassy. And thus the entire territory of the Nawab fell under the British rule. In this
way the importance of this part had been put under the grim shadow of oblivion. Again, Bengal
was divided into two parts namely 1) East Bengal comprising present Bangladesh and Assam
Province of present India, and 2) Present west Bengal during the reign Lord Karjon in 1905.
Dhaka became the capital of the newly formed province and regained its glory. Again Bengal
had been unified with west Bengal during the reign of Lord Hardinge in 1911. Finally, Bengal
had fallen into Pakistan when India achieved its independence in 1947 from the British Regime.
Last of all Bangladesh attained its independence through war of liberation against the Pakistani
occupation forces in 1971.
Sonargaon being the old port city attained its importance due to the fact that the world famous
Muslin (Mull-Mull) of Dhaka used to be shipped to all parts of the civilized world from this port.
Sonargaon being the place of historical interests has been declared as the folk art center of the
country. Every year a number of tourists pays a visit to this place to observe the architectural
elegance and archaeological aspects of the old installations of Sonargaon. Now Sonargaon has
retained the status of an administrative Thana of Narayanganj district.
Narayanganj: Narayganj is the old river port of the country. It is the most densely populated
area of the district. During British period it attained the sub-divisional town of the district Dhaka.
Narayanganj zila has attained its over all importance due to the establishment of industries, mills
and factories like Adamjee Jute Mill, the biggest Jute Mill of the country (also biggest in Asia).
2.0 Architecture
Architecture in this district is deeply rooted in its soil. Its origin can be traced to those humble
beginnings of bamboo huts that even now characterize the humbler homes in the remote villages.
The use of bamboo and the damp climate of this district have dictated a particular trend in the
architectural style of the district. Over and above these local trends, the architectural
developments have been dominantly affected by a building tradition that is associated with the
Muslims. With the coming ofthe Muslims in this country a uniform pattern took final shape and
the entire architectural aspect in the district was changed.
In the pre-Muslim period the temple style was the unique achievement of the Buddhists. It found
its revival in the Dakeshwari and Kalibari temples in the 18th century.
3.0 Pre-Mughal Architecture
The district has many architectural remains of the pre-Mughal period. The tomb of Sultan
Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah (built in 1410 A.D.) at Sona-Mograpara, the mosque of Binat Bibi
(built in 1457 A.D.) are examples of the Pre-Mughal Period.
4.0 Architecture of the Mughal Period
DPC                                                                    Page-2

AES Meghnaghat Ltd                 Archaeological and Cultural Sites Survey
The architectural remains of the Mughal period are many, embodying the outbursts of the
___)     creative urge of the famous Mughal builders and the manifestation of their imperial style of
architecture. Mention may be made of Idrakpur, Hajiganj and Sonakanda forts(built in 1660
A.D) of Mir Jumla, Ssubadar of Bengal.
L.    Hajiganj Fort: It is situated near to the Hajiganj locality of Narayanganj just at the point
where the old Buriganga discharged itself in to the Lakhya River. The fortification
consists of a pentagonal curtain wall with rounded bastions at the angles and a small
gateway towards the river Lakhya suggesting that means of communication was by the
river. The curtain wall has a rampart walk on the inner side and is it self pierced by
several musketry holes. The bastions are filled with earth up to the rampart level and its
merinos have wider holes in between suggesting that they were meant for gun firing at
the pirates proceeding up the river. In a corner of the fort quadrangle is a tall square
column of brickwork. The present appearance is no doubt due to a modem touch, but its
presence links this fort with other water forts of this time. Besides, these, there is no other
building within the fort.
Hi.    Sonakanda Fort: It lies on the other side of the river Lakhya just at the point where
formerly it unite together with the river Brahmaputra. The fort consists of the curtain wall
and a number of bastions and an additional projection towards the river side, where
stands a round drum of huge dimensions. The height of this drum is now much reduced
owing to the levelling of the earth. But once it must have formed a landmark at the
junction of the river.
iii.  Idrakpur Fort: It is situated on the bank of river Ichhamati (flowing through
Munshiganj) now dried up. The river silt in some places has risen right up to the level of
the parapet. This fort falls into two main parts, the wider open area surrounded by curtain
walls with bastions at the angle and the smaller area containing a huge drum. Another
series of curtain walls enclose this drum, while an approach is provided from the bigger
court. Just at the foot of the drum a small magazine is seen.
5.0 Fine Art
Bangladesh is very rich in Fine Art. In this sector Khan Joynul is one of the famous artist of
Bangladesh.
6.0 Culture
1.    Music: Music is enjoyed even now by the people of Dhaka disctrict. Among songs of
indigenous origin mention must be made of bhatiali songs of which reflect the mood of
the boatman as his frail craft moves effortlessly. Murshidi or devotional songs in simple
heart-warming familiar dialect, sometimes accompanied by one or two stringed musical
instruments, have great appeal for the deeply religious village folk.

Abbasuddin popularised folk songs throughout the disctrict by singing them in his rich,
resonant vice. He had many followers.
Besides, a number of good singers have earned distinction in various kinds of modern
songs such as Adhunik Bangla gan, Rabindra sangit, etc. Laila Arjumand Banu, Kaniz
Rasool, Firdausi Begum, Husna Banu, Mahbubua Rahman, Niru Shamsunnahar,
Anjumanara, Abdul Latif, Abdul Ahad, Bedaruddin are among the popular singers who
songs are often broadcast by Bangladesh Bater, Dhaka. in the field of fine art, and music
the famous among others in the world are Ustad Gul Mohammad, Ustad Alauddin,
iL    Jatragan and Kavigan : Jatragan and Kavigan, two old forms of folk-songs are still
enjoyed by the rural people in some places occasionally. The sight of loads jointly or of
workers singing rhythmically while beating shows the love of common people and the
day labours for music and rhythm.
iii.   Theatrical performance : Theatrical performance are organised by groups of amateur
artists and staged in various public halls. They provide entertainment to a large number of
people. A good number of cinemas are run in Dhaka city and other towns of the district.
There is always a great rush of people to the cinema shows. Even the rural people visit
towns to enjoy these shows.
iv.   Dance: In the sector of culture (Dance) Indian dance was completely dominated by the
lyric and rhythmic dance of the people of this territory. Bharat nattyam, Monipuri dance
are famous in this subcontinent.
v.    Paintings: Our knowledge about painting in the pre-eighteenth century period is poor.
Alam Masawwar was a well-known painter of the closing decades of the eighteenth
century in Dhaka. His paintings, 'Muharram' and 'I'd Processions, are preserved in the
Dhaka Museum.
vi.   Hindu Shrines : A good number of Hindu shrines also lie scattered in the city as well as
outside. Nangalband near Narayanganj is hallowed by memories of Parasu Ram, and a
great bathing festival is held at this spot in the Bengali month of Chaitra.
vii.   Birthday Festival: The birth of a child, particularly of a son, has always been an
occasion for great rejoicing in society. The friends congratulate the happy parents who
provide for all kinds of festivities in the house where presents are received and alms
given by the happy parents. A Maulvi or friends are consulted in giving the child a
suitable name. The next ceremony as sociated with such an occasion among the Muslims
of the district is Aqiqa. Aqiqa properly means the hair of the new born infant, but
commonly applies to the shaving ceremony and the confirmation of the child's name in a
formal manner. In this ceremony sheep or goats - two in the case of male child and one in
the case of a female child - are sacrificed and the meat is distributed among the friends,
relatives and the poor. Feasts are held, and people are entertained by well-to-do parents.
DPC                                                                   Page-4

viii.  Marriage:  The institution of marriages also wholly based on Islamic ways, and
whatever may be the views of an individual Muslim about his or her religion, the
marriage ceremony cannot take place except according to strictly Islamic rituals. A
Maulvi must be present on such occasions and solemnize the marriage by reciting the
relevant verses from the Holy Quran in the presence of a large assembly, and, at the end,
all present jointly pray for the happiness of the married couple. The marriage is
solemnized often by the Qazi (the marriage registrar) himself who is also a learned
Maulvi and who registers marriages and divorces.

1. Introduction
AES Meghnaghat Limited wil set up a Power Plant of 450 MW capacity at Meghnaghat near
the Meghna Bridge on Dhaka - Chittagong Highway on BOO basis. This wil 'oe a combined
1cyle power plant.
On 29th May 1999, AES Megtnaghat Limited invited quotation from Development Design
Consuitants Ltd. for Plane Table Survey of the Meghnaghat Site and Development of
Environmental Base Map.
Accordingly DDC forwarded the quotation to AES on 01.06.1999 vide Memo No.DDC-
MEGHNA.002199 dt01.06.1999. In our quotation cost estimate was on the arma covering 2
kn on all sides of proposed power plant But following subsequent telephonic discussion
between MW. Tyui Islam and our Director Mr. M. Bazlur Rahmtn, the survey area was
reduced to I km only instead of 2 km proposed earlier on all sides of the proposed power
plant and accordingly we reviewed and recast our cost estimate and submitted the amended
proposal to AES on 02.06.1999.



Finally AES Megheaghar Ltd. onfirmned their acceptance of our proposal & issued
instruction to DDC on 08.06.1999 through facsimmde to proceed with Piane Table Survey of
Meghnaitst Site and the surrounding ar  upto I km  from  the site boutdasy asd
Developmetsr of Environmental Base Map.
Accordingly DDC sent their Survey teams to the site onl2th June, 99.Fidld work was
completed on 4th July, 1999.
SiteDetails: The project site is located on the norther bank of the Meghn river near the
Me,ghba Bridge on Dhaka Chittagong Highway. The whole site compnses 267 acres of
agricultural land pare of wbich remain submerged under water most of the year. This land has
becn acquired by Bangladesh Power Developnacmt Board (BPDB). Approximately 70 acres of
developed land will be leased to AES Meghnaghat Limited for consteuction of 450 MW CC
Power Plant . The site is now being filled by dredging from the Meghna rver by China
National Water Resources And Hydro Power Engineering Corporation (CWI{BC) appomted
by BPDB. Two villages namely Islampur & Ganga Nagar surround the project site along
south east boundary & north east comer respectively.
2. SCOPEOF WORK
The main works of the survey are:
i) to carry out plane table topographic survey of the project site and the surrounding areas
encompassing appmximately I Km from the site boundary.
ii) to prepare base map on scaes 1: 50,000, 1:10,000 and 1: 2,000 showing major humar
seilemseis, agricusitural land, markets. roads, bridges etc. etc.

3. SERVICES RENDERED
A Plane Table (P. T. ) Survey was carried out in the area ( site) and its surrounding I kin on
all sides of 267 ames showing the features on the gound like homesteads, river, canals,
roads, footpath, gardens. trees, brick fields, cuttural sites, inc3nding human settlements, mads,
bridges, culverts, elctrie, gas & telephone lities and odeh featres which occupy signficant
space on the ground and are sublect of consideration from aspects of environmental unpact.
Before the PT. was nm, the site area with the sunoundingp were reconnoitred and traversed
to provide control points for the systematic running of the PT. survey. These control points
were marked on the ground by embedding woodea pegs which were found missing later due
supposedly to removal by the farners. These were put again for completing the job. No.
ldt         wonder, if these have been removed again at a later date. This removal of pegs does not hove
impact on the job any more.
The PT. survey was conducted on. I 2000 scale as desired by the client & the whole ar
was completed with 12 sheets al together. The field records so collected are used to prepare
the base map of scale 1:20,000 1:10.000 and 1 :2,000 with the aid of compute.
Base Map Drawings of scale 1:2,000 as Annexure-A (12 sheets) are enclosed in a separate
envelope Maps of scale 1:10,000 as Annexrure-B (I sheet) and 1:20,000 as Annexure-C (I
sheet) are attached with this reporn
Maps of scale 1:20,000 has been prepared instead of 1:50,000 scate as the later becomes too
small and illegible.

AES Meghnaghat Ltd                                          Landuse Survey
Landuse Map
1.0 Introduction
In order to depict the existing landuse features and landmarks of the proposed project
site, a comprehensive survey was carried out to prepare a landuse map for the project
area.
2.0 Methodology
* Preparation of the Base Map
A base map was prepared on the basis of available reference maps like a) Site mouza
(Char Ramzan Sonaullah) maps (by reducing into the desired scale), b) Topographic map
of scale 1: 50,000 (by enlarging) prepared by Survey of Bangladesh, and the Local
Government Engineering Department (LGED) prepared Thana map having the same
scale as that of Topographic map. The base map was prepared in a suitable Scale of 1:
25,000 by converting all maps into the same scale. The base map was prepared by
applying the method of superimposition of map sheets maintaining the grid line to keep
the scale as it is.
- Procedures of Field Work
With a view to completing the survey work in the field smoothly and accurately, a team
consisting of four members was mobilized with assistance of a local assistant. The name
and discipline of the team members are shown in the following table.
SI. No. Name                       Discipline         Position

02      Mr Biswajit                Surveyor           Team Member
03      Mr Abul Hashem             Surveyor           Team Member
04      Md Farukul Islam           Surveyor           Team Member
05      Md A Rahim                 Local Assistant    Team Assistant
* Orientation Course
Before mobilizing the team in the field a orientation course was organized for the team
and a pre-testing was performed so that the team could do the assignment correctly.
Afterwards, the team was mobilized to the field with necessary tools for the land use
survey.
* Collection and Plotting of Data
The full team was devoted their efforts in the field to identify the important features,
landmarks and other objects and then plotted them on the base map supplied. Applying
reconnaissance survey methods the field survey was performed. The team tried their
utmost to identify the features and other landmarks to plot them on the map. The
DPC                                                                   page-i

administrative boundary, growth centers, markets, shops, physical and natural features,
agricultural and settlement pattern etc. have been delineated from the LGED prepared
Thana map.
* Delineation of Final Draft Map
After plotting all the desired features on the base map, the final draft landuse map was
drawn superimposing the base map with the help of modem cartographic instrument and
mapping tools. Traverse and chain survey methods were applied for plotting the features
on the base map.
* Types of Data Collected
According to the guidelines of the Department of Environment (DOE) the desired data
like the location of industries, shops, growth centers, markets agricultural lands, water
bodies, important installations like Meghna Bridge, educational institutions, mosques,
and archeological sites etc. have been surveyed.
o Major Classification of Data
The important data was classified into some broad categories like settlement pattern,
industry, agricultural lands, water bodies, commercial installations, physical and natural
features etc.

Re:          Meghnaghat Power Plant - Revised Ambient Noise Results
Geoff:
The following memorandum addresses the revised ambient sound level measurements conducted by ESG
International for the Meghnaghat Power Plant project in Bangladesh. This memorandum serves as an
addendum to the RWDI report entitled "Environmental Noise Impact Study for the Meghnaghat Power Plant"
and dated February 22, 2000 (Noise Impact Study). Additional details on the measurement procedure and
locations may be found in this report.
EXISTING AMBIENT NOISE CONDITIONS
t      A minimum of twenty-two hours of continuous ambient noise monitoring was conducted at each of three
measurement locations over a period of five days, beginning on April 2, 2000 and ending on April 7, 2000.
The measurement sites were located at the same two critical receptors in the villages of Islanpur (Location I a)
and Ganganagar (Location 2) as previously outlined in the original Noise Impact Study, with the addition of
one site in the village of Islampur (Location lb). The original Islampur noise measurement site (Location la)
was located on the south side of the village, adjacent to the river and its associated traffic. The new site
(Location 1 b) was located on the north side of Islampur, placing the village between the measurement site and
the Meghna River. This site was added to ensure that the lowest ambient sound levels were used in this
assessment. The measurement procedures, compatible with World Bank guidelines, and monitoring results
are presented below. See Figures 1 and 2 for the approximate locations of Noise Monitoring Sites NMla,
NMIb and NM2.
Procedures & Instrumentation
All measurements were taken using a Larson-Davis Model 820 Precision Integrating Sound Level Meter
(SLM). The Model 820 uses a Larson-Davis Model 828 preamplifier and a Larson-Davis Model 2560
precision air-condenser microphone, that have been factory calibrated with the SLM unit. Calibration was
checked before and after measurements with a Larson-Davis Model CAL200 precision acousdc calibrator.

Meteorological Conditions
The weather conditions during the monitoring periods were favourable for the collection of ambient noise
levels. No precipitation was observed during the monitoring periods and temperatures varied around the
historical daily average for April (i.e., 26 to 31 °C). Sunny to partly cloudy skies were experienced during
the measurement period with light to no winds.
Monitoring Sites
As noted above, noise monitoring was conducted at three sites. The locations used have been identified as
the most noise-sensitive receptors, representing mixed and residential land-uses in the vicinity of the proposed
power plant. Also factored into the site selections were proximity to the proposed power plant and security
considerations during measurement. The selected sites are briefly described below:
a) Location 1 a - Islampur Village, River Side: This site was selected within the Islampur village which lies
immediately to the south of the proposed power plant. This area is predominantly residential. The site
was positioned at the south edge of the village, near residences along the Meghna River, approximately
100 m from the site boundary.
b) Location lb - Islampur Village, Power Plant Side: This site was selected near residences within the
Islampur village that lie on the north edge of the village, closest to the proposed power plant. This
location is expected to experience lower ambient sound levels since it is about 50 m further removed
from the river traffic, but potentially more severe noise impacts since it is closer to the power plant.
c) Location 2 - Ganganagar Village: This site was selected near residences within the Ganganagar village
which lies approximately 500 m to the northeast of the proposed power plant. The area is predominantly

Measurement results are summarized in Tables Cla, Clb and C2 and plotted in Figures Cla, Clb and C2 at
the back of this report. Both sites were influenced by spurious high-level noise events such as vehicle horns,
animals, human voices, and the Islamic calls to prayer (Azan). These events will increase the L,, values in
certain 30 minute periods, however, no particular event was determined as being more dominant than another.
Location la - Islampur Village, River Side
Continuous sound exposure level monitoring was conducted between 0800h on April 4, 2000 and 0630h on
April 5, 2000. The noise descriptors (Lq, Lgo L50, L10, etc.) at Location la vary throughout the day, but do
follow a typical diurnal pattern with a nighttime "dip" characteristic of urban environments. The daytime
levels are dominated by nearby industrial/commercial sources that operate during the day, road and river
traffic, and other activities within the village. The minimum measured nighttime (2200h to 0700h) Lq (Ihr)
was 42 dBA, and the minimum daytime (0700h to 2200h) Leq (lhr) was 49 dBA.

Continuous sound exposure level monitoring was conducted between 0730h on April 5, 2000 and 0630h on
April 7, 2000. The noise descriptors (L,q, L9, L50, LI., etc.) at Location lb vary throughout the day, but also
follow a typical diurnal pattern with a nighttime "dip" characteristic of urban environments. The daytime

was 42 dBA, and the minimum daytime (0700h to 2200h) Leq (lhr) was 47 dBA.
Location 2 - Ganganagar Village
Continuous sound exposure level monitoring was conducted between 0900h on April 2, 2000 and 0630h on
April 4, 2000. The noise descriptors (Lq, L90, L50, Llo, etc.) at Location 2 vary throughout the day, but also
follow the typical diurnal pattern characteristic of urban environments. The daytime levels are dominated by
nearby industrial/commercial sources that operate during the day, road and river traffic, and other activities
within the village. The minimum measured nighttime L,q (lhr) was 44 dBA, and the minimum daytime Lq
(lhr) was 50 dBA.
Discussion
Table 1 summarizes the measured ambient sound exposures at the monitoring locations. The measurement
results of this assessment are generally lower than those reported previously in the original Noise Impact
Study and hence will provide a more representative scenario for predicting worst-case noise impacts.

Assuming continuous power plant operation (i.e., 24 hours/day), the applicable power plant sound level limits
at points of reception based on the World Bank and Bangladesh guidelines are found in Table 2. Note that
the same sound level limits are applicable at both measurement sites within the village of Islampur.

The soundlevel limitsfor other nearby receprors have been assumed based on the threshold limits oulinedin the applicable guidetines. These limiu may
be conservative relative to actual ambient conditions.
During both daytime and nighttime periods, measured ambient sound exposure levels were found to be below
those of the World Bank guideline threshold limits. As such, the guideline threshold limits have been used
for daytime periods when assessed under World Bank guidelines. The World Bank threshold limits have also
been used at other receptors where ambient noise measurements were not performed. Therefore, these
threshold limits may be conservative relative to actual ambient sound levels.
Bangladesh guidelines are interpreted as limiting the absolute noise levels generated by the proposed power
plant, and do not account for ambient levels. Therefore, the limits were not adjusted for ambient sound levels.
NOISE MODELLING
Details of the noise modelling methodology and modelled sources can be found in the original Noise Impact
Study.
Results
Figures 3 and 4 of the original Noise Impact Study show noise contour plots for the two modelled
meteorological scenarios (i.e, normal daytime lapse rate and nighttime inversion). The predicted noise levels
from the power plant at nearby villages for these two cases are summarised in Table 3, with the Guideline
Limits adjusted where appropriate to account for the April, 2000 monitoring data.

Notes:
Daytime hours are from 0700 to 2200h. Nighttime hours are from 2200h to 0700h.
*   Limits presented arefrom the most stringent guidelinesfor locations where ambient noise conditions were not established.
The results presented in Table 3 indicate that the proposed power plant is still predicted to produce noise
levels in excess of the nighttime World Bank guidelines at the same receptors as the original Noise Impact
Study. The new lower measured ambient sound levels only affect the magnitude of the impact and not the
locations at which they occur.
CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF THREE PLANTS
As a result, the mitigation and conclusions outlined in the original Noise Impact Study (Sections 7 and 8
respectively) remain unchanged due to the new measured ambient sound levels.
The site development allows for the potential inclusion of two additional power plants at the site. To gain
an understanding of the potential cumulative effects of the three stations, the noise contours predicted using
the ENM Model were re-analyzed. The results of this procedure are presented in Figures 5 and 6 (previously
submitted to ESG) attached at the end of this text.
The location of the original modelled plant did not change in this re-analysis. The other additional plants were
assumed to be placed in the middle of each lot - all three being (approximately) equi-distant from each other.
Input parameters (e.g., stack design, sound levels, etc.) for each power plant were considered to be the same
as the original plant.
Note that, since this was intended to be a cursory analysis only, the model was not in fact rerun for the three
sites. Instead, the contours generated for the single site were superimposed at the three potential sites and
added together. This introduced some degree of approximation: for example some of the inflections in the
curves due to grade changes would tend to reappear for the other two plants in inappropriate places. The
curves can be considered somewhat more accurate further out from the sources.

The results indicate that although there are significant increases in predicted ambient noise levels at locations
on and adjacent to the site itself, the relative impacts are predicted to become less significant at greater
distances from the site. As a worst-case, noise impacts should be considered to increase by 5 dBA at nearby
receptors with the addition of the two other plants.
We trust that this is the information that you require at this time. If you have any questions or comments,

1. INTRODUCTION
Rowan Williams Davies and Irwin was retained by ESG International Inc. (ESG) to review
the potential environmental noise impact from the proposed 450 MW combined cycle electrical
power generating station near Meghnaghat, Bangladesh. The assessment is based on relevant World
Bank, Asian Development Bank and Bangladesh Ministry of Environment and Forestry guidelines.
The environmental noise assessment consists of two major components:
a)   a noise monitoring program to determine existing ambient sound exposure levels at
critical off-site receptors within about 500 m of the power plant; and
b)   noise prediction modelling of power plant generated noise.
The analysis indicates that the predicted noise levels generated by the power plant as
proposed will not comply with the limits recommended in the World Bank and Bangladesh Ministry
of the Enviromnent and Forestry guidelines at some nearby village residences. Noise control
concepts are presented for the most significant sources to mitigate noise impacts at offsite receptors.
2. PROJECT BACKGROUND
2.1   Project Site and Surrounding Area
The proposed location of the power plant is on the east end of an island in the Meghna River,
just off the Dhaka-Comnilla highway in the District of Narayanganj, approximately 22 km southeast
of Dhaka (see Figure 1). The site is approximately 250 acres, considered large enough to
accommodate 2000 MW of generating capacity. The site is to be developed in three phases with
each phase adding about 300 - 450 MW to the overall plant capacity. The current assessment
contained herein, only addresses noise concerns for Phase 1 of the project.
Noise Study - February 22, 2000                                                 D1A 
Meghnaghat Power Plant - Meghnaghat, Bangladesh - Project #00- 124-9     Page I R1            l



The project site is approximately rectangular and is bounded on the north, west, and south
edges by the Meghna River (see Figures I and 2). The land to the east of the site is of mixed
land-use consisting of several villages, industrial, and commercial businesses. During the rainy
season. portions of the surrounding land become submerged. Several other villages lie on the north
and south shores of the Meghna River and on neighbouring islands to the west.
2.2   Proposed Facility
Please refer to Figure 2 and Appendix A which contains details of the proposed power plant
design provided to RWDI by ESG to assist with the noise prediction modelling.
The proposed facility is to be configured as a combined cycle plant in a 2+2+1 arrangement;
consisting of two gas turbines (GT's), two heat recovery steam generators (HRSG's), and one steam
turbine (ST). The gas turbines and steam turbine will each drive an electrical generator to produce
a combined rated output of 450 MW that will be transferred to the 230 kV power grid via high
voltage transformers. The hot exhaust from the gas turbines will pass through the HRSG's, heating  i
the steam necessary to drive the steam turbine. Start-up power for the facility and the turbines will
be drawn from the main power grid via start-up and auxiliary transformers. Under normal operation
all of these devices will be operating simultaneously.
The gas turbines and their associated generators will be housed in a building constructed of
single skin steel panels. The steam turbine and associated generator will be housed in an adjacent
building and will also be of single skin steel panel construction.
The generator transformers (three), start-up transformer, and auxiliary transformer will be
located to the north of the turbine buildings. The HRSG's will be located to the south of the turbine
buildings.

Combustion air for the gas turbines will be drawn in through a large intake monitor located
on the roof of the gas turbine building that has louvres on the north, west, and east sides of the
monitor. General room air will be exhausted through six fans on the roof of the gas turbine building
and four fans on the roof of the steam turbine building. The gas turbine exhaust will be ducted
through the south wall of the building, through the HRSG's, and will then exhaust to the atmosphere
through two 60 m tall stacks. The stacks will be outfitted with acoustic silencers.
Two feedwater pumps will circulate the steam from each HRSG to the steam turbine. These
pumps will be located adjacent to each HRSG. Cooling water for the plant equipment will be drawn
from the Meghna River at the south property boundary and circulated by three cooling water puumps
located to the south of the turbine buildings and HRSG's. Three well water pumps will be located
to the west of the main buildings.
Three gas compressors will be located at the compressor shelter approximately 200 m to the
north of the turbine buildings. These compressors will compress the natural gas supply to the
appropriate level for use by the turbines. The roof of the compressor shelter will be made of single
skin steel panels. There will be no walls on the shelter.
2.3   Receptors of Concern
Please refer to Figure I which indicates the land-uses in the vicinity of the proposed power
plant.
Worst-case noise impacts are generally experienced at the receptors of concern closest to the
noise source. For this assessment, the receptors of concern are the residences located in:
a)   the village of Islampur - situated immediately to the south of the proposed site
boundary; and,
b)   the village of Ganga Nagar - approximately 500 m to the northeast of the proposed
site.
Noise Study - February 22, 2000                                                  D^A   Jl
Meghnaghat Power Plant - Meghnaghat, Bangladesh - Project #00-124-9       Page 3 RNVD I



These villages are predominantly residential in nature and are generally bounded by
farmlands which flood during certain times of the year. The villages are also located in close
proximity to several industrial developments, including a cement plant and several paper mills.
The non-residential land-uses in the area (i.e., industrial and commercial developments) are
insensitive to noise relative to the village residences and therefore these areas are not considered
further in this assessment.
2.4   Review of Previous Environmental Impact Assessment
An assessment of the existing noise environment was conducted previously as part of a
preliminary environmental impact assessment for the project, and is discussed in a report prepared
by Mott Ewbank Preece (MEP) in May 1997 [1].
In the MEP study, noise measurements were conducted at six locations in the vicinity of the
site to quantify the existing ambient sound levels. Two of these locations included measurements
in the village of Islampur, located immediately to the southeast of the site. A series of intermittent
spot measurements was conducted at each of the six locations at a variety of times throughout the
week and weekend. No reference of the duration or averaging period for the noise measurements
was made in the MEP report. RWDI has assumed that the MEP measurements are representative
of one-hour averaging periods and are consistent with the applicable noise guidelines (i.e., World
Bank and Bangladesh Ministry of the Environment and Forestry). MEP noted that noise from
dredging and piling activity on the nearby Meghna River may have unrealistically elevated some of
the measured sound levels.
MEP conducted noise modelling to compare the contributions of phase one and two of the
proposed power plant to their measured ambient sound levels at nearby receptors and applicable
World Bank and Bangladesh guidelines. Noise impacts were not assessed against Asian
Development Bank (ADB) guidelines. The analysis contained in the 1997 MEP report only

considered noise from the major power plant sources (i.e., two gas turbines, the steam turbine, the
transformers and the exhaust stacks) and did not account for screening affects due to intervening
power plant buildings or topography. Source sound levels were based on assumed upper limits for
the modelled sources.
The 1997 MEP report did not predict any excesses over the Bangladesh or World Bank
guidelines. However, it was indicated that further study was warranted due to the uncertainty in the
ambient noise measurements and the source sound levels.
3. NOISE DESCRIPTORS AND TERMINOLOGY
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with many of the commonly used noise descriptors.
Therefore, only a brief description of the more important descriptors used in this report are discussed
below. For additional details, please refer to the glossary of noise descriptors and terminology
provided in Appendix B.
The L99 and Lgo measures indicate sound levels that are exceeded 99% and 90% of the time,
respectively. As such, these metrics indicate the effective background noise levels and can be
interpreted as the residual sound levels that are always present (i.e., quietest sound levels). In this
particular environment, these sound levels are predominantly due to human activity in area villages,
road and river traffic, and the sounds of nature (leaves rustling, animal sounds, etc.).
The L50 is the median sound level, exceeded 50% ofthe time, that includes some effects from
occasional events due to traffic, industrial sources, aircraft, or natural sounds. The L1O is the noise
level exceeded 10% of the time and is typical of high level, short duration sounds such as direct
aircraft flyovers, loud infrequent truck traffic, calls to prayer (e.g., Azan), or occasional industrial
sounds.

The L. is one of the most robust predictors of human response or annoyance to noise and
is based on the energy-averaged sound exposure. The Leq is the steady sound exposure over a given
time period that is equivalent in energy to the varying sound level of the measured environment.
Typically, the averaging period used is 1 hour, although other periods such as 1/2 hour, 24 hour,
16 hour daytime, or 8 hour nighttime are also used. Current World Bank and many other
environmental noise guidelines are based on 1 hour L,q measurements [expressed as Leq (1)1.
4. GUIDELINES
4.1    World Bank Guidelines
The 1998 World Bank Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook [2] under "Thermal
Power - Guidelines for NPW Plants" indicates that:
"Noise abatement measures should achieve either the following levels or a maximum
increase in background levels of3 dB(A). Measurements are to be taken at noise receptors
located outside the project property boundary."
Table 1: Maximum Allowable Lq (hourly) in dB(A)
Receptor Type            Daytime (0700h - 2200h)      Nighttime (2200h - 0700h)

We interpret the guidelines as suggesting that for either time period (i.e., daytime or
nighttime) noise from a proposed noise source should not exceed:
1)   the measured ambient Leq (1) in any hour of that time period';
or,
2)   the stated maximum noise level in Table 1 for that time period.
4.2    Asian Development Bank Guidelines
The 1993 "Environmental Guidelines for Selected Industrial and Power Development
Projects" published by the Asian Development Bank, Office of the Environment [3] suggests that:
"In the range of 55 dB to 75 dB, impacts are of the "annoyance" type resulting in
interference with speech communication, general well-being and sleep. Response to such
problems varies with the receptor,for example, schools, off ces and similar receptors where
ease of speech is ofprimary concern, will not have the same response to an increase from
55 dB to 60 dB as a busy commercial district. Above 75 dB, the possibility of severe health
effects occurs such as loss of hearing."
Table 2 sunmmarizes the protective noise levels that are presented in these guidelines. The
noise levels are based on guidelines used in the United States for preparation of noise criteria and
are assumed to be listed in A-weighted decibels (dBA).
Note that if the power plant sound exposure levels equal that of the existing ambient, the overall sound exposure
level or combined effect of the ambient and plant will produce a 3 dBA increase over the existing ambient levels.

Units for the sound limits indicated above are not clearly defined in the legislation.
Therefore, based on general practice in other jurisdictions, we interpret the guidelines as follows:
a)    the limits presented are one-hour energy equivalent sound exposure limits [Leq(l)];
b)    "daytime" is 0600 to 2100 hours, "nighttime" is 2100 to 0600 hours; and
c)    the sound exposure at a receptor resulting solely from the facility, irrespective of ambient
sound levels, should not exceed the presented limits.
4.4    Change Assessment
Based on general practice, and well documented studies on human response to noise (e.g.,
U.S. EPA, 1974 [5]), increases (or decreases) in sound exposure can be ranked as follows:
a)    3 dBA or less    -  considered insignificant due to imperceptibility;
b)    4 to 5 dBA       -  considered a just-noticeable difference;
c)    6 to 9 dBA       -  considered marginally significant; and
d)    10 dBA or more  -  significant, perceived as a doubling (or halving) of sound exposure.
4.5    Guideline Interpretation
The 1998 World Bank Guidelines, Asian Development Bank guidelines, and Bangladesh
guidelines present desirable objectives based on generally accepted studies on human response to
noise. However, in certain urban enviromnents, higher noise levels are tolerated to a greater extent
due to acclimatization to existing sources. In these environments the change in sound levels, and
the corresponding perception of those changes, is a more relevant measure of expected community
response (U.S. EPA, 1974 [5]).
Noise Study - February 22, 2000                                                    U|\       F

Residential and institutional areas are of primary importance in assessing noise impacts (i.e.,
they are considered "sensitive"). Commercial and industrial areas can tolerate much higher sound
environments, which is illustrated by the much higher guideline limits for these areas in both the
World Bank and Bangladesh guidelines.
The Asian Development Bank guidelines are focussed on annoyance and health issues related
to overall noise levels sustained at a certain type of receptor. They do not address specific limits on
the relative or absolute contribution of a particular source (e.g., a power plant) at a receptor.
Conversely, Bangladesh guidelines are interpreted as limiting the sound levels produced by a facility
at a receptor and do not account for ambient sound levels.
For the purposes of this study, the relative impact from the proposed power plant with respect
to the ambient sound levels is of greatest concern. Hence, a change assessment approach is most
useful in assessing the noise impact of a proposed facility on nearby receptors. The 1998 World
Bank guidelines are based on a change assessment approach and address reasonable lower limits for
the overall sound levels at a receptor. These guidelines permit no more than a 3 dBA (Leq) increase
in the existing ambient level due to noise emanating from a new facility. That is to say, sound
exposures from a new facility should be less than or equal to that of the existing ambient sound
environment at the receptor, subject to the minimum thresholds presented in Table 1.
With this in mind, our assessment of noise impacts from the proposed power plant is
primarily based on an assessment of community response to changes in the existing ambient as
outlined by the 1998 World Bank guidelines. Comparisons are also made to Bangladesh guidelines
to assess the absolute contribution of the new facility to the noise environment.

5. EXISTING AMBIENT NOISE CONDITIONS
Twenty-four hours of continuous ambient noise monitoring was conducted at each of two
measurement locations over a period of three days, beginning on September 4, 1999 and ending on
September 6, 1999. The measurement sites were located at the most critical receptors in the area (the
villages of Islampur and Ganga Nagar) and are shown in Figure 1. The measurement procedures,
compatible with World Bank guidelines, and monitoring results are presented below.
5.1   Procedures & Instrumentation
All measurements were taken using a Larson-Davis Model 820 Precision Integrating Sound
Level Meter (SLM). The Model 820 uses a Larson-Davis Model 828 preamplifier and a Larson-
Davis Model 2560 precision air-condenser microphone, that have been factory calibrated with the
SLM unit. Calibration was checked before and after measurements with a Larson-Davis Model
CAL200 precision acoustic calibrator.
5.2   Meteorological Conditions
The weather conditions during the monitoring periods were favourable for the collection of
ambient noise levels. No precipitation was observed during the monitoring periods and temperatures
varied around the-historical daily average for September (i.e., 26 to 3l l C). Sunny to partly cloudy
skies were experienced during the measurement period with light to no winds.
5.3    Monitoring Sites
As noted above, noise monitoring was conducted at two sites. The locations used have been
identified as the most noise-sensitive receptors, representing mixed and residential land-uses in the
vicinity of the proposed power plant. Also factored into the site selections were proximity to the
proposed power plant and security considerations during measurement. The selected sites are briefly
described below:

a)    Location I - Islampur Village: This site was selected near residences within the Islampur
village which lies immediately to the south of the proposed power plant on the north bank
of the Meghna River. The area is predominantly residential.
b)    Location 2 - Ganga Nagar Village: This site was selected near residences within the Ganga
Nagar village which lies approximately 500 m to the northeast of the proposed power plant.
The area is predominantly residential.
5.4   Noise Measurement Results
Measurement results are summarized in Tables C I and C2 and plotted in Figures C I and C2
(see Appendix C). Both sites were influenced by spurious high-level noise events such as vehicle
horns, animals, human voices, and the Islamic calls to prayer (Azan). These events will serve to
increase the Lq values in certain 30 minute periods, however, no particular event was determined
as being more dominant than another.
5.4.1 Location 1 - Islampur Village
Continuous sound exposure level monitoring was conducted between 0900h on September 4,
1999 and 0830h on September 5, 1999. The noise descriptors (L,q, L90, L, L1o, etc.) at Location I
vary throughout the day, but do follow a typical diurnal pattern with a nighttime "dip" characteristic
of urban environments. The daytime levels are dominated by nearby industriallcommercial sources
that operate during the day, road and river traffic, and other activities within the village. The
minimum measured nighttime (2200h to 0700h) Lcq (lhr) was 49 dBA, and the minimum daytime
(0700h to 2200h) Leq (Ihr) was 51 dBA.

5.4.2 Location 2 - Ganga Nagar Village
Continuous sound exposure level monitoring was conducted between 103 Oh on September 5,
1999 and lOOOh on September 6, 1999. The noise descriptors (L., Lqo, L50, L,,, etc.) at Location 2
vary throughout the day, but do follow the typical diumal pattern characteristic of urban
environments. The daytime levels are dominated by nearby industrial/commercial sources that
operate during the day, road and river traffic, and other activities within the village. The minimum
measured nighttime L.q (Ihr) was 45 dBA, and the minimum daytime Leq (lhr) was 49 dBA.
5.5   Discussion

sound level limits at points of reception based on the World Bank and Bangladesh guidelines are

The sound level limitsfor other nearby receptors have been assumed based on the threshold limits outlined in the applicable guidelines. These
limits isill be conservative relative to actual ambient conditions.
During daytime periods, measured ambient sound exposure levels were found to be below
those of the World Bank guideline threshold limits. As such, the guideline threshold limits have
been used for daytime periods when assessed under World Bank guidelines. During nighttime
periods, ambient sound levels at Locations I and 2 are greater than the prescribed World Bank
threshold limits and therefore these levels are used as the limit for noise generated by the proposed
power plant. The World Bank threshold limits have also been used at other receptors where ambient
noise measurements were not performed. These threshold limits will be conservative relative to
actual ambient sound levels.
Bangladesh guidelines are interpreted as limiting the noise generated by the proposed power
plant. As a result, these limits are not adjusted for ambient sound levels.
6. NOISE MODELLING
6.1    Methodology
In this study, power plant noise propagation has been modelled using the Environmental
Noise Model (ENM) which accounts for:
Noise Study - February 22, 2000
RV VD            I    Page 14                           Meghnaghat Power Plant- MeghnaghaL Bangladesh - Project #00-124-9



1)    Distance attenuation;
2)    Source directivity;
3)    Acoustical screening provided by topography, intervening buildings and noise barriers where
present;
4)    Atmospheric attenuation;
5)    Ground attenuation; and
6)    Meteorological effects on noise propagation.
Specific details of the ENM software can be found in a paper by R. Tonin [61 and the
software manual [7].
Conservative assumptions for power plant operations have been applied in the noise
prediction modelling. It is assumed that all modelled sources may operate continuously.
The effects of topography were included in the modelling based on contour plots and
information provided by ESG. The land areas around the proposed site were modelled as flat
grassland. This approach is conservative since potential screening effects from local terrain are not
included. Since the proposed site is situated on an island in the Meghna River that floods regularly,
it will be raised approximately 10 m above the local grade. This elevation change was included in
the modelling.
The location and configuration of the power plant are based on environmental base mapping
determnined by Development Design Consultant Limited and preliminary plant design schematics by
Hyundai Corporation (see Figures 1 and 2 for details). The modelling conducted herein accounts
for screening effects provided by the power plant building itself, as well as noise reduction provided
by the various elements of the building.
Noise Study - February 22, 2000                                                 fl  A   /     I

Ground attenuation has been applied based on grass and shrub foliage for the surrounding
land masses. At certain times of the year, portions of these land masses may be flooded by the
Meghna River. ESG has indicated the approximate limits of this flooding and the resulting areas are
small enough that they are not expected to alter the noise modelling results.
Meteorological factors, such as wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, and vertical
temperature gradient, all affect noise propagation. Typical meteorological conditions used in the
modelling, and based on data from the May 1997 MEP environmental impact report [1], are
summarised in Table 6. Worst-case noise impacts are expected to occur under conditions of calm
winds (occurring 50% of the time) and strong temperature inversions (occurring 40% of the time).

Note: The above conditions are assumed based on data provided in the May 1997 MEP report [1].
6.2    Modelled Sources
Source sound level data for much of the power plant equipment was unavailable to perform
the noise modelling. Hence, where necessary source sound power levels have been assumed based
on performance requirements specified in the Master Specification documents [8] and worst-case
sound levels given in the literature. Typically, these assumed source levels were scaled from
representative measured source data contained in reference materials [9,10, 1 I ]. Details ofthe sound
levels used for each piece of equipment and the source of reference are included in Appendix D.

The modelled noise sources of concern associated with the proposed power plant are:
I)   Gas turbine building, including:
a)     Gas turbines; and
b)     Gas turbine generators;
2)   Steam turbine building, including:
a)     Steam turbine; and
b)     Steam turbine generator;
3)   Gas turbine air intake monitors;
4)   Heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs);
5)   HRSG feed pumps;
6)   Main exhaust stacks;
7)   Transformers;
8)   Cooling water pumps; and
9)   Gas compressors.
These sources have been modelled as point or planar sources as applicable. In some cases
the radiation pattern of a source has been approximated to simplify the analysis. For example, the
gas turbine air intake monitors are modelled as hemispherical point sources rather than modelling
each louvre individually. Similarly, noise from the HRSGs is assumed to radiate from the large sides
of each unit only, and sound radiated from the narrow tops and ends of the units is neglected since

it will be relatively insignificant compared to the radiated sound from  the sides.  These
simplifications will not affect the noise modelling results at the distances considered for compliance
with the guideline requirements.
Other potential noise sources, such as noise radiated from the exhaust piping, were not
considered due to lack of information on their construction. However, the contribution of these
sources to overall sound levels are expected to be negligible in comparison to other sources such as
the HRSGs and the gas turbine air intake monitors.
6.3    Results
Figures 3 and 4 show noise contour plots for the two modelled meteorological scenarios (i.e,
normal daytime lapse rate and nighttime inversion). The predicted noise levels from thepowerplant
at nearby villages for these two cases are summarised in Table 7. Detailed results of the source noise
contributions at each receptor are included in Appendix E.

7. NOISE IMPACT ASSESSMENT
7.1   Proposed Plant
As shown in Table 7, the noise produced by the modelled power plant configuration
during a temperature inversion scenario (i.e., typical nighttime conditions) does not meet the
World Bank guidelines for mixed residential land-uses at the closest receptors (i.e., Islampur and
Ganga Nagar). Consequently, noise control measures should be considered to mitigate the
predicted noise impacts at these receptors.
The sound levels for several of the modelled sources may be lower than the conservative
levels assumed in this analysis. As a result, using actual sound level data for some of these sources
may sufficiently reduce any predicted noise impacts at nearby receptors to negate the need for
mitigation.
7.2    Mitigation Options
Based on the source noise contributions presented in Appendix E for the temperature
inversion scenario, the gas turbine air intake monitors, the transformers, the HRSGs and their
associated feedwater pumps are the most significant sources of concern at the impacted villages.
Mitigation of these sources should eliminate any noise impacts at nearby receptors.
Noise from the gas turbine air intake monitors may be' controlled by the installation of
acoustic silencers. These silencers may take the form of acoustical louvres or duct silencers,
depending on the acoustical and operating requirements.

Typically, transformers are located in acoustical enclosures to reduce the noise radiated from
their surface. Consideration may be given to increasing the acoustical effectiveness of these
enclosures such that they perform better than the specification limit outlined in the tender documents.
Alternatively, a property line noise barrier located between the transformers and the receptors of
concern may be installed to reduce noise impacts. A detailed noise mitigation analysis would be
required to determine the height of this barrier.
The HRSG feedwater pumps may be mitigated by installing them within an acoustic
enclosure. Sufficient acoustical shielding may also be obtained by surrounding the pumps with an
adequate barrier or by relocating them such that the HRSGs act as a barrier that breaks the line of
sight between the pumps and the receptor locations.
Mitigation of the HRSGs is more difficult due to their size. The sound power radiated from
the HRSGs may be decreased by installing acoustical insulation on the outer surface of the HRSG,
or by increasing the mass of the HRSG walls. Alternatively, an acoustical barrier may be installed
along the property line of the site between the HRSGs and the receptors of concem. This barrier
would have to be of sufficient height and mass to effectively block the radiated sound, prevent sound
transmission through the barrier, and eliminate the noise impacts. Detailed noise mitigation analysis
would be required to determine the barrier height. It may also be possible to install a turbine exhaust
silencer or extend the turbine building to partially enclose the HRSG, particularly those areas near
the turbine which radiate the most noise.
Some additional sound attenuation may be obtained by locating support buildings (i.e.,
administration, warehouse, workshop, etc.) between the sources of concern and nearby receptors
(i.e., Islampur). In order for the buildings to act as an effective barrier, they would have to be
staggered and overlap somewhat such that the line of sight between the sources and receptors is
broken. Further noise modelling would be required to assess any mitigation offered by this
altemative.

8. CONCLUSIONS
(
RWDI has predicted the noise impact of the proposed power plant in Meghnaghat,
Bangladesh, based on information obtained from ESG, Development Design Consultant Limited,
and Hyundai Corporation, and employing accepted noise modelling techniques as incorporated in
the ENM software. Sound levels were predicted at discrete receptors of concern and as noise
contours over the area around the proposed power plant.
Comparison of these results to the measured ambient sound levels and World Bank and
Bangladesh guidelines, indicates that the proposed configuration will exceed the applicable
guidelines for mixed, residential land use during inversion conditions commonly experienced at
night. Conceptual noise control measures have been proposed that may reduce the predicted noise
levels of the power plant to meet the guidelines at all receptors of concem.

Re:          Meghnaghat - Dispersion Modelling Results
Message:
Geoff,
We have completed the dispersion modelling for all three phases of the proposed Meghnaghat Power
Plant. This memorandum is an addendum to RWDI's report dated October 29, 1999.
The modelling was conducted using the U.S. EPA's AERMOD program. Five years (1994-1998) of
surface meteorological data from the Dhaka Airport and five years (1994-1998) of upper air soundings
e        from Calcutta were applied in the modelling. The air pollutants modelled were nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
and particulate matter (PM). The modelling parameters applied in this assessment are consistent with
those presented in RWDI's October 29, 1999 report.
TIhe applicable World Bank ambient air quality guidelines are summarized in Table 1, along with
standards from other jurisdictions, for reference.

The following operating scenarios were modelled:
Scenario 1:   all three power plants operating at 100% load (ie., six turbines each operating at 100%
load); and
Scenario 2:   all three power plants operating one turbine at 100% load and one turbine at 50% load.
The stack parameters used in the modelling are summarized in Table 2.

AERMOD was programmed to provide predicted concentrations at a uniform grid of receptor points. A
polar grid was used, 20 km in radius and centered on the proposed plant site. Within 4.0 km of the site,
grid points were spaced 20 degrees apart in compass direction and 200 m apart in radial distance. Beyond
4.0 kmn, the points were spaced 10 degrees apart in compass direction and 800 m apart in radial distance.
Concentrations were predicted at a total of 1080 grid points. The terrain was assumed to be flat.
The maximum predicted ground level concentrations for both of the load scenarios are summnarized in
Tables 3 and 4. Background NO2 concentrations were based on a monitoring program conducted by Mott
Ewbank Preece in 1997. The monitoring results are discussed in the October 29, 1999 report. Monitoring
data from July to September 1999 were reviewed. NO2 concentrations were measured over two week
periods at a total of 5 locations. The results fall within a similar range to those from 1997.

Contour plots were prepared to illustrate the spatial distribution of predicted concentrations. These plots
are provided in Figures 1 through 8. As illustrated in the figures, the concentrations are well below the
applicable ambient air quality guidelines for both operating scenarios. The star shape of the concentration
contours in Figures I to 8 are a direct result of the poor resolution in the recorded wind directions as
discussed in RWDI's report dated October 29, 1999.

In conclusion, the results of the study indicated that the maximum 24-hour and annual concentrations of
NO2, taking into account worst-case emissions and typical background levels, are predicted to be within
the Bangladesh and World Bank levels, when all three phases of the Power Plant are operational. In the
case of PM, background levels are not known. However, the predicted source contribution from all three
phases is small in relation to World Bank guidelines and is therefore, not a concern.
Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions.

1. INTRODUCTION
ESG Intemational Inc. (ESG) retained Rowan Williams Davies & Irwin Inc. (RWDI) to conduct
numerical dispersion modelling for Phase I of the proposed Meghnaghat Power Plant to be located at
Meghnaghat, Bangladesh. This report describes the methods and presents the results of the study.
2. BACKGROUND
Dispersion modelling was conducted previously as part of a preliminary environmental impact
assessment for the project, and is discussed in a report prepared by Mott Ewbank Preece in 1997. In
that study, the following three emission scenarios were modelled: (I) emissions for each turbine unit
discharged through separate bypass stacks; (2) emissions discharged through separate boiler stacks; and
(3) emissions discharged through a combined, multi-flu boiler stack. The dispersion modelling was
performed using the U.S. EPA's screening-level regulatory model, SCREEN3, and the U.S. EPA's
>      detailed dispersion model, ISC3. The models were run with the rural option and with a screening-level
set of meteorological data. In recognition of the fact that numerical dispersion models are incapable
of predicting pollutant dispersion during calm conditions (i.e., no wind), which are very frequent in
Bangladesh, a box model was used to try to estimate worst-case dispersion under these conditions.
In the present study, two emission scenarios were modelled: (1) turbines operating at 100% load
and emissions for each turbine discharged through separate steam generator stacks; and (2) turbines
operating at 50% load and emissions discharge through separate steam generator stacks. These two
cases were selected as being representative of worst-case conditions, based on a review of emissions
data for a range of load cases (Appendix A). Stack parameters and pollutant emission rates used in the
present study differ significantly from those used in the 1997 study, presumably because of changes and
progress in the design of the facility since that time. SCREEN3 was used for preliminary model runs
in the present study to determine the optimum stack height, and the new U.S. EPA model AERMOD
was used for detailed modelling.

AERMOD is soon to replace ISC3 as the regulatory model inthe U.S. Improved features within
AERMOD that are relevant to the present case include more up-to-date physics for dealing with
convective conditions (i.e., light winds and clear skies during the daytime) and specification of
dispersion parameters based upon local terrain characteristics. The method of handling local terrain
characteristics in ISC3 is very simplistic, accounting for only two classes of terrain, rural and urban,
with no intermediate classes. This method of handling convective conditions within ISC3 dates back
to the 1970's. Since that time, a number of significant field studies have been completed which have
resulted in the current improvements reflected in AERMOD.
In the present study, five years (1994 - 1998) of surface meteorological data from Dhaka Airport
and five years (1994 - 1998) of upper air meteorological data from Calcutta, India were used as inputs
to the AERMOD simulations. These were the nearest sources of readily available surface and upper
air data. Since the climate and topography in the region are uniform, the data from these locations are
considered to be representative of meteorological conditions at the study site.
As pointed out in the 1997 study, the high frequency of calm conditions in Bangladesh presents
a problem for numerical dispersion models. Calm conditions occur approximately 50% of the time in
the study area. By definition, they are conditions in which the winds are too light to be detected by
conventional wind instruments (e.g., wind speeds <0.5 m/s). AERMOD, likeISC3, treats anyhourwith
calm conditions as equivalent to an hour with missing data and skips to the next hour. This means that
about half of each year is skipped in the dispersion model runs.
To help account for this, Mott Ewbank Preece adopted a box model approach in their 1997
study. This approach, however, is normally used for calm wind conditions in valley settings and does
not have a sound basis in flat open terrain; a definitive characteristic of the current project area. The
results produced by it have a high degree of uncertainty and do not shed any light on dispersion during
calm conditions. Therefore, the box model was not used in the present study.

It is expected that calm conditions would tend to produce ground level concentrations that are
comparable to those associated with light winds in the 0.5 to 1.5 mn/s range. Since the available surface
data include many hours with light winds, it is likely that worst-case conditions will be adequately
captured, should they be associated with calm and light wind conditions. Therefore, AERMOD is
expected to provide reasonable predictions of maximum short-term concentrations, despite the high
frequency of calm conditions in the meteorological data.
If the worst-case conditions are associated with calm conditions, then the fact that calm
conditions occur about 50% ofthe time and AERMOD skips over those conditions means that predicted
annual average concentrations will be somewhat low. As long as the results are far below applicable
guidelines, however, this should not be a concem.
3. GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS
The principal air pollutants of concern in the exhausts of the proposed turbines include nitrogen
dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM). The applicable World Bank guidelines (July 1, 1998) and
Bangladesh standards for maximum concentrations in the ambient air are shown in Table I, along with
standards in other jurisdictions for comparison.

4. METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS
Surface meteorological data were obtained from the Dhaka Airport, Bangladesh and upper air
data were obtained from Calcutta, India for the period of 1994 to 1998, inclusive. The wind data are
summarized in the wind rose in Figure 2 and in the frequency distribution, presented in Appendix B.
The resolution of the reported wind directions is plus or minus 22.50, as illustrated in Figure 2. As
indicated in Appendix B, calm conditions (i.e., conditions below the detection limit of the wind
instrument) occur about 47% of the time. This is typical of tropical areas but, nevertheless, is very high.
5. SOURCE PARAMETERS
The power plant will consist of two natural gas fired turbines and one steam turbine with a total
output of 450 MW. The exhaust from each of the turbines will be discharged through individual heat
recovery steam generator stacks. The modelled exhaust specifications and stack parameters are
summarized in Table 2. The modelling was conducted for both a 50% load scenario and a 100% load
scenario. The two turbine engines were assumed to be operating simultaneously in both of the
scenarios.

Some uncertainty existed with respect to the pollutant emission rates, with numbers provided
by Ansaldo differing somewhat from those provided by Hyundai. In the case of NO,, the modelling
was based on the Ansaldo emission rates which were somewhat higher than the Hyundai values. In the
case of PM, the modelling was based on Hyundai's guaranteed emission rates. This combination of
emission factors represents the worst-case scenario.
6. BACKGROUND POLLUTANT LEVELS
Some monitoring of existing pollutant levels in the study area was conducted by Mott Ewbank
Preece and is reported in the 1997 preliminary environmental assessment report. The monitoring was
performed using passive sampling devices. Long-term concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and
sulphur dioxide (SO2) were measured over a period of four months at eight sites in the vicinity of the
proposed power plant. The results for NO2 are summarized in Table 3. For the purpose of the present
study, the 4-month averages shown in Table 3 have been treated as approximately equivalent to the
annual average, which is a conservative approach.
The passive sampling method employed in the 1997 study did not provide any direct
information on maximum 24-hour background concentrations. This information is needed for the
purpose of estimating the worst-case combined impact of the proposed power plant and existing
pollutant sources, which can then be compared to World Bank guidelines for the 24-hour averaging
time. In the absence of direct measurements, it is possible to make screening-level estimates of
maximum 24-hour badkground levels, based on relationships observed between averaging times in
continuous monitoring programs conducted elsewhere in the world. This has been done and the
resulting estimates are also shown in Table 3.
The relationship between short-term and long-term averages varies from one pollutant to
another. SO2, for example, is subject to a variety of removal processes in the atmosphere and has a
relatively short half-life. As a result, the maximum 24-hour average concentration is frequently an order
of magnitude higher than the annual average. NO2, on the other hand, is largely a by-product of
photochemical reactions in the atmosphere and tends to fluctuate much less than S02.

RWDI has previously reviewed over 200 station-years of ambient monitoring data, recorded at
a wide variety of locations in Ontario, Canada. The observed average ratio of annual maximum 24-hour
E .1 3ge concentration to annual average concentration for NO2 was 2.91 and the standard deviation was
0.77. Based on these findings, the maximum 24-hour concentration of NO2 for the present study was
estimated by applying a factor of 3.0 to the measured 4-month average concentrations.

The 4-month average concentrations shown in Table 3 range from under 3 to approximately
42 gg/m3 but, with only one exception, are 21 .ig/mn or less. The mean of the 4-month averages for all
eight monitoring sites is 16 pg/m3. The estimated maximum 24-hour concentrations range from 8 to
126 j.g/m3 but all but one are 63 jLg/m3 or less. The average value of maximum 24-hour concentration
is 48 l.Lg/m3.
Additional monitoring with passive samplers is currently under way. Initial results for the first
five weeks of monitoring (not shown above), fall within a similar range to those shown in Table 3. The
field monitoring data have been included in Appendix C.

Based on the available monitoring data, values of 21 gig/m3 and 63 .Lg/3 have been adopted
K    as conservative estimates of the annual average and maximum  24-hour average background
concentration of NO2.
7. PHOTO-OXIDATION OF NOx
Within the exhaust stack of a turbine engine, the oxides of nitrogen consist primarily of nitric
oxide (NO). Once the exhaust gases are released into the outside air, however, photochemical reactions
take place that lead to an increase in the relative proportion of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) present in the
mixture. The ratio of NO2 to total NO, varies depending on the meteorological conditions and the
background pollutants that are present in the ambient air.
In the present case, maximum NO2 concentrations attributable directly or indirectly to the
proposed exhaust stacks were determined by first predicting total NO, concentrations and then applying
a fixed value for the NO2 to NO, ratio. Ratios of 0.52 and 0.68 were used, which represent realistic
upper limits for 24-hour and annual average concentrations, respectively. These values are consistent
with values used previously for regulatory dispersion modelling in various jurisdictions. This is
discussed further in Appendix D.
8. SCREENING LEVEL ANALYSIS
A preliminary estimate of the required stack height was calculated using the Good Engineering
Practice (GEP) stack height calculation, in accordance with the U.S. EPA's Regulation No. 96 issued
in its final form in July 1985. The results indicated that the GEP stack height is 64 m. A range of stack
heights (50 m to 75 m) was then applied in the U.S. EPA's screening level dispersion model SCREEN3.
Air Quality Modelling - October 29, 1999
Meghnaghat Power Plant, Mcghnaghat, Bangladesh - Project #00-124-6        Page 7   R V      DL



The modelling was conducted for one turbine engine and the results were doubled to account
for two engines operating simultaneously. The results of the dispersion modelling are shown in Figure
3. The SCREEN3 results correspond to a 1-hour averaging period. The 24-hour concentrations were
determined by applying a factor of 0.4 to the I -hour concentrations, as recommended by the U.S. EPA
(1992).
The screening level modelling shows that the optimal stack height, to minimize off-site impacts,
corresponds closely to the calculated GEP stack height (Appendix E). Based on the results, it appears
that the optimun stack height is approximately 60 m. This corresponds to the stack height
recommended by Mott Ewbank Preece in their 1997 report.
9. DETAILED DISPERSION MODELLING
9.1 AERMOD
Detailed dispersion modelling for the 60m stack height was conducted using AERMOD, jointly
developed by the U.S. EPA and the American Meteorological Society (AMS). The model is currently
undergoing beta testing and is intended to replace ISC3 as the regulatory model for short-range
transport of pollutants in the US. AERMOD is based on more up-to-date physics than ISC3, providing
a better simulation of plume rise and buoyancy, dispersion around hills, the effects ofterrain roughness,
and plume dispersion in both convective and stable boundary layers.
AERMOD's advantages relative to ISC3 include the updated physics that provides a more
realistic treatment of emissions from tall stacks, the ability to account for the effects of terrain
roughness and surface albedo, and improved handling of dispersion around hills.

9.2    Meteorological Data Processor
Five years of surface and upper air (1994-1998, inclusive) meteorological data were processed
using AERMET. Wind data were only available for 3-hour periods, rather than 1 -hour periods, as
required by AERMET. It was therefore assumed that the data for each 3-hour period was representative
of each hour within that period. Twice daily upper air soundings were available, which is the minimum
required for AERMET.
This model estimates the required boundary layer parameters for the AERMOD dispersion
model based on user specified site characteristics. These characteristics and the corresponding values
are summarized in Table 4.

Parameter                                     Value

Bowen Ratio                                     0.5
9.3    Receptor Grid
AERMOD was programmed to provide predicted concentrations at a uniform grid of receptor
points. A polar grid was used, 20 km in radius and centered on the proposed power plant site. Within
4.0 km of the site, grid points were spaced 20 degrees apart in compass direction and 200 m apart in
radial distance. Beyond 4.0 km, the points were spaced 1 0 degrees apart in compass direction and 800
m apart in radial distance. Concentrations were predicted at a total of 1080 grid points. The terrain was
assumed to be flat.

10. RESULTS
The maximum predicted ground-level concentrations of NO2 at 50% and 100% load scenarios
are summarized in Table 5. As indicated in the table, the NO2 concentrations are well below the
applicable ambient air quality guidelines for both, worst case operating scenarios.

The maximum predicted ground-level concentrations of PM  for the 50% and 100% load
scenarios are summarized in Table 6. Only the source contribution is shown in Table 6, since
background data for PM were not available. The source contribution in very small in comparison to
the World Bank standards. Therefore, the impact of PM emissions from the proposed power plant is
expected to be negligible.

Contour plots were prepared to illustrate the spatial distribution of the predicted source
contribution. The maximum 24-hour and annual NO2 and PM concentrations for the 50% and 100%
load scenarios are provided in Figures 4 to 7 and 8 to 11, respectively, not including background levels.
The star shape of the concentration contours in Figures 4 to I 1 are consistent with the wind rose
shown in Figure 2. This is a direct result of the poor resolution in the recorded wind directions as
previously mentioned (Section 2).
In the plots of maximum 24-hour average concentrations, the points of the star are indicative
of the real extent of the impacts. In the plots of annual average concentration, the real extent of impacts
will likely be somewhere between that indicated by the points of the star and that indicated by the
troughs between the points.
1 1. CONCLUSION
The results of the study indicated that the maximum 24-hour and annual concentrations of1NO2,
e      taking into account worst-case emissions and typical background levels, are within the Bangladesh
standards and World Bank guidelines. In the case of PM, background levels are not known. However,
the predicted source contribution is small in relation to both Bangladesh standards and World Bank
guidelines and is, therefore, not a concem.

APPENDIX B
ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE DESCRIPTORS AND TERMINOLOGY
Ambient or Background Noise: The ambient noise from all sources other than the sound of
interest (i.e. sound other than that being measured).
dB - Decibel: The logarithmic units associated with a sound pressure level, sound power level, or
acceleration level. See sound pressure level, for example.
dBA - Decibel, A-Weighted: The logarithmic units associated with a sound pressure level, where
the sound pressure signal has been filtered using a frequency weighting that mimics the response of
the human ear. The resultant sound pressure level is therefore representative of the subjective
response of the human ear. A-weighted sound pressure levels are denoted by the suffix 'A' (ie.
dBA), and the term pressure is normally omitted from the description (i.e., sound level or noise
level).
Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNdB): A complex measure of perceived noisiness derived by
making adjustments to the magnitude of measured sound level in narrow frequency bands, (1/3
octaves) for tonality, and rise time of the noise. EPNdB values are the base measure of an individual
overflight noise exposure from aircraft under the NEF metric, analogous to the manner in which SEL
is used for computing Leq.24
Eneriv Eauivalent Sound Level (L q.  An energy-average sound level taken over a specified period
of time. It represents the average sound pressure encountered for the period. The time period is
often added as a suffix to the label (ie. Leq (24) for the 24 hour equivalent sound level). L,q is usually
A-weighted. An Leq value expressed in dBA is a good single number descriptor of the annoyance
of noise.
Human Perception of Sound: The human perception of noise impact is an important consideration
in the quantification of the noise effects caused by projects. The following table is a rough guideline.
Increase in                Perception
Noise Level (dBA)            l
I to 3                   insignificant due to imperceptibility
4 to 5                   just-noticeable difference
6 to 9                   marginally significant
10 or more                significant, perceived as a doubling of sound exposure
Exceedance Noise Level (LN): The noise level exceeded N% of the time. It is a statistical measure
of the noise level. For highly varying sounds, the Lgo represents the background noise level, L5.
represents the median or typical noise level, and LIo represents the short term peak noise levels, such
as due to occasional traffic or a barking dog.

Noise: Unwanted sound.
Noise Level: same as Sound Level, except applied to unwanted sounds.
Noise Exposure Forecast (NEF): a calculated measure of aircraft noise based on the type of
aircraft in use, the take-off and landing patterns of the aircraft, and times of operation. It represents
the noise exposure over a typical 24 hour period. A penalty is applied to nighttime operation.
Peak Sound Pressure Level: same as Sound Pressure Level except that peak (not peak-to-peak)
sound pressure values are used in place of RMS pressures.
Sound: a dynamic (fluctuating) pressure.
RMS Sound Pressure: the square-root of the mean-squared pressure of a sound (usually the result
of an RMS detector on a microphone signal).
Sound ExDosure Level (SEL): An L,q referenced to a one second duration. Also known as the
Single Event Level. It is a measure of the cumulative noise exposure for a single event. It provides
a measure of the accumulation of sound energy over the duration of the event.
Sound Level (SL): The A-weighted Sound Pressure Level expressed in dBA.
Sound Pressure Level (SPL): The logarithmic ratio of the rms sound pressure to the sound pressure
at the threshold of hearing. The sound pressure level is described by equation (1) where P is the RMS
pressure due to a sound and P0 is the reference pressure. P0 is usually taken as 2.0 X 10 Pascals.
(1)  SPL (dB) = 20 LOG (P,.jPo0)
Sound Power Level (PWL): The logarithmic ratio of the instantaneous sound power (energy) of
a noise source to that of an internationally standardized reference power. Mathematically:
(2) PWL (dB) = 10 LOG (W/W0)
where W is the sound power of the source in watts, and W0 is the reference power of 10.12 watts.
Interrelationships between sound pressure level (SPL) and sound power level (PWL) depend on the
location and type of source.

SCREENING TECHNIQUES FOR PREDICTING THE CONrVERSION OF NO TO NO2 IN
THEATMOSPHERE
Introduiction
Oxides of nitrogen (NO.) produced as a result of combustion processes consist primarily of nitric
oxide (NO). In internal combustion, NO typically makes up at least 85% of the NO,. Most of
the remainder consists of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Once released into the atmosphere, however,
sunlight and ozone in the ambient air can combine to convert NO to NOI, so that ultimately, the
NOx may contain a much larger porportion of NO2.
An equilibrium between NO and NO2 is achieved in the atmosphere that depends on numerous
meteorological and environmental factors. Sophisticated numerical models that approximate the
complex meteorology and chemistry are relatively time consuming and costly to run. For
regulatory dispersion modelling of short-range impacts (short-range meaning within about 10 km
of the source), the tendancy has been to use simplified, conservative estimates of the relationship
between NO and NO2 in the atmosphere.
Summary of Screening Techniques
Cole and Summerhays (1979)1 described several simplified methods, which they referred to as
screening techniques. The simplest and most widely used of these techniques for short-range
dispersion modelling are as follows: (a) partial conversion using an arbitrary fixed conversion
factor (e.g., 50%) ; (b) empirical curves derived from plume measurements; and (c) the ozone
limiting method. In the ozone limiting method, it is assumed that the conversion of NO to NO2
is limited only by the amount of ozone (03) present in the ambient air. If, for example, a stack
contributes 0.5 ppm of NO, at a given location downwind, and the ambient concentration of 03 is
0.05 ppm, then the resulting concentration of NO2 is 0.05 ppm. If, on the other hand, the ambient
concentration of 03 is greater than 0.5 ppm, then total conversion is assumed and the resulting
NO2 concentration is 0.5 ppm.



Current and Past Practice in Various Jurisdictions
In many jurisdictions, 100% conversion represents the first level of screening technique. If this
does not lead to satisfactory results then other approaches are used. In the U.S., NO2 is regulated
only in terms of the annual average concentration. The current reconmnended approach for the
second level of screening technique is to use the partial conversion method with a default
conversion factor of 75%. A site-specific factor based on spatially averaged field monitoring
data (the so-called Area Ratio Method, or ARM) can also be used2.
The ozone-limiting method was formerly the second level screening approach in the U.S.
guidelines. It is now considered to be a "non-guideline" screening technique and is still in use on
a case-by-case basis. It is currently accepted in most jurisdictions in Canada, or is approved on a
case-by-case basis.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute has used empirical curves for NO2/NO. ratio, based on
plume measurements that were conducted in the Netherlands in the 1980's. The Swedish
Meteorological and Hydrological Institute has used 100% conversion as its first level screening
technique and empirical curves as the second level technique.
In Germany, the partial conversion method has been used, with a 60% conversion factor3. In the
lUK, the partial conversion method has likewise been used, with a conversion factor of 50% for
short-terrn concentrations4. The Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department (EPD)
previously used an conversion factor of 50%, but more recently has been using 20%5.
Field Monitoring in Ontario, Canada
RWDI has examined extensive field monitoring data for NO,, NO2  and 03 collected by the
Ontario Ministry of the Environment. We have analyzed a total of five years of continuous data
from each of approximately 40 sites. Both urban and rural locations were included. The
observed ratios of NO2 to NO, are sumnmarized in the following table.



Table 1: Observed Ratios of NO2 to NO, from 200 Station-Years of Data
Averaging Time                 Mean         Standard    Suggested
Deviation    Factor
annual average                 0.57         0.11        0.68
annual max. 24-hour average    0.37         0.15        0.52
annual max. 1-hour average     0.23         0.11        0.34
The suggested factors in the table represent the mean plus one standard deviation, which
corresponds approximately to the 83rd percentile ratio and represents a reasonably conservative
factor. For the annual average a suggested factor of 0.68 is obtained, which agrees reasonably
well with the EPA's default value of 0.75 for annual average concentration. For annual
maximum 24-hour average, a suggested factor of 0.52 is obtained, which is consistent with the
50% and 60% conversion factors used in the U.K., Hong Kong (previously) and Germany. The
value of 0.2 currently used in Hong Kong appears to be non-conservative and too low when
compared to the Ontario data.
Comments on the Ozone Limiting Metlhod
Al
Gudivaka and Dorris (1991) conducted a study in rural Texas and found that the ozone limiting
method was biased toward overestimating the concentration of NO2, and other researchers have
found that the conversion of NO may be limited by other factors besides ozone6. Thus, the ozone
limiting method may be overly conservative, depending on how it is used.
As examples of the use of the ozone limiting method. we can cite two recent analyses conducted
by RWDI. In a study for a natural gas compressor station in rural Canada. the ozone limiting
method led to a N02/NO, ratio of approximatelv 0.1% for the predicted maximum 1-hour NOx
concentration of 886 pg/M3. In a study for the exhaust shafts of a vehicle tunnel in Boston, USA,
the ozone limiting method led to ratios ranging from 66% down to 3% for the worst one-hour
concentrations at the worst receptors.



It is clear from these two examples that the ozone-limiting method can lead to widely varying
ratios between NO2 and NO,, with results sometimes more conservative and sometimes less
conservative than those based on constant conversion factors. The degree of conservatism is
highly dependent on the nature of the emission source being modelled.
Summary
The available literature and data suggest that both the partial conversion method and the ozone
limiting method can be relied upon to give reasonably conservative results and, as such, are
suitable as screening techniques for estimating the conversion of NO to NO2. In this report,
RWDI provide suggested factors for use in the partial conversion method that are based on
extensive field monitoring data and are consistent with factors previously used in various
jurisdictions.

Re:          Meghnaghat - Stack Height
Message:
Geoff,
We have completed the GEP stack height calculation. as per the U.S. EPA's guideline document. The
results indicated that the GEP stack height is 64 m. A range of stack heights (50 m to 75 m) was then
applied in the screening level dispersion modelling. The stack parameters used in the modelling, which
correspond to one turbine engine operating at 100% load, are summarized in Table 1.
Table 1: Summarv of Stack Parameters

The Screen 3 modelling was conducted for 1 turbine encine and the results were doubled to account for 2
engines operating simultaneously. The results of the dispersion modelling are shown in the attached
figure. The Screen 3 results corresponded to a 1 -hour averaging period. The 24-hour concentrations were
determined by applying a factor of 0.4 to the 1-hour concentrations, as recommended by the U.S. EPA.

The screening level modelling shows that the optimal stack height to minimize off-site impacts
corresponds closely to the calculated GEP stack height. Based on the results, it appears that the optimum
stack height is approximately 60 m.

Re:          Meghnaghat - Dispersion Modelling Results
Message:
Geoft
We have completed the dispersion modelling for all three phases of the proposed Meghnaghat Power
Plant. This memorandum is an addendum to RWDI's report dated October 29, 1999.
The modelling was conducted using the U-S. EPA's AERMOD program. Five years (1994-1998) of
surface meteorological data from the Dhaka Airport and five years (1994-1998) of upper air soundings
_      from Calcutta were applied in the modelling. The air pollutants modelled were nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
and particulate matter (PM). The modelling parameters applied in this assessment are consistent with
those preseated in RWDI's October 29, 1999 report.
The applicable World Bank ambient air quality guidelines are summarized in Table 1, along with
standards from other jurisdictions, for reference.

The following operating scenarios were modelled:
Seenario 1:   all three power plants operating at 100% load (ie., six turbines eaclh operating at 100%
load); and
Scenario 2:   all three power plants operating one turbine at 100% load and one turbine at 50% load.
The stack parameters used in the modelling are summarized in Table 2.

ABRMOD was programmed to provide predicted concentrations at a uniform grid of receptor points. A
polar grid was used, 20 km in radius and centered on the proposed plant site. Within 4.0 khn of the site,
grid points were spaced 20 degrees apart in compass direction and 200 m apart in radial distance. Beyond
4.0 kmi, the points were spaced 10 degrees apart in compass direction and 800 m apart in radial distance.
Concentrations were predicted at a total of 1080 grid points. The terrain was assuimied to be flat.
The maximum predicted ground level concentrations for both of the load scenarios are summarized in
Tables 3 and 4. Background NO2 concentrations were based on a monitoring program conducted by Mott
Ewbank Preece in 1997. The monitoring results are discussed in the October 29, 1999 report. Monitoring
data from July to September 1999 were reviewed. NO2 concentrations were measured over two week
periods at a total of 5 locations. The results fall within a similar range to those from 1997.

Contour plots were prepared to illustrate the spatial distribution of predicted concentrations. These plots
are provided in Figures 1 through 8. As illustrated in the figures, the concentrations are well below the
applicable ambient air quality guidelines for both operating scenarios. The star shape of the concentration
contours in Figures 1 to 8 are a direct result of the poor resolution in the recorded wind directions as
discussed in RWDI's report dated October 29, 1999.

case of PM, background levels are not known. However, the predicted source contribution from all three
phases is small in relation to World Bank guidelines and is therefore, not a concern.

INTRODUCTION
By a telefax on 9 September 1999, ESG International Inc. (Canada) commissioned the Danish
Hydraulic Institute (DHI), in association with Surface Water Modelling Centre (SWMC)
(Bangladesh), to undertake a study of cooling water dilution in connection with a planned power
station at Meghnaghat. Phase I of the power station will be built, owned, and operated by AES
Meghnaghat Ltd.; a subsidiary company of the AES Corporation (USA).
The authorisation to begin the study followed a dialogue about scope and approach, which is
described in Terms of Reference prepared by ESG, and in a short (revised) proposal submitted
by DHI and SWMC on 9 September 1999. Supplementary technical specifications were received
from ESG by telefax on 16 September 1999.
The scope of the study and details of its basis were discussed at meetings in Dhaka between
AES, ESG, SWMC and DHI on September 20 and October 10, 1999.
The starting point for the study is a 'Hydraulic study of the Meghna River near the Meghna Ghat
power plant site, reported to Mott Ewbank Preece in association with Progressive Consultants
Ltd. by DHI in association with SWMC in March 1997 /1/. Since then, another modelling study
was made (for Mott Macdonald) by China National Water Resources and Hydropower
Engineering Corporation, April 20, 1999 /3/.
According to the Terms of Reference, the key objectives of the study are to:
1.    Provide a preliminary opinion on the status of the project with respect to World Bank
Guidelines ... for thermal discharges ... The opinion should include an evaluation as to
whether a mixing zone can be defined as per the World Bank Guidelines 121; and to
2.    Undertake simulation modelling of the thermal discharge ... to assess compliance with
the World Bank Guidelines .... The modelling should be carried out for worst case
discharge conditions.
World Bank Guidelines state that 'the effluent should result in a temperature increase of
no more than 3 degrees Celsius at the edge of the zone where initial mixing and dilution
take place. Where the zone is not defined, use 100 metres from the point of discharge
when there are no sensitive aquatic ecosystems within this distance.' Field studies and a
review of published infornation demonstrates that the project is not located within a
sensitive aquatic ecosystem ...
3.    Upon completion of modelling, provide recommendations to mitigate the thermal plume
of the power plant should it be demonstrated that the plume would exceed the applicable
guideline conditions. This may include modifications to the discharge location,
discharge design, or discharge flow parameters.
By a telefax on September 21, 1999, ESG has requested that the future recirculation be
addressed as a part of the study.

2   FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The following operation conditions have been considered for dry and wet season conditions:
Case 1: Phase 1, normal operation, 15.5 m3/s heated by 5.5 °C
Case 2: Phase 1, bypass operation, 15.5 m3/s heated by 9.5 °C
Case 3: Phase 1 &2, normal operation, 31 m3/s heated by 5.0 °C
Case 4: Phase 1 &2, phase 1 in normal operation and phase 2 in bypass operation, 31 m3Js heated
by 6.5 °C
The model that was established for the 1997 study (/I/) has been re-used, and no additional
calibration has been made for the present study. The model is based on cross-sections surveyed
by SWMC in July-August and October 1996. Hydrological data from February 1991 and July
1996 (measured by Bangladesh Water Development Board) have been applied, the former
period representing a lean flow period with an estimated 50-years return period. Boundary
values to the model were generated by a 1-dimensional hydrodynamic model.
The findings may be summarised as follows:
I    The present study aims at determining a fixed area of initial mixing and dilution, covering
the mixing zone specified in the World Bank guidelines, so that excess temperatures
above 3 °C do not occur outside the area. For this purpose, the largest distance between
the outfall and the 3 °C excess temperature isotherm has been calculated as shown in the    9
following table. The distances listed in the table mark the edge of the World Bank's
regulatory zone and the point at which the thermal discharge from the power plant must
not exceed 3 °C.

d is a characteristic dilution, calculated as the ratio between the temperature increase
through the plant and 3 oC (including recirculation)
I is the distance (in the downstream direction) from the ouffall to the estimated, annual
envelope of the 3 IC isotherm (based on the dry season simulations,
illustrating the worst case on an estimated 50-years recurrence basis)
It is evaluated that these distances may be exceeded at rare intervals. This may for
example be the case, if the water-level for several days should fall below the level applied
in the present dry season simulations (which is around I m relative to Public Works
Department datum).
Under any normal conditions, the 3 °C isotherm will be located well within the (fixed)
boundary thus established.                                                            )

calculated as follows:

3               0.1 0 C     1.8 OC       0.2 °C      2.2 oc
4               0.2 OC      2.3 OC       0.2 0C      2.8 0C
Note: 'mean' and 'max' refer to the actual, selected simulation perod, which covers a
fortnightly tidal cycle with a negligible net flow.
3    Dry season conditions are clearly critical with respect to the extent of the mixing zone, as
well as recirculation. This is due to (i) the negligible net flow available to dilution of the
effluent, and (ii) the tidal reversal of the flow in the dry season, which (at rising tide)
carries the effluent upstream towards the intakes, whereby the diluted cooling water
accumulates in front of the plant, and recirculation occurs.
4     No need of mitigation measures (in order to increase the mixing of the cooling water) has
been identified during this study. The outfall should provide for a reasonable initial
velocity (1-2 mrs) at low stages, in order to direct the plume away from the bank. The
outfall should be designed in such a way that the energy loss becomes moderate. A
submerged diffuser is advised against, as this type of outfall is vulnerable to erosion and
sedimentation, and will increase the energy loss unnecessarily.
5    With a mixing zone extending 3.6 km downstream (for Phase 1) and 4.5 km downstream
(Phase 2), the power plant will comply with the World Bank guidelines with respect to
temperature increase (/2/ p. 9). It is noted that such mixing zones reflect a 'worst case'
combination of adverse (by-pass) operating conditions and adverse (dry season) flow
conditions in the river.

4   THE MODEL
All calculations have been made by DHI's MIKE 21, which is a fully dynamic, 2-dimensional
model.
MIKE 21 is used for examination of hydrodynamics, heat and mass budgets, sediment transport
and ecology of free-surface water bodies that can be conceptualised to 2-dimensional (finite
grid) 1-layer systems, such as river sections, lakes, bays, estuaries, and coastal areas. For such
systems, MIKE 21 provides a deterministic system description that can accurately predict states
and cause-effect relationships.

The use of a 2-dimensional model implies that all variables (notably flow rates and excess
temperatures) are expressed as vertical average (depth-integrated) values. In nature, close to the
outfall, the cooling water plume will be located at the surface of the river (due to its buoyancy),
so that the excess temperatures near the surface will be higher than the vertical average value,
whereas the excess temperature near the bed will be correspondingly lower. The difference will
diminish rapidly with time and distance from the outfall, because depths are shallow (in the dry
season) and moderate (in the wet season). At the boundary of the mixing zone, the excess
temperature will be fairly evenly distributed over the depth.
In the present study, two modules have been applied: The hydrodynamic (HD) module and the
advection-dispersion (AD) module.
The HD module provides the hydrodynamic basis for the heat budget simulations. The module
simulates the water level and flow in response to a variety of forcings, such as:
* Boundary values (specified as time series of flow or water-level distributions along each
open boundary);
* bottom shear stress;
* momentum dispersion;
* outfall and intake flow (mass and momentum); and
* flooding and drying.
In the present case, the bulk flow through the river is quite well known beforehand. Gauging has
been made for many years by Bangladesh Water Development Board, and the hydrodynamics
have been analysed by SWMC by long-term 1-dimensional simulations using DHI's MIKE 11
HD modelling system. Thus, the objective of the present HD simulations is merely to provide a
detailed and consistent basis for the heat budget simulations.    -
The AD module describes the spreading of diluted cooling water (or, in other words, the heat
budget) subject to advection and dispersion processes. Recirculation (of water and heat) is
included, as well as heat dissipation to the atmosphere. Input values to this module include
* hydrodynamic basis (flow rates, water-levels and cooling water flow;
* mixing coefficients, mainly for description of cross-current dispersion;
* temperature increase of the cooling water through the plant (outfall temperature minus
intake temperature); and
* heat dissipation to the atmosphere.
A summary of the simulation procedure is given in Figure 4.1.

The model that was established for the 1997 study (/1/) has been re-used. The model was
calibrated in connection with the original set-up, and no additional calibration has been made for
the present study. The model is based on cross-sections surveyed by SWMC in July-August and
October 1996.
It is expected that landfill for the site will be obtained by borrow dredging in areas near the plant
site. The deepening of the river due to such dredging has been disregarded in the simulations,
because it is conservative to disregard the deepening (which will to some extent increase the
flow velocity and hereby increase the dilution), and because it is expected that the dredged areas
will tend to silt up in the course of time (/1/ p. 31).
In all cases, it was assumed that the cross-channel immediately south of the plant site was open
for flow between the western side branch and the main channel, also during low stage in the dry
season. This assumption reflects present conditions. Comparative simulations assuming a closed
channel (shown in Drawings 28 and 29) show that the assumption is clearly conservative with
respect to extent of the mixing zone, as well as recirculation. This is because both horizontal and
vertical mixing in the western side branch is confined by its narrow width and shallow depth,
particularly in the dry season.
Key data for the hydrodynamic and advection-dispersion simulations are given in Tables 4.1 and
4.2. The applied model bathymetry is shown in Drawing 1 (attachment).

The model is established in its own co-ordinate system, which has been aligned with the flow in
that particular section of the river. A comparison with the BTM grid is made in Figure 3.2 and in
Drawing I (attachment)
The model considers the effect of flooding and drying of the shallow areas that dry up at low
stages (cf. Drawing 1). This effect is important in the present application as a large portion of the
power plant's thermal discharge will be directed into these areas via the natural flows of the
Meghna River.
Boundary values have been specified as a flow boundary upstream and a water-level boundary
downstream, calculated by the MIKE I I model.

Table 4.1: Summary of hydrodynamic model set-up
The mnixing coefficient (or dispersion coefficient) has been specified at 5 m2/s. This value is
regarded as a low estimate considering the irregular flow prevailing in the area, where the
current speed and direction change continuously.
Recirculation is described both in the hydrodynamic and the advection-dispersion simulations.
Hereby, the outfall and the intake (or intakes) are considered as coupled sources and sinks of
water and heat. The intake excess temperature is taken as the actual, instantaneous excess
temperature calculated at the intake position, whereas the discharge excess temperature is
specified as the intake excess temperature plus a fixed increment that equals the temperature
increase of the cooling water through the plant.
A heat dissipation coefficient was applied in the heat budget simulations. This coefficient
expresses the heat loss to the atmosphere per m2 and per °C excess temperature (which is only a
small fraction of the gross heat flux through the river surface). A value of 15 W/m2,C was
calculated based upon the so-called Lake Heffner formula, which is an empirical relationship
that was first established by P.J. Ryan and D. R. F. Harleman in An analytical and experimental
study of transient cooling pond behaviour, M.I.T., Massachusets, 1973. According to this
formula, this value reflects a wind speed of I m/s and a water temperature of 25 °C:
SO6MiM                                                                               Danish Hydraulic Insatet

F = (4.6 - 0.09 T + 4.06 W) exp(0.033 T), where
F is the heat dissipation coefficient (W/m2 °C)
T is the water temperature (°C), and
W is the wind speed (m/s).
Inserting T = 25 °C and W = 1 m/s gives
F = (4.6 - 0.09 25 + 4.06 1) exp(0.033 25) = 15 W/m2 °C.
The value implies that half of the heat is lost to the atmosphere within 55 hours after discharge.
In the present simulations the heat dissipation have played a minor role only. Most of the heat
energy dissipate outside the 3 °C contour or is transported away from the area by the flow
The excess temperature simulations are linear with respect to the temperature increase through
the plant (or 'the waste heat supply rate').

5   SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS
The rationale of the simulation programme is to identify a fixed zone that contains the mixing
zone specified in the World Bank guidelines. The zone is characterised by initial mixing and
dilution taking place inside the zone, and by the excess temperatures remaining below 3 °C
outside the zone.
The assumption has been made that the point where the cooling water is diluted to 3 °C
coincides with the boundary of 'initial mixing and dilution', or is within (or well within) that
boundary. This assumption is fully justified, considering that the required dilution is below 1:2
for normal operating conditions (case I and 3), and 1:3.2 and 1:2.2 for adverse operating
conditions (case 2 and 4).

The actual, instantaneous area of initial mixing and dilution varies with time. This is very much
the case in the dry season, where the area extends downstream of the plant during falling stage
(ebb flow), but upstream of the plant during rising stage (or flood flow). In the wet season, the
area will extend downstream of the plant all the time, but its size will depend on the actual flow
rate.
For environmental administrative purposes, a fixed area is desired. Therefore, the zone is
calculated as the envelope of the instantaneous 3 °C contours in the dry and the wet season. (In
the present study, the results show that the mixing zone is fully determined by dry season
conditions).
In this way, the temperature at the (fixed) boundary of the zone will be well below 3 °C in the
large majority of the time.
The simulation procedure follows the one applied during the 1997 study. Between them, the
simulations cover combinations of 'normal' and 'adverse' operating conditions, and 'adverse dry
season' and 'normal wet season' ambient conditions. Two periods were applied:
31/1 - IS52 1991 (an adverse dry season period); and
15-30/7 1996 (a normal wet season period).
The former period was selected to represent a lean flow period with an estimated 50-years return
period. This period aims at illustrating a practical 'worst case' situation in terms of the extent of
the mixing zone, as well as in terms of recirculation, as it is based on adverse assumptions about
the flow and water-level. The latter period has been chosen because calibration data were
available.
The dry season period was identified by a hydrological analysis of Meghna River carried out for
Mott Ewbank Preece by DHI and SWMC in March 1997 /I/.
The net flow (the residual flow, without the tidal component) was applied as the reference for
'adverse conditions', and the upstream boundary of the 1-D model (i.e. at Bhairab Bazar) was
applied as the point of analysis. Data from the last 25 years was analysed against an extreme
value distribution.
It was found that the average annual low water at Bhairab Bazar for a 50 year return period is
1.23 m PWD. Furthermore, the analysis showed that the selected period nearly represents the 50-
year lean flow situation. The period represents an entire neap-spring-neap tidal cycle, combined
with a unusually weak net flow.
The applied return period was selected in order to provide a valid basis for the mixing zone,
including the effect of actual recirculation under adverse ambient conditions. The mixing zone
thus established will delineate an area, outside of which the direct impact of the increased
temperature is of no practical concern whatsoever. (This does not imply that the impact
anywhere inside the zone boundary will be of any practical interest). (Please refer to Enclosure
A for an elaboration of this rationale).
(Regarding the implications to the thermal efficiency of the plant, a conclusion that the predicted
recirculation is acceptable (from a pure cost-efficiency point of view) will be 'safe'. A conclusion
that the recirculation is not acceptable (from a cost-efficiency point of view) is not 'safe', because
it may be overly conservative. If the findings, against expectations, are a matter of concern in

this respect, a more detailed analysis is required to justify and optimise possible measures to
reduce the recirculation).
Boundary values to the model were generated in connection with the 1997 study by a 1-
dimensional hydrodynamic model (MIKE 11 HD), because measurements were not available at
the cross-sections that were suited as boundaries for the purpose of the present study.
The applied boundary values are shown in Drawings 3 and 7 for the dry and the wet season,
respectively. As a reference, a typical stage variation (from the hydrological year 1996) is shown
in Drawing 2.
Sample results of the hydrodynamic simulations are shown in Drawings 4-6 (reversing flow
characteristic of the dry season) and 8-9 (uni-directional flow, characteristic of the wet season).
The following operation conditions have been considered for both dry and wet season
conditions:
Case 1: Phase 1, normal operation, 15.5 m3/s heated by 5.5 °C
Case 2: Phase 1, bypass operation, *5.5 m3/s heated by 9.5 °C
Case 3: Phase 1 &2, normal operation, 31 m3/s heated by 5.0 OC
Case 4: Phase 1&2, phase 1 in normal and phase 2 in bypass operation, 31 m3/s heated
by 6.5 PC
The discharge rate of heat (or the effect of the cooling water, expressed in MW) is the product of
the cooling water flow, the temperature increase, the specific heat of the cooling water (taken as *
4.18 MJ/t °C) and the density of the cooling water (taken as 0.996 tlm3) (standard physical
characteristics of freshwater at 25 °C). The ratio between the discharge of heat between the 4
cases listed above becomes 1: 1.7: 1.9 : 2.4.
Drawing 10 illustrates the typical variation of the instantaneous excess temperature field through
a tidal cycle in the dry season with a 3 hours increment, as follows
10.a: 8/2 91 07:00 - spring tide, low stage (or low tide)
10.b: 8/2 91 10:00 - spring tide, intermediate (rising) stage (or flood flow)
I0.c: 8/2 91 13:00 - spring tide, high stage (or high tide).
l O.d: 8/2 91 16:00 - spring tide, intermediate (falling) stage (or ebb flow)
10.e: 812 91 19:00 - spring tide, low stage (or low tide)
Between them, these fields illustrate the heat accumulation that will take place in front of the
plant under reversing flow conditions. As a consequence, a certain recirculation will occur at the
same time, which will further increase the excess temperature.
Other results are organised as follows:

average excess temperatures

Time series of excess temperatures at selected points (including the intakes) are shown in
Drawings 11, 15, 19 and 23 for case 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Together with the graphs are
shown tables of intake temperatures. The tables show the minimum excess temperature (which is
always 0), as well as the mean and maximum excess temperature for each simulation case. The
tables also show the maximum duration of the occurrence of excess temperatures above a given
value, and the corresponding mean duration.
It is noted that the values presented in these tables relate to the specific simulation period. The
period has explicitly been selected as'an adverse dry season period. Therefore, the 'maximum'
and 'mean' values can be taken as indicative for adverse ambient conditions. Still, temperatures
higher than he listed 'maximum' values will inevitably occur from time to time. The listed
exceedence frequencies and durations are certainly not valid in general, because in most of the
time, conditions will be more (or much more) favourable than assumed in these simulations.
For example, in the reversing tidal flow that prevails in the driest part of the dry season, the
plume will extend upstream in part of the time, and downstream in part of the time. Under such
conditions, any given location will be affected by the cooling water in part of the time only
(except for the close vicinity of the outfall). Hereby, the average excess temperature will become
much less than the maximum excess temperature. In a pure tidal flow, at some distance from the
outfall, the average value will typically be half of the maximum, reflecting that the location is
exposed in half of the time.
As it is seen from the simulations (e.g. Drawings 13, 17, 21 or 25), the longitudinal excess
temperature gradient is quite small - typically well below 1 °C per km. Therefore, a small excess
temperature difference reflects a large distance along the river.
A synthesis of the findings is given in Table 5. 1, which shows the largest calculated distances
between the outfall and the 3 °C isothermn. The distances have been determined (for each
operation case) as an envelope of the 3 °C isotherm, as reflected by the fields of dry season
excess temperatures (Drawings 13, 17, 21, and 25). Among these, the bypass operation cases (2
and 4) are critical for the Phase I and 2 development of the plant, respectively.
The distances may be exceeded at rare intervals. This will for example be the case, if the water-
level for several days should fall below the level applied in the present dry season simulations
(which is around I m relative to Public Works Department datum).

It is recomrnended that these distances be applied to locate the boundary of the zone where
initial mixing and dilution take place, as required according to the World Bank Guidelines /2/.  &
Under any normal conditions, the actual distance 3 °C isotherm will be less (or even much less)
than indicated. (This is a logical consequence of establishing a fixed boundary around a field that
varies with time).
The mixing zones thus established are illustrated in Figure 5.1, which is based directly on
Drawings 17 and 25.

As a comparison with the 3 °C envelopes shown in Table 5. 1, the distances between the outfall
and the 3 °C average excess temperature are listed in Table 5.2. These distances have been
estimated in a different way than the values in Table 5.1. This is because the average 3 °C
contour cannot be well resolved with the 100 m grid increment applied for the dynamic model.
In nature, the cooling water will not be well vertically mixed within such short distances from
the outfall. Instead, a stationary, 3-dimensional plume model has been used.
6   EVALUATION
The mixing zone recommended in Chapter 5 is evaluated as a reasonable, practical 'worst case'
description. Based on conservative assumptions about operation and flow, it reflects an upper
limit of the excess temperature, to be exceeded at rare intervals only.
In comparison, the fields of average excess temperatures are shown in Drawings 14, 18, 22 and
26 for the four simulation cases. These temperatures give a more general (and presumably a
more valid) impression of the temperature impact of the plant. As explained in Chapter 5, the
average temperatures are well below the maximum ones at any given location, except for the
very close vicinity of the outfall.
In the same way, the effect of recirculation is quite visible in connection with the maximum
excess temperatures, and hereby in delineating the excess temperature envelopes and the
recommended mixing zones. This is seen in Table 6.1. This table shows the large difference
between calculated average and maximum recirculation for the 4 dry season simulations. (In the
wet season, the recirculation is nil). The average excess temperature is almost negligible as
compared with the temperature increase through the plant (of 5.0 - 9.5 °C), while the maximum
recirculation is not.
The 'average' and 'maximum' values in Table 6.1 refer to the applied simulation periods. The
general validity of the former depends on the validity of the latter. The decisive factor in the heat
budget is the flow. The two simulation periods represent extremely low flow (0-500 m3/s, cf.
Drawing 3) and typical wet season flow 8000-9000 m3/s, cf. Drawing 7). By comparison with
the annual variation of the flow (as indicated by the hydrograph in Drawing 2), they may be
taken as quite conservative indications of dry season conditions, and as general indications of
wet seasori conditions.
When the cooling water has spread across the river channel, the further downstream reduction of
excess temperature is relatively slow. This is illustrated in Dwgs. 18, 22, and 26. Once the
cooling water has been entirely mixed with the river flow, the reduction will take place only by
heat dissipation (which is a slow process, with a time scale of days, cf. Chapter 4).
The border of the mixing zone is defined by the 3 °C isotherm. It is therefore located so far from
the outfall that the cooling water is largely fully rnixed with the river flow within the mixing
zone. The small longitudinal excess temperature gradient means that even a small change of the
initial excess temperature will move the 3 °C envelope visibly upstream or downstream. The
mixing zone is highly sensitive to the initial excess temperature, and hereby to the recirculation.
The effect has been fully accounted for in the model simulations. It means that in the analysis
reported in Chapters 4 and 5, the border of the mixing zone has been determined by a 'rare

event', rather than by 'typical conditions'. The recirculation is significant to the delineation of the
mixing zone, according to the applied calculation procedure, but is not at all in itself significant 
to the environmental impact (if any) of the discharge.
With regard to plant operation, the maximum values do not contribute with any weight to the
general operating conditions. They occur too seldom for that.

'Average' and 'maximum' relate to the applied simulation periods
Table 6.1: Average and maximum recirculation
The simulations show that dry season conditions (characterised by a reversing tidal flow and
accumulation of cooling water around the plant) are clearly critical with respect to the extent of
the mnixing zone, as well as recirculation. This is exemplified by comparison between Drawings
11I and 12; 15 and 16; 19 and 20; and 23 and 24. For the same reason, fields of average and
maximum excess temperatures are presented as drawings for'the dry season only. The reason
why the wet season simulations were made in the first place is that this finding is not self-
evident. It is often seen that a uni-directional steady flow can extend a given isotherm by a
longer distance than a reversing flow.
Practical potential rritigation measures comprise
*Increasing the distance between the intake and the outfall (or outfalls). This will reduce the
recirculation in the first place, and, as a consequence, reduce the general level of the excess
temperatures. The average recirculation is small, 0.1I - 0.2 'C (cf. Drawings I 1, 15, 19 and
23), as compared with a basic temperature increase of 5 - 9.5 'C. Therefore, the effect of
such modification will largely be limited to reducing the occasional peak values
*Relocating the outfall, to discharge directly into the mainstream. The effect of such measure
would be significant (cf. Drawings 27-29), but the scheme is hardly practical and does not
seem justifted
*Closing the cross-channel immediately south of the power plant site. The effect of this
scheme would be similar to relocating the outfall.
*Optimising the outfall in terms of discharge velocity and direction, at the same time
observing the water-level variation interval in the river and maintaining a reasonable energy
loss. With a low discharge velocity (less than around 0.5 mIs), the plume would proceed
along the river bank, reducing the initial lateral mixing. On the other hand, a high velocity

(above around 2 m/s) would increase the energy loss of the cooling water system and hereby
the plant efficiency (which is in itself a key determinant of its over-all environmental
impact).
To summarise, no need of mitigation measures have been identified in order to increase the
mixing of the cooling water, or to reduce any adverse environmental effects related to the
increased temperatures. Excluding the close vicinity of the outfall, the excess temperatures are
so confined in time and space that they will not cause any harm to the environment. The
occasional event of high recirculation is illustrated by Case 4 (Dwg. 23), where the excess
temperature at intake 1 and 2 has been calculated to exceed 2 °C for periods of up to 1.5 and 3
hours, respectively. During such events, the buoyancy of the cooling water will increase
accordingly. Therefore, extreme excess temperatures near the outfall will occur at the surface of
the river. The water column and the river bed will not be fully affected, due to the delay until the
vertical mixing has taken effect. The river bed will be fully affected only once the cooling water
is fully vertically mixed.
From an operational point of view, the predicted extent of recirculation is seen as a minor effect
as well. Mitigation measures should be implemented only if justified by an improved plant
efficiency. An increased over-all plant efficiency will always improve the ratio between social
value and environmental costs of power production.
A prudent (cost-effective) design should be aimed at, also for the cooling water intake and
outfall. The outfall should provide for a reasonable initial velocity (1-2 mIs) at low waterlevel, in
order to direct the plume away from the river bank. The outfall should be designed in such a way
that that the energy loss becomes moderate - for the reason stated above, that an excessive
energy loss will reduce the plant efficiency, and hereby inevitably incur adverse environmental
side effects.
A submerged diffuser is advised against, as this type of outfall is vulnerable to erosion and
sedimentation, and will increase the energy loss unnecessarily.
If the cross-channel immediately south of the power plant site be blocked, due to morphological
developments, the cooling water effluent will be directed into the main flow of the Meghna.
Hereby, the mixing zone will be reduced, and the recirculation will decrease. This is shown in
Drawings 27-29, which may be compared with Drawings 23, 25 and 26 (where the cross-
channel is open).
As a consequence of this difference, the 1997 study (I/ p. 31) tentatively suggests to close the
cross-channel 'to avoid negative effects'. In this connection, the opinion is offered that the extent
of the muxing zone in itself should not justify any mitigation measures, and particularly not any
measures that might, possibly, incur side effects.

Meghnaghat Power Station, cooling water dilution -
Preliminary Opinion Memo
Introduction
By a telefax on 9 September 1999, ESG lnternational Ltd. (Canada) commissioned Danish Hydraulic
Institute (DHI) in association with Surface Water Modelling Centre (SWMC) (Bangladesh) to
undertake a study of cooling water dilution in connection with a planned power station at
Meghnaghat. Phase I of the power station will be built, owned and operated by AES Corporation
(USA).
The authorization to begin the study followed a dialogue about scope and approach, which is
described in Terms of Reference prepared by ESG, and in a short (revised) proposal submitted by
DHI and SWMC on 9 September 1999. Supplementary technical specifications were received from
ESG by telefax on 16 September 1999.
The starting point for the study is a 'Hydraulic study of the Meghna River near the Meghna Ghat
power plant site', reported to Mott Ewbank Preece in association with Progressive Consultants Ltd. by
DHI in association with SWMC in March 1997 /I/.
IP                    The present Preliminary Opinion memo has been prepared in response to the following study
objective 1.
Study objectives
According to the Terms of Reference, the key objectives of the study are to:
1.    Provide a preliminary opinion on the status of the project with respect to World Bank
Guidelines ... for thermal discharges ... The opinion should include an evaluation as to
whether a mixing zone can be defined as per the World Bank Guidelines;
2.     Undertake simulation modelling of the thermal discharge ... to assess compliance with the
World Bank Guidelines - analysis for potential recirculation of cooling water is not required
at this time. The modelling should be carried out for worst case discharge conditions.
World Bank Guidelines state that 'the effluent should result in a temperature increase of no
more than 3 degrees Celsius at the edge of the zone where initial mixing and dilution take
place. Where the zone is not defined, use 100 metres from the point of discharge when there
are no sensitive aquatic ecosystems within this distance.' Field studies and a review of
published information demonstrates that the project is not located within a sensitive
ecosystem ...
3.     Upon completion of modelling provide recommendations to mitigate the thermal plume of the
power plant. These might include modifications to the discharge location, discharge design or
discharge flow parameters.

The Project                                                                                        -
The planned power station is located on the right (north) bank of Upper Meghna River, just
downstream of the Dhaka-Chittagong highway bridge across that river.
The future cooling water discharges are listed in Table I below. In comparison, the 1997 study /2/
assumed a total discharge of 24 m3/s (from 3 units), with a excess temperature of 8 OC. In terms of
heat flow, this is 5 percent less than scenario 4 in Table I.
I      Phase I, normal operation                 15.5 m3/s, 5.5 oC
2      Phase l, steam turbine bypass              15.5 m'/s, 9.5 oC
3      Phase I & il, both normal operation        31 m3Is, 5 oC
4      Phase I in normal operation and Phase ll in
bypass operation                          31 m3/s, 6.5 oC
Table 1: Discharge rates (communicated by ESG in a telefax on 16 September 1999)
The lowest cooling water dilution near the plant is expected to occur in February - April, where data
(from 1993/94) shown in /I/ indicate that the net flow can become nil for short periods of time (i.e.
some days), whereby the heat balance off the plant becomes determined by a pure tidal flow.
General consideratfons
The following general aspects are noted:
For a given plant capacity and power generation technology, the amount of waste heat is largely a
fixed quantity. Economic and environmental considerations both point at a high plant efficiency (with
a favourable ratio between electricity production and waste heat production). Both considerations
indicate a prudent generation technology, which is the only way to confine the basic waste heat
production.
The amount of waste heat released to the aquatic environment can be reduced by extraordinary means,
such as cooling ponds, cooling towers, multiport diffusors, OT increasing the cooling water flow
excessively. Such means will reduce the over-all plant efficiency. Hereby, they inevitably imply both
increased operation costs and negative environmental side effects. In general, they should only be
selected if they are necessary for operational reasons, and only after ajoint assessment of
environmental impacts to the aquatic environment and in general. Otherwise, such means are not
recommended.
If delineating a mixing zone around an outfall, the critical (instantaneous, single point) temperature
increase will occur at-the surface, at the point where the cooling water plume axis intersects the
mixing zone boundary. If applying a 'minimum' dilution (ora 'maximum' excess temperature)
criterion, the critical temperature will occur for short periods of time only. (In theory, once in the
lifetime of the plant, while in practice, a couple of days per year).
When a critical temperature is defined in this way, compliance is easy to monitor. This is a good
practical objective, and the reason why a mixing zone is considered at all.
In return, however, the criterion is not well related to the environmental impact. The criterion can



3
safeguard against direct temperature effects outside of the mixing zone (and will in many cases be
overly conservative in this respect), but it does not indicate very much about temperature effects in
general. From an environmental point of view, it makes no sense at all to apply a general temperature
limit. What can be entirely harmless at one location can be critical elsewhere.
The World Bank Guidelines (page 9) define the mixing zone as the zone of initial mixing and
dilution. This zone is characterised by the heat transport being influenced by the discharge velocity
and the outfall dimensions. Characteristic transport mechanisms are jet entrainment and buoyancy
spread, while heat dissipation to the atmosphere plays a minor role, because it proceeds over a longer
time scale. The excess temperature at the edge of the mixing zone can be influenced by heat
accumulation and recirculation, but these effects are difficult to monitor.
Preliminary evaluation
According to the Terms of Reference quoted above, there are no indications of sensitive aquatic
ecosystems near the plant site. It is assumed that compliance with the World Bank Guidelines /2/ is
explicitly intended, for administrative or other reasons.
Based on information supplied by ESG, and the results of the 1997 study /1/, a preliminary evaluation
can be summarised as follows:
i     A mixing zone around the outfall can (and should) be defined as per the World Bank
Guidelines in connection with the present study. With the present plant design, the general
criterion stipulated in the Guidelines for cases where a mixing zone is not defined cannot be
met for Scenarios 2, X and 4, and probably not for Scenario 1.
2      The mixing zone should be delineated with the understanding that excess temperatures above
3 OC are acceptable outside of the mixing zone in a small part of the time (say I percent of the
time). Otherwise, the mixing zone becomes excessively large, and entirely unrelated to any
impact, because the excess temperature in the major part within such a large area would be
below any practical concern in most of the time.
3      Provided that a suitable mixing zone be defined, compliance with the World Bank mixing
zone criterion is not expected to require any comprehensive amendments of the planned once-
through cooling water system.
4      Recirculation is explicitly omitted in the scope of the present study, but must be taken into
account as a contribution to the excess temperature at the edge of the mixing zone. In the dry
season, when the flow is reversed by the tide, there will be a significant recirculation, as
clearly shown by the 1997 study. Results of that study should be taken as a qualitative
indication only, because the plant layout has been changed in the meantime. For a given heat
disposal, the recirculation will be related to the discharge velocity (which should assure a
suitable initial spread of the cooling water across the river), and to the spacing between intake
and outfall.
5      If it has not already been done, it should be evaluated whether the dry season flow past the
plant site is likely to diminish in the lifetime of the plant, for example due to planned
irrigation withdrawals. Extended periods of negligible net flow coinciding with high ambient
water temperatures might possibly affect the plant efficiency, the aquatic environment, and
the compliance with any mixing zone criterion to be applied.

considered, but should be kept in mind, if relevant.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Aquatic Environment Evaluation
The AES Meghnaghat Power Station will use the Meghna River as the source for once through cooling
water. The following analyses examine the potential effects associated with modifications to water
circulation patterns, entrainment and impingement of aquatic organisms at the intake structure, and warm
water discharge.
1. Design Parameters
The power plant has been designed to withdraw and treat a maximum of 743 m3/day (0.0086 m3/sec) of
water from the Meghna River for use as process water. The process water will be utilised for plant
operations including make-up water for the Heat Recovery Steam Generators, make-up water for the
closed cooling water system, potable water, and other services in the plant.
The power plant will also withdraw approximately 15.5 m3/sec (56,000 m3/hr), of water from the Meghna
River for the once-through cooling water system. After passing through the condensers the cooling water
will be discharged approximately one kilometre downstream of the water intake. Under normal operating
conditions the cooling water will experience a maximumn temperature rise of 5.5°C in the steam
condenser. Should the power plant operate in steam generator by-pass mode, the temperature rise through
the condenser will be 9.5°C. Treated waste process water will be discharged with the cooling water.
The average annual minimum discharge of the Meghna River, recorded by the Bangladesh Water
Development Board during the years 1990 through 1995 is 1,987 m3/sec. This minimum discharge
typically occurs during the last week of November. During low flow periods the Meghna River becomes
tidal and experiences bi-directional flows.
2. Water Circulation Patterns
No significant effects are expected to occur on river water circulation patterns due to the operation of the
water intake or discharge of the cooling water. The cooling water system has a design flow of 15.5
m3/sec, which represents 0.78% of the average annual minimum discharge rate of the Meghna River. At
other times of the year the flow of the cooling system is insignificant compared to the flow of the river.
There may be some localized effects on turbidity levels in the immediate vicinity of the water intake and
discharge including increased turbidity from the discharge, alter existing aquatic flora and fauna habitats,
or disrupt migratory patterns of some aquatic species.
Turbidity levels are expected to increase in the vicinity of the discharge point immediately following start
of operations. The increased turbidity is, however, expected return to pre-operation conditions once the
river substrate has stabilized to the new (localized) circulation patterns. The short term increase in
turbidity is not expected to has a significant effect on aquatic life as, like most major rivers in Bangladesh
which originate in the Himalayas, the Meghna River is a major vehicle for sediment transportation.
Consequently, it is a highly turbid river (e.g., turbidity ranges from 18-28 NTU). It is anticipated that any
increase in turbidity from the power plant discharge will be temporary and minor.
The power plant water intake and discharge system is not expected to interfere with the movement of
resident or migratory fish. Any minor change in water circulation patterns will be limited to the area
immediately adjacent to the intake and discharge structures, allowing sufficient room for fish movement
outside of the affected areas.

3. Entrainment and Impingement of Aquatic Organisms
Operation of cooling water intake can adversely affect aquatic organisms by entrainment or impingement.  X
Entrainment is the intake of organisms along with the cooling water into the cooling water system.
Impingement involves the trapping of larger organisms against a physical barrier due to the force of the
water flow (U.S. EPA, 1977a).
Entrainment
Depending upon the size of bar screen and intake flow velocity, entrainment typically involves small
organisms including phytoplankton and zooplankton, fish eggs and larvae, shellfish larvae, and other
small aquatic organisms (Cada, 1990). Injury and mortality to entrained organisms occurs by:
*  mechanical damage such as physical contact with pumps, pipes, and condensers;
*  pressure damage caused by passing through pumps;
*  shear damage resulting from organisms entering intersections between two high-velocity flows in
different directions;
*  thermal damage related to elevated temperatures in condenser passage;
*  cavitation damage caused by vapour pockets imploding near organisms; and
*  toxicity damage caused by exposure to biocides and other corrosives injected into the cooling
water to prevent scaling and fouling in pipes and equipment (Eicher, 1988; Ferguson, 1993).
Calculations were undertaken to determine the intake flow velocity at the mouth of the intake channel .
The Calculations were based upon the equation:
V = F/A
where:
V = flow velocity
F = intake flow rate
A = channel mouth area
Using the established intake flow rate of 15.5 m3/s and an intake channel area of 54 m2 (i.e., 12 m wide
and 4.5 m deep at the mouth of the intake at the lowest water level in the Meghna River), the flow
velocity has been calculated at 0.29 m/s.
Studies from North America indicate that adult fish such as carp, suckers, and bass, are capable of
sustained speeds' ranging from 0.0 - 0.4 m/s, prolonged speeds of 0.4 - 1.6 mls, and burst speeds ranging
from 1.6 - 3.1 mls. More active adult fish, such as trout and salmon, are capable of sustained speeds
ranging from 0.0 - 2.7 mIs, prolonged speeds of 2.7 - 4.2 m/s, and burst speeds of 4.2 m/s - 6.8 n/s
(DFO, 1992; Stuber et al., 1982). It is anticipated that fish species found in the Meghna River occupying
ecological niches and exhibiting body shapes similar to the fish studies in North America would have
similar swimming capabilities. Based on these data, it is expected that fish found in the Meghna will be
capable of sustained speeds greater than the intake flow velocity, and therefore able to avoid entrainment.
Younger fish (e.g., juveniles) are also expected to be capable of burst speeds sufficient to escape the
intake flow velocity
It is anticipated that intake flow velocity will increase gradually between the main river channel and the
mouth of the intake channel, creating a buffered area between normal river velocities and the maximum
intake velocity. Fish entering the buffer are will be able to sense and avoid the increased flow rate of the
cooling weather intake.
Sustained speed can be maintained indefinitely. Prolonged speed can be maintained for up to 200 minutes. Burst
speed can be maintained for up to 165 seconds.

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Drift organisms (e.g., phytoplankton and zooplankton) and other aquatic organisms lacking sufficient
burst speed to avoid the intake but are small enough to pass through the bar screens will become entrained
within the intake water. It is assumed that there will be 100% mortality of the individual aquatic
organisms that pass through the cooling water system. However, the loss of these individuals is not
expected to have a significant effect on the populations of these organisms in the river, since plankton
communities reproduce quickly and there is a large population from which to recruit new individuals
(Powell, 1989).
Impingement
Bar screens will be used to prevent debris and other large objects from entering the cooling water system.
However, aquatic organisms larger than the screen size can become impinged against these screens.
Impingement can be lethal to aquatic organisms due to starvation, exhaustion, asphyxiation, or exposure
to descaling or rake mechanisms (USEPA, 1976). To minimize impingement
In order to reduce lethality related to impingement, the water intake for the power plant has been designed
with the following features:
*  a low approach velocity of <0.3 n/sec which will allow most aquatic organisms to swim away
from the intake channel to avoid impingement;
*  a short intake channel which will minimize the trapping of organisms in the forebay of the intake
structure;
*  bar screens consisting of a smooth woven mesh to prevent injury to impinged organisms; and
*  a removal system for impinged organisms to safely return them to the river.
Considering the intake flow velocity, swimming capabilities of fish, and design characteristics of the
intake channel, the potential for mortality related to impingement will be low.
4. Cooling Water Discharge
An assessment of the potential effects of the power plant's cooling water discharge system has been
undertaken based upon the U.S. EPA guidelines for once through cooling water systems (U.S. EPA,
1977b). These guidelines outline decision criteria to determine if the effects associated with a thermal
discharge are acceptable.
Decision criteria are a series of concerns specific for each major trophic or taxonomic group present in the
aquatic ecosystem. These are phytoplankton, zooplankton, habitat formers, shellfish, and fish. . Each of
these criteria is discussed below.
Phytoplankton and Zooplankton
Plankton are the rminute aquatic plant (phytoplankton2) and animal (zooplankton) species that either have
limited powers of locomotion or drift in the water at the discretion of waves and currents. Plankton, in
the Meghna River will be exposed to heated and chemically treated wastewater effluent. Due to their
limited motility, some plankton will be unable to avoid the thermal plume as they move with the rivers
currents pass the discharge location.
The U.S. EPA decision criteria for assessing effects on phytoplankton includes:
* no shift towards nuisance species of phytoplankton will occur; and
* there will be no appreciable harm to the balanced indigenous population due to induced
changes in plankton community caused by the effluent discharge.
2VPhytoplankon are plant microorganisms that live unattached in the water.
Zooplankton are animal microorganisms that also live unattached in the water.

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The U.S. EPA decision criteria for assessing effects on zooplankton include:
*  the therrnal plume will not constitute a lethal barrier to the drift of zooplankton;
*  the heated discharge will not alter the standing crop and relative abundance of the various
species composing the natural populations;
*  there will be no appreciable harm to the balanced indigenous population of fish and shellfish
due to induced changes in the zooplankton community.
These five decision criteria listed above can be addressed by reviewing the thermal plume configuration
in relation to the characteristics of the Meghna River and previous studies related to the biological effects
of once-through cooling water systems.
Numerical therrnal plume modelling was conducted for the proposed power plant (Appendix J3). The
critical time period for modeling was determined to be the seasonal low flow period that corresponds to
the dry season. During the wet season the thermal discharge is rapidly assimilated into the relatively large
flow of the river and poses no concern for effects to aquatic life. The balance of this discussion focuses on
the effects of the thermal discharge during the dray season.
In accordance with World Bank Guidelines the thermal plume was considered to extend to the point
where the temperature has cooled to 33°C above ambient (the 3°C isotherm). The modeling predicts that
during normnal operations the 3 °C isotherm will extend approximately 100 m downstream from the
discharge port and about 100 m out into the river. As the river is about 1 km wide the plume does not
constitute a lethal barrier to the drift of zooplankton.
The Utility Water Act Group (UWAG) conducted studies on 25 U.S. power plants that use once through
cooling water systems. The power plants studied ranged in size from 240 to 1,642 MW, with design
discharge volumes ranging from 9.45 to 84.5 m3/s, and temperature increases of 5.6°C and 18.0°C. The
design parameters of the proposed Meghnaghat power plant fall within the lower range of the study.
The UWAG (1978) study found no evidence indicating a shift in the phytoplankton population towards
nuisance species; alteration in the standing crop and relative abundance of the zooplankton species; or any
appreciable harm to the balanced indigenous population of shellfish and fish due to induced changes in
the plankton conmmunity caused by discharge of cooling water. The minimal impacts to the plankton
community, from once-through cooling systems, has been attributed to their short generation time, high
reproductive capacity, and proximity to a large population capable of recruit replacements. It is expected
that these results are applicable to the AES Meghnaghat Power Station, and that there will be no
significant effect on plankton or on fish as a result of the cooling water discharge.
Habitat Formers
Habitat formers are any assemblage of plants and/or animals characterized by a relatively sessile life stage
with aggregated distribution and function as: living substrate, food source for shellfish and fish, nutrient
cycling path or trap, contributing to soil development, or as spawning or nursery areas for fish or
shellfish. No such habitat formers are present within the 100 m extent of the thermal plume. The area
affected is primarily the shoreline of the filled MPSA area, which has been hardened for protection
against water erosion.
Shellfish
Shellfish include molluscs and crustaceans (e.g., shrimp/prawns, crayfish, crabs, oysters, and clams) that,
in the course of their life cycle, constitute important components of the benthic or planktonic fauna. The
UJS EPA decision criteria for shellfish include:
*  no appreciable harm to the balanced indigenous populations - no reduction in the standing crop;
*  maintenance of existing fauna diversity;
ESG INTERNATIONAL INC                                                                  J4 - 4

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
* no harm to shellfish passing through the thermal plume; and
a  no impact to spawning and nursery sites for important shellfish.
The small aerial extent of the thermal plume is not expected to result in any appreciable effect on he
shellfish population size or diversity. Most species are mobile and will move away for any deleterious
thermal conditions. Similarly, the plume is not expected to have a significant effect on shellfish passing
through it, as its area extent is normally relatively small (100 m).
The MPSA area is not a prime spawning area for shellfish, thus no significant effects on spawning or
nursery sites are expected.
Fish
The US EPA decision criteria for fish is that no appreciable harmn to the fish communities will occur from:
*  direct or indirect mortality from cold shocks;
*  direct or indirect mortality from excess heat;
*  reduced reproductive success or growth as a result of plant discharge;
* exclusion from unacceptably large areas; or
b blockage of migration.
Cold shock is a phenomenon that occurs in temperate climates where the ambient water temperature is
low compared to the temperature of the discharge water. Fish can be shocked when the cooling water
discharge is cut following shut down of the power plant. The effect is not expected in sub-tropic regions
such as Bangladesh.
Given the relatively small size of the thermal plume no harm to fish communities is expected due to
6.t         excess heat, exclusion, or blockage. Similarly, a reduction in reproductive success or growth is not likely
to occur as a result of thermal discharge given its small size, existing river dimensions, and lack of
spawning and nursery habitat in the area within the 3 °C isotherm.
No effects are expected on any VTE fish species, such as Torta, Labea nandina, as these do not appear to
be present in the Meghna.
The starch of the Meghna is also not prime breeding area for major conmmercial species such as Hilsa.
Therefore, no significant effects on fish breeding are expected.

RESETrLEMNT ACTION PLAN
AES MEGHNAGHT 450 MW POWER PROJECT
1.    SUMMARY
The AES Meghnaghat Power Project (MPP), Stage I, envisions the construction of a 450 MW
gas-fired, combined cycle power plant project (the "Project"), to be built near Meghnaghat, some
27 km southeast of Dhaka on the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway. The site is a large riverine island
(char), about one kilometre south of the Meghna Bridge (Figure 1). Inundated annually during
the monsoon, the site provided many households with livelihoods in seasonal agriculture and
fishing opportunities.

Meghnaghat is emerging as an industrial centre in this part of the country. Construction, cement,
chemicals, and paper mills are already in place, with additional industries currently buying up land
in the area.
The Government of Bangladesh (GOB), through the Office of the Deputy Commissioner (DC)
Narayanganj, acquired the site for the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) in 1996.
However, the BPDB did not make any efforts to occupy the site until March 1999 when they
retained a site preparation contractor to undertake site filling and compaction works. After
completion of the site preparation works, the BPDB handed over the elevated land to the Project
Sponsor (i.e., AES Meghnaghat Limited) on May 26, 2000 free of all encumbrances.

Under the provisions of the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) guidelines
15.22 (b)], and the Land Lease Agreement (LLA) between the Project Sponsor and the BPDB, the
Project Sponsor is not responsible for any activities relating to acquisition of the land or its
development. As per the terms of the LLA, the BPDB was obligated to make available 70 acres of
land, elevated to one meter above the highest flood level, to the Project Sponsor.
The data used in this Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) were collected in a field Baseline Census,
which established the affected population, and a subsequent comprehensive Household Income
Survey of the affected population. The data included in the RAP are still in the process of
verification. It is apprehended that many PAPs on the lands for Stage II and IlIl power
development are mistakenly counted as Project Affected Persons (PAPs) of Stage I, and in many
cases the same PAP may be counted in two or more categories of PAPs. As a result, the
numbers of PAPs shown under each category are expected to decline following the field
verification and checking process during RAP implementation.
The land acquisition for MPP Stage I, the access- road to the site, and the Regulating and
Metering Station (RMS), has had an impact on approximately 544 households. The major losses
resulting from the development of the Stage I lands are summarized as follows:
1.    The permanent loss of 0.20 acres of homestead land owned by four households. This
loss entails the loss of five dwellings, 12 homestead trees, and crops (e.g., melons,
gourds, squash, etc.).
2.    The permanent loss of 50.81 acres of privately-owned agricultural land.
3.    Permanent loss of access to 27.40 acres of government-owned land (khas), part of which
was leased out to cultivating households. Some 25 households, who were a mix of
influential people and squatters, informally held the remaining portion.
4.    The immediate loss of access to land and water resources by landowners, leaseholders,
tenants, renters (bandhakee), field labour (bandha), and households involved in,
community fishing enterprises using the large fish traps Uhop).
Table 1.1 provides a detailed summary of losses involved with BPDB's land acquisition for the
Meghnaghat Stage I, the Titas' RMS, and the BPDB access road, which is a common facility to all
the stages at Meghnaghat.

A this includes 8.21 acres of land acquired for the access road and RMS. Private land acquired for the
Stage I power station land is 42.60 acres.
The Project Sponsor will provide supplementary assistance to the PAPs as shown in Table 1.2
below. The three general areas of supplementary assistance will include:
1. Priority in construction jobs for Project affectees. Based upon an ID card system, one per
affected household, the Project Sponsor will ask the Construction Contractor to hire first
from among the Project affectees, if the PAPs are found qualified for such jobs in
construction.
2. Scholarship Programme for Vocational Skills Training for affected households losing
twenty percent (20%) or more of their annual income or affected households whose
yearly income falls below the Country's official poverty line' in effect at the time of
baseline survey. Each such household is eligible for a scholarship for one family member
Bangladesh's poverty line at the time of the Baseline Census was defined as Taka 1,500 per month or Taka
18,000 per year.

to attend a vocational skills training facility in Sonargaon, Narayanganj, or Dhaka. One
purpose of the training is to provide affected households with the necessary skills to find
jobs in the new, burgeoning industrial centre at Meghnaghat. The underlying objective is
to permanently replace livelihoods lost due to land taking by the BPDB the and to provide
affected rural social groups with a stepping-stone to the next stage of macro economic
development in the region.
3. The Project Sponsor will cooperatively undertake construction of an elementary school at
Islampur for education of the children of the villagers and provide financial assistance for
construction of an earthen access road to Islampur Village. The PAPs will be responsible
for identifying and providing the land for these facilities.
In addition to the above assistance to the PAPs, the Project Sponsor will construct one small land
based or floating hospital equipped with primary health care and treatment facilities. Preference
will be given to floating type to provide service to people of wider areas including the PAPs. The
exact configuration is currently under study.

The RAP will be implemented by the Project Sponsor to the extent identified as its scope of
responsibility. The sponsor's Community Liaison Officer (CLO) will be responsible for
implementing the plan. The CLO will report to the Project Sponsor's Project Manager at the site
during the construction period, and will settle disputes over eligibility, assistance, and other
matters in the RAP.
As noted, the Project Sponsor will recommend to the Construction Contractor and subcontractors
to first hire Project affectees for work in the construction of the Project. The Project affectee
households will be identifiable through picture ID cards to be issued by the Project Sponsor.
The Project Sponsor will appoint the senior officer of AES Meghnaghat Limited, as Project
Oversight and Monitoring Officer (POMO). The POMO will oversee all key functions of the RAP
and certify that these were made according to the RAP. The POMO will make scheduled reports
to the appropriate authorities in the GOB, IDCOL, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

2.    STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Design of the Project Sponsor's supplementary assistance program has had regard for the
objectives contained in the Environment and Social Framework (ESF) of IDCOL (1997), the
World Bank's Operational Directive (OD) 4.30, Involuntary Resettlement, and the ADB's
Summary of the Handbook on Resettlement, (1998). This RAP had regard for the IDCOL
guidelines, in part because IDCOL is participating in the financing package of the MPP, and in
part because these guidelines are the most complete and recent of any accepted by an entity of
the GOB. In essence, the IDCOL guidelines adopt those of the World Bank Group, such that
there is very little difference between these and OD 4.30.
2.1    Objectives and Principles
As OD 4.30 notes, "the content and level of detail of resettlement plans will vary with
circumstances, especially the magnitude of resettlement,". This RAP has been designed to
support the people affected by land taking by the BPDB, as part of the Project Sponsor's social
responsibility program. Common objectives and principles regarding this RAP include:
1. Since some impacts are unavoidable, appropriate mitigation plans should be developed.
Affected persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their former living standards,
income eaming capacity, and production levels, or at least to restore them. Particular
attention should be given to the needs of the poorest groups affected.
2. The absence of a formal legal title to land by some affected groups will not be a bar to
access to assistance offered by the Project Sponsor under this RAP; particular attention will
be paid to households headed by women, and appropriate assistance will be provided to
help them improve their status. In Bangladesh, this means that sharecroppers and long-
term day labourers on privately owned land, and leaseholders on govemment-owned land
(khas), are eligible for compensation under IDCOL, World Bank Group, and ADB
guidelines.
3. Community participation in planning and implementing resettlement should be encouraged.
Wherever appropriate, existing social and cultural institutions should be used to assist in
resettlement design and implementation.
The ESF provided by IDCOL presents its own matrix showing social impacts and entitlements for
1DCOL financed Projects. This framework matrix is discussed below as it is applied to the MPP.
2.2  Implications of Objectives for the Meghnaghat Project
Given the history and evolution of the land acquisition by the BPDB for the site, not all adverse,
impacts were avoidable. This RAP provides practical assistance with regard for the objectives of
the guidelines noted above and permitted within the budget of the Project Sponsor's Social
Responsibility Programme.
Before the RAP study was initiated, the Deputy Commissioner of Narayanganj had finalized land
acquisition process and BPDB been developed the project site by the filling of river sand up to a
depth of six to seven meters. Site filling was done under a contract between the BPDB and the
Chinese firm, China National Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Corporation
(CWHEC). The Project Sponsor is simply leasing the Stage I lands, as prepared by the BPDB
and their Contractor, under the terms and conditions of the LLA. The LLA also included
provisions for the construction of a site access road, which also required the acquisition of land by
the BDPB.
In the area of acquired land, the filling of the site precluded a cadastraVplot survey of the site as
part of the process to confirm and validate landownership and leaseholdership. These both are
necessary to construct a completely reliable baseline census of people (e.g., owners,

leaseholders, tenants/sharecroppers, day labour) affected by the land taking and to ensure the
right people have access to the supplementary assistance program.
2.2.1  Brief Description of the Project
The MPP is part of a power generation development programme in the private sector initiated by
the GOB under their private sector power generation policy introduced in 1996. According to the
1995 Power System Master Plan (PSMP), the BPDB proposed to develop a 450 MW generating
capacity as the first stage at Meghnaghat, to be on-line by the year 2001. A Request for Proposal
(RFP) for a 300 to 450 MW gas-fired, combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power project, to be
constructed on a Build, Own, and Operate (BOO) basis, was issued in March 1997 by the Board.
On June 24, 1998, the AES Corporation, USA, was declared the first-ranked bidder and on
February 4, 1999, AES Meghnaghat Limited was incorporated. Thereafter, the project took legal
shape through execution of the following agreements on July 29, 1999:
+ Power Purchase Agreement with the BPDB
+ Land Lease Agreement with BPDB
* Implementation Agreement with the GOB
+ Gas Supply Agreement with Titas
Two years prior to the issuance of the RFP for Stage I, the BPDB formally acquired the land for
all three stages at Meghnaghat (i.e., 230.77 acres), which included 145.515 acres of private land
and 85.255 acres of government land. Land was acquired under the country's relevant law of
expropriation, namely the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982
("Ordinance"). Under this Ordinance, the Deputy Commissioner of Narayanganj District instituted
eminent domain proceedings to acquire the land. The Office of the Deputy Commissioner notified
Section 3 of the case on December 28, 1995 and on May 14, 1997 formally took possession of
the site. Compensation payments were begun at that time by the Deputy Commissioner of
Narayanganj on behalf of the GOB. However, the BPDB did not make any effort to occupy the
land until March 1999, when site filling activities were initiated. Until that time, the pre-existing
landowners and leaseholders continued to cultivate the area.
The Project Sponsor initiated steps for the completion of an Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) for the project in July 1999. As part of the EIA exercise, this RAP was undertaken as part of
the Project Sponsor's due diligence process for its principal lender, IDCOL, and as part of the
Project Sponsor's own Social Responsibility Programme.
2.2.2 The Project Site
The project site is located at Char Ramzan Sonaullah in the list of revenue estates (mauzas)
Sonargaon Thana of Narayanganj District. Out of the 230.77 acres of acquired land by the BPDB,
70 acres have been leased to the Project Sponsor under the LLA. At the expiry of the LLA term
(i.e., 22 years), this land will be returned to the BPDB. The Project Sponsor took over 62.02 acres
(i.e., the Demised Premises) of the leased land from the BPDB on May 26, 2000 for location of
the power station and the remaining 7.98 acres (i.e., the Demised Corridor) on July 20, 2000 for
location of the cooling water discharge channel.
Char Ramzan Sonaullah is affected by monsoon inundation, as are most areas of Bangladesh.
The char was submerged during the annual summer inundation for three to four months, not fully
emerging until November. Once it emerged from the summer high water, local farmers began to
cultivate the land, starting along the riverbank and working down as the water receded, until they
could plant paddy on the lower bench. The land was also used to house and feed livestock
during the period. During the summer monsoon, Char Ramzan Sonaullah was used as a ground
for fishing, as are most low lying areas of the country that are seasonally inundated by flood water
coming from the upriver.

RESETLEMMNT ACTION PLAN
AES MEGHNAGHT 450 MW POWER PROJECr
Those who farmed Char Ramzan Sonaullah live in the nearby villages (gram). Only one of these
villages, Islampur, which lies along the bank of the main river, is contiguous to the project site.
The others lie on raised ground along the back channels to the west and north. Some of the
villages (e.g., Ganganagar and Jauchar), are in the revenue estate (mauza) of Char Ramzan
Sonaullah. Other villages are in different mauzas. Like the roads in the region and the industrial
area clustered around the western terminus of the Meghna Bridge, these inhabited areas
normally remain above the summer high water, often by only a few feet. The inherent fertility of
the land and the richness of the water bodies, coupled with the extraordinary population density,
make for a rural socio-ecology where small parcels of land support many households, albeit often
at a bare subsistence level. Even though Char Ramzan Sonaullah was only seasonally
cultivable, it provided several hundred households with sustenance in crops and fish, and to a
lesser extent, livestock.
The BPDB land acquisition had impacts on those households whose livelihoods depend either
wholly or in part on agriculture and fishing on the land. The BPDB mitigated these impacts in
accordance with the Bangladesh Law and compensated landowners with an additional 50%
premium above the value of the land determined under the law. As the mitigation under
Bangladesh Law is only monetary, and entitles only those who have legal title on the land, many
other groups of people such as wage labourers, sharecroppers, yearly lease holders, and
unauthorised cultivators on govemment land, who did not have any formal title on the land, were
not entitled to any compensation under Bangladesh law. The Project Sponsor, under its Social
Responsibility Program, is proposing supplemental measures to assist the PAPs affected by the
BPDB's land purchase through the GOB, in restoration of their lost income. The RAP focuses
upon providing assistance in areas that would produce long-term benefits to the PAPs. As the
people have been mainly affected in their livelihood through loss of access to cultivable land and
fishing grounds, the main target of the RAP is to improve their living condition, either through
temporary employment in construction and/or by providing means for alternative employment
through a vocational skills training programme.
2.3    Social Impact and Entitlement Framework
Table 2.1 outlines the entitlements for the various PAPs under the RAP. The loss of various
assets has been mitigated by the BPDB through the Deputy Commissioner of Narayanganj and is
therefore, excluded from the entitlements of this RAP. The Project Sponsor will implement
supplemental measures under the RAP permitted within the budget of its Social Responsibility
Programme.

2.4 Implementation Strategy
The entitlements in the RAP are designed to protect current livelihoods where possible and to
provide for altemative means for future livelihoods. Where there are permanent losses, the
supplementary assistance program should assist the PAPs in restoring and/or increasing their
livelihoods. Possible jobs during construction will help households losing land to restore an
income stream while looking for alternative sources of income. All affectee households losing
20% or more of their annual income will have access to the vocational skills training programme,
which should add the kind of skills to PAP households that increasingly are in demand as the
area industrialises. Additionally, PAP households whose annual income is below the poverty line
will also have access to the vocational skills training programme and possible jobs during
construction.
Thus far in the project, land has been acquired and compensated in cash under the law of
Bangladesh.  Cash compensation (or cash for land) is less desirable than land for land
compensation, as cash can rarely replace land as a permanent resource.  Unfortunately,
Bangladesh has no excess land. Government land (khas) is leased out and to use this land --
even if available -- to compensate landholders would cast the existing leaseholders adrift, which
did not seem much of a solution. PAP households do not always use cash compensation to
invest in income-producing activities, although to date a surprising number have put their
compensation to productive uses (Table 2.2).

the compensation to further his business interests by building a commercial cold storage.

RESEITLEMNT ACTION PLAN
AES MEGHNAGHT 450 MW POWER PROJECT
2.4.1  Responsibility for Mitigation Under Land Acquisition
According to the various agreements underlying this project and the guidelines pertaining thereto,
the Project Sponsor is not responsible for any aspect of the acquisition of land. The land taking
for the MPP, to some extent, compares with guideline 5.22 (b) of IDCOL's ESF:
The counterpart government agency, under a formnal agreement with the Project Sponsor,
arranges to acquire the land under local land acquisition procedures and transfer it free of
all encumbrances to the Project Sponsor. In such cases, since mitigation measures need
to be completed before transfer of land, the cost of mitigation would initially be bome by
the counterpart government agency. However, the cost could be reimbursed to the
govemment agency or could form the govemment equity in the project. Mitigation would
still need to be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the ESF.
The counterpart govemment agency, the BPDB, as per condition of the RFP for the project,
acquired and developed the iand at its own cost, and leased it to the Project Sponsor under the
LLA. Land transfer to the Project Sponsor was never envisaged. The BPDB owns the land and
will eam an annual rent from the Project Sponsor against use of the land. In addition, the LLA
guarantees that the land for the project will be provided free of all encumbrances and, specifically,
that it has provided compensation to all displaced persons. In Section 4.1 (I) of the LLA, the
BPDB affirms that:
It has provided adequate compensation (as required under the Laws of Bangladesh) to
all persons:
i. who may have been displaced;
ii. whose land may have been acquired; or
.iii whose livelihood may have been affected;
when the Demised Premises, the Demised Corridor, and the Access Road were
acquired.
As noted below in Section 6 of this RAP, the Laws of Bangladesh require compensation for
private land taken for public purposes. The laws do not, however, provide for compensation to
non-landowning groups whose livelihoods may, nevertheless, be affected by land taking under
the laws of eminent domain. In Bangladesh, most commonly, these social groups are tenants,
renters, and field labourers.
Since the BPDB is the owner of the land acquired for the project, making up the losses for land
and livelihood is the responsibility of the BPDB and the Government. Through the implementation
of this RAP, the Project Sponsor is volunteering to share part of such responsibility under its
Social Responsibility Programme. This RAP is an effort towards alleviating the impacts arising
from the land taking for the project.
For its part, the Project Sponsor is committing to provide assistance to those households who
have depended upon the land and water resources of the site for their livelihood. The groups
who did not have any recourse under Bangladesh law are mainly the non-landowning groups,
who have sustained losses to their livelihoods, will get priority in the assistance offered by the
Project Sponsor. Such non-landowning groups include the following:
* Tenants or Sharecroppers: those with a formal tenancy relationship to the landowner
or leaseholder;
*  Sub-Lessors on Private or Leased Land: those with some form of informal tenancy or
mortgage arrangement (bandhakee, bondoq) with the landowner or leaseholder,
whether written or oral. This kind of arrangement allows the sub-lessor the right to
cultivate the land.

RESETTLEMNT ACTION PLAN
AES MEGHNAGHT 450 MW POWER PROJECT
+  Permanent Field Labor (bandha): those with long-standing, customary obligations to
provide work in the fields for a landowner. This is distinct from temporary, migratory
labour (bodli).
*  Jhop Fisherfolk: those who used to fish on the site land for at least a portion of their
incomes, whether as individual households or through community efforts.
The MPP will provide jobs for up to 800 persons during the construction of the Project. Many of
these jobs will be for unskilled or semi-skilled workers. The Project Sponsor will recommend to
the Construction Contractor to give preference to the PAP households in hiring for this work.
These jobs should be given on a *first-come, first-serve" basis to PAPs, provided PAPs are
qualified for the jobs. They should not be hired through any outside syndicate or other labour
supply organisation, as these organisations inevitably bring in unnecessarily large numbers of
outsiders and take a significant proportion of the workers daily wage as their fee.
There will be approximately 30 permanent positions at the MPP during the period of operation.
Most of these will be for highly trained managers and engineering personnel. The plant
management will look to the PAP pool to fill jobs such e.g., gardeners and cleaners), but for the
most part the plant normnally will not have need of unskilled or semi-skilled workers.
2.5    Land Acquisition
The land acquisition process has been underway since the issuance of the public notice, by the
Deputy Commissioner on December 28h, 1995, to acquire the land for all three phases of the
Meghnaghat Project. As of July 1999, according to the district administration, approximately 85%
of the cash compensation had been paid to the landowners in the DC's list. The remaining 15
percent has been withheld pending discovery of the true owners of the plots. The Deputy
Commissioner notes that for a portion of the plots in the land record the actual owner is not
known.
According to the Deputy Commissioner, in a meeting on July 28t", 1999, the current position of
the land acquisition and resumption is as follows:
Land Taken:  Total Land:                       230.770 acres
Privately Owned Acquired         145.515 acres
Govemment (khas)Land Resumed      85.255 acres
Valuation           Total:                     55,694,474.83 Taka
Cost of Khas              19,092,857.00
Govt Contingency*          3,885,661.03
Paid to Landowners        24,316,070.97
Balance                    8,399,885.83
'Paid to GOB by the BPDB
The Deputy Commissioner valued two categories of land: (1) average agricultural land (nal or
polizumi) in the site area at 2,240 Taka per decimal (0.01 acre, or 100 decimals in an acre); and
(2) higher level agricultural land (viti) at 3,359 Taka per decimal. This price included a 50%
premium required by law. No separate valuation was made for the homestead land, which
represented a very small area (0.20 acres).
In addition to privately-owned land, the Deputy Commissioner resumed 85.255 acres of
govemment land (khas), which had been leased out on a variety of bases. The Deputy
Commissioner has asked the govemment for a legal finding on whether leaseholders should be
provided with cash compensation for the loss of their leaseholds. This was still pending at the
time of writing.

2.6    Cut-Off Dates and Grievance Procedure
The cut-off date for eligibility for the entitlements under this Resettlement Action Plan is
December 31, 2000. The Baseline Census is founded on the plot, titleholder, and leaseholder
information provided by the district administration and the Project Sponsor. Survey teams
validated this information in the field, reconciled discrepancies in the lists, and filled in blank
landowners (titleholders), such that all plots in the land taking are noted, along with the titleholder
or leaseholder, depending on the status of the land. Further, the field survey teams included the
names of the successors of titleholders in those cases where the titleholder was deceased, or
where a titleholder had retired and informally divided the land among his heirs without making the
requisite change in the land record. Final checking will be completed by October 1, 2000.
In the event that additional claims emerge as to entitlements, or for other disputes pertaining to
the supplementary assistance program as documented in this RAP, the concemed individual(s)
can appeal to the Project Sponsor, through the CLO. The CLO can either examine the claim, ask
a respected elder to validate or reject the claim, or choose some other traditional means of
settlement. If the claimant remains unsatisfied, he or she may appeal to the Chairman of the
Pirozpur Union Council, who, if he believes the claim has merit, may seek a meeting with the
POMO to discuss the matter.

3.    ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
Responsibility for implementing this RAP lies with the Project Sponsor. The Project Sponsor will
initiate assistance activities starting from the time they complete the EIA process and/or begin to
construct the power station.
3.1    Project Oversight and Monitoring Officer
The Project Sponsor will nominate its senior representative at the site during the construction
period as the POMO for all aspects of this RAP. The POMO will monitor all aspects of
supplementary assistance program to ensure this is carried out in accordance with the law and
this RAP. He/she will ensure that the Project Sponsor devotes sufficient resources to perform the
detailed work required under the CLO's job description. Specifically, the POMO will have the
following as his/her Terms of Reference:
1. Monitor labour hiring for the construction of the project to ensure that the PAPs are
given priority.
2. Monitor the vocational skills training programme for the PAPs, to ensure these
arrangements are equitable, practical, and timely.
3. Serve as the final locus of appeal in all disputes involving program entitlements and
all other disputes that result from the implementation of the RAP.
4. Initiates the RAP's project monitoring plan.
3.2    Community Liaison Officer
The Project Sponsor will appoint a CLO from among its staff. The CLO will represent the Project
Sponsor to the community at large. Specifically, with respect to the RAP, the CLO has the
following functions and responsibilities:
1. Functions as the administrative and implementing officer for the RAP.
2.  Functions as the Project Sponsors liaison with PAPs and the wider community in the
project area.
3. Provides all RAP documentation to the POMO.
4. Performs all functions needed to implement the RAP, including setting up meetings
with the PAPs, maintenance of the PAP database, etc.
5. Consuft with the PAPs on all disputes that may arise and attempt to settle such
disputes at this level. All disputes can, of course, be appealed to the POMO.
6. Administer the vocational skills training program.
7. Work with local people and PAPs in participatory formats to elicit their views and
recommendations on the range of project impacts, both anticipated and
unanticipated, and to help guide the Project Sponsor in how it may invest in its own
Social Responsibility Programme.
8. Act as the Project Sponsors liaison with the organisation selected to evaluate the
implementation of the RAP.
3.2.1 Database of Project Affected People
The CLO will maintain the Project Sponsor's Database of Project Affected People. This database
will contain the names of the family members of all households affected by the Stage I project, as
collected by the Baseline Census and Household Income Survey. Any households subsequently
discovered to be affectees through the project grievance procedure will be added to the
database. Employment in construction and benefits provided under the vocational skills training
program will be noted in the database. Information in the database on household incomes will be
kept confidential by the Project Sponsor, except that it should be made available to the group
providing studies under the Monitoring Programme.

3.22  Identification Cards for Project Affected People
A key function of the CLO will be to ensure that the PAPs are identifiable to other concerned
bodies, such as job employment officials, NGOs that may be brought into the vocational skills
training programme, etc. Hence, the adult members of all PAP households entitled to benefits
under this RAP will be provided with a laminated, embossed, picture Identification Card, with the
emboss mark going at least part way through the picture. The number on the card will be the
same as the number in the database. Each number will identify a specific PAP household. The
cards given to adult household members will have a letter, descending through the alphabet, so
that no card is exactly the same. These cards will be made by the Project Sponsor and signed by
the CLO. They will be used to identify those who are eligible for various forms of benefits in the
project.
3.3    Local Government Institutions
The two-tiered system of local government has remained a feature of Bangladesh since the
countrys inception, although considerable experimentation has gone into defining the personnel
and powers of the local govemment bodies. Currently, local govemment functions under the
Local Govemment (Union Panishads) (Amendment) Act, 1993 and the Local Govemment (Zila
Panshad) (Amendment) Bill, 1993.
The Union Parishad (UP) is the lowest tier of government in the rural areas of Bangladesh. Each
UP is divided into nine wards, each of which more or less represents the old village (mauza)
boundaries. The Parishad consists of a Chairman and nine members. The latter are elected one
from each ward. The Chairman is directly elected by the voters of the entire UP on the basis of
adult franchise. In addition, three seats are reserved for women members, who are indirectly
elected by the Chairman and the UP members. The terms of the directly elected members are
for five years.
The UP has a number of important functions, including the maintenance of birth and death
registers, maintenance of law and order through the village police (Ansar Force), the construction
of roads, renovation of ponds, maintenance of markets (hats) and bazaars, and the settlement of
petty local disputes. In addition, the UPs are responsible for encouraging the planting of trees,
motivating people to adopt family planning methods, and promoting cottage industries.
The UP has a limited capacity to raise revenue and lacks its own technical staff. The govemment
permits it to levy fees and taxes on a limited number of resources, although local pressures often
militate against the collection of these revenues.  In addition, the UP is eligible for various
govemment grants, which often are released late. Effective and well-connected Chairmen,
however, can get funds and services for local govemment departments, such as the Local
Govemment Engineering Department (LGED), which builds and fixes village roads, and locally-
based NGOs.
The next tier of representative local govemment is the Zila Parishad (ZP), or District Council,
although in this case all the members are indirectly elected. The ZP comprises a Chairman, male
members and women members. The Chairman is elected by an electoral college consisting of all
the UP Chairmen and members within the jurisdiction of the District. The same electoral college
also elects to make members and one woman member from each Thana within the District.
Terms of office are also for five years.
The Zila Parishads are responsible for the maintenance and extension of district roads, culverts
and water channels in the district. They also have significant functions in health and sanitation,
including mass vaccination, charitable dispensaries, and the cleaning of drains, tanks, reservoirs,
wells, and canals. They are responsible for supplying drinking water in the district, increasingly
via tube wells. Zila Parishads also maintain several types of educational institutions, including
primary schools, technical schools, and industrial schools.

The ZP is dependent upon government grants to carry out its responsibilities.  It has
administrative and technical staffs, headed by a Secretary, who is a civil servant in the Ministry of
Local Government. Formally, decisions are made by the Chairman and elected members, but          )
since these are routed through the Secretary for implementation, the latter has a major role in
how the ZP programmes are administered.
In between the UP level and the ZP, is the Thana, the sub-district level of govemment and the
lowest level of formal administration in Bangladesh. Key administrative functions, such as the
keeping of law and order, the maintenance of land records, and the provision of basic services
occurs at the Thana level. The Thana Executive Officer (TNO, or Thana Nirbahi Officer) heads
the Thana level administration and is responsible in all these functions to the Deputy
Commissioner at the ZP level. The TNO has an interest in any project where land is being
acquired under the rules of eminent domain, or where a law and order situation may arise.
Increasingly, the government has been attempting to concentrate official development functions
at the Thana level and below.  For this purpose, it has formed the Thana Development
Coordination Committee (TDCC, or Thana Unnayan Samannya Committee, TUSC). All UP
Chairmen within the Thana are ex-officio members of the TDCC and all UP schemes are
approved by this committee. The TNO chairs the TDCC, which also has local representatives of
the development ministries. The technical staff of these ministries at the Thana level provide
guidance to Projects initiated at the UP level. The local Member of Parliament may also attend
the meetings of the TDCC.
The current govemment has revived the third tier of local govemment, the Upazila Parishads.
These councils are to be elected at the upazila or thana level. But the government has not yet
declared the date of such election.

4.    COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION
The people and community leaders of the project area have been broadly informed about the
MPP as part of the assessment and survey activities required for producing the EIA and RAP, as
well as contacts scheduled as part of the Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan (PCDP). The
latter process was continued with the scheduling of community at large consultative meetings
after the finalization of the draft EIA report.
With respect to the issues in the RAP, the PAPs have been separately consulted about impacts,
land acquisition and compensation under the eminent domain proceedings of the govemment,
and women's issues. After the finalisation of affectee list, the latter were validated in public
meetings with senior representatives of the affected villages (gram) present. Subsequently, the
PAPs were consulted about the preliminary supplementary assistance program and the social
arrangements for this RAP. Table 4.1 summarizes the community meetings held to finalize the
RAP.

5.     BASELINE CENSUS AND HOUSEHOLD INCOME SURVEY
The PAPs were identified through the Baseline Census. This census was based upon
information on land acquisition and resumption provided by the district administration, as well as
on fieldwork to fill in and validate gaps in the record provided by the govemment. In addition, a
survey was undertaken to identify the jhop fishing households on Char Ramzan Sonaullah.
These households also are part of the Baseline Census. These activities resulted in the
construction of a database of PAPs, listed by household head and household members, fathers
name, address, and loss. The baseline census forms the basis for determining eligibility to the
supplementary assistance program.
All households in the Baseline Census were surveyed in a Household Income Survey. The
purpose of the Household Income Survey was to quantify projected losses to household incomes,
whether permanently or temporarily, due to the construction and operation of the Stage I power
station. This means both actual losses, as well as losses as a proportion of household income
from all sources. The Project Sponsor will maintain the detailed Household Income Survey
database for future monitoring of the impacts of the Project, while protecting the privacy of certain
information, such as household incomes.
5.1    Loss of Homestead Land and Homes
Although it was originally thought that no homestead land and housing would be affected by the
acquisition of land for the Meghnaghat site, field surveys for this RAP found this not to be the
case. During the survey some households displaced by the floods of 1988 and 1998 also
established claims with the field surveyors for the loss of homestead lands, houses, trees, and
other homestead assets. However, field verification indicates that 0.20 acres (i.e., 20.0 decimals)
of homestead land was acquired, which provided separate housing for four households, living in
or using five structures.
Table 5.1 provides the details of the homestead land and houses lost in the land acquisition and
site construction procedures. This data was collected in the field, but because this area had
disappeared under fill material, the information was reconstructed from interviews with the
affectees and other knowledgeable individuals: It appears to present an accurate picture, as
nothing in the data is unusual or non-commensurate with existing pattems in the site area.

5.2   Loss of Other Physical Assets
In addition to the loss of homes and homestead land, these households lost assets associated
with their homesteads. For the most part, these were various kinds of trees or other immovable
properties, all of which represented a resource to the household, as well as vegetable crops in
kitchen gardens or as vines. Table 5.2 details these physical assets.

5.3.1  Private Landowners and Leaseholders on Khas Land
A total of 70 acres of land was leased to the Project Sponsor for power station development, of
which private landowners owned 42.60 acres and the remaining 27.40 acres was owned by the
govemment. In addition to this land, the access road built by the BPDB, as a common facility for
all phase developers of MPP, resulted in the acquisition of an additional 6.49 acres of private land
while land acquired by Titas for the RMS required another 1.72 acres of privately owned land. All
told, the land taking for the Stage I power station and associated infrastructure covered by this
RAP is 78.21 acres (Table 5.3).

The main portion of the land being taken for Stage I is arable land, cultivated for at least part of
the year. All of the khas land being taken for the demised corridor (i.e., cooling water facility) is
very low land on the riverside, below the normal annual low water mark, and probably was more
commonly used as a fishing ground than cultivated land.
Some 171 households with proprietary or leasehold rights are affected by the land taking. The
total number of title holders of private land (196) shown in the Table 5.3 is greater than the actual
number (171) because many title holders simultaneously hold land on Access Road and Demised
Premises, Access Road and RMS, and RMS and Demised Premises. All the leaseholders on
Khas land were also private landowners and appear again in the category of titleholders of private
land (last column of Table 5.3).
A smaller grouping is composed of households affected by the resumption of leased land, some
55 households. Another 316 households are affected by the loss of access to land as tenants,
sharecroppers and field labour on the land being resumed for the project. This includes
tenants/field labour on both private and leased land. In addition, 25 househoids are cultivating
khas land without any lease, in effect as encroachers.
Table 5.4 shows the distribution by size of the plots acquired by the Deputy Commissioner. The
data for the khas land is affected by the fact that two of the lease holdings were large, one being
19.22 acres, of which 18.94 acres is being resumed, the other 13.53 acres, of which 8.78 acres is
being resumed. Clearly, these plots were not leased out under the current regulations, which
normally disallows the lease of more than one acre per lessee (section 6.7 below). For the khas
land, the largest number of plots resumed were in the quarter to half acre category (28.1%), while
the second largest number of plots (26.6%) were in the 16 to 25 decimal category.

A perusal of the household income data for the PAPs losing privately owned land suggests that,
in the aggregate, agriculture does not play a major role in the household income of this group.
Indeed, the data in Table 5.5a shows that this group of households is well on the way to a
transition from dependence on traditional occupations (i.e., agriculture and fishing) to trade and
salaried incomes as the key to household livelihoods. Some 85 household heads are still
involved in either agriculture or fishing as their primary occupation, while 74 household heads are
involved in trade, salaried jobs, or are students. Undoubtedly, data for working members of these
households other than the head of household would show and even greater shift away from
agriculture and fishing.

Even more instructive is Table 5.5b, which shows that traditional occupations no longer provide
the greater part of household incomes for even the landed households. If all the agrarian sources
are lumped together, including livestock, these provide (in aggregate) only 5.71% of the annual
income for these households. Fishing provides another 5.5%, for a total of 11.21%. In contrast,
trade, salaries, remittances from abroad, and non-agricultural wages provide 87.58% of
household incomes for those losing land in the project.
Table 5.5c shows the annual income levels of PAP households losing land. Almost half the
households have incomes over 100,000 Taka per year, while only eight households (4.68%) fall
below 15,000 Taka per year, near the official poverty line in Bangladesh (i.e., 18,000 Taka per
year). These eight households and a further six households in the next category (making 15,001  0
to 25,000/year) are Oat risko due to the impacts of the land taking, but the same cannot be said for
the overwhelming majority of households in this category. In the aggregate, all these data reflect
the marginality of the land being taken, the decreased importance of agriculture, and the growing
importance of jobs off the land; in industry, govemment service, the professions, or non-agrarian
wage labour for the unskilled and semi-skilled.
5.2.3 Loss of Land: Holders of Khas Without a Lease
In addition to those holding Govemment owned land (khas) with a valid lease, a further 25
individuals were in extralegal occupation of khas land within the land taking for Stage I of the
MPP. Within this group, 17 individuals had gained occupation of the land through extralegal
agreements with the Thana Land Revenue Office. Presumably, these are locally influential
individuals with access to the civil administration. The remaining eight individuals in this category
were squatters. They had not been given occupancy of the land by anyone in the civil
administration and were making no informal payments. They were occupying a strip of very low
land, one that was dry and cultivable for only a few months.
Part of the land in question is classified 'fallow land," although almost no rural land in this part of
Bangladesh is uncultivable. Fourteen of the 25 non-leaseholders were in occupancy of "fallow
land," another four were holding land as "caretakers," and seven were cultivating khas plots
contiguous to their own land. The majority of those in occupation of this land had held it from
prior to the birth of Bangladesh in 1971. The remainder had held it for lesser periods, although
only three of the 25 had been in occupancy for less than ten years.

The PAPs in this category were a mix of landholders, tenants, and squatters. Two holders either
put the land out on lease or in a sharecropping arrangement. The remainder cultivated the land
themselves, using a mix of family and hired labour. None of those holding extralegal khas had
aIZw          family incomes of over Taka 60,000 per year, as Table 5.7 notes. An overwhelming majority of
this group falls in the Taka 10,001 to 40,000 range. The income data reflects the diversity of this
group: households that occupy very small plots, whose economic status is not much dissimilar
from the tenant and field. labour groups described below, and landholding groups that own
multiple acres of private land both within and without the project boundary.  Most of the
households depended on other land or secondary occupations to fill out annual household
eamings.

say they have lost Taka 10,000 or less, including seven affectees who have lost less than Taka
2,500. Presumably, these are the squatters on the less productive low land. A few affectees

As all these affected households engaged in a variety of occupations, including cultivation of the
khas land, the impact of the project land taking on the annual incomes of this grouping was highly
variable. Some 40% reported losses of 20% or less to their annual household incomes. Twenty
eight percent household heads reported more than 50% loss.

5.4    Loss of Livelihood
Considerably more affected by the land taking are the more vulnerable groups who, while they
depend on land or contiguous bodies of water for all or part of their household incomes, are not
the possessors of land. These are the sharecroppers, permanent wage labourers, and fishing
community. In Bangladesh, large numbers survive in these niches in the rural system. For the
most part, these provide marginal, subsistence incomes, although some households in these
groupings have substantial incomes.
5.4.1 Cultivation as Tenant, Sharecroppers, or Informal Sub-Lessors
In the project survey, some 28 individuals reported themselves as sharecroppers or as cultivators
(bandhakee, bondoq) with some form of contractual access (koO to land. (Table 5.10).
Sharecropping in the project area is regulated largely by custom and often involves less
prosperous kinfolk of the landowner or leaseholder (when the land is khas). The sharecropper
normally has a long-term, customary relationship with the landowner, which, while it does not
convey legal right, amounts to a strong social bond and a relatively secure livelihood. A number
of sharecropping arrangements are based on the customary division of inputs and outputs
(typically 66:33).
Bandhakee covers non-customary forms of renting land, of which there are several. Usually, the
bandhakee pays a sum for the right to cultivate an area of land for a fixed period. One such
individual affected by the project paid 10,000 Taka for the right to cultivate 5 kannis (30 decimals
or 0.30 acre) for two years. Another paid Taka 7,000 for the right to cultivate 3 kannis for ten
years. In the latter case, the terms of the deal specified that the landowner could take back the
right to cultivate the land any time he repaid the Taka 7,000. Until then, the bandhakee had sole
right to cultivate the land and reap whatever profits he could. The latter terms were written on
stamped paper-the only instance in the project area where the terms (kot) of the deal were
written down.

Not surprisingly, sharecropping on Char Ramzan Sonaullah was a seasonal occupation, engaged
in by the virtually all sharecropping households from five to six months of the year. For the other
part of the year, these households (head of household and members working in cultivation)
engaged in secondary occupations. Table 5.11 shows that out of the 28 sharecroppers/
bandhakees, 25 were involved in secondary occupations of various forms; 48% of them are in
cultivation and wage labouring. Compared to the landholding group, secondary incomes were
more traditional, less skilled and lower paying. The data do not suggest this social grouping is
making as successful a transition as the landholders from the agrarian order to opportunities in
the burgeoning industrial landscape in the project area.

Household incomes also reflect the lower socio-economic capabilities of this group, as compared
to the landholders. As Table 5.12 shows, most tenant/bandhakee households have annual
incomes in the Taka 20,000 to 30,000 range, which averages around 2,000 Taka per month.
This is about Taka 500 above the official poverty line in Bangladesh.

The land taking for the project has substantial impacts on the livelihoods of the tenants and
bandhakees. According to the Baseline Census and Household Income Survey, this group of
affectees cultivates 3434 decimals (34.34 acres) of land in the region, of which 2,359 decimals
(23.59 acres), or 40.72% of the whole, is land taken for Stage I of the Project. Table 5.13 shows
the impact of this land taking on the household incomes of the group. About 32.15% of the
affectee households have lost between 21 and 50% of their annual incomes, the aggregate
average for the whole group is 27.99%.

5.4.2 Field Labour
The largest single socio-economic group affected by land taken by the BPDB for the project (e.g.,
Stage I) is agricultural field labour. The Baseline Census has identified 288 households whose
primary occupation is traditional, long-term field labour (bandha) or some form of customary

labour contract (Table 5.14). In Bangladesh, bandha (tied) signifies a long-term covenanted
relationship between a landholding or tenant lineage and a labour service lineage in the same
village, often lasting through generations. In addition to customary, reciprocal social obligations,
bandha status confers higher income security. In the project area, the terms of bandha provide
for regular work for three weeks in each of seven months of the year. During this period, the
labourer is provided with three meals per working day and 3,000 Taka per working month. There
are variations on this, of course, but this is the standard contract. In contrast, bodli (occasional)
labour, which is mostly episodic and short term, and provided by migratory workers, pays one
meal and 70 Taka per day.

As Table 5.15 shows, by far the largest numbers of field labourers (82.29%) have worked for their
landowner for more than five years. Those who have worked for lesser periods presumably are
the sons of an earlier generation of bandha labourers, who are now taking up the established
inter-lineage relationship.

Like the tenants and bandhakees, the field labourers had second occupations, pursued
throughout the year, though more intensively when the land was under water. Of the 288
labourers who were also household heads, the largest number also worked as fishermen,
followed by involvement in small trade, rickshaw pulling, and non-agricultural wage labour.
Working family members tended to follow the same traditional occupational alignments, working
less in agricultural wage labour and more in non-agricultural wage labour, small trade, and
fishing.
Income levels for this grouping are slightly lower than those for tenants/bandhakees. As Table
5.16 shows, the largest portion of this category of affectees fall into the income strata of Taka
10,001 to 20,000 per year. This constitutes 122 households, or 42.36% of the group.

The next largest group of 74 households, or 25.69% of the total, falls in the next higher strata.
Thus, agricultural field labour (bandha) overlaps with the tenant group in this and higher strata,
but trails proportionally in each category above 20,000 Taka. Generally, the field labour grouping
has incomes that fall around the official poverty line of Taka 1,500 per month income, some
below, others above.
Insofar as estimated annual income loss due to land taking by the BPDB, the majority of field
labour households reported a loss of between 21 and 30% of their annual income (Table 5.17).
These numbers reflect the fact that some bandha labourers still have access to land not acquired
for the project, all have secondary occupations, and most have at least one other household
member gainfully employed. Based on the Household Income Survey, it is estimated that the
average annual loss for heads of households in this grouping is Taka 3,344 per year, and Taka
4,260 per year for other family members.

Of the total of 288 bandha labourers losing a proportion of their previous livelihoods, some 109
have found alternative employment. The majority of those who have made an occupational
transition say they have acquired salaried work, meaning regularly paid work in one of the
factories at Meghnaghat or on the construction of the site. The next largest group (20 affectees)
has taken up other non-agricultural labour work, but of a temporary nature. Another 14 have
shifted into small trade and 13 have either taken up fishing or are pursing it as a full-time
occupation. Of the 109 in this grouping, 92 (or 84.4%) say their incomes have increased as a
result of making the occupational transition. This still leaves 179 bandha labourers who have not
made a change in occupation.
6.4.3 Traditional Fisherfolk
According to the validated survey, no households in the immediate project area whose profession
was traditional fishing have been economically displaced by the BPDB land taking for the Stage I
power station. Traditional fisherrnen main area of fishing is the Meghna River and they are
continuing their profession as they used to do before development of the site. These groups use
big fish net and boat with three to four crewmen, more often from the same family or family
groups.
Big net fishing is the most lucrative avenue, particularly when combined with involvement with
wholesaling the catch in Dhaka and Narayanganj. Big net fishing is carried on in the main channel
of the Meghna, using a type of drift net. It requires about Taka 90,000 to 100,000 to purchase
and outfit a boat-made of sal and teak, engine not included-for big net fishing. Most boats use
a crew of three-owner or renter and two crewmen. Most of those involved in this, the largest
aspect of the fishing community, work for themselves and sell the catch themselves.
The best months for big net fishing are May through August, when a big net boat can make from
Taka 1,200 to 1,400 in a day (1999 figure). In the winter, big net fishing can yield between Taka
300 to 400 per day (1999 figure), the catch consisting mostly of small fish and shrimp.       9
Fishing activity generally declines after the summer and all fishing on and around the site was
only seasonal and used to be pursued on casual basis for meeting the household consumption,
not to seek profit. These households have already been identified in other category of PAPs such
as landowners, tenants, agricultural wage labourers, sharecroppers, etc.
Like big net fishing, fishing by hooks has not been affected by land for Stage I, as this land was
relatively high. Shallow depth of water did not make it a suitable ground for such kind of fishing.
The main area of such fishing is the back channel, which still remains unaffected for fishing.
5.4.4 Fishermen
Jhop fishing is the use of large traps both in the back channels and along the riverbank in the
main channel of the Meghna. The traps are made of bamboo poles, linked by strands of rope
and bamboo. Vegetation, mostly the river hibiscus or lily pad, is brought in to cover the surface of
the water and held in place in the lighter currents along the banks. Fish gather under this shaded
area and are fed by the local ihop committee a diet of mixed rice and wheat flour. The fish are
harvested at intervals during the year, anywhere from every two months to twice year.
Harvesting is accomplished by putting a net around the perimeter of the trap and culling out the
fish by smaller nets.
There is a regional Samity (Association) for the Jhop community covering the nine grams around
the back channels south of the main Dhaka-Chittagong Highway. This committee settles
disputes, provides night watchmen, schedules fishing, and generally keeps the peace. The trap
fishermen follow customary rules. The riverbank, for example, is open trap builders on a first-
come, first serve basis. Prior to the alteration of the site, according to local jhop fishermen, some
20 to 25 large traps were sited around the margins of Char Ramzan Sonaullah. In one deep hole    )

AES MEGHNAGHT 450 MW POWER PROJECT
(ko'al) on the back channel off Ganganagar, five to seven jhop traps were sited annually. Another
eight traps were sited on the margins of the back channel in areas not affected by Stage I lands.
Prior to its removal by the filling of the site in 1999, this ko-al was the most valued jhop site in the
region, franchised out annually by two masjids in the area as part of local auqaf arrangements-a
traditional method of financing religious establishments. The thana administration took over the
ko'al some years ago, after the two masjids had fallen out over the site, but continued to let it out
on a franchise basis.
A jhop manager at Islampur on the main channel of the Meghna has two traps along the
riverbank. His main annual expense is for the poles that make up the structure of the traps.
These and other materials cost Taka 30,000. He hires 10 to 15 helpers to build each trap, which
takes about a week, and later 20 to 25 fishermen to help him catch the fish at each two month
interval when he closes off the trap. In a good year, after all expenses, he can eam Taka 60,000
in profit. In a bad year, his eamings can go down to Taka 30,000.
For the most part, jhop fishing is an extended family and/or a community activity, requiring
multiple investors of cash and labour. Women and children of the investing households perform
many of the routine tasks associated with maintaining the trap. According to the Baseline
Census, some 32 households were involved in jhop fishing as their primary activity.
5.5    Women Headed Households
The baseline census found 11 women-headed households among the PAPs. The entire group
records household work as their main occupation. Five of the women are widows, the remaining
six say their husbands live far away.
Interestingly, all of the group own land, putting them in the socially and economically more
privileged strata of the rural population. Average household income for this group is Taka 17,982.
The sources of income are land, eamings by other family members, and their own eamings. Due
to the loss of land to the Project, this group of households has been hit fairly hard. Everybody in
the group says their income loss exceeds 20%, while some 64% say their income loss is more
than 25%.

6.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH GOB ACQUIRED THE LAND FOR
THE BPDB                                                                               77)
The Project Sponsor has gained possession of the land according to the terms of the Land Lease
Agreement between the Project Sponsor and the BPDB, originally signed on July 29, 1999. As
presented to the Project Sponsor, the site was fully prepared for the initial construction of the AES
Meghnaghat Power Project. This meant raising the level of the land, initially a seasonally
submerged island (char, some eight meters by dredging sand from the riverbed and filling it over
the site.
As discussed, prior to acquisition, the land existed under two ownership categories: (1) privately
owned land; and (2) land owned by the govemment and leased to farmers, most of whom, in this
case, are resettled here after losing land to river erosion. All the land acquired, both private and
govemment, was seasonally cultivable land, some being higher in elevation and hence cultivable
for a longer period. The privately owned land was acquired for the project by the BPDB through
the eminent domain proceedings, carried out by the Deputy Commissioner of Narayanganj
District under the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance of 1982. The
leased land, all under one-year leases, was resumed by the administration and sold to the BPDB.
For the purposes of land acquisition in the current project, the 1982 Ordinance and 1984 Act are
the pertinent laws.
6.1    Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982
This Ordinance provides the Deputy Commissioner (DC) with the power to initiate the acquisition
of any property in any locality within his district that is likely to be needed for a public purpose or
in the public interest. In this event, the DC shall cause a notice to be published at a convenient
place in or near the property to be acquired (Section 3). Any person having interest in such
property may object to the proposed acquisition to the Deputy Commissioner in writing within 15
days (Sec. 4.1). The DC will prepare a report and refer the case to higher authorities for decision
(Sec. 4.2). If the property exceeds to standard bighas of land, the final decision will be made by
the govemment. In case of property up to 10 bighas, the final decision will be made by the
Divisional Commissioner. However, if no objections are raised with the 15 days time limit, the
final decision may be made by the DC in case of properties up to 10 standard bighas of land,
otherwise the Divisional Commissioner (Sections 4.3 and 5) will take the decision in case of
dispute.
After a decision of acquisition of a property has been made, the DC issues a second notice, again
to be published at convenient places at or near such property. The public notice shall state the
intention of the authorities to take possession of the property. It shall also invite all persons with
interests in the property to appear in person or by agent before the DC not later than 15 days
after the publication of the notice to state the nature of their interest in the property and submit
claims to compensation (Section 6).
In determining the amount of compensation, the DC shall take into consideration the market value
of the property at the date of the publication of the first notice. In this process, the DC shall take
into account the average value of similar properties in the vicinity during the preceding twelve
months (Section 8.1.a). In addition to the market value of the property, 'the DC shall in every
case award a sum of fifty percent on such market value in consideration of the compulsory nature
of the acquisition. (Section 8.2, emphasis added).
Among the matters to be considered in determining compensation (Section 8) are the following:
1. The damage that may be sustained by the person interested, by reason of the
taking of standing crops or trees which may be on the property at the time of
taking possession thereof by the Deputy Commissioner,
AES MEGHNAGHAT LIMrTED, DHAKA, BANGLADESH                                       30

AES MEGHNAGHT 450 MW POWER PROJECT
2. The damage that may be sustained.. .by reason of the acquisition injuriously
affecting his other properties, movable or immovable, in any other matter, or his
earnings;
3. If in consequence of the acquisition of the property, the person interested is likely
to be compelled to change his residence or place of business, the reasonable
expenses, if any, incidental to such change;
In terms of compensation, the Ordinance explicitly states that the DC, when determining
compensation, shall neither consider any disinclination of the person to part with the property, nor
any increase in the value of the property to be acquired likely to accrue from the use of it after it
has been acquired (Section 9.e).
Payments of compensation must be made before the authorities take possession of the property
(Section 10.1).
The property acquired under the ordinance must not, without prior approval of the govemment,
;be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it has been acquired (Section 17).
After compensation has been paid or deposited in the Public Account, the property shall stand
acquired and vest absolutely with the Govemment free from all encumbrances. The DC can take
possession of the property after a declaration has been made in the Official Gazette (Section 11).
Compensation must be paid or deposited with a period of one year from the date of decision of
acquisition. All proceedings shall stand abated on the expiry of that period. In addition, the
Deputy Commissioner may, with the approval of the competent authorities, revoke all
proceedings in respect of the acquisition of any property at any time before the payment of
compensation (Section 12)
The Ordinance also covers the case of temporary acquisition of property for a public purpose or
in the public interest. (Often these are areas only temporarily needed for construction purposes.)
With prior approval of the govemment, the DC can decide on the requisition of any property for a
period of two years of more. However, no prior approval will be required for emergency
requisition for the purpose of maintaining a transportation or communication system (Sec. 18.2
and 18.2.a).
The DC may take possession of the requisition after serving the requisition order. The amount of
compensation will be equal to the estimated rent which would have been payable for the use and
occupation of the property if it has been taken on lease for that period, plus compensation for
estimated expenses for vacating and re-occupying the property (Sec. 20). If a person is not
satisfied with the amount of compensation, or there is a dispute over ownership, the DC may
deposit the money in the Public Account (Sec. 21).
A person who does not accept the award made by the DC, in any case under the Ordinance, may
submit an application seeking revision of the award to the Arbitrator, within 45 days from the date
of notice of the award (Section 28). The Arbitrator is a government appointed Judicial Officer, not
below the rank of Subordinate Judge. A determination by the Arbitrator takes precedence over
that of the DC.
An appeal against the decision by the Arbitrator can be made to an Arbitration Appellate Tribunal
which consists of a member appointed by the govemment from among persons who are or have
been District Judges. A decision of the said Tribunal shall be final (Sec. 34).

6.2   Property (Emergency) Acquisition Act, 1989
In the wake of the devastating floods of 1987 and 1988, the government decided to promulgate a
new Land Acquisition Act entitled: Property (Emergency) Acquisition Act (Act IX of 1989). The
Act was formulated to expedite the emergency acquisition of land to enable the govemment 'to
control inundation, flood and upsurge caused by natural calamity and to prevent river erosion."
The 1989 Act was not meant to replace the 1982 Ordinance, but to complement it for special
circumstances. Normally, acquisition of land for development purposes would not come under
the 1989 Act. Use of this Act to acquire land for development would require extremely compelling
reasons.
6.3    Administrative and Regulatory Guidelines and Instructions
In addition to the provisions in the law, the land acquisition process is regulated by certain
administrative instructions and procedural requirements. The most important of these are
summarised below.
In 1976, the govemment constituted land allocation committees at the district, divisional and
central levels to control what was regarded as too lavish taking of land for public purposes. The
committees were charged with ensuring 'the most rigid measures of economy in the use of land
for purposes other than agriculture."
The District Land Allocation Committees (DLACs) are chaired by the DC and have seven other
members. These member include Executive Engineers of the R&H Department and the Public
Works Department, and the Civil Surgeon. They are entrusted with land allocation within the
district not exceeding two acres.  The Divisional LACs are chaired by the Divisional
Commissioner and have technical representation at the Superintending Engineer and Deputy
Director level. These committees consider land acquisition cases involving between two and five
acres of land. All cases of more than five acres, and all cases of land belonging to Dhaka City,
go to the Central Land Allocation Committee (CLAC). This committee is chaired by the Minister
of Land Administration and has technical representation at the Secretary level. In 1989, the  0
govemment ordered that in all cases involving the acquisition of land exceeding 10 bighas, the
President would have to give consent.
6.4   Land Acquisition Procedures
Land acquisition requires interaction between, on the one hand, the Requiring Body (RB), which
usually is a national infrastructure development agency, such as the Water Development Board,
Power Development Board, Titas Gas, etc., and, on the other, the Acquiring Body (AB), which
normally is the Ministry of Land. The Ministry of Land usually delegates its authority to the
Deputy Commissioner or the Divisional Commissioner, depending on the magnitude of the land
taking, or other considerations.
The division of responsibilities between the RB and the AB consists in that the RB provides the
technical input and the AB the legal input in the land acquisition process. The Requiring Body
must ensure that the Project, for which the land must be acquired, is approved by the competent
authorities and that funds are available. The RB must also justify the need for land and other
property on the basis of field surveys, including detailed engineering design, and must prepare all
necessary documents required for decision making. At this stage, the AB undertakes to process
the land acquisition case.
The procedural aspects of land acquisition begin when the RB submits an application to the
Deputy Commissioner with a request to acquire land for a specific public purpose. The
procedures for dealing with land acquisition matters are laid out in a Government Memorandum,
dated October, 1985. With respect to proposals in the water resources sector, additional

RESETTLEMNT ACTION PLAN
AES MEGHNAGHT 450 MW POWER PROJECT
guidelines are issued by the Water Development Board. The proposal must contain the following
items:
*  A Proforma indicating the amount of land required, a timetable for the acquisition of
land and a purpose for which the land is to be acquired;
*  A Layout Plan, which shows the location of the Project on a map;
*  A Site Plan, showing the alignment in red ink on a Mouza Map;
*  A Land Schedule, showing the classification of the land and the ownership of the
plots to be acquired;
* A Certificate of Minimum Requirement, issued by the Requiring Body, stating that the
quantity of land proposed for acquisition is the absolute minimum for a proper
implementation of the Project; and
*  Administrative Approval, comprising a copy of the approved Proforma.
After receiving the proposal, the DC will arrange for field verifications jointly with the staff of the
Requiring Body. This includes a classification of the land to be acquired and an identification of
trees and standing crops, which are involved.
The Requiring Bodys application is then submitted to the appropriate Land Acquisition
Committee. After clearance by the LAC, the DC issues the preliminary notice and, if required,
hears objections against the proposed acquisition. If there is no objection, and if the area is less
than ten standard bighas, the DC may give the formal approval for land acquisition. If there are
objections, and if the area is greater than ten standard bighas, the DC submits the application to
the Commissioner or the Ministry of Land for final approval. The DC's submission shall include
the clearance by the relevant LAC, a report on the objection petitions, and information on the
likely number of households to be affected.
After the final approval of the PresidenVCommissioner/Deputy Commissioner (as the case may
be), the case is referred back to the DC for the assessment of compensation and the
identification of the owners of the plots to be acquired. With the final approval to acquire the land,
the RB must place the required funds for payment of compensation with the DC. If the RB fails to
do that within one year of the date of final approval, all proceedings shall stand abated and a
declaration to that effect by the DC will be published in the Official Gazette.
Compensation is paid by the DC's office. There are no specific rules on where and in what form
compensation should be paid. Normally, smaller amounts appear to be paid in cash, whereas
larger amounts are paid by cheques to persons who are identified by the Chairman or members
of the Union Parishad or by gazetted officers. In the event the rightful owner of the land cannot
be found, or there is a conflict over ownership, or the distribution of compensation, funds are
deposited in the Public Account.
In the event the owner of the loan does not accept the award of compensation, the person can go
for Arbitration according to the provisions of the 1982 Ordinance.  After payment of
compensation, the ownership of the loan is formally transferred to the Requiring Body by mutation
in favour of the RB in the govemment's revenue record, which is maintained at the concemed
Thana Land Office. The transfer also is published in the Government Gazelte.
6.5  Institutional Arrangements
The administrative set up for land acquisition has two tiers under the Ministry of Land
Administration. At the Division level, there is an Additional Commissioner dealing with land
administration under the Commissioner. At the district level, there is an Additional Deputy

RESErlLEMNT ACTION PLAN
AES MEGHNAGHT 450 MW POWER PROJECT
Commissioner in charge of land administration. Under him, there is at least one Land Acquisition
Officer and several Assistant Land Acquisition Officers. The number of officers depends on the
size of the District. Non-gazetted officers in the land administration include Kanungos and
surveyors.
6.6    Time Frames
6.6.1 Time Frame for Payment of Compensation
The following are time frames relevant to the payment of compensation:
a)     Payment of compensation must be made before the authority takes possession
of the property (Ordinance of 1982).
b)     Compensation must be paid or deposited within a period of one year from the
date of final decision of acquisition by the DC under Section 5. All proceedings
shall stand abated on the expiry of that period (Ordinance of 1982).
C)     Persons with an interest or right over the property to be acquired have 10 days in
the 1989 Act and 15 days in the 1982 Ordinance to submit claims for
compensation.
d)    The 1989 (Emergency) Act provides for quicker compensation by introducing the
concept of 'provisional compensation' which is to be determined within 10 days
of the order of acquisition. Land can be acquired on payment of provisional
compensation. However, the final compensation is to be determined within three
months from the date of acquisition.
6.62  Time Frames for Legal Procedure and Appeal
The following are time frames applying to the legal process:
a)     The aggrieved party may raise objection in writing against the decision of
acquisition within 15 days from the date of serving the notice of acquisition. It
may take about a month to make a final decision.
b)    If a land owner is dissatisfied with the amount of compensation offered, he may
apply for arbitration to an Arbitrator not less than the level of a Subordinate
Judge within 45 days of the award.
c)     Subject to the decision of the arbitration, either party may appeal against the
decision to the Arbitration Appellate Tribunal within the stipulated period allowed
by the court.
6.7    Framework for Leasing of Government (Khas) Agricultural Land
The rules for managing and leasing govemment-owned (khas) land are framed in two
notifications in the Bangladesh Gazette: (1) Notification: Bhumo/Sha-8/Kha-jo-bo/46/84/261,
Bangladesh Gazette Extra Edition, May 12, 1997, pp 1527-1536; and (2) Notification:
Shuno/Sha-4/Kri-kha-jo--bo-1/98-264, Bangladesh Gazette, September 15, 1998.
Under these regulations, the govemment leases cultivable agricultural land in the rural areas to
landless farming households. The allotments cannot be more than one acre, except in the
southem districts where up to 1.5 acres of char land can be allotted. A landless family is defined
as one that works in agriculture and may own a homestead, but has no arable land of its own.
Given this basic definition, five groups of landless families are given priority in the allotment of
leases: (i) families of freedom fighters; (ii) families who have lost all their land due to erosion; (iii)
widows with an adult son capable of working the land; (iv) farmers with homesteads but no land;'

RESEITLEMNT ACTION PLAN
AES MEGHNAGHT 450 MW POWER PROJECr
and (v) farmers who have lost all their land due to land acquisition under the eminent domain
laws.
The regulations provide for a three tiered structure, with Committees for the Management and
Leasing of Khas Land at the National, District, and Thana levels. While the upper committees
have oversight and appeal functions, the key operations occur at the Thana level. The Thana
Committee is chaired by the Thana Nirbahi Officer (TNO, or Thana Administrative Officer) and is
advised by the local Member of Parliament. The members of the committee are the Thana
Agricultural Officer, Thana Police Commander, the Cooperative Officer, Forest Range Officer,
Union Pafishad Chairman, representative of lower income groups (appointed by the Deputy
Commissioner), one representative of an organised peasant organisation (appointed by the
Ministry of Land), one local notable/philanthropist (appointed by DC with advice of MP), a
scholar/educator (appointed by DC with advice of MP), NGO representative (appointed by
ADAB), and a freedom fighter representative (appointed by Ministry of Land). The AC Land
(Thana level land officer) acts as Secretary of the Committee.
The Thana Committee for the Management and Leasing of Khas Land is charged with recovering
khas land that is out of govemment management, dividing it into plots, and informing the
population in the mauza (revenue village) about the leasing programme. Once applications have
been made and the fee of one Taka paid, the committee vets the applicants, makes a priority list
and passes its recommendations up to the District level committee. Applicants have 30 days to
appeal over the make up of the list. Normally, the District committee finalises the list of allottees.
However, if there are disputes, the National level committee examines the circumstances and
makes the final determination.
The actual leasing of the land is carried out under the AC/Land at the Thana, where leaseholders
sign a lease agreement. The lease is for the number of years decided upon by the Thana
Committee for the Management and Leasing of Khas Land. Normally, rural agrarian or
homestead land is leased for three years. These are temporary leases. There are instances,
however, in which land can be leased for fifteen years, after which the lease becomes
*permanent," that is for 99 years. In practice, once even temporary leaseholders are in the
system they may stay on the same land for years. Upon their retirement, disability or death, the
transfer of the lease is allowed only to their descendants. The leaseholders pay a small annual
fee to the govemment of Tk 5/- per decimal. No land tax is collected in Bangladesh on any
agrarian land up to 25 bighas in extend. (25 bighas equals 8.25 acres.)
The current reworking of the leasing system in the regulations of 1997 and 1998 is not meant to
recover khas land leased under previous rules. It covers only that khas which has been occupied
illegally or has been out of govemment management control for some other reason.
Undoubtedly, some ineligible people slip through the leasing system, but in the experience of the
Project so far, the leaseholders were genuinely landless peasants, who had lost their land to
erosion, and who were living on homestead land and cultivating agrarian land on temporary
leasehold status.
The govemment has the right to cancel the leases and resume the land, if it is needed for a public
purpose. All khas land that is held under a permanent lease (99 years), if resumed by the
govemment, is compensated as if the leaseholder were the owner of the land. In the event of the
involuntary resumption of temporary leases, however, there is no provision in the regulations for
payment of compensation. Under other regulations, the administration is liable to pay for the loss
of standing crops.

7.     LOSS OF ASSETS, LIVELIHOODS, AND COMPENSATION
Each household affected due to land taking by the BPDB for Stage I of the MPP is eligible for one
work permit for job(s) during the construction of Stage I power station; provided suitable jobs are
available with the Construction Contractor. In addition, all households losing 20% or more of their
annual income due to the Project, or whose annual income is below the poverty line, are eligible
to place one household member in the vocational skills training program (Section 8) to be
supported by the Project Sponsor. The subsections below relate to losses already sustained by
the PAPs.
7.1    Loss of Housing
The four households who lost their homes were compensated for their houses and homestead
lands by the Deputy Commissioner of Narayanganj. Table 7.1 details the valuation of the
housing loss based upon the responses made by the house owners. The compensation awarded
by the Deputy Commissioner for losses for houses was Taka 102,117. Since these houses were
dismantled prior to the Project Sponsor's involvement, there is no possibility of making a proper
assessment. The values claimed by the homeowners, however, appear close to the
compensation made by the BPDB.

7.3    Loss of Private Land
As noted above in Section 5, 60.85% of the land leased by BPDB for Stage I of the MPP was
private land (42.60 of 70 acres). Of the 42.60 acres, 0.20 acres were homestead and the rest was
agricultural land. In the assessment of Deputy Commissioner, only 0.2 acres were classified as
homestead land (vitb). In addition to the above land, 1.72 acres of private land will be required for
the RMS of Stage I, and 6.49 acres were required for the BPDB access road common to all the
stages at MPP.
Under the Bangladesh laws of eminent domain, the Deputy Commissioner of Narayanganj valued
agricultural land at the rate of Taka 2,239.5 per decimal. Only 0.2 acres of homestead land was
valued at Taka 3,359 per decimal. These rates were based upon local land sales recorded in the
Land Sales Registry Office, and calculated as an average of sales over the preceding twelve
months, plus a 50 % premium required by the law.

The Deputy Commissioneres office in Narayanganj appears to have used land transfer data up to
and including 1995, or at least part of 1995, but probably would not have had 1996 data available.
The BPDB paid Taka 2,239.50 per decimal, which also included the 50% premium required by
the law.
The gas supplier to the project, Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited
("Titas') will acquire right of way over 500 metres long and 6.1 metres wide (0.75 acres) land for
construction of a 20" gas pipeline for connection between Bakhrabad-Demra main gas pipeline
and the RMS on the project site. Titas has identified the alignment of this interconnection gas
pipeline to be used as common facility for gas supply to all stages on the MPP and will make
compensation as entitled under the law Bangladesh.
7.4    Losses to Livelihoods
Table 72 shows the figures for aggregate income and loss to the various groups in the Stage I of
the MPP. Most of these are the non-ownership groups, but nevertheless depended upon the
land for at least part of their household incomes.

Source: DPC Baseline Census and Household Income Survey, Decemnber 1999(data updated, June 2000)
It appears from the survey, that many of the PAPs on land of Stage I, have lost 20%or more of
their annual income. As it was difflicult to separate the agricultural labourers affected by land
taking for all the stages, the 288 agricultural labourers identified in the survey, will in reality
include agricultural labourers who are somehow affected by land acquired for the Stage II and IlIl
at the MPP site. This number will be further verified in the presence of employers and elected
representatives of the Pirozpur Union Council.
By losing access to the land after March 1999, many of these household heads might have
become temporarily unemployed, but a large number of them have made successful transition to
altemative employment. It was found in the consultation meetings with PAPs that their immediate
priority is sustainable alternative employment. Considering the magnitude of impact caused by
the BPDB land acquisition on the livelihood of a large number of such groups, this RAP has been
designed to provide income support altematives through comprehensive training in various trades
as a long-term solution to the problem. It is expected that the PAPs will find job with their new
skills in the Meghnaghat area, where more and more new factories are being added.
Although fishing was temporarily affected during the site filling works, it is expected to have
revived to the original level by this time.

8.    INCOME SUPPORT THROUGH TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT
8.1    Training
The Project Sponsor's Vocational Skills Training Programme is being set up as a scholarship
programme. The Project Sponsor will make one scholarship available to each PAP household
losing twenty percent (20%) or more of its annual income, and to each affected households
whose annual income falls below the official poverty line irrespective of the degree of income
loss, in accordance with the Entitlement Matrix (Table 2.1). The scholarship can neither be
transferred out of the household, nor can it be cashed in.
In order to ensure that each trainee is fully committed to the training programme that he or she
has selected, and is pursuing it due to a real need for that, the Project Sponsor will only fund the
tuition fees for the individual's training as they become payable to the institute. After the training
institute awards the Diploma or Certificate, the trainee will approach the Project Sponsor's CLO to
claim the living allowance and transport allowance he or she is entitled to under the scholarship
programme. The Monthly Average Training Budget of Taka 20,000 per person includes both
living and transport allowances. However, if a trainee takes longer than usual time to qualify the
training, he or she will not be entitled to claim the tuition fees and allowances for the additional
time. Any trainee not be able to qualify the training, will not be entitled to claim any living or
transport allowances from the Project Sponsor, unless the release of such funds is directly tied to
successful completion of the training.
Effective implementation of the whole training package will be difficult for the CLO to monitor and
there will be no 100% guarantee that the money will not be wasted. Although the PAPs will be
responsible for taking the initiative for training, the Project Sponsor, through the CLO, will
encourage PAPs to participate in the training and extend all possible co-operations, so that the
target enrolment is achieved within the time period.
Within these limits, the programme is meant to be flexible. Each eligible household can use this
scholarship as it sees fit. This means selecting the person to receive it, and agreeing on the skills
to be pursued. It means that the training can be used for any skill that will be used to generate
income, including technical construction skills, training as a community organiser in health and
family planning, or training in any of the skills listed in the Tables 8.1 and 8.2 below.
The programme is designed to fund training up to a basic capability in the chosen skill. Clearly,
insofar as time is concerned, it cannot be an open-ended commitment and will be available for
two years from the start of construction. In some cases, however, the programme may support up
to a yeares training or professional education, provided the CLO is convinced that the individual is
especially deserving, whether due to extreme poverty coupled with demonstrated giftedness, or
some other reasonable measure of qualification.
The Project Sponsor is currently developing a booklet in Bangla describing the scholarship
programme. This booklet will list the various kinds of opportunities in the area, such as Technical
Training Schools and/or NGOs offering specialized skills training, and other sources of training. It
will establish the parameters of the programme, which the PAP households need to take to put
the scholarship into effect. The booklet will contain an application form in Bangla, which will serve
as the starting point for the scholarship. These steps are as follows:
1. Entitled household selects the individual to be trained and the type of training desired,
decides on two or three places where such training is available, fills in the application form,
and submits it to the CLO for consideration. If unable to fill out the form, PAPs should bring it
to the CLO and fill it out together. The application should include a note from the candidate's
teacher, if recently in school, or some other responsible person who can attest to the
individual's character and prospects.

2. The CLO will set aside one afternoon per week to deal with scholarship requests and will
make this time known to the PAPs.
3. The CLO will vet the application by talking with the household to see that they have made a
good choice, to ensure that the training school or other facility chosen is reputable, and to set
up a schedule for when the training will begin. If the CLO is satisfied, he will move on to the
next step. If not, he will work with the household until he is assured that the experience will
produce enhanced and marketable skills for the household.
4. The CLO will contact the training facility and assists the candidates in enrolment. The
candidate shall have requisite qualification for enrolment in the schools he or she chooses.
5. The facility should agree to inform the CLO after one month about how the training is
progressing. The facility should inform the CLO whether the trainee is coming to the facility
and submit progress report for each trainee after at the end of each month. The affectee
household only gets one chance and it is up to them to keep their trainee in school.
6. The training facility will provide a certificate of completion of training to the CLO, who will
make a copy for the files and present the original to the trainee.
Clearly, as experience accumulates, the CLO can alter these steps to better fit his experiences in
running a scholarship programme. As always, the objective should remain the provision of skills
to the affected households that will enable them to replace the losses to their livelihoods
sustained as a result of the Project. The hope is that these skills will enhance earning capacities
in the years to come.

82    Employment
The Stage I project will not offer large-scale permanent employment to residents of the project
area, although, by providing reliable and one of the cheapest sources of power to the national
grid, it will encourage additional industries to locate in Meghnaghat in particular and over the
country in general. The AES Project at Meghnaghat will be an advanced, highly automated power
station, requiring a permanent operating staff of about 30 people.
During the two-year construction period, however, some 800 workers (at peak labour
requirement) will be involved on the project site. A large proportion of these will be unskilled and
semi-skilled workers. The Project Sponsor will ask the Construction Contractor to give all the
PAPs listed in the Baseline Census priority in hiring for all jobs during the construction phase -
unskilled, semi-skilled, and skilled. The Construction Contractor will also be encouraged to
source labour from the local market area (i.e., greater Pirozpur Union), prior to going to general
hiring.
The ID Card system will be used to identify those PAP households that are entitled to priority
consideration in hiring. Each PAP household head will be given a numbered photo ID (number to
show the household followed by a letter to show adult individual). The Construction Contractor
should consider each numbered household for one job in the construction of the project, covering
a minimum of two months, but in practice held as long as the individual performs satisfactorily.
This is a minimum standard, of course, set so as not to saddle the Construction Contractor with
incompetent individuals. In practice, it is anticipated that the PAPs, once hired, will prove able and
hard working and will be retained for as long as they are needed. The CLO will maintain a record
of the PAPs employed, by date of employment and date of termination.
It is critically important that any employment during Stage I construction does not fall under the
control of an outside labour syndicate. The Construction Contractor may attempt to simply
contract out this entire aspect of the project to labour suppliers it has used elsewhere. This would
lead to the hiring of outside labour and thereby materially damage the interests of the PAPs and
violate the expressed requirements of this RAP.  The Project Sponsor will ensure the
Construction Contractor complies with the requirement to give preference in hiring to the PAP and
persons from the greater Pirozpur Union area.

9. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES
9.1   Infrastructure
Apart from the Stage I project, the project area will benefit from improvements in roads, utilities,
and social services. Meghnaghat is becoming a significant industrial hub of the country and
major upgrades are planned in these areas by the GOB. The major challenge for the
Meghnaghat area will be to ensure that all industrial facilities adhere to the country's
environmental regulations, so that the Meghna fishery will not be lost as a national resource.
During the construction period, the Project Sponsor will require the Construction Contractor to
provide necessary tube wells on the site and pit latrines for the use of the work force. These are
important facilities for the workers, but it also is important to keep the work force from using
village water resources or from fouling the area. Generally, the Construction Contractor must
pursue arrangements that keep the workers out of the villages.
In addition to water and sanitary facilities, the Construction Contractor should keep the site area
wetted down, so as to prevent sand from blowing over and into the homes of the contiguous
villages.
9.2    Social Services
The Project Sponsor will work with the local people to improve health services and education in
the project area. The Project Sponsor has demonstrated elsewhere its commitment to socially
responsible projects in education and health for communities surrounding its facilities. The same
level of commitment will be applied to this undertaking by the Project Sponsor.
The Project Sponsor will provide a primary school for the settlement at Islampur. The residents of
this area, most of them PAPs, will provide the land for the school. In addition, a number of local
youths are sufficiently educated to be employed as staff.
In addition, the Project Sponsor will provide funds to help construct an access road to Islampur
Village. The residents of the settlement would also contribute both land and labour to this small
project
Finally, the Project Sponsor is committed to constructing either a land-based or water-based
hospital to service the local villages (e.g., Islampur and Ganganagar) and people in the remote
areas who do not have ready access to health care facilities. Preference may be given to a
mobile water-based hospital since it could service a larger area.
10. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT
The Project Sponsor is committed to achieving the highest standard of environmental and social
performance consistent with their established operating procedures and with their delivery of one
of most cheap electrical energy in the World. To this end, the Project Sponsor is developing and
implementing an Environmental Management System (EMS) for the construction, operation, and
decommissioning of the power station. The EMS will address main aspects of the environment,
including socio-economic, health, and safety concerns. Additional information on the EMS is
contained in the EIA (Section 6).

_ 11. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION
11.1  Implementation Schedule
11.1.1 Initial Requirements to Put the RAP into Effect
Prior to the implementation of this RAP, acceptance of the RAP by the project lenders and
regulators (e.g., IDCOL and ADB) will be obtained. Implementation will generally follow the
schedule shown in Figure 11.1.
11.12 Implementing the RAP
There are two priority items in the implementation of the RAP. First, the Project Sponsor will
undertake to issue picture ID cards to the eligible households as soon as possible. This will
enable the PAPs to present themselves to the Construction Contractor at the initiation of the
labour mobilization. It is a major requirement of this RAP that the affected households have the
first priority in general hiring, at the rate of one person per household, if the candidates are found
eligible for the job available with the Construction Contractor. The latter means that the work
should be spread among the affected communities and not preserved by influential groups for
their own people.
The second priority is to carry out the training need assessment of the PAPs who have lost a part
of their livelihoods to the project. Implementation of the Scholarship Programme for Vocational
Skills Training should begin within six months of taking over the site by the Project Sponsor. The
sooner the affectees can gain new skills, the sooner they can find new work in this fast-
developing region, and leave behind the disruptions occasioned by the coming of the Project.
112   Project Monitoring Programme
The Project Sponsor will administer its own Monitoring Programme to ensure that this RAP is fully
implemented. As discussed, the senior AES officer at the site during the construction of the
power station will serve as the POMO.
Essentially, the CLO and POMO must be committed to seeing that all aspects of the RAP are
implemented. The CLO will be required to report formally at designated times during the
implementation of the RAP, but will also be responsible for providing ad hoc field reports when
and if they believe some aspect of the RAP is being improperly implemented. Field reports
should also be filed if the monitor perceives that some unanticipated or unintended negative
impact is affecting the PAPs and surrounding communities.

RESEITLEMNT ACTION PLAN
AES MEGHNAGHT 450 MW POWER PROJECT
At a minimum, the CLO should complete the following tasks:
1. report on the employment of the PAP households during construction;
2. report on the quantity, status, and outcome of the scholarship programme as part of the
Vocational Skills Training Programme. This should include information about how many of
the trainees have succeeded in establishing a new source of income; and
3. describe how the Project Sponsors Social Responsibility Programme is taking shape.
The CLO will also make two formal reports that will be reviewed by the POMO. The first, the
Interim Report, will be due six months after the start of construction on the power station by the
Construction Contractor or three months from the first draw down of the IDCOL loan commitment;
whichever occurs later. The Final Report will be due approximately two years after the Interim
Report. It should be completed after the end of construction, but prior to the commissioning of the
station. Both reports should cover the main issues in the RAP (they should not be ad hoc field
reports) and the steps taken by the Project Sponsor to mitigate unanticipated negative effects.
Copies of the lntefim and Final Reports will be provided to:
1.   Project Sponsor            4.   Asian Development Bank
2.  IDCOL                       5.   World Bank (if required)
3.   Department of Environment
11.3  Evaluation
The implementation of this RAP will be evaluated by an independent agency. The evaluation will
begin two and a half years after the start of construction, or six months after the commissioning of
the station. Of particular importance will be the evaluation of the long-term impact of the stage I
project on the livelihoods and standards of living of the PAP households, as listed in the Baseline
Census. The Project Sponsor will contract with an appropriate consulting firm or NGO to carry
out this evaluation
Copies of the Evaluation Report will be prepared and provided to the same groups that received
the Final Reports of the CLO and POMO.

7.0  POUCY
i Is the policy of AES Meghnaghat to provide a safe method in which to enter
confined spaces. The AES Confined Space Entry Program defines the procedure in
which all AES people and contractors will conduct themselves and activities
involved in confined space en"ry. Any variance from this procedure, without proper
authorization and documentation will be a direct violation of AES Meghnaghat
policy and may result in disciplinary action.
Additionally, AES Meghnaghat as a responsible employer, shall implement all
necessary safety measures to prevent unauthorized entry into confined spaces,
identify and evaluate the hazards of permit and non-permnit spaces before people enter
them and to develop and implement the means, procedures and practices necessary
for safe permit space entry operations.
2.0   PURPOSE
To protect individuals, contractors, and equipment from exposure to hazardous
materials and environments when working in or around a conrined space.
3.0   DEFINMONS
3.1   Permit required space:  A  space which has one of the following
characteristics:
3.1.1    Contains or has a potential to contain a hazardous atmosphere.
3.1.2    Contains a material that could engulf an entrant.
3.1.3    Has an internal configuration such that an entrant could be trapped
or be asphyxiated.
3.1.4    Not designed for continuous human occupancy.
3.1.5    Contains any other recogrnized serious safety or health hazards.
3.2   Non-permit required space: A confined space that does not contain with
respect to atmospheric hazards, or have the potential to contain any hazard
capable of causing death or serious physical harn.

with the injured person(s) and witnesses will be necessary to
gather the racts. Where possible, these interviews should be
conducted by the entire committee. There will be circumstances
where this will not be possible. In those cases it is recommended
that at least two people participate in every interview. The major
consideration in interviewing people, whether injured person or
witness, is to establish an atmosphere that is most conducive to
obtaining the complete facts about the event. People being
interviewed must be encouraged to feel that their testimony is an
Important part of the committee's effort to determine cause and
prevent a recurrence of the incident. The tone should be casual
and relaxed. A threatening atmosphere will not likely produce a
frank exchange of information. Someone should take notes. A
tape recorder may be used. At the conclusion of the interview.
someone on the committee should orally sumsnarize while the
person being interviewed is still present. The purpose is to be
certain that the committee members and the person being
interviewed agree on what information was presented in the
interview.
S.2.4    Incident Statement - After the committee has gathered all the facts
about the event that seems to be appropriate, they should then meet
to establish cause and coffective actions. As a first step in this
process it is suggested that the committee forsmulate a short
incident statement as a visible focus for their deliberations. This
statement should be in three parts: what was going on. what went
wrong, and what were the consequences. This exercise also helps
to be certain that everyone on the comnimitee Is in agreement as to
the basic facts of the incident.
S.2.5    Causes(s) - Establishing cause(s) Is a critical portion of the
evaluation process since it sets the basis for determining the
corrective action. The committee should not be content with only
the apparent cause(s) of the eveni but should strive to determine
the underlying root cause(s). Determine what safety system did

8.O  OBSERVE SAFE PRACTICES
NOTE: It Is not possible to anticipate every condition that will occur in the
performance of welding or cutting activities. Therefore, personnel must remain alert
to potential safety hazards and observe safe practices at all times.
&I   For work at more than five feet above the floor or ground, use a platform with
railings or use other fall protection equipment.
3.2   Wear respiratory protection as required for each situaton.
5.3   When welding in a conftned space, refer to the Confined Space Program for
safety precautions.
8.4   If welding or cuttisg in a confined space is stopped for a period of time:
8.4.1     Disconnect the power on arc welding or cutting units.
8.4.2     Remove the electrode from the holder.
8.43     Turn off the torch valves on gas units, shut off the gas supply at a
point outside the confmed area, and, if possible, remove the torch
and hose from the area.
5.5   After completing welding or cutting, barricade the area surrounding the hot
metal, have someone standby until metal is cool or post a waring sign to
keep people away from heated surfaces.
5.6   Follow safe housekeeping principles. Do not throw electrode or rod stubs on
the floor; discard them in proper waste containers. Keep tools and tripping
hazards off the floor and store them properly.
5.7   Follow manufacturer's instructions and practices when using equipment.
5.t   Obtain a Hot Work Pernit when welding except in the designated
maintenance welding area.

Emergency Response Plan
The purpose of this section is to establish and document the plans and organization necessary
to effectively cope with possible emergencies. The plans and procedure set down in the manual
are, for the most part, concerned with plant-wide emergencies and also emergencies that, while
not plant-wide, are of general enough nature that they might occur anywhere in the plant.
The usefulness of this manual depends on the timeliness of the information contained. It is the
responsibility of each individual to insure that the information contained in the section(s)
covering their area(s) of responsibility be kept current. All revisions should be communicated
to the Plant Safety Coordinator and Safety Steering Committee.
Plan Responsibilities
The following people are listed as contacts in the event an emergency should occur in their
respective areas. Additionally, these people can be contacted for further guidance on the
specific duties required in the Emergency Response Plan.

Maintaining an efficient emergency organization with procedures to cover emergency
conditions is essential to the safety and security of the people, the protection of the plant, the
products, and neighbors. The purpose of this plan is to provide this protection. It is designed as
simply as possible to allow maxirnum flexibility.
This manual has been prepared for the use of all AES Meghnaghat plant people and contains
the policies and procedures applicable to foreseeable plant emergencies, provision for adequate
emergency training, and designation of the plant functions related to receiving aid under the
911 Mutual Aid System.
The causes of serious emergencies may be broken down into three main categories:
1. Unexpected Operational Accidents - These may result in fires, explosions, or plant
shutdowns.
2. Forces of Nature - These may include severe windstorm, such as cyclones, tornadoes, hail,
heavy rains, floods, lightning, earthquake.
3. Deliberate Damage - This may occur because of malicious act, mischief, sabotage or direct
action.
Copies of the Emergency Response Plan will be available in the Control Room and in the
Safety Manual which will be provided to each person upon initial employment. All AES
Meghnaghat People and contractors shall comply with the requirements of this program.
WHAT CONSTITUTES A PLANT EMERGENCIES
The following emergency conditions are guides for activating the organization and procedure
outlined in this manual.
(a)   An emergency condition which cannot be controlled by the area people involved,
requiring immediate additional plant people assistance.
(b)   An emergency condition that presents real evidence of danger to the remainder of the
plant or to our neighbors.
The principle considerations in cases of emergencies are:
(a)   To rescue and provide medical care of injured persons.
(b)   To prevent spread of emergencies
(c)   To protect property already involved from further damage.
(d)   To perform basic functions necessary in relation to Items a, b, and c without
endangering the lives of plant people.

Reporting an Emergency (Preferred Method):
1.    Dial . for all emergencies (utilize the ...... paging system Channel .. or Channel... on
portable radios to contact the Control Room if you are not near a phone) and state:
a.    Who you are - (Your Name) at AES Meghnaghat
b. Location c.
c.    Return phone number u.
d.    What you want to respond - (Fire, Ambulance, Police; whatever the emergency
requires)
e.    Be sure that all information is understood and acknowledged before hanging up.
The Emergency Operator should hang up first.
2.    Notify the guard at the gate of assistance on the way.
3.    Initiate emergency call list. A call list will be maintained for superintendents and other
persons for emergency call in, depending on the situation.
4.    Organize available on-site people to help direct emergency units to area required as
someone familiar with area would help emergency unit/units a great deal.
5.    If the situation warrants, or is seen as getting more and more extended, notify
neighboring facilities for help, which is available on a mutual aid basis.
6.    DO NOT be afraid to call for help. It is better to have too much than not enough.
7.    Additional security should be called out as needed.
OUTSIDE INTEREST - A call list designating neighboring communities, industries, local, and
government agencies shall be maintained. They will be called as needed, based upon the type
and magnitude of the emergency. These calls will be initiated by the plant Manager or his
designate.
PLANT SECURITY - Control of outside traffic will be handled by the ........ police with the
assistance from the State Police or police in their municipal aid system
HEAVY EQUIPMENT - The Maintenance Area shall provide any heavy equipment such as
cranes or bulldozers. They will provide necessary people to operate the heavy machinery and
perform other maintenance work required.
EMERGENCY SUPPLIES - On-site gasoline, diesel fuel, and motor oil for vehicles will be
utilized as needed. Additional supplies will be arranged through the Storeroom.
EMERGENCY FEEDING - The Safety Coordinator will be responsible to make arrangements
for food supplies and personal items as required.
EVACUATION PROCEDURES - The decision to evacuate the entire plant will be made by
the Plant Manager or his designate based upon the magnitude of the emergency.
OPERATING AREAS - When a plant fire alarm sounds in the Control Room for a fire in an
operating area, only essential people to handle the emergency will be permitted to enter the
area. Only those persons responsible for shutting down equipment should remain in the
3



building. All non-essential people should vacate the building by way of the nearest possible
exit. The entire building will be evacuated if the situation is serious or imminent danger exists.
Direction and Assignments
OVERALL DIRECTIONS - EMERGENCY COORDINATOR - The Plant Manager, Area
Superintendents, or Control Room Technician, in that sequence based on availability, will
direct the overall emergency. The Control Room Technician on duty will assume the
responsibility of Emergency Coordinator until the Plant Manager or Area Superintendents
arrive.
COMMUNICATIONS - The Command Post will be the communications center. Normally, the
Command Post will be in the Control Room, but in the event of a major disaster requiring the
Control Room to be evacuated, an altemate command post will be designated upon the
situation.
FIREFIGHTING AND RESCUE - The Control Room technician on duty will assume the
responsibility of Emergency Coordinator until the Plant Manager or Area Superintendents
arrive. The name of the person in charge at the scene will be announced over the ...........
system. This person will remain in charge until relieved by someone else or until emergency is
over.
EMERGENCY FIRST AID - The ambulance at the command post will provide initial
treatment. Determination can then be made on additional assistance or medical treatment as
required. Some of the available AES Meghnaghat People that have been certified in
Emergency First Aid will be on hand to assist as needed.
NEWS MEDIA RELEASE - News releases will be made by the Plant Manager ONLY. His
permission is required before any news reporter can be admitted to the plant. See "News Media
Plan". It is to be followed if news media people show up for any reason.
PLANT SECURITY - No vehicles will enter the plant unless authorized by AES Meghnaghat.
Outside (non-AES Meghnaghat) people and vehicles will be removed from the plant as quickly
as possible. Only authorized people will be allowed to enter the plant.
First Aid Procedures
To be followed by trained AES Meghnaghat People
The following procedures cover some of the situations which have the potential of occurring
Comnmon sense and swift, correct action are vital factors in mitigating the damage caused in
any situation.
A.   CAUSTIC SODA, SULFURIC ACID, HYDROCHLORIC ACID EYE BURN
4



If even minute quantities of caustic, sulfuric acid, or hydrochloric acid, either in solid form or
liquid, enter the eye, they should be irrigated immediately and copiously with water. Prompt
irrigation of caustic and acid eye burns can not be overemphasized. The eyes should be
irrigated for a minimum of 15 minutes at the time and scene of the accident with "WATER"
before the patient is moved for further treatment. The eyelids should be held apart and the eye
rotated during the irrigation to insure contact of the "WATER" with all the tissues of the
surface of eye and lids. On arrival at the First Aid station, the eye should be irrigated with
"WATER" and given continuous irrigation for at least 15-20 minutes or more, depending upon
the extent of exposure. After the irrigation is complete, cover the eye with a sterile patch and
send the patient to physician.
B.   CAUSTIC SODA OR SULFURIC ACID BURNS OF THE BODY
A person who has had caustic/KOH or sulfuric acid spilled, splashed, or sprayed upon them
should be subjected immediately to a drenching shower of water. Their clothing should be
removed as quickly as possible, while they are under the shower and First Aid called at the
earliest possible moment. It is essential that all affected body surfaces be washed with copious
quantities of running water until all traces of the caustic or sulfuric acid have been removed.
After all traces of the Caustic/KOH or sulfuric acid have been removed, neutralize the area of
contact by washing with "Phosphate Buffer". After this on-the-spot treatment, the patient must
be transported to First Aid, for treatment. Call an ambulance and then inform the Control
ROOM. On the arrival at First Aid, the affected body surfaces are washed with "Phosphate
Buffer" for sulfuric acid bums and caustic /KOH bums. Make certain that all affected areas
have been thoroughly cleaned and free of all chemicals. If the bum is of a minor nature,
immersed the burned area in cold water until all pain subsides and cover with a sterile dressing.
In cases of severe or extensive bums, shock symptoms, such as rapid pulse, sweating, and
collapse, may occur at any time. If such symptoms should appear, keep the patient lying on
their back and keep them warm until he can be seen by a physician. NOTE: Do not use a spray
or ointment on the wound; cover with a sterile dressing.
C.   HYDROCLORIC BURNS OF THE BODY
A person who has had hydrochloric acid spilled, splashed, or sprayed upon them should be
subjected immediately to a drenching shower of water. Their clothing should be removed as
quickly as possible, while they are under the shower and First Aid called at the earliest possible
moment. It is essential that all affected body surfaces be washed with copious quantities of
running water for a sufficient time to remove all hydrochloric acid. The acid should not be
neutralized with alkaline solutions. Wash the affected are thoroughly with "Phosphate Buffer"
solution. After the affected are is thoroughly washed with water and "Phosphate Buffer", the
patient must be transported for further treatment. On arrival, the affected body surfaces are
given additional cleaning, if necessary, with water and "Phosphate Buffer" solution.
If the burn is of a minor nature, a topical anesthetic is applied to the burned area and covered
with sterile dressing.
5



N
D.   ELECTRIC SHOCK
Keep the victim lying down with the feet slightly elevated unless there are chest injuries. Cover
victim with blanket or other covering to keep warm. Do not cause sweating. Put sterile dressing
on bums. In electrical accidents, the shock is likely to affect the patient's heart and lung action.
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation may be required.
E.    CARDIAC AND RESPIRATORY ARREST
Check for breathing by listening for airflow at mouth and nose, look for breathing movements
and feel for air exchanges. If none of these are present, clear airway and begin artificial
respiration and check carotid pulse to insure heart is beating. Transport patient to hospital and
continue artificial respiration until patient is breathing on his own or until relieved by hospital
people.
F.    HEART ATTACK
Keep patient at rest and comfortable in sitting position. Have someone call paramedic Rescue
Unit .   Star administering oxygen immediately. It is important that the . It is important that
the patient's condition be stabilized before being transported. If cardiac arrest occurs, begin
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and continue until relieved by paramedics. Signs of Cardiac
Arrest:
-  No respiration
-  No pulse
-  Dilated Pupils
G.    GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR SERIOUS INJURY
1.    Render immediate assistance to the injured to the maximum extent possible.
2.    If possible, at least one person should remain with the injured while another seeks help.
The emergency number..... should be called.
3.    Call the guard at the main gate to guide the ambulance to the exact location of the
injured.
4.    Do not move the injured unless absolutely necessary to protect them from further harn.
Us extraordinary care and conmnon sense in handling the patients to avoid aggravating
their condition.
5.    If breathing has stopped, check for a pulse. If a pulse is not present, start CPR
Immediately.
6.    If there is bleeding, use the closest and cleanest available piece of cloth directly over
the wound, using your full hand to apply direct pressure to the bandage over the wound.
7.    A seriously injured person is usually in shock. Keep the body warm by using blankets
or other suitable protection available, underneath as well as over the body. If possible,
elevate the feet at least six inches and attempt at all times to keep the head lower than
the feet.
6



8.    Talk to the patient. Attempt to calm and encourage him by assuring him that he will be
"okay" and that expert medical attention will soon arrive. Do not allow people to crowd
around the injured, and by all means remain calm yourself.
H.   MEDICAL EMERGENCY
1.    Determine extent of injury or illness.
2.    Start First Aid measures as required.
3.    If needed, Dial ....... and state:
a.    Who you are (name) at AES Meghnaghat Plant
b.    Location   -..........................................
c.    Your return phone number ....................
d.    Response needed - Ambulance, Police, Fire Fighting, etc.
4.    Arrange for an AES Meghnaghat person to meet the ambulance or other emergency
response vehicle on Route: ............. To direct them to the scene of emergency.
5.    Notify Area Superintendent of Plant Manager. They will initiate the call list as needed.
6.    If decision is made to notify injured person's family, use on eof the superintendents and
someone that knows the family, if all possible.
7.    Fill out Accident/ Incident Investigation Report while details are fresh on everybody's
mind. Record statements if at all possible.
8.    Make photos if at all possible (if an accident has occurred)
Evacuation Plan
The intent of this procedure is to provide for the safety and health of everyone working or
visiting in the plant in the event of an emergency. Our primary concern is to first remove
everyone exposed to the danger and then attempt to control the source of danger.
The purpose of this procedure is to alert non-essential people in the plant and office areas to
immediately evacuate the plant upon the sounding of the alarn and to gather at the Primary
assembly point for accountability. This location is the ................ area of the
....................... .Te secondary point is the .You will be instructed by your
Area Superintendent upon arrival at the Primary assembly point if the Secondary point of
assembly is to be used. The reason for the primary location is to be sufficiently close to the
plant so that response efforts can be coordinated with minimal distance to the plant.
All people evacuating to the Primary or Secondary location will be accounted for by their
respective Area Superintendents. Each Area Superintendent will ensure that their area people
are accounted for. Each person should ensure that they are accounted for to avoid unnecessary
searches that could place other people at risk.
Essential people will remain to place the plant in a safe condition. These people will be on-shift
team and any other people that they request for assistance. The goal is to place the plant in as
safest condition as possible taking into consideration the severity of the plant emergency. The
Emergency Coordinator (Plant Manager or his designate) will determine the best condition for
7



the plant and ensure that it is placed without undue danger for the plant technicians. The
Emergency Coordinator will make the decision as to whether or not to evacuate the Control
Room. If a shutdown of the plant is decided upon or has occurred, the following minimum
conditions should be attained before a complete evacuation, if possible.
I.    Turbine and generator shutdown: turbine on the turning gear.
2.    MFT on the boiler; boiler feed via the LOP to maintain some cooling to the
boilers.
3.    All non-essential systems shut-down. These would include: boiler feed pumps,
Condensate Pumps, PA/SA fans, all blowers, circulating wateT pumps, etc.
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION - The Control Room technician on duty will assume the
responsibility of Emergency Coordinator until the Plant Manager or Area Superintendents
arnve.
PEOPLE ACTION REQUIRED - Upon activation of the plant alarm (a verbal announcement
over the ...      paging system), all non-essential people in the plant should evacuate by as
direct a route as practical and in an orderly fashion to the primary assembly point. The elevator
should be avoided due to potential problems. Non-AES Meghnaghat people shall be escorted
by an AES Meghnaghat person.
ALARM TEST - The Plant Annunciating system (............. ) will be tested each Wednesday
at 12 noon unless it has been used in the last 24 hours. An announcement will be made over the
P.A. System alerting everyone it is a test.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE MANAGEMENT TEAM - The Emergency Response Team will
consist of the Plant Manager and all superintendents whose area is not affected by the
emergency. This team will report to the Services Building conference room or the Maintenance
Building as required so decisions on responding to the existing emergency can be made and
executed.
Fire Prevention
EQUIPMENT SYSTEM TO PREVENT / CONTROL IGNITIONS OF FIRE -
All AES Meghnaghat buildings are equipped with fire and security alarms. These alarms are
maintained and monitored continuously by the Control Room. They are inspected biannually
by .................
Monitoring systems relating to fire and sprinkler system control are as follows:
Signal A - Sprinkler activation. Each sprinkler is fitted with a sensor device which
detects any flow of water. A discharge from one sprinkler head will trigger
the device.
8



Signal B -  Sprinkler valve position. Each sprinkler valve is fitted with a device which
is activated if the valve is in any position other than fully open.
Signal C -  Dry pipe system. Each dry pipe is fitted with an air pressure which is
activated if the residual system drops below ............ psi.
Signal D -  Building Temperature. These monitors are activated if the inside
temperature drops below a pre-selected level, usually . degree Celsius.
For a Signal A response, the Control Room would immnediately notify the ....... .. .... will
respond with apparatus on the assumption that an open sprinkler head is caused by a fire of
some considerable size.
The Control Room will have a list of several key people to contact. Please be aware of the
following consideration:
1.    The only source of automatic detection and alarn we have is sprinkler water flow and
smoke detectors.
2.    Never assume that because the sprinklers are opening, the Fire Department has been
notified. They should always be called by the Control Room Technician.
3.    Each sprinkler valve is equipped with water driven bell which rings outside the
building when a sprinkler head opens. This will not activate the Control Room alarm,
which has a delayed timer incorporated to prevent surge triggering.
Sprinkler System
The entire complex is protected by a series of "Ordinary Hazard" wet and dry pipe sprinkler
systems installed in accordance with NFPA standards and approved by the ...........
Should it ever necessary to turn off any portion of the sprinkler system, proceed as follows:
1. Notify the Control Room Technician at (Tel No .......... / Ext. No. )
2. Keep sprinkler repair time to a minimum. Allow no cutting, welding or flamrnmable
materials in the affected areas.
3. To restore service, close all drains and charge the system slowly. When full pressure is
realized, advise agencies listed in Step 1 and 2.
Fire Hazards
The major fire hazards in the building are electrical, chemical, compressed gases and
flammable metals. The fire extinguishers placed appropriately placed appropriately throughout
the facility for use by trained individuals.
List of Potential Fire Hazards and Locations
The AES Meghnaghat facility has a total of ( number....) of oil tanks, mechanical equipment
containing amounts of oil and (number..... ) Lubricating Oil Conditioner, (number ...... ) areas

*  Station Auxiliary Transformer            ........          ........... liters
*  Services Building
*  Generation Building
House Keeping
Good housekeeping procedures will be followed to control accumulations of flammnable and
combustible waste materials and residues so that they do not contribute to a fire emergency.
This includes contractor collection and disposal oily rags, designated smoking areas are
separate from the fire hazards, and certification of welders.
Training
AES Meghnaghat will train all its people on the elements of this Emergency Response Plan.
This will help assure safe and orderly evacuations and help protect the person in the event of an
emergency. AES Meghnaghat will train all its people on any plan changes, when a person's
responsibility changes, and/or the inception of the plan. The Plant Safety Coordinator or a
designated person will review this plan with a new person's orientation and annually thereafter.
Cyclones
If it appears that a severe c will affect the Narayanganj Area, plans ma be made to shut down        -
all or most of the plant. Only critical item will be kept operating. Since cyclones are very
10



erratic in nature, the plant will not be shut down until it appears certain that the are will be
seriously affected.
w
The Plant Manager and Area Superintendents will carefully follow the course of the cyclone to
determine when the plant should shut down to allow time for people to go home before the
weather or road gets too bad to travel. Everyone will be expected to report for work on their
normal shift unless advised otherwise.
Shut-down of the operating units will commence in Phase III and will be in the normal plant
shutdown sequence. Specific timing for the above will be determined by the Plant Manager or
the designated Area Superintendent on Cyclone duty.
Cyclone Alert Phases
The following alert phases are based on the number of miles a cyclone is from our plant
locations with an average rate of travel of 10 mph over water. It must be understood that three
phases are to be used as a guide only, and each cyclone will be dealt with individually as it
develops and progresses.
Phase I - 750 Mile Alert
-    Plant Manager advised of cyclone possibility.
-    Review organization and procedure checklists for people and shutdown,
including equipment and supplies list.
-    Storeroom  supervisor to check for food rations and bedding for cyclone
emergencies. Food supplies, toiletries, and personal needs should be stored in
the .Building.
Phase II - 500 Mile Alert
-   The Plant Manager and Area Superintendents estimate landfall hour of storm
and sets priorities for shutdown decisions.
-    Maintenance begins checklists to secure plant.
-    Contractors advised to follow requirements to secure and prepare for shutdown
of work.
-    Storm standby crew released from plant to secure home and families 36 hours
prior to projected landfall.
Phase II - 30 Hour Alert
-    Plant Manager or his designate confirms predicted landfall hour and makes go
or no-go decisions for plant shutdown.
-    Weather stations manned continuously.
-   Area Superintendents inspect areas to verify that they are properly secured and
equipped to meet storm.
II



Storm standby crew returns to plant prior to landfall of the storm.
All non-essential people released; Area people will be released as shutdowns
are completed and volunteer people take over.
Purchasing has perishable food rations, personal items, and bedding delivered
to main control room for standby crews.
Deliver emergency supply kits to assigned areas.
Radios distributed to designated locations.
ACTIVITY COORDINATION
If and when a cyclone seems imminent, the Plant Manager and Area Superintendents will be
notified at the plant or at their homes of the cyclone's potential as forecasts are received. From
the information, they will declare when the different preparation phases are reached (750 Mile
Alert, 500 Mile Alert, and 30 Hour Alert), and alerts plant people.
The plant may maintain full or partial operations if the cyclone passes nearby. The exact steps
and timing for plant shutdown are based on information available at the time. The Plant
Manager and Area Superintendents will hold periodic meetings to evaluate the information and
plant accordingly. The decision and timing of a shutdown will be based on the analysis of the
weather data collected and the shutdown, if necessary, will be coordinated in a manner to
minimize production losses.
As each unit is shut down, the superintendent for that particular area will satisfy himself/herself
that the unit has been placed in a safe standby condition prior to releasing his/her shutdown
people.
As soon as the storm subsidies, AES Meghnaghat People should return to the plant and survey
the damage and take steps necessary to resume operation. Everyone should report back to the
plant on their regular schedule after the storm has passed unless otherwise notified. Startup will
be coordinated by the same people or their counterparts that coordinate shutdown.
The Area Superintendents will have the responsibility for securing their areas and in the
coordinating of cyclone activities which include:
I.      Seeing that Control Room is properly staffed.
2.      Responsible for contacting vendor for supplies at appropriate times of
preparation, through the Storeroom Supervisor.
3.      Distribution of cyclone supplies including perishables to the Control Room.
4.      Scheduling plant security for cyclone coverage.
5.      Transmission of message to local radio stations for broadcasting.
6.      Arranging for up-dates on storm progress and plant status.
COMMUNICATIONS
A.   Weather Information - In the vent of a cyclone that is detected within 750 miles, the
control room will be designated as our Weather Station. The location, direction of    )
12



travel, date and time of cyclone will be maintained on a plotting map. Bangladesh
Meteorological Department information will be made available to the supervisors. Any
weather information transmitted out of the plant should be funneled through the Control
Room. Particular care should be exercised in passing along this.
B.   Communications - It is our practice to operate the plant continuously whenever
possible and to get back in operation as soon as possible after a shutdown. Unless
notified otherwise, everyone should come to work on a regular schedule. Whenever
there is reasonable doubt about plant operations, proceed as follows:
Contact a superintendent, or other plant supervision so that up to date information and
instructions concerning your work schedule. Keep a record of the superintendent's
home phone numbers. It is your responsibility to keep in touch with your
superintendent to know your work schedule.
SUPPLIES
Two lists of emergency supplies have been complied with one being for plant needs and the
other being for needs for those people staying in the plant during the cyclone shutdown. The
plant needs will include such things as emergency generators for the control center, potable air
compressors, ice, materials for boarding up and tying down, water supply, fuel supply, etc.
The Support Services Area Superintendent will coordinate accumulating these supplies during
a        fithe 500 Mile Alert phase.
Supplies for people who will be staying in the plant during a plant shutdown will include such
items as food, cots, pillows, sheets, toiletries, kerosene stoves, lanterns, additional flashlights
and batteries, etc. Accumulation of these items will be coordinated by the Storeroom
Superintendent both prior to and during cyclone alerts. These items will be distributed to the
various control centers during the 30 Hour Alert phase.
PLANT COVERAGE
People remaining in the plant after it is shut down for a hurricane will do so on a voluntary
basis, and will be selected by the Area Superintendent. These volunteers will be allowed time
off prior to the shutdown to relocate their families or protect their property. Following is a list
of people required for the control center and where they will be located.
1.    Control Room
One (1) Superintendent
Two (2) Control Room Technicians
2.    Maintenance and Additional People

Emergency News Media Plan
It must be recognized that the press has a legitimate interest in plant emergencies that attract
outside public interest. In such a situation, the press is our liaison with the public. It is to AES
Meghnaghat' benefit to cooperate with the news media in a reasonable way when a major
emergency occurs. This is our best guarantee that news will be factual and accurate and to
prevent spreading of rumors. Improperly handled news media is time of major emergencies can
destroy, in a few hours, all of the press and public goodwill built up over a period of years.
RESPONSIBILITY - The Plant Manager, or the designated representative, will act as News
Media Coordinator during all plant emergencies. In the absence of the Plant Manager, the
14



designated representative will assume this duty. No other person is authorized to give
information to the news media and such inquiries must be directed to the News Media
Coordinator (Plant Manager) or other above-designated people. Note See News Media
Handling During Off Hours.
PRESS ROOM: LOCATION AND PROCEDURE - All news media persons will be stopped at
the security gate entering the plant. They will not be allowed into the plant until the Plant
Manager or the designated Area Superintendent is present to escort them. The press escort will
take them to the area designated as the Conference Room. A map to be used in such press
conferences for pointing out the area involved in the emergency shall be available there. A
radio for monitoring news releases going out over the air will also be on hand so that incorrect
or false information can be corrected immediately.
1.         In emergencies that involve the news media, the News Media Coordinator will
go to the conference room and be prepared to receive the reporters, TV station
people, etc. he guard will escort these people to the Press Room. None will be
allowed to enter the plant at the time the actual emergency exists.
2.          One of the News Media Coordinator alternates should be instructed to go the
emergency area and contact the area supervisor for information to be released.
This person is to remain there and funnel accurate and factual information from
the emergency area to the News Media Coordinator at the Press Room for
evaluation and release to the news media. The Safety Coordinator or Plant
Manager's office will be utilized for discussions away from the news media.
^        3.           Refer all inquiries from the news media to the News Media Coordinator at the
Press Room.
4.          The News Media Coordinator will clear a factual release as soon as possible. If
the nature of emergency does not permit such a release immediately, they
should be told briefly of the situation and advise that one will be issued shortly,
if at al possible.
5.          Releases containing information on injured persons or name of the specific unit
involved will not be made until the family of the person has been notified.
6.          News media members who come to the plant may have a press conference with
the Plant Manager if necessary.
7.          After the emergency subsidies, the responsibility of admitting reporters and
photographers to the scene will be that of the Plant Manager. If they are
permitted to enter the plant, they must be issued hard hats, safety glasses, and
other equipment as needed at the guard office and be escorted by an AES
Meghnaghat person.
NEWS MEDIA HANDLING DURING OFF HOUR EMERGENCIES
It is the responsibility of the shift Control Room Technician to act as temporary News Media
Coordinator until the Plant Manager or one of the designated alternates arrives at the plant. The
acting News Media Coordinator should make sure the Plant Manager or one of the alternates is
notified that they are needed. In the event that members of the news media reach the plant
before the Plant Manager or one of the alternates, they will be held outside the guard office and
is



told: "We have had an emergency. At the moment we do not know how serious. We will let you
know as soon as additional information is available." Do not leave the media people
unattended. The same information will be given on telephone inquiries from the news media.
Be sure to take the name and telephone number of the person making the inquiry and give this
to the News Media Coordinator or alternate when he arrives. When the Plant Manager or his
alternate arrives at the plant, he will escort news media people to the Press Room.
GENERAL COMMENT
RELASE OF DETAILED INFORMATION - Questions should not be answered which may
injure our Company's competitive position in the industry such as information on unannounced
research, production figures, value of Company property dollar loss suffered, sales volume
suffered, insurance coverage, etc. No questions will be answered anonymously
THE FIRST RELEASE - The common tendency after a fire, explosion, etc., is to exaggerate the
scope and extent of the emergency. Consequently, it is of the utmost importance to give out
accurate infornation on the size of he emergency, even though the facts may still be limited, as
soon as possible in order that the news media may give the proper information to the public.
NEWS MEDIA OURS OF THE SECNE - The news media will probably want to visit the scene
of the emergency. They may be permitted to do so if such visit can be made safely into the
plant will be made by the Plant Manager (or in his absence, an Area Superintendent).
If the emergency scene is close to a restricted or confidential operation which cannot be
photographed, this fact should be made known to the visitors in advance and an understanding
reached that they will not be allowed to enter or photograph such restricted areas.
As soon as a decision is reached for such a tour, the News Media Coordinator, or one of the
alternates, should escort them to the area and stay with them the entire time they are inside the
plant. An accurate list of all news media who came to the plant, when they go to the scene, and
when they leave, should be kept.
IDENTIFICAA T1ON OF INJURED AND AREAS INVOL VED - Efforts will be made as soon
as possible to notify the families of any injured persons before releasing such names for
publication. This same policy should apply to identifying the specific plant area or unit
involved in the emergency since this also tends to identify who might be injured. This should
be explained to the news media.
IMPORTANCE OFA 7TITUDE TOWARDS NEWS MEDIA -It is impossible to plan in advance
for every detail that may arise in an emergency. The most important help will be the attitude of
plant people working with the news media. It is not wise to try to cover up the incident. It is
regrettable, but not a disgrace, to have an emergency condition within the plant. To have one in
print after it has been denied can be vary embarrassing. Remember that the news media has
free access to hospitals, the coroner, fire and police departments, as well as AES Meghnaghat
16



people. They will get the news from someone, so seeing that they get it correctly is ital. The
photographer will also get his pictures somehow, so that they are the accurate ones.
METHOD OF GIVING OUT INFORMATION- The news media will not be content with
using a formal statement that may be handed to them. Therefore, we must be prepared to
answer their questions for publication. It is advisable to refuse to answer questions. This does
not mean that only verbal statements should be given out, or that everybody should give out
statements. To insure accuracy and assist the reporters when they write their stories, a prepared
statement should be given along with suitable background material. A media briefing paper
giving background and general information should be prepared in advance and up-dated
periodically.
POINTS TOI REMEMBER - In describing the emergency and what is taking place, there are
several things that should be kept in mind:
1.    Be careful how you describe the raw materials or finished products that are
involved. We want the release to be factual and not exaggerated.
2.    Place strong emphasis on the fact the emergency is or was, being handled by
trained people.
3.   If the news media insist on an "eye-witness-account", of the emergency, a
qualified witness should be available for interview; however, he should be
cautioned beforehand about speculating on causes of the emergency.
Bomb Threat
The purpose of this bomb threat plan is to provide guidance and establish procedures for those
people who may be required to take information concerning a bomb threat and/or help search
for such a device. A copy of this procedure should be readily available at the switchboard
operator's desk and in the Control Room.
The individual receiving a bomb threat by phone, mail or any other method must obtain as
much information as possible. If possible he/she will complete the questions listed below
during the conversation with the caller:
1.    When will it explode?
2.    Location of device?
3.    Appearance of device?
4.    Type of device?
5.    What will cause it explode?
6.    Did you place the bomb?
7.    Why?
8.    What is your name and address?
9.    Other pertinent data
a.    Date and time of call
b.    Exact wording of caller
10.   During the call, from an opinion of the callers' possible:

Upon completion of the conversation notify the following:
1.    Plant Manager
2.    Control Room Superintendent
ACTIONS BY MANAGEMENT - Evaluate threat and contact the following for assistance, if
needed:
1.    Police Department
2.    Fire Department
3.    Medical People
Establish Contact Center (should be predetermined) based upon any information concerning
location of bomb. If no information is known, the main conference room will be Control
Center.
THREA TASSESSMENT - The assessment of a bomb threat is the responsibility of the Plant
Manager. As a guide, a threat may be assessed as potentially genuine under the following
circumstances:
-    Intelligence from police indicating that the threat may involve real bomb.
-    A suspicious package or object is discovered.
-    The caller gives specific locations and details.
Should it be deternined that a search is necessary, alert everyone by intercom message. Should
an intercom message be appropriate, the following might be stated:
"Attention everyone! Please standbyfor an emergency message. We have received a
bomb threat. This is a bomb search message. Everyone is to commence a bomb search
of their immediate or designated area. When a search ofyour area is complete, notify
your superintendent. All superintendents are to report information to the Control
Room. "DO NOT EVA CUA TE UNTIL DIRECTED."
SUPERINTENDENTS - Search your own area first. Utilize people who have completed a
search of their immediate or designated area to search other public areas.

3.0    SITE DESCRIPTION
The site is twenty two kilometres to the south east of Dhaka. It lies just to the west side of the
main road to Comiilla, on a promontory in the Megna river. The land is currently being
prepared for installation of electricity generating plants in three phases, by raising the ground
to some ten metres above the river level. The proposed AES-Meghnaghat power station will
occupy Phase 1, which is the plot closest to the main road. The situation is illustrated in
figures I and 2.
The villages of Islampur and Ganga Nagar are on the same promontory as the proposed power
station. They lie close to the south-east corner and north side of the site, respectively. Several
villages also lie along the north shore of the Magna river, between one to two kilometres
away across the water. Brick, cement and paper manufacturing facilities are within one
kilometre to the east.
4.0    PLANT DESCRIPTION
The plant will be of the combined cycle gas turbine type (CCGT): Electricity is first generated
as in the traditional "open cycle" process, by a gas turbine that drives a generator. However,
in the modern CCGT technology, the hot exhaust gases from the gas turbine are then used to
produce steam, which drives a conventional steam turbine generator. In this way, additional
electricity is produced from the same amount of fuel.
After the exhaust gases have been used to produce the steam, they will be dispersed into the
777          atmosphere via a tall chimney. The primary fuel will be natural gas from the pipeline that runs
adjacent to the site. The cooling water that is required for the steam turbine will be abstracted
from and discharged into the Megna River.
The situation is illustrated schematically in figure 3.
Of the commercially viable methods for generating electricity by combustion of fossil fuels,
CCGT technology is acknowledged as the most environmentally desirable:
* Energy conversion efficiency is in the order of 55%, as compared to 35 to 38% for an
open cycle gas turbine or a conventional steam turbine. As well as entailing attractive
economics, this technology, therefore, achieves corresponding reductions in emissions of
carbon dioxide, the main gas implicated in the global wanning phenomenon.
* Nitrogen oxide emissions are significantly lower than for the other methods. They are
typically around 50 ppmV or better, this is in contrast to several hundred ppmV for the
alternative technologies.
* The process water demands are only about one third of those required by conventional
steam generation technology and, hence, releases of water-borne pollutants to the
environment are similarly reduced. This is because two thirds of the power is generated
directly by the gas turbines, which require neither condenser cooling water nor de-
mineralised water for production of steam.
Furthermore, when natural gas is used as the principal fuel, significant additional benefits are
available:
*  carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by a further 25% per unit of electricity generated
*  nitrogen oxide emissions are typically reduced by a further 50%



sulphur dioxide emissions are virtually zero.
At the AES Meghnaghat plant, natural gas will be the only fuel, thus also avoiding the need
for large bulk storage tanks, with their visual impacts and risks of a serious spillage.
Despite these very significant benefits of the CCGT technology, as for any large industrial
development, there is still potential for adverse affects on the surrounding environment, both
in its construction as well as operational phase. These will be addressed in the Environmental
Impact Assessment, which will be carried out to the standards of the funding agencies and the
government of Bangladesh, to ensure that adequate mitigation measures are included in the
planning and design.
5.0    RELEVANT REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES
5.1    World Bank
The World Bank publications of most relevance to the Environmental Impact Assessment are
listed below:
* Guidance for Preparation of a Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan (January 1996)
*  Operational Procedure (OP) 4.01: Environmental Assessment (September 1998)
* Policy on Disclosure of Information (September 1998)
*  Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook, Part III, Thermal Power: Guidelines for
New Plants (July 1998)
5.2    Bangladesh Government
The Government of Bangladesh have issued their guidelines for canrying out an acceptable
Environmental Impact Assessment, in the publication, "EIA Guidelines for Industries"
Department of the Environment and Forest, (June 1997).
A  document which conveniently summaries all the various regulations and environmental
quality and pollutant discharge limits, has been produced by the Bangladesh Centre for
Advanced Studies. It is entitled, "Guide to the Environmental Conservation Act 1995 and
Rules 1997".
5.3   Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL)
IDCOL has its own formal guidelines for this type of study. They are similar to those of the
World Bank and are contained in the IDCOL publication, "The Environmental and Social
Framework" (May 1997).
5.4    Asian Development Bank
The ADB requirements of most relevance can be found in their publication, " Environmental
Guidelines for Selected Industrial and Power Development Projects", (1990).



6.0   STAKEHOLDERS
This Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan is a fundamental part of the consultation
process, as required by the World Bank. The Bank policy states that project sponsors must
"meaning fully consult with stakeholders (*) on the preparation and results of all Category-
A Environmental Assessments and disclose to the public the results of the Environmental
Assessment Process". The proposed power station falls into Category-A.
(*)Stakeholders are individuals or groups of people who are likely to be affected or can
affect the outcome of a proposed project. The main stakeholders in the case of Meghnaghat
power station proposal are listed below.
* Government Organisations;
-     Department of the Environment
-     Department of Fisheries
-     District Commissioner ( Narayanganj)
-     Thana Executive Officer ( Sonargoan)
Chairman of the Pirozpur Union Parishad (Meghnaghat)
Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company
a   -  Bangladesh Power Development Board
* Non-government Organisations;
-     World Conservation Union (IUCN)
-      3Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies
-     The industries which are close to the site
* Public;
- Representatives and individual residents of Islampur, Ganga Nagar and the nearby
villages on the north shore.
7.0   PREVIOUS PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE
Consultation was carried out for the previous Environmental Impact Assessment of 1996-97.
The findings are summarised below:
7.1    Department of the Environment (DOE)
The DoE is responsible for all environmental matters, from planning to management and
monitoring, and for providing technical services to the Ministry of Environment and Forests,
of which it is a part. It was, therefore, the only government department consulted. The
Director General emphasised the need to comply with the relevant standards and confirmed



that the DoE would accept the EIA Report if it complied with the ADB guidelines.
The DoE is now the body responsible for enforcement of the recently enacted primary item of
environmental legislation, the Environmental Conservation Act (1995) and Rules (1997).
7.2    Non-government Organisations (NGOs)
This part of the exercise involved senior representatives of the World Conservation Union
(IUCN) office in Dhaka and the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS). Both
representatives expressed their support for introduction of the EIA process to Bangladesh. It
was said that the Meghnaghat project should become a good example of how EIA is used to
incorporate environmental considerations in the design and planiing of large industrial
developments.
The IUCN requested that the ELA Report address the question of whether the use of natural
gas for power generation is in the national interest or whether it should be put to more cost-
effective applications.
In response to this request, the EIA Report referred to studies that show the national
recoverable reserves of gas to be adequate for both power generation and the other uses. It
also explained that in comparison with gas supply network, coal mines, which represent the
only other likely source of fossil fuel, are still poorly developed.
7.3    Neighbouring Villages
Representatives of Islampur, Ganga Nagar and the villages on the north shore were
interviewed. The people at the first two of these villages, which are vezy close to the site,
were well inforrmed about the project, but on the north shore some explanation was necessary.
The representatives were generally in support of the project, on the condition that adequate
compensation is provided for loss of land and amenity.
As a result of the interviews, the EIA Report recommended the following mrinimum
requirements:
Assure the residents of Islampur that they will not be resettled or relocated.
Provide adequate compensation for,land loss, according to Bangladesh and World Bank
guidelines.
Provide jobs during construction for at least one member of each family who have lost land to
the project.
Provide jobs during construction for others from nearby villages.
Other possible improvements were also suggested: for the villages of Islampur and Ganga
Nagar
* Provision of running water and street lighting
* Access to the power station medical facilities.
* Construction of a primnary school.
* Renovation of the two mosques.



_!_             8.0    FUTURE PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE
The future public consultation and disclosure programme will be carried out in two stages:
* The first stage will be coincident with early part of the environmnental compact
assessment work, in July an August 1999.
-For the government and non - government organisations, face- to - face discussions will
be arranged with senior representatives. At these meetings, the organisations will be
presented with .a copy of this PCDP, to explain the consultation process and how it is
integration into -the wider project.
-For the local public, the initial consultation will take place coincident with the socio-
economic survey. This will cover a representative sample of families in the six villages
around the site, by means of a questionnaire. A brief, one page, summary of this Plan, in
the Bengali language, will be presented to each interviewee (See Appendix).
* The second stage will take place after issue of the Draft EIA Report. It will involve three
public meetings;
-At the project site for the local stakeholders.
-At the project site for womens' groups in the area..
-In Dhaka, at national level, for the government and non-government organisations
For this stage, a fact sheet will be issued, explaining the project and summarising the EIA
findings, in both the English and Bengali languages.
The stakeholders' responses will be recorded and the EIA Report will then be completed,
taking their responses into account.



APPENDIX:
THE  AES  MEGHNAGHAT  POWER  STATION  PROJECT: PUBLIC
CONSULTATION FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Several feasibility studies and the latest Power Station Master Plan have identified a need for
additional electricity generating capacity in Bangladesh. The Meghnaghat site has been
recommended for the installation of some of this additional capacity. The site is 22km to the
south east of Dhaka and lies just to the west side of the new Magna River road bridge.
The plant will be built, owned and operated by the AES Corporation of the USA. It will
supply electricity to the Bangladesh Power Development Board for an initial period of 22
years.
The power plant will be of a modern combined cycle gas turbine type (CCGT) and will be
fuelled by natural gas from the nearby pipeline. When compared with the older methods of
generating electricity by burning using gas, oil or coal, this technology is the most
environmentally friendly:
-  It produces 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel.
* Pollutants released into the air are reduced by ten times or more.
*  Water is reduced by three times.
*  There is no need for very large oil storage tanks, which are an eyesore and pose the risk
of serious water pollution by spillages.
Financing for the project will be via the Infrastructure Development Company Lirnited
(IDCOL). Therefore, despite the many advantages of this technology, an Environmental
Impact Assessment to the World Bank standards, must be carried out before the funding will
be provided. At this time, it is believed that the main issues are likely to be:
* The effect on local air quality by release of the exhaust gases.
* Noise nuisance because some villages are close to the site.
*  The effects on the Magna River water close to site, by the warm water that will be
discharged.
As part of the Environmental Impact Assessment, members of the public as well as
government and non - government organisations must be consulted, so that their concerns can
be taken into account in the project planning and power station design.
The consultation will be two parts:
*  The first part will be at the beginning of the Environmental Impact Assessment, in July
1999. It will take the form of interviews and questionnaires.
* The second part will be just before the end of the Environmental Impact Assessment,
about October 1999
During the second part, meetings will be held to bring together interested parties. A brochure
in both English and Bengali, will also be produced to sunumarise the findings of the                 )
Environmental Impact Assessment. This brochure will be available to the public.

SECTION 8
PUBLIC AND STATUTORY BODY INVOLVEMENT
8.1          INTRODUCTION
Formal and informal consultation exercises were undertaken as part of the Environmcntal Impact
Assessment process with both statutory consultees and non-govemmcnt organisations. Informal
consultation was the preferred method employed to obtain the views of affected groups uithin the vicinity
of the proposed site.
Statutory and Government consultees act initially as an important source of information during the scoping
and baseline collection exercises. More importantly, consultation may be used to influence development
decisions if information is received at an appropriate stage of the planning process. Therefore, statutory
bodies such as the Department of the Environment, Ministry of Environment and Forests have been
consulted from the outseL
Consultation with non-statutory bodies and the local population also fulfils the additional role of ensuring
that all interested parties are represented and that those parties feel eventual decisions were arrived at
equitably.
Mott Ewbank Preece have considered the abovc philosophy when entering into consultations with the
various bodies and have sought to comply with the requirements of the World Bank Operational Directive
(October 1989) for Statutory and Non-statutory consultations.
8.2          CONSULTATION WITH STATUTORY BODIES
82.1         Background
The Department of the Environment represents the national govemment agency responsible for
environmental planning, management and monitoring in Bangladesh, as well as being responsible for
providing technical services to the Ministry of Environment and Forests. Hence only DoE were consulted
on this project.
8.2.2        Consultation with the Department of the Environment
A meeting was held with the Director General of the Department of the Environment, Ministry of
Environment and Forests. It was stssed at the meeting that relevant environmental standards should be
complied with and that DoE would accept the EIA report in undertaken if accordance with ADB
Guidelines.
83           CONSULTATION WITH NON-STATUTORY BODIES
83.1         Background
There are a large number of Non-government Organisations operating within the Dhaka area. Many of
these organisations are privately funded and many have limited resources with which to operate.
8.3.2        Meeting with IUCN
A rneeting was held with the Director of the World Conservation Union (TUCN) office of Dhaka. A brief
project outline was provided and his comments were invited. The comments are summarised below:
F.'fNtXftOEXCnUaX0&ULW7?-EM1SEcmAfl       5-Inn Fl J



IUCN is pleased that a full environmental impact assessment study is being underta;ken to the Asian
Development Bank requirements. Specially, it was mentioned that:
*       T he Meghnaghat area is not covered by any wet land areas or other protected areas.
The EIA report should address the issue whether the use of natural gas for power generation is
in the national interest or could it be used more cost effectively for other applications.
Natural gas and coal are the country's two most important natural energy sources. Namural gas fields are
well developed and a network exists for its supply to various parts of the country. Coal mines are yet less
developed and hence the reliability and availability of coal to support large power projects is speculative.
On the other hand. the acceptable figure for recoverable reserves of gas is now 10.2 tonnes per cubic foot
compared with a figure of 3.5 tonnes per cubic foot in 1985. Many reports have indicated that the potential
recoverable gas reserves are very much greater than the current figures would seem to indicate.
The proportion of gas consumed by the different sectors in 1994 is shown in Table 8.1. As indicated, the
power sector is major consumer, with 46% of the share, while fertiliser is next at 35%. It appears that the
Government of Bangladesh wishes to limit the consumption of natural gas by the power sector to between
45 and 50% of total gas production. From the comments made in the Acres Report (Ref.2), such a limit
is conservative and that there is enough gas to provide the power sector with all of its requirements for the
forseeable future.
8.33         Meeting with Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies
A meeting was held with the Executive Dimctor of the Bangladesh Centre for advanced studies (BCAS).
an organisation active in the field of promoting environmnental awareness in Bangladesh. BCAS acts as
NGO as well as a consultant for some projects.
ME? outlined the project objectives and the following comments were made by BCAS:
-       BCAS is pleased that a detailed EIA study is being undertaken for this projecL
L       BCAS stressed that the Mcghnaghat project is one of the largest projects being undertaken in the
power sector in Bangladesh and hence it should be seen as an example to other developers of
power and other projects on how environmental solution are being incorporated into plant design.
*       MEP and other involved parties should highlight the fact that a detailed EIA study is being
undertaken for this prestigious project, with the hope that the word 'EIA' reaches as many people
as possible.
Their comunents were taken on board by MEP.
8A            PUBLIC CONSULTATION
8A.1          Background
When considering the possibility of socio-economic disruption on the local communities, the nearby
villages were identified as being the most vulnerable and those most likely to be affected.
We therefore selected 3 village communities within the area and these were as follows:
Village lslampur.
Village Ganga Nagar
Village Dhadghata
rw.Crsoos<otr.uAur                          8-2                              Mon Ewbank Pm=.



Each one is likely to be impacted upon by one or more of the potential impacts associated with land use.
noise, visual intrusion, socio-economic and compensation.
8.4.2        Public Consultation at Islampur
A number of village representatives were interviewed and these included head of mosque, shop owner,
chief engineer from the ship repair yard and some household heads.
They were all in favour of the project proceeding. They were generally well informed of project details
and recognised the need for such a project and even talked about the benefits to the nation of such a
project.
However. the key issues mentioned by all are as follows:
(A)    Resettlement
They all requested that the village should not be shifted and people did not want to be relocated.
(B)     Compensation
They stressed that adequate compensaton should be provided to each landowner whose land is
to be taken away for the proposed power projecL
(C)    Other Requirements
They would be pleased if jobs could be provided. Other benefits such as supply of running
water, renovation of the mosque, access to site medical facilities and supply of electricitv would  9
be regarded as "bonus" and viewed as a net benefit to the community.
The requirements mentioned in (A) and (B) were seen as the mninimum that should be fulfilled by the
power plant developer.
Since these interviews, we understand that the village will not be relocated and that the site boundary has
been adjusted to take this into account The compensation issue still needs to be resolved.
8A3          Public Consultation at Ganga Nagar
A number of village representatives were interviewed including head of mosque and 'head' of village.
Once again, we found that generally they were all in favour of the project 'going ahead' and were well
informed about project details.
The major issue here appeared to be that of compensation for land being taken up by the proposed
developmenL An adequate compensation package was requested by all those interviewed.
In addition to an adequate compensation, they also requested for the following benefits:
*       jobs could be provided for village people
*       a new school to be constructed in the village
*       renovation of the mosque.

8.4.4        Public Consultation with Representatives of Dhadghata
A number of farmers were interviewed and these people were not aware of this proposed project as well
as those interviewed in Islampur and Ganga Nagar. An outline of the proposed project was provided and
comments were then invited.
Gcnerally, they were in favour for the project to proceed provided they receive an adequate compensation
package.
8.5          RECOMMENDATIONS
Following the interviews, it is proposed that the following overall measures should be considered:
Minimum Requirement
These are considered by to be the minimum conditions to be met.
i)      Assure the people at the village Islampur that they will not be resettled or relocated.
ii)     Provide an adequate compensation package for all land owners whose land is being taken away.
The value of the compensation package should be decided on Bangladesh compensation
Guidelines, World Bank Compensation Guidelines and consultation with representatives from
land owners.
iii)    Provide jobs during construction for at least one member per family for those families whose
land is being taken away.
e        iv)     Provide jobs during construction for others from nearby villages.
Additional Requirements
Additional benefits which may assist public relations.
i)      Provide running water for the villages of Islamnpur and Ganga Nagar.
ii)     Provide some street lighting for the villages of Islamnpur and Ganga Nagar.
iii)    Provide access to the site medical facilities for the residents of lslamnpur and Ganga Nagar.
iv)     Construct a primary school for children for these two villages.
v)      Rcnovate the two existing mosques at these villages.

SUBJECT:   Meeting With Pirozpur Union Parishad Chairman
Along with Prof. Monir, I met with Allhaj Sirzul Hoque Bhuiyan, Chairman of the
Pirozpur Union Parishad (Meghnaghat). Mr. Hoque also is President of the Taherpur
Madrasa Yatimlkhana (cn Islamic religious school and orphanage), and the Mongolar
Gaon Bazaa Conunttee. This meeting, which was held at the residence of the Chairman
in Dhudghata on July 23rd, can be seen in the context of the PCDP process.
We reviewcd the MPP with the Chairman and discussed possible environmental impacts
as well as the over-all value of the project for the country. We emphasized that the
project would be implemenled fully in compliance with the environmental and social
guidelines of the World Bank and that we, representing AES, wished to have open and
positive relations with the people of the ae. Mr. Hoque had some concers about the
way in which the land had been acquired, which we discussed at length for the RAP, but
generaly was positive about the pmroct. We suggested that as Cbairman of the local
Union Parishad, he could help keep the people fully informed about the project and assist
us later in the PCDP phase, when a more roua informationa meeting could be held
between the sponsor (AES) and the people of the area. He readily agreed to this.
Apart from aspects of a training program relevant to the RAP, Mr. Hoque acpressed an
interest in developing a market center on the toe of the Char Ramjan Sonaullab. This is
tip of the island, jus beyond the area acquired for the MPP snd two fiture
power tations. He said the local people would fill the land themselves to bring it up
above the annual inundation, but wanted a road access aiong the peiimeter of the power
plant, or a bridge across the back channel of the Mcghna, from Kurbanpur roughly to the
aeumk-ga_eern corner of the larger site.

SUBJ:       Meeting with Deputy Commissioner, Narayanganj District
On 28 July, accompanied by Tajul Islam of AES and Dr. Reazur Rehman of DPC, I met
with the Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Narayanganj District, Mr. Abdur Re4man.
Tlb DC provided us with infbrmation about the status of the land acquisition, including
the amount paid so far. Thus far Taka 2.43 crores have been paid to the landowners,
which represents 85 percet of the payment due. Currently, a decision is pending within
the governmnt on whether kascholdcrs also should be compensated.
Sitting vith the DC was Abdullsh &I-Hasan Chowdhury, DLMand, in the DC's Office at
Narayaganj. Under the direction of the DC, we worked out with Mr Cbowdhur, the
modalities involved in our geting the land and compensation records which we need for
the PAP. Mr. Chowdhury said it would take two weeks. We agreed that if he could give
us the data for Stage One first, tha would expedite ow work.
Tajul briefed the DC on the proect and its egected environental impacts, noubly noise
poUution stLck emissions (C02 and N02), and thrmal effects on the river. Ihe DC
seemed particularly concerned about ndise and emissions. Tajul noted tha the site is not
-pecially close to habitations, save Islampur, and promised that, according to DOE
guidelies, a greenbelt would be planaed aomund the power plant. The DC was satisfied
tht the plant will be a CCGT system, based on natural ps, and hence producing energy
efficiently and reladtively cleanly.
The meeting qualihes as an important step in the PCDP proces.

Meeting with Apparel Ltd.
31a July 1999
On Saturday 31" July, accompanied by Jamil Mallik of Mott MacDonald Dhaka Office.
consultation was conducted between Karen Findlay of Mott MacDonald. UK. the Managing
Director of Apparel Ltd. Md. A. Kharhens and Production Manager, Mr. lahangiir. They
were already aware of the Project and were handed a copy of the Public Consultation and
Disclosure Plan.
Apparel Ltd. Employ some 300 people and have 2 tubewells, one 135 m deep which they use
to abstract drinking water and one 60 m deep, which they use for dyeing. There is always a
continuous supply of water available from the tubewells and abstraction from the deep well
amounts to 150,000 litrts per day and from the shallow well, 1,500 litres per day. Dyeing for
whites requires a continues supply of water for 6-8 hours whereas for coloured materials the
dyeing process takes 20.24 hours.
Like Meghna Indusu.ies, Apparel Ltd. also complain of frequent electricity cuts, for example,
that day the electricity had been cut off 4 times that day for a total period of 6-8 hours.
Although they have 2 dieswl genemors for- lighting and the machines and could continue
production during the power cuts, dicsel fuel is very expensive and. with a usage of 30 litres
diesel/hr the cost of electricity production very high. Thus their complaint was that 25% of
productivity was lost because of the power costs and wer a continuous electricity supply to
result from construction of the Meghnaghat power stadon, then this would allow them to
employ anothcr 200 people. Of these 200 people, 50% of the employees would be women.
Special training can be provided by a branch manager and supervisor located elsewhet, who
could come to site to train or there are training facilities in place elsewhere in Bangladesh.

Notes or Meeting at Mleghna Industries, near, Meghnaghat site, on Saturday, 31" July.
Present at the mceting:-
Administrative Officer, A. Q. Kondaker,
Chief Engineer, Babin Kartick Chandra,
Chemist, M. Azizul Haquc,
Nd Kutubul Alan of Mcghna Dairv,
.Elcctrical engineer, Md Abdul Alim.
This w%-as the second visit to the Meghna PET Industries site conducted as part of the
programme for public disclosure. A copy of the Public Disclosure and Consultation Plan 'vas
presented to the Chicf Engineer in order to providc the representatives of Meghna industris
Aith information regarding the proposed Project and the planned programme of Public
Consultation.
The  are a number of factories within the Mcghna Industries complex. Meghna DD                    r
imports milk powder from the UK and Ireland which it recortiutes and bottles for sale in
Bangladesh. The Meghna PET factory is a polyethylene plant whi use;sa
and produces rcfintd oils. There are 7 oil storage tanks on sit., holding a total of 16,000
tonnes of oil.
A mineral water botling plam also on site is currently abstracting drinking water from a d£ep
tubewell located in  ri y close proxinity to the proposed project site for the Mcghnaghat
o-wer Station and chemical analysis of this water is undertaken by the site chenist on a
regular basis. Thc deep-tube groundwsaer well is approximately 800 fect (243 m) deep and
some 36 m3 per day of groundwater is abstraed, 18 m' per day of water is acualy bottled
and a f&rthcr 18 in is used for washing equipment at the water and dairy botling plants. As
expected, the groundwater is believed to flow north to the river. Groundwater level appears to
be fairly consistt and Meghna Industries have noticed no change in the level over the past 3
years. Prior to bottling, the water is trmated by means of ozone technology, for cbemical
detuction of any bacteria which may be present.
Cunnitly the haeoics at Mena Indusies expe         daiy powo cuts, typically of 5-6 hours
duwuom On the day of the visit the pow  cut had lasted from 9 am in the morning to 3 p;n in the
aftenoonL Althougb they have private genetors the  are capable of ping electricity only for
lighting. AC's and some smaU machiner sh as the water filling lines. The large machines canne be
supplied by Ihese generams and consequendy there is loss of production Salies for the 400 people
employed must still be p-add in monetary term  ibis reates to 60,000 dhaka per hour or SUS 320.
Thus Mega Industries are verv much in favour of the proposed Project which they believe wil lead
to a continuous supply in electiciry and few intamiptions in power supply. Te generad comment was
that all persons in the locality would welcome the Projec since it was se to be god for the area and
good for the country.
The Ttprtsentatie at Me&gh  Industries considered that if they ld a continuous power supply as a
isll of the Project, the wold be in a position to employ more people and build more factories
Then wa  2 factorics cuely underoing wmsocd on the site, 1 factory to produce prime edible
oils and the other, United Cemeat 2 more bftories re propoed, onefo Meh  5ug  Lid and one
ior Prime PET Mghza Induuries, for production of pelyetiryla1or
umtermpted power supply would allow Mcga Industies to employ an additional 150 works of
whom 30% would be opeztOrS aW n. etcw earning an aveac 400 Dbakas per day, th remaining
70% being unuldlied workers eaLiing an a ge 120 Dhaka per day. These job opportuntics would
involve hard labour and would be be purely for Meen. There would be no new job opportuties for
womn.

It was explained that Mcghnaghat Power Station is also planning to abstract groundz%:tcr for
drinking purposes and that, in the sbscncc of sitc groundwatcr data, access to the Mcghna
Indusnries groundwamter chemical analysis reports would greatly assist the proposed Project
for inclusion within the the Environmental Impact Asscssrnent report. Hoixcvcr, the
rcpresentatives of Meghna Industrics were not in a position to rclease the information to us
without the penmission of the m3nager at Hcad Office in Dhaka. Mr Helal Uddin, at BRTC
Bhaban (3 floor), 21 Rzzuk Avcnue, Dhaka - 1000, telephone number: 9568934, 9568818,
9563444.
Mr Uddin was contacted and he suggested that a witten letter of request should be faxed to
the Chairman of the Meghna Group of Industries in order for permission to be grated. The
fax (artached) was sent to Meghna lndustnes on 2" August. Mr Uddin advised us that Ehe
Hed Office does not hold copies of this information, therefore we would need to return to the
Mcghnaghat site in order to obtain the requested information. He did disclose, however, that
tht iron concentrtion in the water was very high and that there were small concentrations of
aoter maals present
MM returned to the Project Site on Tuesday 3d Atigust and were told that neither the Chemist
or Chief Engineer who held this information were on site. MM then received a Icer from
Meghna Industries declinng to rclease the infosmation. This lener is mamhed.

Meeting with Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA)
1I August 1999
Those present Mrs. Rizwura Havsan - representing the BELA Group of Environmental
Lawyers
Dr. Karen Findlay   - MM (UK)
Jamal Mallik        - MM (Dhaka)
Mrs. Havson explained the role that BELA played in protecting the interests of those parties
affected by a new development and cited Occidental as an example of a companv who
undenoolk a gas development in Bangladesh without undertaking the necessary precautions to
avoid accidenwal explosion. The EIA. conducted by Bangladesh consultants, failed to address
the health and safety risks posed by the project and Occidental are currently being sued by
BELA, on behalf of those parties harmed by the explosion.
BELA are also considering suing UNICEF. on behalf of those parties poisoned by drinking
asenic contaminated water from groundwater wells provided by UNICEF during the 1980's.
Mrs. Havson was briefed about the proposed Meghnaghat Power Project presented with a
copy of the Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan and asked for conmments. She advised
that care should be taken to ensure that adequate compensation is provided to fishermen and
boatmen affected by the project and that there should be an exput assessment of the potential
danuge to fisheries. She also advised that the risk of gas explosion needs to be addressed
witin the ELA.
Reference was also made to the Environmental Con3envation Act 1997 and daft Red List and
the need for Environmental Clearance and an Environmental Management Plan.
Mrs. Havson also advised that a letter needs to be written to the Ministry of Energy, Power
Development Division. advising that the EIA is to be conducted befom work on the EIA can
commence, that the Ministty of Industry also needs to be informed and that the Ministry of
Energy, Directorate of Explosives (she is not sure but may also need to bc consuled
reprding the risk of gas explosion).

guidelines for ELT. particularly with respect to fisheries. agriculture and for advice on
protected areas.
IUCIN have facilitated the setting up of a number of NGO organisations in Bangladesh who
are now operating fully independently. These include NEAB (the National Association for
Bangladesh) and BCAS (the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies). Others include:
ADAB (association of Development Agencies in Bangladesh)
BELA (Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association)
CEN
BUP
CFSD (Centre for Sustainable Development)
CNRS (Centre for National Resource Studies)
Dr. Nishat advised that we should include all the above NGO's within our consultation
programne.
Dr. Nishat was briefed regarding the proposed Mcghnagbat power station and presented with
a copy of the Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan. He is familiar with the project site
ara and with the fact that the River Meghna divides into two channels at this location with
one channel taking the mnajor flow. Hs concern is that the Project develop.ent could result
in the TmAnor cbannel taking the bulk of the flow, thus causing a change in the river course and
posing a disk of erosion taking place further downstream. He therefore suggested that the
EnvironEmntal Monatoring Plan must ensure tbat river flow is monitored a few kIn upstream
of the Meghna bridge (at  A point before the Megbna river divides into two channels) as weal
as dowstam of the power plat and in the mnoor chameL                                                  1
Dr. Nishat reporms that he is now aware of any endangered species living in the river, it is Dot
consideed to be a critical ecological resoume and it is not considerd to be an important
spawning &ra  The spawning of the Hlsa fish, one of th most importnt fish species in
Bangldesh because it accounts for 40-50% of the fish eaten) is witbin the bay ar, where the
River Meghua meets the sea. UlCN have prepared a Draft Red Ust of vulnerable and
gndangered species which is not officially available but a copy could be provided were MM
to write an official letter endorsed by the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).
In sumnary, Dr. Nishat' s concem is the impact of dredging on the geology and flow stbility
of the river sad the local ecology. He is concerned that changes in river flow could lead to
erosion of the river banks such as at the Obayshi site.
Dr. Nishat would like to be invited to the public meeting and, acting as a neutral organisamion,
could facilitate the meeting by offering the IUCN conference room, which can accommodate
up toSO people.

Mvleeting with Dr. Atiq Rahman, Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCGAS)
2" August 1999
Others present: Dr. Karen Findlay MM (UK)
BCAS are an NGO set up by rUCN who act as advisers to the Govemment of Bangladesh and
assisted in the development of the EIA Guidelines, which are applied to all new development
within Bangladesh.
Dr. Rahmnan is also very familiar with the World Bank guidelines for EIA and Public
Consultation and the World Bank will nornally approach BCAS for their opinion and
comments on ELA's produced for World Bank funded projects in Bangladesh.
The Bangladesh Environmental Guidelines for the Power Sector are still being drafted and are
not currently in force however. Dr. Rahmran advised that reference can be madc to a book
prTeviously published entitled Environment and Development Bangladesh, University Press
ltd. 2 volurms (1993) for basic concepts.
Dr. Rahnaan in tum, would like to see a copy of MM's previous Meghnaghat EIA and the
previous themal impact analysis. He advises that there are textiles, metal processing and
agro-chemical plants located north of the Project site, on the Dhaka road, which might impact
upon the Project area and therefore should be included in the baseline analysis.
Air quality is not considemd to be an issue but must include all proposed and existing power
plants located in the general aa and must allow for seasonal variations, especially calm
conditions.
Dr. Rahman also advised that because the plant was to be gas-fired and there is a nisk of
explosion with any gas-fired power plant, that this should be addressed in the EIA and a risk
assessnznt canied OUL If this is not included in the Terms of Refernce or the EIA then MM
should recommend that such a study needs to be undertake.
On 30' August Dr. Rahmnan goes to Rio de Jancro for 2 weeks. If MM were to send the dmft
FIo tO him for review before this date he would be willing to give his comments.
A copy of the Public Consulation and Disclosure Plan was presented to Dr. Rahman. He
considers that public consulation is very important at an carly stage of project development
but advises that the Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan is a document which sbould be
for the benefit of the consultants own use, and not distributed to the public. Instead he would
like to see a Scoping document (as required by ElC and World Bank guidelines) which
oudines the EIA procedure to be followed, identifies potential impacts arising from the
project and how key Issues are to be addressed. HE stressed that it is a requimment of IFC
2hat a scoping document be distributed to all inteested parties. those affected by or likely to
affect the outcome of the project. as pan of the public disclosure and consultation process.
Dr. Rahman stressed the need to openly explain to the public and statutory consultees the
environmental impacts likely to result from the power project development in order that they
can provide infonmd commenL This is the purpose of the scoping document and should
forn a key elemcnt of any public consultation and disclosure plan A separte Environmental
Managemet Pian thould also be produced- He asked if we would provide him with a copy
of our proposed Terms of Reference for the EIA.

3rd August 1999
Mohammed Smdad Ullah Mian
Assistant Corsmissioner (Land)
Sonargaon
Narayangaj
Bangladesh
Comnents by Assistant Land Comsnissioner.
1.    The people are very much in favour of power plant because it will ensure a
continuous supply of electricily and provide job opportunities.
2     But the people are not knowledgeable about the impacts of the power station - its
emissions and hot water discharge nd do not understand tht effcts that these will
have.
He is happy that we are employing our expertise in deternining the impact of the
power plant and if any impacts are identified then he expects and will require tht all
measures are taken to ensure that this impacts arr nitigated and the people arc not
hamed.
3.    He understands that there are no people living on the site at the moment and Ehat
those resetted have been compensated by Bangladesh Power Development Board -
So ht sees no problem here.
4.    Water level drops to low level in dry season - need to consider in the thermal imnpat
analysis under ninimum flow Nov - Dec. - as a worst case scenaio.
For approval for land reclamtion BPDB came to land office at Sonargoan for
approval. 230.77 acres were purchased from people. 231.77 including road. So
smybe somc of the land was not purchased but as far as know bought land ownership
and approval was takn to Lind Ministry and Mlnlsuy Energy.
(the Sonargpon Thana Executive Officer, Md Zillar Rahman, was not available for
consultation, but hAs approval will be needed for the project to go ahead).

Mteting with CNRS (Centre for National Resource Studies)
4"- August 1999
Mr. Mockluser- Coalition of Environmental Engineers
Main interest is wetland resourceS management in central North and North East Bangladesh
are whee there are endless wetlands and forest plus coastau amra mangroves.
Sonme esWarine fish will migrate up Mcghna river to power station area.
Concern regards thermal impacts - asks whether there are similar power plants in Bangladesh
which also use once through cooling.
Baseline information should be obtained regarding fish population. benthos and aquatic plants
prior to dischare from plant.
Fishery survey - because the fish are sTall - not so much fishing here - so fishing data may
not be available in this are but if small fish die then this may effect adult fish population
further downsteam.
Mr. Mandal - Personal Secretary to the Secretary of Ministry or Energy
5* August 1199
Mr. Mandal received a copy of the public consultation and disclosure plan produced by Mon
MacDonald but seered surprised to learn that we bad been appointed by ABS to undertake
the Environmental Impact Analysis. HE always garded Mott MacDonald as the Ministry of
EnergyIBPDB's consultzL
We weme asked to write a letter to Mr. Mandal clearly identifying our role. who we are
representing and the purpose of the meeting. It was suggested that we should meet with the
Chaiman of BPDB and his Poect Director for the Meghnaghat Project.

Meeting witWhCPSD Public consultation - very important
5b August 1999
1.     EIA public discussion is mandatory announce in newspapers, use power driven
microphones to announce public hearing.
2.     Pcople action groups to environmenul politics eg. Kulma protests about noise first
lPP in Bangladesh. He believes - could affect fisheries and agriculture people.
3.     People in Govt. of influence less likely to be sufferers of impact but local people will
suffer and could protest if not properly consulted
4.     Was controversy at lumuna River Bridge but not awar of problems of compensation
settlernents here.
5.     Will affect fish migratory routes And therefore fish catches at existing fishing area.
6.     May affect course of river. If walls built to prtect project area flow of river will be
deflcted elsewhere and could cause erosion - must be part of environenmal
monitonring.
7.     Noise pollution - must cotnply with Bahgladesh anid World Bank Guidelines.
8.     Need w contact local NCO CDSP - Centre for Development Society.

Cmments of AES Meghnaghat Power Project Environmental Impact Assessment (ic
the PCDP)
1.    The repon prepaed by Mott MacDonald. highlighting historical background, site
description, plant description. relevant reguladtons and guidelines, srakeholders,
previous public consultadon and future public consultation etc.
2.     The proposed power project will be established on the west bank of the Meghna river.
The effluents, including heated water will be discharged into the river system of the
MeEhna.
3.    In the repor, the general cnvironmental considerzions have been looked into, but
impact of aquaic ecosystem including primy and secondary productivity and fsh
fauna were not considered.
4.     An aditional monitoring system of fisheries aspect should e developed befam
establishing of the power project. Primay & secondary productivity and species
composition of fisb fauna around the power plant should be studied for impat
assessment.
S.     The DoF Is collecting very liDited fish catch dau through its FRSS System from the
Meghna river, but not at the power project site, which may not serve the purposes of
the cnvronnental impact assessment

Govemnment of Bangladesh (GOB) for development of 1200-1300 MW of power in three
phases. Specifically, the MPSA is situated approximately 35 kilometres south-east of Dhaka
near the Meghna Road Bridge on the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and is under the
adxninistrativc jurisdiction of Sonargaon Thana, Narayanganj District (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
AES Mcghnaghat Limited (thc Project Sponsor) is a special purpose company, established
under the laws of Bangladesh. The Project Sponsor hat retained Hyundai Engineering and
Construction Company limited of Komra as the Installation, Erection, and Commissioning
(EG) Contractor and Hyundai Heavy Industies Company Limited as the Supply Contractor
to design and procure equipment for the power station .(herein collectively referred as the
Construction Contractor) to build the powcr station. The Project Sponsor will independently
own and operate the power station, supplying power to the Bangladesh Power Development
Board (BPDB) for an initial period of 22 years.
To finance the power station, the Project Sponsor is currently seeking funding from the
Infrastructure Devclopment Company Limited of Bangladesh (I)COL), a World Bank
financial intermediary, and from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Consequently, the
project is being planned and will be built and operated In accordance with the applicable laws
and regulations of Bangladesh and the guidelines of IDCOL and the ADB.
LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS
The Bangladesh Department of Environment (DOE), a division of the Ministry of
Environment and Forests (MEF), is the agency responsible for issuing environnental
approval for the construction and operation of power stations. Under MEF guidelines, both
Sitt Clearance and Environmental Clearance ar required from the DOE before any power
station can be made operational.
An Initial Environmental Examrination (lEE) eport was prepared and was submitted as part
of the Project Sponsor's application for Site Clearance from the DOE. The purpose of the
IEE was three-fold: i) to apply for Site Clearance from the DOE; ii) provide the Terms of
Refernce for the EIA study; and iii) continue consultations with project affected
stakeholders. The Site Clearance was obtained from the DOE on March 13, 200.
The project is also being planned to address the environmental and social requirrments of the
Prject Sponsor's lenders: IDCOL and the ADB. IDCOL has been established by the GOB
as a company registered under the Bangladesh Companies Act to facilitate private investment
using credit made available by the World Bank (IDCOL, 1997). As a condition of receiving
the credit. IDCOL is requirmd to ensure that its infrastructure projects conforn to the
environmental and social requirements of Bangladesh as well as the operational policies,
directives, and business practices of the World Bank.
The proposed undertaking is considered a Red Caregory project according to the Bangladesh
Environment Conservation Rules, 1997 (BECR) and Caregory A project as decribed in the
rso ZWD3mMML SEc.

World Bank guidelines (1998) and subject to the highest level of environmental assessment.
In addition to thcse requirements, the ADB also has a set of environmental guidelines for
thermal power stations (1993), which have been applied to this undenaking. The Project
Sponsor will also utilise this EIA report as part of their application for Environmental
Clearance from the Bangladesh DOE.
EIA MTHODOLOGY
ElA, as a methodology, is a tool used to identify, quantify, and evaluate the potential impacts
of a proposed undenaking on the environment. Typically, the results azr then used to assist
decision-makers in balancing the goals of the proponent with those of the project
stakeholders. As a process, it provides a traceable and defensible approach that integrates
economic development with environmental management initiatives.
The spccific methodologies utilised in the preparation of this EIA study included
identification and quantification of baseline environmental conditions in and around the
project site; prediction and quantification of potential environmental effects assisted in pat
by computer modelling, professional experience, and survey progams; and evaluation of
potential effects coupled with the identification of reasonable environmental protection and
nitigation measures.
The present EIA builds on the findings and work documented in an earlier ELA of a "generic"
design combined cycle gas turbine power station at the same site. The present EIA is based
on the specific and detailed design made available by the Construction Contractor for the
projecL
The Canadian-based firm ESG International Inc. (ESG) led the preparation of the EIA. ESO
incorporated inputs from sub-consultants specializing in the areas of air dispersion modelling
and noise assessment (RWDI Inc, Canada), thermal plume dispersion modelling (Danish
Hydraulic Institute, Denmark in association with the Surface Water Modelling Centre.
Bangladesh), social impact assessment (Deodar Associates, U.S.A.), and soio-cultUral
specialists and in-country EIA requirements (DPC Group, Bangladesh). The UK based
consultancy Mott MacDonald prepared the Public Consultation and disclosure plan and
carried out early consultation activities.
MEGHNAGHAT POWER SITES AREA
The MPSA was identified in the 1995 Power System Master Plan as a top ranked site for
development of three new pnvate sector power stations, to be developed in three phases
(Phases L IL and HD1) (Acres, 1995). On July 29, 1999, the Project Sponsor signed an
lmplemenaation Agreement with the GOB, a Land Lease Agreement and a Power Purchase
Agreement with the BPDB and a Gas Supply Agreement with Tins for the Phase I project at
the MPSA (Figure 2).
The BPDB was responsible for prepaTing the project site, as well as the rest of the MPSA and
the access road. This involved raising the seasonally inundated land to a level approximately
1 meter above the 200 years' highest flood level.
The Phase I lands (the project site) consist of 70 acres (i.e., the power station site and cooling
water channel), of which 62 acres were tumed over to the Project Sponsor on May 26, 2000
following site raising and grading activities by the BPDB. The BPDB has also allocated 6.5

built by Titas.
BASEUNE ENVIRONMENT
Soclo-Economic
Sonargaon Thana is charucterised by fields of paddy, banana plantations, and vegetable plots
intermixed with clusters of houses. The area is threaded by a patchwork of canals and
watercourses and, by Bangladesh standards, it is a relatively prosperous ama. Annual
incomes in the region surrounding the project site indicate that less than 2% of the population
live below the Bangladesh poverty line.
Six villages are located close to the MPSA, and include Islampur, Ganganagar, Dudhghata,
Kurbanpur, Panchani, and Char Goaldi. Having adapted to the annual cycle of summner
inundation, village residents build their homes on platforms to avoid flooding during the
monsoon season. These village platforms provide space for houses, sheds for cattle, kitchen
gardens. medicinal plants, fruit trees, and small orchards. While most of the villagers have
been directly affected by the site acquisition, few individuals in Islampur village have also
required relocation of residences and many other have lost access to monsoon fisheries on the
project site.
Land-Use
Phase I lands consist of 70 acres of land. Land-use of the project site follows the pattenm seen
throughout the alluvial deltaic areas of Bangladesh. Prior to site development, the vPSA
was utilised for production of rice, wheat, pulses, oilseeds, eggplants, tomatoes, sweet
potatoes, and watemelon. Predominantly a very fertile aea, the project rtgion has mixed
crop vegetation, monoculture tree plantation, and homestead-based agro-forestry. During the
monsoon floods, when common crops could not be grown, the MVSA supported a localised
monsoon fishery. Within a thme-kilometre radius of the project site are numerous industnal 
and commnercial developments.
Water-Use
The Meghnaghat river port is a major inland port and trading centre. Various developments
in the region continue to increase this port's imporunce to cargo ships. fishing boats,
passenger boats, and trawlers. The Meghna River will be relied upon for transportation
purposes and as well for power station cooling without any treatment, and for process and
other industrial uscs and for drinking after necessary treatment.
Hydrology
At the project site, the water level of the Meghna River varies from a peak of around + 5.5 m
PWD during the monsoon to around +1.0 m PWD during the winter. During the monsoon
season, water levels ame much higher and the Meghna overflows into the region's low-lying,
floodplans. The highest flood levels recorded by the Gauge Station at bleghna Ferryghat
during the 1998, 1988 and 1974 floods are +6.76 m, +6.55 m and +6.19 m PWD respectively.
On the other hand, the lowest recorded water levels were 0.0 m PWD in 1994 and 0.2 rn
PWD in 1982. The river is tidal during the months of November through April when the net
flow is low and the water level fluctuates between +1 m to +2 m PWD. The width of the
Meghna River at the project site is approximately 1,000 metres and the flow discharge rate is
in the range of 6,000 to 9,000 m3/s..

Air Quality
Monitoring data indicate that NO0 levels, within the airshed, are well within Bangladesh and
World Bank guidelines. There are several existing industries in the immediate vicinity of the
project site. Tine principal point sources of air pollution include a jute mill, a packaging and
board mill, a brick yard, three cemcnt processing indusuries, and two pulp and paper mills.
Future developments in the region may include a chemical processing industry and another
pulp and paper mill. Non-point sources of pollution include cottage industries, household fuel
consumption, and road and river traffic,
Ambient air quality data were collected in 1996 as part of the 1996 EIA and again 1999 as
pat of this EIA, and the ambient NO2 values of 21 pg/m3 and 63 pg/m3 were identified as the
maximum annual and the maximum 24-hour average concenirations respectively.
Sound Levels
As the project site is located adjacent to several industries, there are numerous contributors to
the region's ambient noise levels. As part of the assessment, two separate sites were selected
for the monitoring: the village of Islampur aiLd the village of Ganganagar. These sites are
representative of the two residential areas closest to the power station. The monitoring
indicates that Ganganagar is relatively quite at night while Islampur, being next to the river,
experiences engine noise from boats navigating their way up and down the Megbna River. A
summay of the measured one-hour average L. values for each monitoning site is provided in
Table 1.
Table I1: Measuged Ambient Sound ftposures (I SO)

The ambient noise monitoring results were influenced by spurious high-level noise events
such as vehicle homs, animals, human voices, and the Islanic calls to prayer (i.e., Azan).
The  events serve to increase the L.q values in certain 30-minute periods, however, no
particular event was determined as being more dominant than another. Ambient noise levels
vary thrughout the day, but do follow a typical diurnal pattem with a night-time "dip"
characteristic of urban environments.  The daytime levels are dominated by nearby
industrial/commercial sources that operate during the day, road and river traffic, and other
acDvides within the village. Noise data were checked again in 2000 at the instruction of the
DOE and reponted as follows.
Terrestrial and Aquatic Flora and Fauna
Extensive agricultural, industrial, and residential developments have significantly altered the
natural habitats within the project region. No vulnerable, threatened, or endangered (VTE)
floral species have been identified at the MPSA. Published data indicate there may be habitat
for vertebrate VTE species (e.g., avian, mammalian, and reptilian species) within a ten
kilometre radius of the MPSA. Since the Project Sponsor's works are limited to the MPSA.
the potential for adverse effects on VTE species is considered low to negligible.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION

* situated adjacent to a large, flowing body of water which can be used for cooling
water purposes;
*  minimal involuntary resettlement needed to occur to develop the project;
* background air quality within the airshed is good;
* the power station will burn indigenous natural gas;
* located adjacent to one of Bangladesh's main highways;
* site filling materials can be dredged from the Meghna River - immediately adjacent to
the project site;
* predominant land-uses, adjacent to the projcct site, contain a mixture of industria] and
commercial uses; and
a minimal environmental and socio-economic impacts are anticipated primarily due to
the project design, fuel type, and location
Power Station
The power station will utilise combined cycle gas turbine technology comprising a 2+2+1
configuration (i.e., consisting of two gas utrbine generators, two hcat recovery steam
gcnerators, and one steam turbine). The power station will be exclusively powered by
indigenous natural gas fuel to be supplied to the power station by the Titas Gas Transmission
and Distribution Company Limited (Titas). The natural gas will be supplied through Titas'
existing Bakhrabad-Demra gas pipeline with a 500 metre spur line required to the project site.
The natural gas contains negligible amounts of sulphur.
Cooling of the power station will be achieved with a once through cooling water system,
urilising water withdrawn from the Meghna River. After its use, the cooling water will be
released back into the Meghna River via a cooling water dischage channel. The power
station will include full effluent treatment, fire control systems, waste management facilities,
and other systems required to maintain daily operations.
Consruction will last approximately 23 months communencing in September 2000 with an
estimated peak labour force of 800 workers. All the preliminary works are expected to be
complete by October 2000. Approximauely 80% of the peak labour force will be supplied
through local and neighbouring comrnunities. Where appropriate, project site housing and
support facilities will be provided by the EPC Contractor during the construction phase of
project development. Once the project has been constructed, 23 to 24 personnel will be
requircd for daytime operations and approximately 3 to 4 persons will be rquired for night-
time operations.
Associated Infrastructure
To allow the ultimate development of the threc power stations at the MPSA, construction and
opeTanion of vanious infrastmctures are required. ConstTection and operation of the associated
infrastructure will be the responsibility of Titas, the PGCB, and the BPDB as shown below
(Table 2).

The BPDB was responsible for all site prparation activities. By the last quarter of 1999,
approximately 1,888,000 m3 of fill material was dredged from the Meghna River and placed
on the project site by the site preparation contractors of the BPDB. The elevation of the
project site was finished to approximately +7.83 m (PWD) measured with refernce to the
nearest SOB Benchmark. The finished level will be further checked and made sure that it is 1
m above the 200 years highest flood level. .
Construction of a 938-metre access road between the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the
project site was completed by the BPDB in the lasL quarter of 1999. The road has been raised
to the same elevation as the MPSA using fill from the Meghna River. The BPDB is
responsible for maintaining the access road for the operational life of the project.
Connection to the National Grid and the Dhaka Transmission Ring will eventually be
accomplished via three 230 kV transmission lines connecting the MPSA to substations
located at Haripur, Hasnabad, and Comilla North. Construction and operation are the
responsibility of the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB). Based upon consultation
with PGCB, it is understood that transmission lines will be constructed and operated by the
PGCB under funding from the ADB.
The POCB has already awarded the contracts for construction works of the Mcghnaghat -
Haripur and Meghnaghat - Comilla North Transmnission iAnes, and construction works of
Meghnaghat - Hasnabad Transmission Uine will be undrtakn in the near future. It is also
understood that environmental analysts have been undenaken for the transmission lines in
acordance with DOE and ADB requirements.
A 500-metre steel pipeline with 20 inch diameter will form the connecting link between the
interconnection point on Titas' Bakhrabad-Demra main gas transmission pipeline and the
power station, providing a safe and efficient method for the transport of natural gas. The
permanent pipeline easement will be approximately six metres in width and Titas will require
an additional six metres of temporary working space during pipeline construction. It is
expected that the pipeline will be laid at a distance of approximately 200 meters north of the
access road. There are no residences or other constraints to pipeline development on the
prposed route and construction casement between the existing main pipeline and the site.
The pipeline land, owned by private landowners, has been used for paddy cultivation during
the winter season only. In the rainy season, it remains submerged under water. Titas will
acquire this land through the GOB.
A regulating and metering station (RMS), occupying approximately 50 by 100 metres, will be
constructed to control the flow of gas entering the power station. The RMS will also contain
facilities to adjust gas pressure under various operating conditions as well as gas metering
and flow measurement. Titas will construct, own, and operate the RMS.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND PROPOSED MITIGATION
River Dredging and Site Flling
The Meghna River is highly turbid and carTies high levels of sediments. Based on EIA studies
carried out for the dredging contractor, the turbidity created by the dredge was not expecLed
to significantly affect long-term sediment loadings in the tiver and would only have a short-
temi effect on benthos (i.e., bottom dwelling organisms) within and inmuediately adjacent to
the bonrow armas. Thcse organisms are expected to quickly recolonise the affected aeas once

dredging is completed. The river is sufficiently large to allow fish and other active swimmers
that might have been affected by the turbidity to avoid high turbidity areas. Overall, no long-
term deleterious cffects are expected on aquatic life due to dredging activities.
Cooling Water Intake
Damage to aquatic organisms may occur by either entrapping or impinging of largcr
organisms or by entraining small organisms at the cooling water intake. A fixed bar and
travelling band screens will be installed to reduce the number of aquatic organisms entering
the closed cooling water system. Impingement will be reduced through the installation of
fish deterrent devices. The effect of impingement on the population of small aquatic
organisms is expected to be minor as the percent of population affected is small and
populations tend to have high recruitment rates.
Cooling Water Discharge
Cooling water will be required for the steam turbine condenser, gas turbine lube oil cooler,
and other power station equipment. The power station will withdraw cooling water from the
Meghna River via a cooling water intake canal located at the project site boundary on the
southenm riverbank. The cooling water intake canal will include devices to limit the
impingement and entrainment of fish, other aquatic organisms, and debris. The cooling water
will be discharged at the south-west corner of the MPSA into the Mcghna River.
The thermal plume modelling undertaken as part of the ELA indicates that the power station's
discharge temperature will combine with the ambient river temperature to produce an average
tenperatur compliant with both DOE and World Bank standards.
Tbe power plant will withdraw approximately 15.5 m3/sec (56,000 m31hr) of water fmm the
Meghna River for once through cooling purpose. Under normal operating conditions the
cooling water will experience a 5.5 °C temperature rise in the steam condenser and will be
retumed to the river at a downstream point located approximately one kdlometr from the
water intake (Figure 2). The average of the annual minimum discharges recorded by
Bangladesh Water Development Board during the years 1990 through 1995 was 1,987
m3/sec. Abstraction of water at 15.5 m31sec for cooling purpose is only 0.78% of this average
arinimum discharge. The past record shows that minimum discharge occurs during the last
week of November, when the river is tidal and experiences bi-directional flow.
The cooling water dispersion simulations were carried out by Danish Hydraulic Institute and
Surface Water Modelling Centre using the specific design parameters for the power plant
using two professional modelling packages: MIKE 11 and MIKE 21. The model was run for
the worst-case flow event with a return period of 50 years. The model was also run for the
average-case low flow event. Based upon the model inputs and the maximum excess
temperatures, the largest distance between the discharge point and the 3°C averag,c excess
temperature have been calculated using the worst-case flow and the avcrage-casc low now
scenaros. Dilution percentages, including the effects of cooling water recirculation, at the
isotherm edge were also calculated.
The modelling indicates that under normal operating conditions and average-case low flow
conditions the distance from the outfall to the downstream edge of the 3eC contour of the
average excess temperature is 100 meters. A thermal plume of this size is not expected to
have any significant effect on the aquatic biota. Under the worst-case condition, which is
predicted to occur within a 50 yea retumn period, the distance extends to 1.0 km (Figure 3).
During the short period of time this plume would manifest itself pelagic i.e., free swimming

fish would be able to avoid the higher temperatures. As the plume floats, bottom dwelling
species will be unaffected. No significant long-term effects on aquatic biota are expected.
To examine possible cumulative effects modelling was also carried out to assess the cffects of
operation of the AES Meghnaghat power station in combination with the second phase power
station, both discharging at the same location. The results of the two scenarios are provided in
the following table (Table 3).

For the second scenario, the plume in worst-case conditions extends 2.2 km downstrmam
(Figure 4). As for first scenario, these conditions are of minor concemn due to the short period
of time they manifcst themselves. During average conditions the plumes could extend 300 X.
These conditions could occur over a longer period and are of concern.
Potential for Cooling Water Re-circulation
Computer modelling was also undertaken to determine the potential that cooling water
recirculation might have on the thermal discharge plume. Specifically, MIKE 21 modelling
was undertaken for the dry season, when the Meghna River is dominated by tidal flows with
negligible net flows.
The Tesults of the computer modelling pmdicted that with tidal conditions thermal
accumulations would occur in front of the MPSA under reversing flow conditions.
Consequently, recirculation will occur, further increasing the discharge temperatum. The
predicted effects of thermial accumulation upon cooling water discharge are summarised in
Table 4.

Note: Avewage and Maximuni refer to the aWal dimulation ped VtW covers a tonnightly taW cycle wh a nhglie

As indicated in above table, the temperate effects of recirculation under avenge river
conditions (i.e., a nornal dry season) at intakes I and II will be negligible, ranging from
O.1C to 0.2°C. Such a small change in the intake water temperature will have a limited, if
any, affect on the discharge temperature or the chracteristics of the thermal plume.
Movements of the thermal plume with a complctc tidal cycle under the worst case (i.e., a 50
year return period) conditions are shown in Figures 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 for Phase I
normal operation.
Under maximum adverse river conditions (i.e., a 50 year return period), the temperature
affects of recirculation are more noticeable at intakes I and El. ranging from 1.8 - 2.8°C

(Figures 6 and 7). However, the 50 year return period is of limited occurrence and therefore
contributes little weight in tetms of assessing power plant operations with regard to
recirculation and environmental effects (DH1, 2000). In the event that these recirculation
conditions occur, the effect will be of a relatively short duration and is not expected to have a  0
significant effect on aquatic life.
Based upon the predicted modelling results, no protective or mitigative measures are
recommended to minimise the potential effects of cooling water recirculation.
Noise
The power station will meet the applicable guidelines for environmental noise. Where
appropriate exhausts and air intakes will be equipped with silencers to reduce noise levels at
the source. Noise modelling based on conservative assumptions shows that the predicted
noise level at the nearest Village of Islampur will exceed night time noise limits of the DOE
and World Bank. The Village of Ganganagar will exceed the World Bank nighttime noise
liMiL
Construcffon Phase
Construction phase noise will be generatcd by equipment on the project site and by vehicular
traffic on the road and river network. Noise from construction equipment will be experienced
mainly at the villages of Islampur and Ganganagar. Noise associatzd with transportation will
be incremental to the daytime noise that many residents, who live for the most part along or
near main roads, currently experience.
Thrugh implementation of noise management measurs and additional good site practces,
noise impacts should be limited to a short-term intermittent increase in daytime and nighttime
noise in the vicinity of thc project site.
Operutfon Phase
As noted, the surrounding land-uses at the MPSA include residential, agricultural,
commercial, and industial. Consequently, various land-use categories were used as the
environmoental noise guidelines and standards for evaluating the potential environmental
noise effects of the power station. The power staion noise propagation was modelled using
environmental noise model sofiware, resulting in the delineation of noise contours for the
aeas adjacent to the MPSA. The propagation model utilised conservative data inputs related
to the:
e anticipated sound levels from power plant equipment
* continuous operation of all power plant equipment;
effects of local terain; and
* occurrence and effects of temperature inversions and calm wind condiaions.
The modelling predicts that daytime noise levels at all surrounding villages, commercial, and
industrial areas should comply with both Bangladeshi standards and World Bank guidelines
(Table 5 and Figures 8 and 9). However, in the Villages of Islampur and Ganga Nagar,
nighttime noise IlvCes are predicted to exceed the applicable guidelines and standards when
there are nighttime temperature inversions and periods of calm winds.

Under normal climatic conditions the predicted nighttime noise levels ar: expected to be
similar to the anticipated daytime noise levels of 53 dB(A) at Islampur and 44 dB(A) at
Ganga Nagar. During nighttime inversion the predicted noise levels at Islampur is 56 dB(A)
and at Ganga Nagar is 48 dB(A). As per well documented studies (the US EPA), human
response to increases of sound exposure by: (i) 3 dBA or less is considered insignificant due
to imperceptibility; (ii) 4 to 5 dBA is considered a just-noticeable difference; (iii) 6 to 9 dBA
is considered as marginally significant; and (iv) 10 dBA or above is considered as significant
and perceived as doubling of sound exposure. Therefore, the predicted nighttime noise
increase at Islampur by 9dBA will be marginally significant and 3 dBA at Ganganagar will
not be perceptible to human being. as the ambient nighttime noise levels at these two
,^",       locations were measured 49 dBA and 45 dBA respectively.
Nevertheless, several mitigation options have been idendfied that will ensure compliance
with the applicable environmental noise guidelines and standards. The Project Sponsor and/or
the EPC Contractor will evaluatc the implementation of each mitigative option, presented
below, during the detailed design phase to detemine the optimal design. Regardless of the
mitigative option(s) selected, the Project Sponsor is committed to operating the power plant
within the identified environmental noise guidelines and standards.
If the conservative noise assumptions used in the modelling remain the same during the
detailed design phase, these mitigative options, or combination of options, will bring the
environmental noise levels at the Villages of Islampur and Ganga Nagar into compliance with
the applicable guidelines and standards. Regardless of the preferred technical changes to the
power plant and/or the mitigation measures implemented, the EPC Contractor is contractually
bound to meet noise guidelines of the World Bank.
Air Emissions
The Ansaldo V94.2 turbines will be installed with dry low NO% bumers and operated
exclusively on indigenous natural gas. Turbine start-up will utilise clectricity from the grid
(i.e., no diesel-fuelled generators will be required on site for this purpose). The design
specifications indicate that these turbines and burners will control the emissions of oxides of
nitrogen (NO1) to levels well below the emission lirnits of the DOE and the World Bank.
Stack concentrations of NO. duning normal operating conditions (i.e. loads greater than 50%
occurring 99% of the time as the plant is designed as base load power station) will be about
57.46 mglNrn3; well below the World Bank guideline of 125 mgfNm3 and 82 mg/Nm3 of the
DOE. The NO. emissions at 50% or lower load of a gas turbine will exceed the DOE and
World Bank limits. Such exceedance will only occur at start-ups and shutdowns, and will

continue for less than one hour at each occasion. Emissions of SO2 and PMlo will be
negligible given the composition of the natural gas fuel.
The following table (Table 6) shows ithe NOx emissions from the power plant at various load
scenarios on the assumption that at plant loads of 50% or below, ohe gas turbine will be in
operation and the other gas turbine will be shutdown. Table 6 illustrates that the NOx
emissions from the power plant will remain within both Bangladesh and World Bank
Guidelines. The plant will not dispatch power at any load bclow 25%.

The table assumes that at plant loads of 50% or lower, one turbine will be shut down in order
to increase the thermal efficiency of the remaining operating turbine (i.e., at 50% plant load,
one turbine will be shut down and the remainder will operate at 100% load). Plant operation at
25% load or less is only expected to occur for short time periods at plant start-up and shutdown
(i.e., <I% of the total operating time). However, once the power plant becomes operational, the
Project Sponsor will implement a NOx monitoring program.
Maintaining the power station in a good working order will also assist in niinimising its
increased emissions of NO2. Stack emissions will be monitored on a routine basis throughout
the life of the power station.
Ground Level Concentrations
Ground level concentrations of NO2 were calculated using the U.S. EPA's AERMOD model
at various station loads to predict short-term and long-term ground level concentrations of
NO2. The results of the modelling indicate that the contribution of the power station, plus the
existing background levels, will be compliant with the applicable guidelines of the DOE and
World Bank.
The model was also run to assess the cumulative effects of the ultimate development of three
power stations at the MPSA. Model results at 100% (with duct firing) and 50o loads for
short-tern and long-term ground level concentrations are presented in the following tables
(Tables 7 and 8). Both load situations are considered as worst-case scenarios as the mass
flow rates for pollutants of concern are at their highest. The 50% load scenario is expected to
occur less than I % of the time - at start-up and shutdown only. The results indicate that both
NO2 and PM,o contributions to ground level concentrations are within the applicable
guideline values. Figures 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 show the predicted NO2 and PMwa
contributions to the ground level concentration at various radial distances from the source.

A post-construction monitoring program will be implemented by the Project Sponsor to
confirm the model's predictions.
Greenhouse Gas Contributions
Combined cycle systems typically operate at higher efficiencies than conventional boiler-
steam power systems. This allows a greater amount of electricity to be generated per unit of
fuel utilised and thus, minimises the volume of greenhouse gases released per unit of
electricity produced.  Natural gas is low  in carbon content compared to the other
hydrocarbons fuels, resulting in lower cnissions of CO2 per unit of heat released. Therefore,
the efficiency of the combined cycle gas turbine, coupled with the use of indigenous natural
gas fuel, will minimise the emissions of CO2 per unit of power produced.
Economic Dislocation
The Project Sponsor has reviewed the compensation provided by the BPDB as part of the
acquisition of the Phase I site and determined that supplemental management measures would
be appropriate. A Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared setting out the methodology
for canrying out these supplemental activities.
Specifically, development of the project site and the associated infrastructure, by various
government agencies, has affected households through the loss of private agricultural land
holdings and access to cultivable land. The BPDB dredging activities might have also
affected local fisherfolk. The baseline survey identified around 746 households who were
somehow affected by land acquisition for the Phase I power station, the access road and the
RMS and their categorywise distribution are shown Table 9.

Note: the numbers shown above are likely to change in field verification and scrutiny.
Consequently, the Project Sponsor has undertaken a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), based
upon IDCOL, World Bank, and ADB guidelines. As most the PAPs were affected in their
livelihood, finding alternative employment through vocational skills training in differenE
trades of duration up to six months and providing opportunity for job in construction of the
project are proposed in the RAP as the means of mitigating social impacts of the project.
Each PAP households who lost 20% or more of their annual income due to the project are
entitled to nominate one candidate for training and will take training in a pre-qualified
vocational schools in the project region. After successful completion of the training, the
trainee will be reimbursed all the costs of training and be given the allowances for living and
transportation for the period the training would normnally continue. The Project Sponsor has
also committed financial support to constuction of an earthen road and a primary school for
the Islampur Village, as the villagers have long been suffering in the absence these
infmstructures. The RAP did not propose any cash compensation to the PAPs for loss of land
or crops. as the land acquisition and site preparation were the responsibility of the
government agency, BPDB and the Project Sponsor has been given the lease of the land for
the tern of the project.
Involuntary Resettlement
Base line surveys indicate that BPDB development of the project site may have required
resettlemcnt four households. Additional detailed analysis is being undertaken to confirm
these findings and will be documented in the fmal EIA report.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMNET AND MONITORING
An environmental action plan (EAP) has been developed setting out the project mitigation,
management, monitoring, and consultation activities for the project.  Environmental
management requirements for project contractors are incorporated in contractual agreements
and the Project Sponsor will implement oversight procedures and personnel to ensure
compliance. The detailed monitoring program to be implemented and followed by the
Project Sponsor focuses upon compliance with the environmental, social, health, and safety
standards of the Government of Bangladesh, IDCOL, and the ADB.
Environmental monitoring, which started with the collection of background data as part of the
EIA study, will continue with appropriate follow-up activities during operation. The        )
monitoring will provide data on key environmental, social, and occupational health and safety
aspects and on the effectiveness of mitigation measures implemented as part of this project.

PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
To date, public consultation and information disclosure for this project has been completed in
thTee paris as summarised below.
Conceptual Design
Preliminary consultations were undertaken in 1997 as part of a generic EIA report prepared
for the ADB and BPDB based upon a conceptual project design. The conceptual design was
used to conduct preliminary consultations with governmental agencies, non-governmental
organisations, and nearby villages. Specifically, stakeholders included the DOE, IUCN, the
Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS), and the villages of Islampur. Ganganagar,
and Dudhghata.
Phase I Consultations
In July and August 1999 Phase I consultations were initiated based upon a newly designed
PCDP. These consultations were undertaken following the award of Phase I of the MPSA to
the Project Sponsor by the BPDB. Various stakeholders were consulted, including the IUCN,
BCAS, DOE, District Commissioner of the Narayanganj District, Sonargaon Thana Assistant
Comniissioner (Land), and the Chairnan of Pirojpur Union Parishad, among others.
Although some concerns were identified during this phase (i.e. potential emiissions impacts,
health and safety risks, effects on fisheries), most are mnitigable and/or avoidable through
project design changes. Despite these concerns most individuals and groups expressed
support for the project.
Phase 11
Phase II consultations will consist of formal and informal meetings with project scakeholdens,
courtesy calls, and workshop in Dhaka in order to provide and discussion the findings of the
draft EIA report. Following these consultations the ETA report will be finalised for
submission to the DOE and the project lenders.
CONCLUSION
Due to the existing industrial/commercial nature of the area and the power staEion design, the
project will not have a significant impact on the region's environment. Standard good site
practices and operating procedures, in conjunction with the project's envirorunental action
plan, will provide effective management, monitoring, and mitigation programs. With the
exception of noise, all emTissions from the power station as well as daily operational activities
will be compliant with DOE, ADB, IDCOL, and World Bank environmental guidelines and
health and safety standards and procedures.
The project involves both economic dislocation and involuntary resettlement for few number
of households. The form of support to be provided to affected people has been concluded
based on extensive consultations.
Finally, the power station will operate on indigenous natural gas and will deliver some of the
cheapest electrical power in the World. Its implementation will help Bangladesh to reduce
the gap in demand for and supply of electricity and restore stability in load management on
the national grid. The power station will further relieve the stress that daily load shedding
has put on the BPDB, MEMR, and local consumers.

Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Project
Public Consultation Meeting with the Villagers of Islampur
in Close Vicinity to the Project Site
Meeting Minutes
Venue        : Mosque Premise, Islampur
Date         : 25 April 2000
Time         :4PM
Participants : Villagers of Islampur
Introduction
A public consultation meeting was organized on 25 April, 2000 with the villagers of
Islampur, the village nearest to the Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Project site. This meeting
was a part of the overall PCDP process currently going on and first meeting with the villagers
in Islampur on environmental impacts and mitigation plan and other related issues.
Obiectives
The main objectives of the meeting were as follows:
* Inform the meeting participants about the current project implementation status;
* Discuss and exchange views/opinions about the possible environmental impacts of the
project with the local community and examine the appropriateness of the mitigation plan
as proposed in the draft EIA report; and
* Discuss and record the concerns of the villagers on environmental issues for addressing
them in the revised environmental management plan.
Meeting was organized by a DPC team based at the project site and conducted by the Project
Team. The villagers were invited formally and given enough background information before
they participate in the meeting. A list of participants is appended in Appendix 1, and a photo
album in Appendix 2 will provide evidence of major events in the meeting (forthcoming).
Proceedines
Dr. Reazur Rahman, the DPC Project Coordinator, opened the meeting by welcoming all
present and thanking them for attending the meeting. Ms. Runu, Sociologist of DPC, and Mr.
Biswajit Biswas, Field Coordinator were present in the meeting.
Dr. Reazur Rahman explained the overall status of the project implementation to the audience
and invited them to voice their comments and questions on project related issues.

Mr. Biswajit briefly gave an overview of the project and informed the audience about the
milestone activities of the project.                                                              N
Dr. Rahman briefly described the salient features and findings of environmental studies
carried out and possible impacts of the project to the participants. He also explained the
course of actions would be pursued by the Project Sponsor with regard to environmental
impacts mitigation. About the environmental issues, he informed the audience the broad
status of existing environmental conditions as benchmark and assured the audience that
subsequently all out efforts will be made for keeping the environment of the area intact as it
exists now.
Mr. Ahad Ali Pradhan, an elderly villager, said that due to the project their loss of livelihood
is irreparable. He requested that steps should be taken by the Project Sponsor so that they can
restore at least present level of income and livelihood. He also mentioned that the on-going
meeting being held at the mosque premise and the poor villagers would be grateful if AES as
Project Sponsor extends cooperation to the villagers to improve the conditions of the prayer
house.
Mr. Abdus Samad also described his grievances due to loss of land and access to fishing
ground. He mentioned that regarding the environmental issues they do not have enough
knowledge to anticipate the impacts, but he said that the villagers are facing much problem
due to highly raised dunes of sand on the project site. The village is very close to the site and
when wind blows suspended sand particles spoils their foods and drinks. This makes their
foods contaminated during cooking and eating. He requested that some measures should be
taken immediately to mitigate this problem.
Mr. Samad also requested, if possible the Project Sponsor should take initiatives to help the
villagers, to built a permanent primary school for their children in Islampur. Presently many
children facing problems of access to the primary school due to distance and accidental
hazards on the highway. There are frequent incidence of death of school going children in the
area, and this made the parents afraid of sending children to the school.
Mr. Md Mohsin, a young villager said that the villagers are eager to donate their own land for
the purpose of a primary school, but further assistance is required. He also requested for
AES's assistance for improvement of the internal road beside the project so that the villagers
have direct and easy access to the main road.
Mr. Mohsin opined that the Project Sponsor and the Consultants have well thought about the
possible environmental impacts of the project and the poor and illiterate villagers do not
understand much about environmental issues which will emerge due to construction of the
project. But he generally expressed his observations that due to dredging for land filling the
river is now very deep and they fear that this may result in erosion of the river bank causing
loss of land in Islampur village. He mentioned that this is a linear village with a long slender
strip of land. The land loss by erosion would be fatal. He requested that the Project Sponsor
should take all measures to protect the river bank.

Resolutions Reached
After a thorough discussion among the villagers in the meeting, the following resolutions
were reached for the attention of AES, the Project Sponsor:
*  The audience requested that the Project Sponsor should cover the land surface of the
project site with grass or should take some other measures so that during strong wind
sands would not cause much problem particularly spoil their foods and drinks.
*  The spilled over sand which has already submerged the agricultural land adjacent to the
project site causing decreased fertility of the soil should be considered as a negative
environmental impact and the concerned PAPs should be properly compensated for the
income loss.
*  The audience requested that AES as Project Sponsor should extend cooperation to the
Islampur village community for establishing a Primary School, improve the village road
and mosque as part of their social contribution to the community.

Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Project
Public Consultation Meeting with the Villagers of Kurbanpur
in Close Vicinity to the Project Area
Meeting Minutes
Venue       : Kurbanpur Primary School
Date        : 26April 2000
Time        : 4:30PM
Participants : Villagers of Kurbanpur
Introduction
A public consultation meeting was organized on 26 April, 2000 with the villagers of
Kurbanpur, the village located near to the proposed Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Project site.
This meeting was part of the overall PCDP process currently going on with the local
community on environmental impacts and mitigation plan and other related issues.
Objectives
The main objectives of the meeting were as follows:
* Inform the meeting participants about the current status of the project implementation;
e Discuss and exchange views/opinions about the possible environmental impacts of the
project with the local community and examine the appropriateness of mitigation plan as
proposed in the draft EIA report; and
* Discuss and record various concems of the villagers on environmental issues and address
them in the environmental management plan.
The meeting was organized by a DPC team based at the project site and conducted by the
Project Team. The villagers were invited formally and given enough background information
before they participated in the meeting. A list of participants is appended in Appendix 1,
while the Photo Album in Appendix 2 (forthcoming) will provide evidence of major events in
the meeting. During the meeting visual aids were used highlighting the main features of the
project and provided with core environmental information to the participants.
Proceedines
Dr. Reazur Rahman, the DPC Project Coordinator, opened the meeting by welcoming all
present and thanking them for attending the meeting. Mr. Biswajit Biswas, Field Coordinator,
Md. Masudur Rahman Khan, and Mr. Ziaul Haque, Research Associates of DPC, were
present in the meeting.

Dr. Reazur Rahman explained the overall status of the project implementation to the audience
and invited them to voice their comments and questions on project related issues.            -
Mr. Biswajit briefly gave an overview about the project and inforned the audience about the
milestone activities of the project including phasing of implementation.
Dr. Rahman briefly described the salient features and findings of environmental impacts of
the project to the participants. He also explained the course of actions would be pursued by
the Project Sponsor and the Consultants with regard to mitigation of environmental impacts.
About the environmental issues, he informed the audience the broad status of existing
environmental conditions as benchmark and assured the audience that subsequently all out
efforts will be made for keeping the environment intact as it exists now.
Mr. Dhanu Miah, a participant of the meeting, mentioned that regarding the environmental
impacts he do not have much to say. It would be sufficient if the mitigation measures as
described by Dr. Reaz are complied. Though he expressed his satisfaction that a large power
project would be built in Kurbanpur area, he pointed out that they have received
compensation for their land at a very lower rate. Moreover they had to give bribe to get
compensation money from the designated office. Now because of site filling the river depth
reduced so much that some of jhops are already buried under the sand and they lost more than
Tlk 50 thousand per jhop/year and those who have bigger jhops have lost even more than Tk
100 thousand per jhop/year.
Mr. Shaidul Islam also mentioned about the sand filling of jhops and Mr. Mustafa Kamal
mentioned that because of site development activities the area for fishing has become smaller
resulting a huge loss in income to the local communities. Mr. Kamal further indicated that
due to loss of income their earlier income capacity has also reduced substantially.
Mr. Fazlul Haq, a member of the Union Parishad, said that the people most affected due to
the project, a majority of them live in Kurbanpur village. So he requested the Project Sponsor
through the DPC team that during construction the PAPs from this village (Kurbanpur)
should be given priority in getting the jobs.
Mr. Muhammad Ali Miah stated that due to powerhouse the noise must not disturb the
villagers during sleep. He has heard that power houses are very noisy.
Mr. Shaidullah said he has not anything to say regarding the environmental impacts. He
mentioned that the present value of land is Tk 8-10 lakh per acre whereas they have received
only Tk 65 thousand per acre. He requested that AES as Project Sponsor should consider
supplementary compensation to cover this huge loss. Mr. Shahidullah further requested that if
an entry gate is opened for the villagers and have access through the project site then they can
save about two hours and 30-40 taka to get access to the Dhaka-Chittagong highway. Now
the only entry point is at the highway and they have to go through a long round about to reach
to the highway.
Mr. Ali Akkas requested AES to donate for the mosque and primary school at Kurbanpur.

Resolutions Reached
After a thorough discussion arnong the villagers in the meeting, the following resolutions
were reached for the attention of AES, the Project Sponsor:
* The Project Sponsor was requested to attach highest priority to Kurbanpur villager for
providing temporary job opportunities during construction as the severity of income loss
is also higher for Kurbanpur then other villages in the project area.
* The spilled over sand which has already covered the fishing areas used for jhop fishing
adjacent to the project site should be considered as a negative environmental impact and
the PAPs should be properly compensated for the income loss.
Conclusion
At the end of the meeting, Dr. Reazur Rahman extended thanks to the participants on behalf
of AES and DPC for their spontaneous response and contributions to the meeting expecting
full cooperation in this regard in the future also.

Introduction
A consultation meeting with the project affected persons (PAPs) was organized on May 9,
2000 in the village Kurbanpur, a village located in close vicinity to the proposed AES
Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Project site. This meeting was a part of the overall PCDP
process currently going on and first meeting with the local community on Resettlement
Action Plan (RAP) and other related issues.
Obiectives
The main objectives of the meeting were as follows:
0  Inform the meeting participants about the current status of the project implementation;
* Discuss and exchange views/opinions about the possible social impacts of the project
with the local community and examine the appropriateness of RAP as proposed in the
draft EIA report; and
* Discuss and record various concems of the villagers on social issues and address them in
the resettlement action plan.
A DPC team, based at the project site, organized the meeting and the Project Team lead by
Dr. Reazur Rahman conducted the meeting. Dr. Philip Jones from Deodar Associates and Mr.
Tajul Islam, Project Manager, AES Meghnaghat Limited accompanied the project team. Dr.
Jones, Tajul Islam, and Dr. Reaz spoke at the meeting.
The villagers were invited formally and given enough background information before they
participated in the meeting. A list of participants is appended in Appendix 1, while the Photo
Album in AppendLr 2 (forthcoming) will provide evidence of major events in the meeting.
Proceedings
Dr Reazur Rahman, the DPC Project Coordinator, opened the meeting by welcoming all
present and thanking them for attending the meeting. He introduced Dr. Philip Jones, Mr.
Tajul Islam, and the DPC Team members. Mr. Biswajit Biswas, Field Coordinator and Mr.
Masudur Rahman Khan, Research Associate of DPC, were also present in the meeting.

Dr. Reazur Rahman stated that about a fortnight back on 26 April 2000 a meeting with the
villagers of Kurbanpur was held at the same premise on the environmental impact of the AES
Meghnaghat Power project and its mitigation plan. Some of the PAPs were also present at
that meeting. The objective of this meeting was clearly mentioned and all should concentrate
primarily on the social impacts and the RAP. He also mentioned that presence of Dr. Jones
and communication with him would be no problem because Dr. Reaz would be assisting him
as an interpreter. The presence of Mr. Tajul Islam was also appreciated as this is the first time
the PAPs met the representative of the Project Sponsor. The villagers were also informed that
they can voice their queries and concerns directly to Mr. Tajul Islam.
Dr. lones described the RAP and what is it. He started by saying that the bottom line of the
RAP is that the livelihood of the villagers is to be maintained. If the annual income of the
family is increased after the project it is good, but at least it should not go down due to the
loss of income or livelihood from the project site.
He mentioned that there are three issues in the plan. The first is that an identity card is to be
given to each of the PAP household head so that one eligible candidate from the household
may get priority in getting job in the project during construction period.
Dr. Jones said that after thorough survey, the PAP list has been made. The name and address
are in a computer database. He made it clear that by these IDs only priorities are ensured not
the jobs at the project during construction period. In addition to the priority of the PAPs, the
RAP has also recommended that the villagers from the adjacent village will also get priority.
Dr. Jones mentioned the information regarding the bad practices of syndicate and requested
the PAPs to suggest what measure they think appropriate for them.
Mr. Waliullah, a young PAP, appreciated the plan of ID card and he said that any association
or presence of middlemen should be avoided, because whatever name is given, the
association would turn into a syndicate. He preferred that the laborer at the site would be
hired directly by the Construction Contractor and the wage payment should also be given
directly without any brokerage.
Mr. Ainal wanted to know whether a contractor is to be assigned for construction work or the
AES themselves directly would do the construction work. Mr. Tajul Islam replied that the
Construction Contractor would be Hundai Corporation and they would honor the ID card
given by AES.
Md. Ali raised the issue of the compensation to the landowner given by the government. He
mentioned that they have received only 65,000 per kani (30 decimal) whereas at that time it
was about taka 125,000 lac per kani. He also mentioned the few landowners even now, have
not received the compensation.
The second issue of the RAP was also described by Dr. Jones. The PAPs, those who have lost
20% or more of their household income due to the project, would be eligible for training.
Only one person, nominated by the household, would get training through AES and the total
expenses would be given by the Sponsor.
Mr Tajul Islam added to clarify that AES is responsible for only one-third of the site that has
been recently sand filled and the AES site is on the eastern part of the site developed by the
2



Bangladesh Power Development Board. So this card is to be distributed only to the PAP
households related to AES project.
Dr Jones continued. Regarding the second area in the RAP, the villagers noted that technical
training would be beneficial because a lot of construction of industry is going on in and
around Meghnaghat area.
The third issue of the RAP was a small amount of monetary assistance and plan for fish
farming in the river which may have direct positive impact on the PAP families solely
dependent on fishing.
Mr. Jahar Ali and Nazrul Islam mentioned that the project site filling activities has hampered
the fishing particularly chai fishing.
An ex-member of the Union Parishad (Council), Mr. FazIul Haq, made concluding remarks
on behalf of the villagers. He mentioned that the people of this locality are very poor and
most of them are illiterate. Therefore, during the constriction period they might get only
manual jobs. He said that jobs through Syndicate should be avoided. In that case the poor
always suffer and only the elite with muscles and power get all the benefits.
Moreover, he said, it is still uncertain what percentage of people would be benefited from the
construction work. He appreciated the plan for training but still doubtful that it would be
difficult to compensate the loss those has already affected by the project. He requested AES
to ensure that the Construction Contractor honour the identity card and utmost care is to be
given to distribute ID Cards to the eligible families.
Resolutions Reached
After a thorough discussion among the villagers in the meeting, the following resolutions
were reached for the attention of AES, the Project Sponsor.
* The Project Sponsor were requested to ensure that the Construction Contractor honour the
RAP and the priorities are given to the ID card holders and next preference is given to the
the people of the adjacent villages.
Conclusion
At the end of the meeting, Dr. Reazur Rahman extended thanks to the participants on behalf
of AES and DPC for their spontaneous responses and contributions to the meeting expecting
full cooperation in this regard in the future also.

Date        : 10 May, 2000
Time          4:30PM
Participants: Villagers of Islampur
Introduction
A consultation meeting with the project affected persons (PAPs) was organized on May 10,
2000 in the village Islampur, a village located in close vicinity to the proposed AES
Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Project site. This meeting was a part of the overall PCDP
process currendy going on with the local community on Resetdement Action Plan (RAP) and
other related issues.
Objectives
The main objectives of the meeting were as follows:
*  Inform the meeting participants about the current status of the project implementation;
*  Discuss and exchange views/opinions about the possible social impacts of the project
with the local community and examine the appropriateness of RAP as proposed in the
draft EIA report; and
*  Discuss and record various concems of the villagers on social issues and address them in
the resettlement action plan.
A DPC team based at the project site organized the meeting and the Project Team lead by Dr.
Reazur Rahman conducted the meeting. Dr. Philip Jones from Deodar Associates and Mr.
Tajul Islam, Project Manager, AES Meghnaghat Limited accompanied the project team. Dr.
Jones, Tajul Islam, and Dr. Reaz spoke at the meeting.
The villagers were invited formally and given enough background information before they
participate in the meeting. A list of participants is appended in Appendix 1, while the Photo
Album in Appendix 2 will provide evidence of major events in the meeting (forthcoming).
Proceedines
Dr. Reazur Rahman, the DPC Project Coordinator, opened the meeting by welcoming all
present and thanking them for attending the meeting. He introduced Dr. Philip Jones, Mr.
Tajul Islam and the DPC Team members. Mr. Biswajit Biswas, Field Coordinator, and Mr.
Md Masudur Rahman Khan, Research Associate of DPC were also present in the meeting.



Dr. Reazur Rahman stated that about a fortnight back on 25 April 2000 a meeting with the
villagers of Islampur was held at the same premise on the environmental impact of the AES
Meghnaghat Power project and its mitigation plan. Some of the PAPs were also present at
that meeting. The objective of this meeting was clearly mentioned and all should concentrate
primarily on the social impacts and the RAP. He also mentioned that presence of Dr. Jones
and communication with him would be no problem because Dr. Reaz would be assisting him
as an interpreter. The presence of Mr. Tajul Islam was also appreciated, as this is the first
time the PAPs met the representative of the Project Sponsor. The villagers were also
informed that they could voice their queries and concerns directly to Mr. Tajul Islam.
Dr. Jones described the RAP and what is it. He started by saying that the bottom line of the
RAP is that the livelihood of the villagers is maintained. If the annual income of the family is
increased after the project it is good, but at least it should not go down due to the loss of
income or livelihood from the project.
He mentioned that there are three issues in the plan. The first is that each of the PAP
household will be given priority for a job in the project during construction period. An
identity card is to be given to each of the PAP household head so that one eligible candidate
from the household may get priority in getting job. He mentioned that this recruitment and
payment, as recommended in the RAP, would be done directly by the Construction
Contractor, not through any syndicate. Dr. Jones requested the PAPs to suggest what measure
they think appropriate for them.
Dr. Jones said that after thorough survey, the PAP list has been made. The name and address
are in a computer database. He made it clear that these IDs ensure only priorities not the jobs
at the project site during construction period. He clarified that AES is responsible for the
PAPs who had any stake in the eastem part of the project site developed by the Bangladesh
Power Development Board. The AES portion is only one-third of the newly sand filled area.
Md. Abdur Rahman said that some of the invited persons have not yet arrived because they
are out of the village for different dispositions. On behalf of the PAPs he mentioned that the
plan of ID card is good. During the site development activity, few of the villagers of Islampur
have gained some expefience regarding the syndicate.
Mr. Kalu Mia, a bandakee (land-leaseholder) who previously cultivated 5 kani of land on the
AES project site, also appreciated the plan for giving priority to the PAP household. He said
they are not very optimistic that the loss for the project would be recoverable. But he
requested if it is possible for AES to provide assistance to the villagers of Islampur to build a
primary school in the village.
Mr. Mohsin, a madrasha graduate, agreed with Mr. Kalu Mia and said that the villagers are
ready to donate their own land for the school and a plot close to the mosque premise is a
proper site.
The second issue of the RAP was also described by Dr Jones. The PAPs those who have lost
20% or more of their household income due to the project would be eligible for training.
Only one person, nominated by the household, would get training through AES and the total
expenses would be given by the sponsor.



Mr. Ahad Ali Pradhan, an elderly villager, said that this village has already some semi-skilled
workers. The young village boys are also working as apprentice in nearby industries. Some
has even working experience as crane operators and other vehicle drivers in construction
firms in foreign countries.  Regarding the training he mentioned the following (with
assistance from other respondents): electrical work, fitter work, crane operation, mechanical
work, gas welding, printing, plumbing, etc.
The third issue of the RAP was a small amount of monetary assistance and plan for fish
farming in the river which may have direct positive impact on the PAP families solely
dependent on fishing.
Mr. Abdul Gafur Bepari, a fish marketer, said that he is suffering from irreparable loss
because of the site filling. Now fishing is less and his business is no more. He does not hope
that fish will come back.
The villagers also request some donation to the mosque and some assistance for the
prevention of bank erosion. Every year the villagers put much effort to prevent erosion.
Resolutions Reached
After a thorough discussion among the villagers in the meeting, the following resolutions
were reached for the attention of AES, the Project Sponsor:
i The Project Sponsor was requested to ensure that the Construction Contractor honour the
RAP and the priorities are given to the ID card holders and next preference is given to the
people of the adjacent villages.
0  If the villagers of Islampur, particularly one nominated person in each of the PAP
families, have the required skills for the semi-skilled jobs at the project during the
construction phase, they would be given preferences.
3 AES would look into the issue of assisting the Islampur villagers to build a primary
school at their own land.
-  The proposal of the villagers regarding the construction of the road from the gucchagram
(cluster village) to Islampur is to be recommended to the Sponsor for their consideration.
No commitment could be given.
Conclusion
At the end of the meeting, Dr. Reazur Rahman extended thanks to the participants on behalf
of AES, Deodar Associates, ESG, and DPC for their spontaneous responses and contributions
to the meeting expecting full cooperation in this regard in the future also.

Proceedines
Dr. Reazur Rahman, the DPC Project Coordinator, opened the meeting by welcoming all
present and thanking them for attending the meeting. He informed the villagers that this
meeting is a participatory process to finalize the EIA and RAP reports. The meeting will
concentrate on RAP issues only.



Dr. Reaz introduced Dr. Philip Jones, Mr. Tajul Islam and the DPC Team members. Mr.
Biswajit Biswas, Field Coordinator and Mr. Hamid Patwary, Research Associate of DPC,
were also present in the meeting.
Dr. Reazur Rahman stated that a series of meetings with the villagers in the vicinity of power
project is being held for last few weeks. Regarding the environmental impact of the AES
Meghnaghat Power Project and its mitigation plan; the people of Ganganagar have ideas from
the researchers working in the village and through previous meeting. He also mentioned that
another meeting with the village women is schedule on this village on 15 May 2000.
The objective of this meeting was clearly mentioned and all should concentrate primarily on
the social impacts and the RAP. Dr. Reaz also mentioned that presence of Dr. Jones and
communication with him would be no problem because he would be assisting him as an
interpreter.
The presence of Mr. Tajul Islam, was also appreciated. The villagers were also informed that
they could voice their queries and concems directly to Mr. Tajul Islam.
Dr. Jones briefly described bout the meaning of RAP and what is it. He started by saying that
the bottom line of the RAP is that the livelihood of the villagers is maintained. If the annual
income of the family is increased after the project, it is good, but at least it should not go
down due to the loss of income or livelihood from the project site.

card would be given to each of the PAP household head so that one eligible candidate from
the household may get priority in getting job. He mentioned that this recruitment and
payment, as recommended in the RAP, would be done directly by the Construction
Contractor, not through any syndicate. Dr. Jones requested the PAPs to suggest what measure
they think appropriate for them.
Dr. Jones said that after thorough survey, the PAP list has been made. The name and address
are in computer database. He made it clear that these IDs ensure only priorities not the jobs at
the project site during construction period. He clarified that AES is responsible for the PAPs

more of their household income due to the project would be eligible for training. Only one
person, nominated by the household, would get training through AES who would give the
total expenses.
The third issue of the RAP was a small amount of monetary assistance and plan for fish
farming in the river which may have direct positive impact on the PAP families solely
dependent on fishing.
Mr. Tamijuddin, a young landowner, said that it is much appreciated that the consultants have
planned for such entitlements. But presently the villagers of Ganganagar are suffering for the
access road built for the project. The fence of the road is preventing the usual passage of the
villagers of this village and they have to walk all the way along the road to reach the Dhaka-



Chittagong Highway. Moreover, he said, more importantly, because of the land raised for
road now water is logged and the cultivable land owned by the villagers of Ganganagar
remain under water even during the cropping season.
Md. Chan Mia, a middle aged landowner, agreed with Mr. Tamijuddin and added that the
road and its fence is a great obstacle to the farmers and with their bullocks and ploughs - they
had to go to the highway and only by going round a long distance they can reach their land.
Mr. Tajul Islam said that he has never seen such fence on both sides of road in any project.
He suggested that the villagers could cut of the fence and made their access to their owned
plots. Regarding water logging he said that he would inform the BPBD to make passage of
the water.
Regarding the ID cards and entitlements, Mr. Awlad Hossain, whose wife named Rokhhee is
a landowner, said proper identification of PAPs should be ensured and training would be
beneficial only if the skills imparted are employable. He emphasized that jobs during
construction work would be more beneficial to them.
Nurul Islam, another land owner, said that he does not think that plan for fish farming in the
river may not have direct positive impact on the area, whereas Mr. Rumen a young villager
who earns his living by fishing said that there are ways to increase fish production and this
might have positive impact on their livelihood.
Resolutions Reached
After a thorough discussion among the villagers in the meeting, the following resolutions
were reached for the attention of AES, the Project Sponsor:
v  The Project Sponsor was requested to ensure that the Construction Contractor honor the
RAP and the priorities are given to the ID card holders and next preference is given to the
people of the adjacent villagers.
i  The water logging issue should be investigated and proper measures are to be taken so
that the villagers can reuse their arable land.
*  AES would look into the issue of assisting the Ganganagar villagers to provide them
access through the fence and BPDB would be consulted.
Conclusion
At the end of the meeting, Dr. Reazur Rahman extended thanks to the participants on behalf
of AES, Deodar Associates, ESG, and DPC for their spontaneous response and contributions
to the meeting expecting full cooperation in this regard in the future also.

Kurbanpur in Close Vicinity to the Project Area
Meeting Minutes
Venue        : Kurbanpur, (Close to Primary School)
Date          : 15 May, 2000
Time           4:30PM
Parficipants : Village Women of Kurbanpur
Introduction
A consultation meeting with the project affected persons (PAPs) was organized on May 15, 2000 with
the village women of Kurbanpur, a village near the proposed AES Meghnaghat 450 MW Power
Project site. This meeting was a part of the overall PCDP process currently going on and second
meeting with the women group on environmental issues including mitigation plan, details of
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), and other related issues.
Obbiectives
The main objectives of the meeting were as follows:
* Inform the meeting participants about the current status of the project implementation;
* Discuss and exchange views/opinions about the possible environmental and social impacts of the
project with the village women and examine the appropriateness of RAP as proposed in the draft
EIA report; and
- Discuss and record various concerns of the village women on environmental and social issues and
address them in the RAP and environmental management plan.
The DPC team based at the project site organized the meeting. Ms. Runu, a DPC sociologist,
conducted the meeting with assistance from Dr. Reazur Rahman and other DPC field team members.
The village women were invited formally and given enough background information before they
participated in the meeting. A list of participants is appended in Appendix 1, while the Photo Album in
Appendix 2 (forthcoming) will provide evidence of major events in the meeting.
Proceedings
Ms Runu, the DPC women Sociologist opened the meeting by welcoming all present and thanking
them for attending the meeting.
She said that on 26 April 2000 and on 9 May 2000 two successive meetings were held in Kurbanpur
High School premise where the male villagers were invited and discussed the project. In those
meetings environmental and social impacts of the AES power project were discussed. So it is certain
that the village women already have some ideas regarding the agenda of this meeting. She described
the objectives in brief to the women folk. The village women were also informed that they could
voice their queries and concerns.
1



The village women responded that they have heard from their husbands and relatives about those two
discussion meetings. Regarding air, noise, and water pollution the village women said that they hope
the project sponsor should comply to the mitigation plan.
While discussing the environmental issues, the women infonned that this area is within the arsenic
affected zone. Before the dredging activities for the project people of the village could use the river
water, but during dredging, which continued for quite some months, they had to used the tubewells
and many of them are having signs and symptoms of arsenic. They have also mentioned that before
sand filling on the project site, there were many trees and plants on the Charland. Now it is like a
deserL Presently the wind that blows are always hot and during gusty wind, sand particles in the air is
a nuisance. It hampers normal village activities.
Ms. Runu described what is meant by RAP and mentioned that that the bottom line of the RAP is that
the livelihood of the villagers is maintained. If the annual income of the family in increased after the
project it is good, but at least it should not go down due to the loss of income or livelihood from the
project site.
She mentioned that there are three issues in the plan. The first is that an identity card is to be given to
each of the PAP household head so that one eligible candidate from the household may get priority in
getting job on the site during construction period.
Ms. Jamirun, a young village woman, said that she is a divorcee and like most of the household in this
village her main earning was fishing. Her son used to fish and selling the catch was sufficient for the
survival of the family. But after the sand filling activities particularly because of dredging and sand
filling, the number of catch went down; she also added that the fish catch has sharply decreased in
comparison to the years before the project activities.
Ms. Shamsum Nahar, a blind middle-aged woman, said that the earning from fish was sufficient for
her survival, but now fish are no more in her low land.
Ms. Fulshaharat Begum said if the villagers get electricity when power generation by the project starts
then this would have a positive impact on the economy of the village and the negative impacts would
be compensated.
It has been observed by the women folk that after the land development activity on the project site the
number of robberies has increased in the nearby village. They understand that there is an association
because it was inconvenient for the crossing the rivers.
Some women have raised the issue that a number of families are headed by women and it may be
possible that none of those families could be eligible for site construction work to such cases access
to project training would be beneficial. Ms. Asma, a BRAC school teacher, said that UARC had an
adult literacy program for 2 years, but during that time the village women were not aware of the
importance of literacy. Most of them cannot sign their names.
Ms. Hosene Ara said that training on entering and sewing clothes would be much beneficial because
this would help them to get jobs in garment factories. Moreover this training can help them to earn
money by self-employment.
Ms. Sharfa suggested that small loans may help them to increase their income through income
generating activities such as making puffed rice, raising poultry, and selling eggs, etc.
Regarding the plan for fish farming the women did not shown any interest. They are pessimistic about
the future in this sector. They do not feel there is any hope that fish would come back.

Resolutions Reached
After a thorough discussion among the village women in the meeting, the following resolutions were
reached for the attention of AES, the Project Sponsor:
* The Project Sponsor was requested to ensure the compliance of the EIA report during
construction and operation of the project.
* During implementation of the RAP the suggestions and concems of the village women should be
duly considered.
Conclusion
At the end of the meeting, Ms. Runu extended thanks to the participants on behalf of AES and DPC
for their spontaneous response and contributions to the meeting expecting full cooperation in this
regard in the future also.

Ms. Mahmuda Begum stated that the access road to the site is protected by fence on both sides. But
they have available land on the other side of the access road. Due to the fence they have to go about
one and a half kilometers round the fence to get access to the road.
Ms. Jahanara also supported Ms. Mahmuda and said the same and requested that some papers should
be given to them with clear indication that the present fence should be removed as their access to their
land is reestablished as early as possible.
Regarding the issue, Ms. Shahenoor stated that if you don't agree with us then what is the use of this
meeting. This year due to non- accessibility and water logging they can't cultivate their own land on
the other side of the access road.
Ms. Munira stated that their houses are close to the powerhouse and she noted her concems that if any
accident inside the plant may cause harm to their households. She requested, during planing extra
caution should be taken so that any accident may not affect the locality outside the plant site. She also
expressed her concern that because of increased traffic movement the threat to more road accident is
to be considered. Because of frequent accident the villagers do not send their children to schools on
the other side of the road unless they are eight or ten years old.
Ms. Rahima said that when the land for access road was acquired by the authority clearly indicated
that this road will no create any problem to the villagers, passage for plough animal and farmers and
even water, but no such provision was made in the access road. She also said that before the project
their husbands and sons had works in the field and during rainy season they would fish on the char
land (project site). According to her, at present most of the males in the village do not have work to
do. Moreover she mentioned that the price they have received was very low in comparison to the
actual price
Ms. Jotty Bewa, an old woman, said that before the project this village was full of crops after harvest
paddy, potatoes, ground nuts, etc. were everywhere. There were varieties of work like husking for a
widow like her at that time. Presently she is almost without any work or food. The project has turned
her into a beggar.
Ms. Shahnaz told that a huge amount of land is taken as the loss of livelihood of people is also huge.
The discussion totally is only for the Phase-I plant area, but for the villagers the impact is not
segregated. She mentioned that during the land acquisition it was agreed that the cultivators would
receive compensation for standing crops, but no compensation was received.
Ms. Habiba, wife of Moslem, said that her husband is physically handicapped for last six years and
cannot do any work. Her only earning member -son does not contribute a farthing to the famnily. She,
with her sick husband and three daughters was maintaining her family by working as agricultural
laborer in the project site. Now she is without any particular work and her condition is very serious.
She wants that the Project Sponsor to rehabilitate her earning.
Ms. Shamsun Nahar, wife of late Kadaam Ali, said that her husband died by electric shocks when he
was working,. At present she has 4 daughters to maintain and she is facing much difficulty because
the project has taken away her land.
Ms. Momena, wife of Md. Kumu, said that her two sons have left her and she has to live on her own.
Before the project she had good earning during harvest as she had work. She worked as labor while
the road was constructed. She wanted a job in the project site.
Ms. Umela, wife of Joynal Abedin, said that they had house on the eastem side of the project site.
They have not received any compensation for the housing structure. Her husband worked during
bridge construction, but at present is out of job.
Ms. Shahela, wife of Ali Mia, said that they had also two room house on the project site. Because of
the project they are now in a distressed condition.
Ms. Sufia, wife of Abdul Ali Sarker, said that they had land on the project area and Ms. Feroza, wife
of Md Khalil, said that she lost about 20 kani of land in a single plot. Both of them stated that their
2



livelihood is at a stake and requested that the RAP should consider their family for rehabilitation of
their livelihood.
Resolutions Reached
The concems and the request made by the participants were duly recorded and the report of the
meeting would be passed on to the concerned authority to make a plan accordingly and where
required corrective measures should be taken. The requests for passage through the access road should
be considered. This concern was also recorded during the meeting with the male villagers on 12 May
2000 at the same premise. The request of jobs for the women or their nominees during construction
period were also recorded and this should be taken into consideration during implementation of RAP
document.

Participants : Villagers of Panchani
Introduction
A public consultation meeting was organized on 19 May 2000 with the villagers at
Panchani. This meeting was a part of the overall PCDP process currently going on on
environmental impacts and mitigation plan, Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), and other
related issues.
Objectives
The main objectives of the meeting were as follows:
*  Inform the meeting participants about the current project implementation status;
*  Discuss and exchange views/opinions about the possible environmental impacts of
the project with the local community and examine the appropriateness of the
mitigation plan as proposed in the draft EIA report; and
* Discuss and record the concerns of the villagers on environmental and RAP issues for
addressing them in the revised environmental management plan and finalization of
EIA document.
The meeting was organized by DPC PCDP management team and supported by the on-
site Project Team. The villagers were invited formally and given enough background
information before they participated in the meeting. A list of participants is appended in
Appendix 1, and a photo album in AppendLx 2 (forthcoming) will provide evidence of
major events in the meeting.
Proceedings
Dr. Reazur Rahman, the DPC Research Coordinator, opened the meeting by welcoming
all present and thanking them for attending the meeting.
Dr. Reazur Rahman explained the overall status of the project implementation to the
audience and invited them to voice their comments and questions on project related
1



issues. Dr. Rahman briefly described the salient features and findings of environmental
studies carried out and possible impacts of the project to the participants. He also
explained the course of actions would be pursued by the Project Sponsor with regard to
environmental impact mitigation. About the environmental issues, he informed the
audience the broad status of existing environmental conditions as benchmark and assured
the audience that subsequently all out efforts will be made for keeping the environment of
the area intact as it exists now. Regarding the RAP, in broad outline of the plan was
discussed. The villagers were informed that their views, concerns, and suggestions would
be duly considered during finalization of the EIA report.
Mr. Abdul Alim mentioned that the landowners coming from the villages on this side of
the project had most of their land in Phase-3 of the project. Only a few owned the land,
which is now presently under Phase-I. He said that by fishing in a part of the day one
could earn Tk. 200-300. But due to discharge of warmn water at the outfall, the fish would
not come to this area because of additional rise of temperature in the river water. So the
fishing in this area would be totally stopped leading us to the remarkable loss to our daily
income and livelihood.
Mr. Raja Mia reciprocated the same concern as stated by Abdul Alim adding that if the
normal temperature of the water become high during the summer, it might stopped the
flow of the fishes and thus reducing the quantity of fish catch. He expressed his concern
that if additional warm water is discharged to this water area, the fish movement would
be totally stopped, he apprehended. He again regretted that at night he would catch fish
before filling sand in the project site and earned taka 100 to taka 150 per day. Now he has
been depriving from this cash income and became unemployed.
Mr. Moti Sarker expressed his concern about the high pressure water to be discharged
into the water pool that might stop the fish movement in this area and in course of time
the fish cultivation would be extinguished in the area as that was observed at the
Siddirganj Power Station site. There should be special arrangement for dissipation of the
high pressure. He and Raja Mia claimed that after sand filling the water became muddy
and under this condition quantity of fishes was reduced and have negative impacts on the
income from this source. He again said that before sand filling, he would earn about Tk.
70,000 to 80, 000 but now this income was reduced to only Tk. 20,000 per year. He said
that they had been seriously affected. Mr. Sarker also said that he had no legal document,
but everybody in this area knew him as a Jhop fishermen.
Mr. Ahsan Ali said that they could distribute Identity Cards (ID) properly if entrusted
with the assignment because they knew everybody. As a result nobody could claim of his
ignorance of having the ID card.
Mr. Abdur Rashid stated and requested the concerned authority to take proper steps so
that the area should not be affected. He said that the want of fish was deeply felt in the
meantime. He observed that neither the flow of water nor the fish movement was evident
in this area.
As a whole they claimed that it was the responsibility of the authority concerned to
protect the existing environmental condition for the betterment of the locality. They
explained the technical terms in this regard. They simply understood the healthy
environment where they could live with their family member smoothly.                      )

Resolutions Reached
The concerns and the request made by the participants were duly recorded and it was
observed that in comparison to other areas, the villagers of this area are mainly affected
by the Phase-E site of the BPDB land, not the AES site. The PAPs of the AES site were
duly identified and measures are to be taken to address their concerns. The requests of
jobs during the construction period were also recorded an,,- this should be taken into
consideration during implementation of RAP. It was mentioned that this is only for the
PAPs of the AES project site.
Conclusion
At the end of the meeting, Dr. Reazur Rahman extended thanks to the participants on
behalf of AES and DPC for their spontaneous response and contributions to the meeting
expecting full cooperation in this regard in the future also.

Date          : 13 June, 2000
Time          : 3 PM
Participants : Local Elite and PAPs of the Region
Introduction
A public consultation meeting was organized on 13 June 2000 with the regional elite people and
the PAPs of the region of the power plant area. This meeting was a part of the overall PCDP
process currently going in the second phase on environmental impacts and mitigation plan and
other related issues of the Meghnaghat.
Objectives
The main objectives of the meeting were as follows:
*  Inform the meeting participants about the current project implementation status
= Discuss and exchange views/opinions about the possible environmental impacts of the project
with the local community and examine the appropriateness of the mitigation plan as proposed
in the draft EIA report
* Discuss and record the concerns of the regional level local elite and stakeholders on
environmental issues for addressing them in the revised environmental management plan.
Meeting was organized by DPC team responsible for PCDP implementation and the on-site
Project Team. The regional elites and stakeholders and the PAPs in the locality were invited
formally and given enough background information before they participate in the meeting. A list
of participants is appended in Appendix 1, and a Photo Album in Appendix 2 will provide
evidence of major events in the meeting.
Proceedings
Dr. Reazur Rahman, the DPC Research Coordinator opened the meeting by welcoming all
present and thanking them for attending the meeting. He introduced Mr Tajul Islam, Project
Manager to the audience, as representative of the Project Sponsor.
Dr. Reazur Rahman explained the overall status of the project implementation to the audience and
invited them to voice their comments and questions on project related issues. Dr Rahman briefly
described the salient features and findings of environmental studies carried out and the possible
impacts of the project on the PAPs and local community. He also explained the course of actions
would be pursued by the Project Sponsor with regard to esnvironmental impacts mitigation.

Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Project
About the environmental issues, he informed the audience the broad status of existing
environmental conditions as benchmark and assured the audience that subsequently all out efforts
will be made for keeping the environment of the area intact as it exists now. He briefly informed
the RAP issues and the plan.
Engr. Shamsul Haque, a local elite, stated that they were very happy to have the 450 MW Power
Plant on Char Ramjan Sonaullah mouza in the union of Pirojpur. He disclosed in the meeting that
the local people did not oppose to the land acquisition for the plant, rather they assisted the
authority in all respects. He said that they lost land and other valuables due to the land
acquisition. But so far they did not get anything in return except money for land. That money was
inadequate and even some people still did not receive it at all. He expressed the sufferings that in
the mean time, because of financial hardship the education to their children had been about to
stop. He claimed that among the PAPs, those who used to fish on the project site they would earn
about Tk 200 to Tk 300 per day by catching and selling fishes in the area. Their income was not
actively considered during compensation.
He demanded that the ID cards should be given as per list given by the Chairman so that they
could realize who had been missed. He also claimed that the posts of engineers, supervisors and
sub-assistant engineers should be appointed from among the PAPs on the basis of eligibility &
priority. And other PAPs would be selected for the jobs in the project and outside the project on
the basis of individual eligibility. The proper arrangement should be made by providing facilities
to the women for bathing places. The people of his area (Kurbanpur) catch fishes upto Jhaochar
and earn a handsome amount of money for their livelihood. He raised allegation that in the
meantime the Nala had been closed due to sand-flow coming out from the site and our paddy
fields became unfertile due to depletion of sand on the fertile land. He finally requested to protect
the local environmnent as it was as before the construction of the power plant.
He added that in the west of the project site about 24,000 to 30,000 people lived but there was no
gate to enter in this area, he regretted adding that nobody had paid any heed to our appeal. A gate
is a bare necessity to go the village of Panchani, Mongolergaon, Kurbanpur and Dudhghata, he
claimed.
Mazharul Islam of Village Ganganagar , claimed that atleast one-third land of the AES Power
Plant site belonged to their greater family group and another one-third land belonged to Union
Parishad Chairman Serajul Islam's greater family group but that part was mostly on the phase III
land. He said that when they had the land, they would cultivate and many people worked on the
fields. But now those crops and work of people were no more because of the implementation of
the Power Project on their land acquired by the Government. Presently the value of land has
become Taka 400,000-500,000 per acre. But they had received only taka 120,000 per acre from
the Government/PDB. He appreciated the attempts of AES to provide the training program to the
PAPs for their skill development, so that they could be appointed either in the project or in other
gainful activities out side the project.
He claimed that the approach road had been stretched over their chest but at that moment they
could not go through the road due to the obstruction by making a fence along the power plant
boundary. There is no drainage system and thus water logging is a big problem in the area. Before
the construction of the road, there was a canal linked with the Meghna and at times the country
boat would pass through the canal. He requested the authority concerned to make necessary
arrangements for drainage of stagnant water and let the land be cultivable. This is required so that
the owner of the waterlogged area should not suffer any more.
Some of the PAPs had lost their homesteads and they would desire to be rehabilitated with the
legal compensation in the villages.                                                            )

Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Project
He also requested to issue ID Cards to the PAPs as early as possible through the Chairman and it
rather better to distribute the ID Card among the PAPs before starting the construction of the
Power Plant.
Md Asaf Ali Bhuiyan said that most of the people of the area were farmers, laborers, fishermen
and small fish-trader in this village. He said before the sand filling, there were crops in the field
and compensations for standing crops were calculated but none had received it so far. He
expressed doubts whether the training program would be useful because the Hyundai Company
would supply the required manpower as per the contract made with them and the people trained
by the Project Sponsor would not get any job in the project.
He alleged that the authority had acquired additional land beyond their requirements and
encircled by making barbed fences along the periphery of the power plant area. Moreover he
demanded that within the fence there were more land in addition to the land formally and
officially acquired by the project.
Access for about 200,000 to 250,000 people to the highway was intervened by making fences.
Now people have to turned around about 2-3 kms additional distances and have to expend taka 40
for the access to highway for their daily routine works. He expressed his concerns that due to the
construction of the power plant, air, soil, water would be polluted and that would cause a lot of
negative influences to the locality. He requested the authority concerned to protect the IRRI
cropped land from the anticipated harmful actions. He also expressed his deep concern that the
dacoity, snatching, robbery and other social crimes would increase at the higher rate due to
joblessness and increase in poverty because of the construction of the power plant. He said that
during wind the sand flowing from the project site at the Meghna were polluting rooms, clothes
and other domestic materials.
He also requested for giving proper compensations for the project-affected people and 70% cuts
in power bill for the PAPs who were the freedom fighters.
Md Alekuzzaman made his efforts to draw the attention of the authority concerned and expected
that nothing would be harmful to the people of this locality. He said that the land of this area, the
Meghna and its floodplain were the breeding centers of the fishes. Most of the people of this area
would maintain their livelihood by earning from fishing. He said in his statement that there was
no linkage for the floodplain with the Meghna River. As a result of this it would bring a series of
sufferings to the lives and livelihoods of the people of this locality.
He requested the authority not to drop waste to the river and the water of the area. He again
appealed to control the temperature of the discharged water at the normal temperature so that the
river water could not become hot which is beyond tolerance limit of the aquatic resources.
Original floodplains, ditches might be the alternative sources of fish cultivation provided
financial support is available atleast for the humanitarian grounds and thus creating job fields for
the unemployed youths.
Tamiz Uddin stated that he was a small trader and wanted a favorable environment for running
his trades adding that in the meantime, the fishermen became unemployed. The entry of the road
built by PDB had been closed for the general public. He requested that every affected village
should be provided with gas facilities. He made allegations that during the sand-filling,
additional land had been acquired but no actual compensation had been paid. He said that he
deposited money for the job as a labour to the manpower authority but could not yet managed job
for himself. He repented that he might get a job by bribing Tk. 10,000 to Tk. 15,000 to the
concerned person.

Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Project
Md Hasan Ali expressed his strong determination to live on rice staying at home and dealing in
fishes during rainy season. He said that he would cultivate some land on the basis of lease, no
compensation would be realized for the land having the Parcha ( A deed having land plot number,
Tauzi Number, J L Number, Record holders and identification of land) after Revised Settlement
(RS).
Tarani Mohan Sarker, Block Suvervisor, Thana Agriculture Office, insisted that about 80%
people of this area are the farmners. Land would be remain fallow provided the nala (small canal)
was closed. He said that the quantity of agricultural land had been reduced and requested the
authority concerned not to drop industrial waste on the agricultural land. He suggested to plant
saplings as per advice of the Department of Agriculture Extension to make a green belt for noise
protection. He wanted a growth center to be located there.
Nurul Islam, Joinpur, said that the village would be flooded provided the canal (Nala) was
closed and requested to dig the canal so that the stagnant water could flow normally. He wanted a
road for the public to go to the west. Now they have to go through the Power plant area.
He inforrned that some people of this area were searching in Power Development Board. He also
opined that the women would be provided with jobs in the project based on their eligibility.
Mr Emdad Sarker, suggested rehabilitation of the PAPs through Cooperatives (Society) and he
was seeking approval through the Chairman of Pirojpur Union. He wanted a gate in the western
side for the people of the area. He requested the authority concerned to take necessary
arrangements for keeping environment free from pollutants.
Aman Ulah, a Bank Employee, requested AES to take necessary arrangements for dredging the
river. He also requested not to drop the industrial waste to the river water and not to pollute the
environment.
Mr Nur Mohammad, Ganganagar, disclosed that on both side of the present access road there
were strips of land having the width about 20 feet that was owned by Power Development Board.
These strips of land could be used for the public. He also requested to distribute ID Cards through
the Chairman of the Union.
Engineer Shamsul Hoque, once again took the floor and said that they made the Syndicate
which took money for giving jobs to the people but presently the syndicate was declared
inoperative. He expressed his desire to form an association for the PAPs he wanted assurance so
that they would not have to face troubles and obstacles in future. He requested to advise the
Deputy Commissioner for his active assistance in payment because there were many who did not
receive any compensation for land.
Tajul Islam, Project Manager, Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Project assured the audience
saying that every point discussed here would be duly considered for the finalization of the EIA
document and the measures to be taken during implementation of the project.
He said that there are possibilities of three kinds of negative effects. The temperature of the
discharged water would be as high as 4' to 5° C particularly on the western side where the water
will be discharged into the river. During the winter particularly between March-May when the
water level of the River will be lower then the adverse effects would be more. He said that the
combined effects of two power plants were considered and through modeling the probable
impacts were assessed.
The noise intensity would be kept equal or below 45 dBA which was as per World Bank
Guidelines. He said that not a bit of pollutants nor any type of wastes would be drooped into the
4



Meghnaghat 450 MW Power Project
river water. The standard of chlorine gas and chlorine water would be maintained within the
WHO standard. As a result of this, the fish would experience a little harm.
Moreover he mentioned that so far it is known that water temperature up to 350 C is not harmful
for crops and agriculture.
In the conclusion the Chairman of the meeting made his remarks on the following issues:
*  The grievance of the people has been already expressed in the meeting. This is clearly
expressed in the fact that the children of the PAPs have stopped going to schools and
colleges, because of the sudden deterioration of the economic condition of their family. So it
is quite natural that they would get jobs atleast during construction period of the project. He
emphasized if the jobs are not provided to the PAPs, situation may go out of control and there
are possibility of violence. This is because the suffering of the people is great as the total land
area for all the three power plants is also great.
*  It is a matter of regret that the happiness of the poor people is gone forever.
*  He proposed that all the affected villages like Mongelergaon, Dudhghata, Islampur,
Nayagaon would be facilitated with gas supply.
*  The obstruction to the normal access of the students from the adjacent villages to the Dhaka-
Chittagong highway and Meghnaghat bazar is removed and if not possible alternate easy
access is to be established
*  He thanked as proposal has been made to built a primary school and road construction works
for the villagers of Islampur. He added that gate at the eastern side for the people of
Dudhghata and a bridge for passing of people and also pass way for villagers of Ganganagar
through the same road.
Resolutions Reached
The concerns and the request made by the participants were duly recorded and the report of the
meeting would be passed on to the concerned authority to made plan accordingly and where
required corrective measures should be taken. The requests of jobs during construction period
were also recorded and this should be taken into consideration during implementation of RAP.
Conclusion
At the end of the meeting, Dr Reazur Rahman extended thanks to the participants on behalf of
AES and DPC for their spontaneous response and contributions to the meeting expecting full
cooperation in this regard in the future also.

Participants : National Level Stakeholders
Introduction
A public consultation meeting was organized on 03 July 2000 with the national level stakeholders and
the persons who have expertise in EIA at the Women Voluntary Association (WVA) Auditorium.
This meeting was part of the overall PCDP process in the second phase and was the final meeting on
environmental impacts and mitigation plan and other project related issues.
Obiectives
The main objectives of the meeting were as follows:
- inform the meeting participants about the current project implementation status;
*  discuss and exchange views/opinions about the possible environmental impacts of the project with
the local community and examine the appropriateness of the mitigation plan as proposed in the
draft EIA report; and
* discuss and record the concerns of the national level stakeholders and EIA experts on
environmental issues for addressing them in the revised environmental management plan.
Meeting was organized by DPC team responsible for PCDP implementation with support of the
Project Team in close collaboration of AES. The national level stakeholders and EIA experts were
invited formally and given enough background information before they participated in the meeting.
The draft EIA Report was also distributed to a various invitees. A list of participants is appended in
Appendix 1, and a Photo Album in Appendix 2 (forthcoming) will provide evidence of major events
in the meeting.
Proceedines
Dr. Ain-un Nishat, a national ELA expert and the Country Coordinator of IUCN Bangladesh chapter
who was invited to the meeting as chief guest, formally chaired the meeting. At the podium, Dr.
Monwar Hossain, Head of the Department of Water Resources Engineering, BUET, was also present
as special guesL
Dr. Reazur Rahman, the DPC Project Coordinator, opened the meeting by welcoming all and thanking
them for attending the meeting. He made some introductory remarks, which included the present stage
of the project implementation and the draft EIA report. Engineer Mahbubur Rahman, Mr. Mustafa
Kamal and other members from DPC were also present.
Mr. Tajul Islam, Project Manager, AES Meghnaghat Power Project, on behalf of AES presented the
Draft EIA Report. He was assisted by Mr. Mohammad Anis and Mr. Nipak Shaha, two of AES's
Project Manager's based in Dhaka office. Mr. Tajul Islam presented the Draft EIA findings with the



help of a video projector. In his presentation, he briefly described the salient features and findings of
environmental studies carried out and possible impacts of the project to the participants. He also
explained that the Project Sponsor, with regard to environmental impact mitigation would pursue the
course of actions as delineated in the EIA report. About the environmental issues, he informed the
audience the broad status of existing environmental conditions as benchmark and assured the audience
that subsequently all out efforts will be made for keeping the environmental condition at least at the
present level. He mentioned that the expected date of commissioning of the power project is
September 2002 and AES is giving the cheapest price for electricity, which is only 1.37 paisa per
kilowatt-hour.
Regarding the resettlement issue, Mr. Islam mentioned that the land area acquired by BPDB for AES
site is only 70 acres and in this area there were only four housing structures. The initial total of
various categories of project affected persons (PAPs) was estimated as 746 having categories such as
landowners, sharecroppers/bhandhakees, unauthorised PAPs on Khas land, Agricultural wage laborer,
fishermen, jhop fishermen, etc.
Key issues raised by the important discussants are described below:
Dr. Mahfuzul Huque, Secretary, NEAB
During the site preparation, Dr. Mahfuzul Huque, Secretary of National Environmental Association of
Bangladesh (NEAB) visited the project area and he said that he had observed a serious encroachment
into the Meghna River. Even he fears that the people of village Islampur, that is hardlylO meters away
from the barbed fence of the power plant area, will experience a tremendous noise during the
operational period. He wanted to know the use of cooling water and mentioned that probably hot
water will be discharged to the Meghna River. If the hot water is discharged in the Meghna River, the
fish habitat in the river water will be totally disturbed and the lives of other aquatic plants and animals
will be seriously affected.
The access road, having about 938 meters length, has divided the wet land area (where fish and
agricultural crop would have been cultivated) into two parts providing no navigational facilities to the
people of the project affected locality. Where as the people of the surrounding area of the power plant
used this natural pool of water during rainy season as waterways. Now this pool of water has become
obstructed for plying boats and other water transports. The southern part is now water logged and
even agricultural crop cultivation is being seriously affected.
He also said that PAPs compensation for land value was done wrongly. We all know that the price
recorded in the land register office is always low. This is universally practiced in this country to pay
less tax. So when market value is calculated in this way by default the landowners become victim.
Moreover everybody knows what manipulation is being done to receive the compensation money.
About Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), he commented that training should be provided to each
member (who is able to take training) of each affected family whoever may be and provided with job
in the project. He remarked that the training period should be for a minimum 6 months-period.
Dr. Ain -Un Nishat, Country Representative, IUCN
Dr. Nishat in his brief commentary expressed that the affected people of the project area expected
permanent solutions to the acute problems following proper Environmental Management Planning
(EMP). He further said one bridge over the water pool along the access road should have been
constructed giving legitimate facilities to the affected people of the surrounding area. He further
mentioned that he would be glad if the Directorate of Environment (DOE) organized a public hearing
on the EIA. He thanked AES for organizing a national level discussion.
Dr. Ainun Nishat: Country Representative, IUCN                                                         9

He questioned. Where is the hot water discharged? Hot water can be used for irrigation purposes as
per our practical experience in Ghorasal and Siddirganj power plant it is well known to the farmers
that the hot water is beneficial to irrigation purpose because it does harms to the insecticides attacked
to the crop fields.
He gave thanks to the participants and organizers of the national level meeting. He also thanked to the
PAP representatives for giving their views and comments on the issue. At last he concluded the
meeting expecting immediate incorporation of the valid points discussed in the meeting by the
honorable resource persons in the final EIA Report.
Ms. Reba Paul, Environmental SpecialisL Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB)
Ms. Reba Paul, said in her statement that she had thoroughly gone through the Report. She
commented that residual impacts should have been focussed in the report. The noise level of the
power plant area should not exceed 45 dBA or else the hearing of the workers would be impaired.
She mentioned that a multidisciplinary team has worked in the preparation of the Draft EIA repon and
many people have been consulted. The names should be properly included in the report. She said that
there should be proper grievance mechanism, giving compensation is not enough. The transaction of
compensation to the loss to the properties of the project-affected area should be realized properly and
monitored regularly. Ms Paul emphasized that the experience of Jamuna bridge RAP implementation
should be followed in case of Meghnaghat Project.
Dr. Mizan R Khan (SEMP)
Dr. Mizan R Khan expressed in his statement that, though he is not a hardcore technical expert in this
sector, he wanted to divide his comments into two parts, like specific comments and macro-
comments. In the specific comments he said that the report seemed to be very rosy. Regarding the
noise pollution he raised the question whether the animals, other than human, are also affected. If so,
he said care should be taken not to do harm to the animals. He said, the methodology for the
preparation of EIA reports not clear to him. The training cost must be realized before staring the
training course for the PAP members.
In his macro-comments he said that the supply and demand of electricity should be meet, but at the
same time the gaseous emission should be mitigated at any cost. The proper steps should be taken to
reduce the system loss to l/3'd of the present amount giving emphasis on energy management. This is
specially required because the investment in power generation is huge. Also proper steps should be
taken to create social awareness among the people and stakeholders of this area.
Mr. Mamunul Huque Khan (SEMP) and Member of NEAB
In the deliberation, Mr. Mamunul Huque expressed his opinions on the basic issues of the EIA. To
him, it appears that the EIA exercise is incomplete. This is particularly because the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) that is the management and monitoring plan etc are "missing" in the EIA
repon. The methods like CB analysis, Matrix and 3-D modeling etc. may be used to make the
presentation clearer.
He said that the entire report seemed too cloudy. It is needed to find out the parameters, which were
affected during EMP mitigation. The embedding of power plant pipelines and power plant related
other works should be brought under EIA procedures. The 3-D modeling may be preferred. He
wanted to know that what was the baseline of measuring environmental impacts. The parameters of
mitigation measures were seen also missing and some of them were for the year 1997. He thanked the
sponsor for organizing the discussion meeting and mentioned that this is not commonly practiced.

Dr. Gul Hossain, Senior Researcher, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI)
ln his statement Dr. Gui Hossain expressed his anguish about the system loss and mismanagement of
public Sector power plant. He gave an emphasis on transparency and accountability of public sector
power generation system. He mentioned that from the national dailies he leamed that during land
filling the compaction was not properly done. After much negotiation BPDB agreed to finance the
additional money for further compaction. Through proper management this money could be saved and
with that money the project affectees could be adequately compensated.
Miah Mohd. Shamsul Huque: Vice Chairman of the Liaison Committee of the Project Affected
People (Land Owner)
Mr. Huque expressed his dissatisfaction over the non-fulfillment of their demands placed earlier with
various authorities. They wanted two roads for providing facilities to about 40,000 people of this
locality. They demanded a small link road in the eastern side of project connecting the Islampur
village so that they can easily come to their work place. They now desire to be trained up for skill
development in order to get jobs in the project. They also demanded a gate at the we'st side extending
facilities to the people of the west of the project area, so that they can easily come to the main road to
go their work place elapsing minimum tirne from their houses. He informed the meeting that there
was a nala (a small natural outlet for passage of water) where special types of shrimp was cultivated
and exported to foreign countries and earned a lot of foreign exchange. But now this nala was closed
due to the construction of the power plant. They demanded to keep the nala open / perennial allowing
fish ladder for shrimp cultivation. He also expressed his opinion that the fish cultivation in the area
will be affected due to rise of temperature following the discharge of hot water into the Meghna River
from the power plant.
Mr. Mazharul Islam: Representative of PAP
Mr Islam expressed his deep concern over the access road and canal issues and he told the meeting
with anguish that they had been already deprived of the opportunities to express views in the project
planning of the power generation area. In his opinion the villagers wanted access road, two gates, but
they were not able to draw the attention to the authority. He said that the water logging is evident and
the canal was closed. He also informed that a Canteen is going to be opened in the plant area under
the management and close supervision of AES. He demanded that preference should be given to the
unemployed youths-men or women of the PAP groups for the selection of Canteen employees. In the
meeting he gave a pen-picture of their sorrows and sufferings and narrated that they had lost all
cultivable lands and other valuables due to construction of the power plant. Some of them even lost
their last pieces of land for cultivation and that led them to becoming landless.
Mr. Noor Mohammad: Land Owner
Mr. Noor Mohammad said in his statement that he was a farmer, now did not have any land for
cultivation. He claimed that they were fishing in the river and regularly earned about fifty thousand to
one lac taka annually from jhop fishing. He mentioned that before, all opportunities he had earned
now he has nothing to make his livelihood. He claimed that as he is much aged, presently he is even
not fit for any job, therefore he should be paid with monetary compensation.
He also said that at the initial stage, we were assured that we would receive taka one lac per decimal
of land but we got the same amount against 31 decimals of land. He lamented that now they are to go
to their work places from their houses by spending two hours additional time along the curved path
due to the construction of the power plant. It is at the same time time-consuming and expensive.
Mr. Noor Mohammad, Secretary, Liaison Committee of the PAPs
He said in his statement that about 80% people of Dhudghata village are involved in local business
and earn an adequate amount of money for their livelihood and maintaining a minimum standard.
They have now become jobless and unemployed for an indefinite period. They will have no other
altematives, but to commit robbery in the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway, if they are not provided with
4



the jobs in the AES plant. He requested the authority concemed to issue work permit through issuing
ID cards. He said that the gas pipeline was being embedded and the gas supply would be started very
soon. He requested the concerned authority to supply gas to the house of the PAPs so that they can
avail the opportunity for their domestic use. He also seeks assurance from AES authority to provide
jobs for the PAP's in the project construction activities.
Mr. MA Kalam, Additional Chief Engineer, DPHE
In his deliberation Mr. Kalam raised some basic questions before the house on groundwater and
surface water. He wanted to know the procedures of surveying the ground and surface water. He also
wanted to know whether quality and quantity of water and the location of aquifer had been surveyed
or not. His inquiries were to know the methods and procedures for surveys of the same applied. He
questioned, did they carry out any test for arsenic for surface or groundwater? He observed that there
were no references of these vital issues in the report. How are the cooling water and the hot water
discharged from the plant? It is not clearly mentioned in the report. What was the unit/definition of
lower emission, not mentioned? The fish cultivation will be seriously affected due to the rise of
temperature in the river water, it was because of the discharge of the hot water into the river. He also
demanded for issuing ID Cards to the PAPs and workers.
Syed Shah Tariquzzaman: President of NEAB
Syed S Tariquzzaman, the President of NEAB expressed the legal and design aspects of the project in
his deliberation and it needed to be explained elaborately. He exerted pressure on AES to elaborate
the EMP, social action plan and ISO-14000 for emission. He. requested AES to appoint Social
Development Officer/ Community Development Officer before the construction work starts. The
compensation for the loss to the properties of the PAPs should be quickly distributed. Necessary
arrangements/precautions should be taken for proper maintaining of fishes and human health. He
claimed for some benefits to the owners and there should be an access road for the public. He
commented that report should have been distributed before a couple of months. The stakeholders
should have opportunity to keep active role/sufficient room for expressing their views on the SIA. He
demanded EMP should be executed properly. He explained that in the report there was no elaboration
of legal issues of environmental management.
He gave emphasis on the rights to easement and access to the definite destination. He assessed that the
EAP / EMP needed to be re-addressed properly. He assumed that the present EIA report looked like a
quick copy to that of Mott MacDonald and it was done any way without giving much attention. He
pointed out that at the time of preparation of the report, no health specialists were consulted. He again
found out the defects for non-disclosure of the names of the resource persons.
Mr. S. T. Zaman concluded his statement adding that another session of the discussion on the report
should be held for qualitative improvement of the report after incorporating the comments, views, and
opinions expressed by speakers in the meeting.
Treasurer of NEAB
The report is hollow and superfluous. The 450 MW power project is a big thing. All aspects relating
to the power plant should come under consideration for preparation of EIA. In the project there is no
legal aspects and little elaboration of social aspects. The people's interaction and sacrifice have not
been focussed properly in the report. There is no touch of bio-diversity wet-land issues in the report.
Mr. Serajul Huq Bhuiyan, Chairman of the Liaison Committee of the Project Affected People
(Land Owner)
In the report, the Chairnan noticed that there is a scope for a school to the people of Islampur and
Ganganagar, but no scope for schools in other places. The unemployed youths should be provided
with small work. In the meantime, the youths of Kurbanpur and Nayanagar have become jobless and
unemployed and will commit robbery in the highway very soon if they are not provided with jobs in
the projecL He recalled that before the land acquisition they produced and trading sweet potatoes,
chili, and other products in the locality. He raised about the gate and mentioned that it should be
constructed for the welfare of the public of the locality. Those who deal in fish, they have become
5



unemployed, they have no work at hand. If a road from Dhudghata to Dhaka-Chittagong highway is
constructed about 60,000 people will benefit. He gave stress on the construction of a bridge over the
access road.
Dr. Monwar Hossain: Head of the Department of Water Resources Engineering, BUET
Dr Monwar Hossain, the special Guest in the meeting stated that the points discussed here were all
valid points and these should be addressed properly in the report. In addition to that some points
relating to the environmental and social assessments must be addressed properly.
Resolutions Reached
After a thorough discussion at the meeting, the following resolutions were reached for the attention of
AES, the Project Sponsor
*  The audience requested that the Project Sponsor should improve the presentation of the report
including the suggestions and recommendations made at the meeting. The concerns are to be duly
recorded and steps are to be made during finalization of the report.
*  The limitations and the constraints of the EIA research should be clearly mentioned in the EIA
executive summary indicating the present EIA and previous IEE was initiated during site-filling
exercise when the land boundaries completely hidden under piles of sands and some PAPs have
left the area without leaving any address. Moreover it is very difficult to segregate the impact of
the AES plant project site from the land of other two phases.
Conclusion
At the end of the meeting, Dr. Reazur Rahman extended thanks to the participants on behalf of AES
and DPC for their spontaneous responses and contributions to the meeting expecting full cooperation
in this regard in the future also. The chairman of the meeting formally declared the conclusion of the
meeting with thanks and requested the guest to join the lunch party.
