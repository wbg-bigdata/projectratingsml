F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The PDO as contained in the DCA was to assist in the development of a modern and
efficient infrastructure system in Bangladesh by promoting private sector participation,
inter alia, in the investment, operation, ownership and maintenance of infrastructure
facilities. This translated into the specific objectives: (i) enable flow of private
investment in the form of commercial equity and debt financing for infrastructure project;
and (ii) enhance GOB's capacity to attract and realize private sector interest and
investment in infrastructure projects

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The objectives of the Post Flood Recovery Program (for which $154 million from PSIDP
was allocated in March 2005) were: (i) rehabilitation of physical and social infrastructure
damaged by September 2004 flood for speedy recovery of affected areas and population
particularly the poor and vulnerable, while emphasizing on reduction on vulnerability
over long term; and (ii) promotion of infrastructure projects for private participation and
creation of a framework for the sustained and efficient operation of infrastructure by
private sector including making the Private Sector infrastructure Guidelines (PSIG)
operational.

I. Disbursement Profile

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background

At the time the project was being designed in the mid `90s Bangladesh stock of physical
infrastructure was dilapidated and inadequate and as such was a constraint on both its
international competitiveness and the growth of agriculture and rural incomes. Despite many
years of support from IDA and other donors, Bangladesh's physical infrastructure suffered
from under-investment and severe operational problems. All the infrastructure sectors (power,
gas supply, roads, ports, telecom, water, etc) were thus affected. For example the situation
with respect to power supply in 1998 was described as follows ...generating capacity needs
to be increased by almost 1,200 MW (an increase of almost 50%) ....because of inadequate
capacity load shedding is frequent...inadequate capacity is compounded by massive system
loss of over 35% due mainly to illegal connections and corrupt billing practices...
Congestion and mismanagement at the Chittagong port and the other main ports was a major
obstacle to increased trade.

The government that took office in 1991 had adopted a comprehensive program of
stabilization and structural adjustment that by the mid-90s had resulted in commendable
macro-stability and internal and external balance. Across almost all macroeconomic
indicators, Bangladesh's stabilization performance stood out among IDA countries as
exemplary. However progress on structural reform remained disappointing.

In the case of the power sector an inter ministerial working group had prepared a report on
power sector reforms that led in 1996 to publication of a policy document pertaining to
private investment in generation of electricity. This provided for fiscal incentives and
outlined the institutional support and project approval process that would enable private
investment in generation projects. It also outlined the financing arrangements envisaged
including a fund that would provide concessional finance to projects. PSIDP would
operationalize this fund through the setting up of IDCOL which was intended to act as a
conduit for IDA financing for infrastructure development. At the time the project was being
designed this policy was already being implemented. A unit (Power Cell) to facilitate
transactions had been set up in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) and
competitive bidding with the participation of reputable internal developers was advanced for
several large generation projects including the sub-project that would be later financed by
PSIDP (Meghnaghat). Although key pricing and regulatory policies were under discussion
and draft legislation on setting up a regulatory body had been prepared, these reforms had not
been unambiguously formulated nor had legislation giving them effect been promulgated.
However some significant sector restructuring had been carried out with the establishment of
Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) in 1990 and subsequently of the Power Grid
Company (for ownership of transmission assets) and the Dhaka Electric Supply Company
(ownership of distribution assets in the Dhaka area except for the southern part of the city
whose supply is the responsibility of DESA) under the Companies Act in 1996.

In telecommunications a draft regulatory framework for private sector involvement needed to
be approved and implemented.

The CAS of March 1998 described the factors that stood in the way of structural reform
"weak public institutions compromise private sector activities..... powerful vested interests,
ponderous regulatory and judicial systems, loss-making state-owned enterprises, and the
failure to develop a shared vision for pro-private sector reforms undermine sound
policymaking and public management, frustrate private entrepreneurship, thwart competition,
and breed corruption..."

Rationale for Bank Assistance

The project rationale presented in the PAD was built on the observed inadequacy of public
financing to fund the massive investments needed in Bangladesh to construct, operate and
maintain power supply and other infrastructure needed to promote sustained economic
growth. Investment needs in infrastructure were estimated at $1.75 billion per annum against
which annual budgetary allocations were less than $1.0 billion. In the case of power
generation these investment needs were estimated at $4.4 billion for the period '96 to '05.
As actual expenditures were less this implied a minimum shortfall in public expenditure on
infrastructure of at least $750 million per annum. The project was designed on the premise
that private participation would attract commercial finance thus easing public financing
requirement and deliver efficient services. However Bangladesh presented then a very
challenging environment for private sector participation in infrastructure development.
Foreign private investment flows were very small and domestic capital markets too narrow
and underdeveloped to provide significant equity or debt financing (i.e. of particular
relevance to what PSIDP was designed to overcome was the fact that commercial lenders had
low appetite for long-term debt exposure). These constraints were compounded by a poor
policy environment characterized by weak legal and regulatory systems evidenced by lack of
transparency in procurement.

The focus of PSIDP was on facilitating transactions with private sector participation. The
project therefore was focused on providing sufficient commercial debt and on making the
transaction regime more efficient in order to attract private investment on the scale required
to implement large infrastructure sub-projects. TA in the project was intended to improve
processes for procuring competitive investment projects with private sector participation thus
demonstrating good practices in the design, procurement and completion of private
infrastructure sub-projects. Overarching policy issues having to do with pricing, sector
structure and legal and regulatory reform were not a focus of the project and was a conscious
design choice. These were to be taken up as part of technical assistance in other sector loans.
In making this choice a premise of the design was that improving procurement of
infrastructure (transparent selection and competitive bidding, etc) would lead to efficiency
gains and a further premise was that in order to sustain these efficiency gains wider sectoral
reform would need to be implemented.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

As stated in the Project Appraisal Document and in the Development Credit Agreement the
project sought to support Bangladesh develop modern and efficient infrastructure by
promoting private sector participation in the investment, operation, ownership and
maintenance of infrastructure facilities. The more detailed objectives were to: (i) proactively
develop and market sound infrastructure sub-projects for private investment; (ii) establish
speedy competitive and transparent procurement processes for realizing private sector
participation in such sub-projects; (iii) providing appropriate mechanisms for reasonable risk
sharing and mobilizing commercial investment in the form of equity and debt financing for
infrastructure sub-projects; and (iv) creating suitable legal and regulatory structures in the
various infrastructure sub-sectors for the sustained and efficient operation of private
infrastructure facilities.

The project benefits postulated in the PAD were: (i) addition of thermal power generation
capacity in the private sector; (ii) enhancement in available gas transmission infrastructure;
(iii) development of sub-projects to enhance port capacity, establish new toll highways and
augment water supply; (iv) developing policies, strengthening regulations and building
appropriate capacity in Government to select, develop and market soundly structured projects
for private participation; (v) establish government capacity for promoting environmentally
sustainable and socially acceptable implementation arrangements for privately sponsored
infrastructure projects.

The agreed performance indicators are described in the PAD as follows: (i) overall increase
in the country's infrastructure capacity at the beginning and at the end of the project; (ii)
increase in the share of private ownership and operation of infrastructure assets; (iii) amount
of non-guaranteed debt finance mobilized for infrastructure projects; ( iv) number of
infrastructure projects identified and developed for private sector participation; and (v)
establishment of processes and frameworks for promoting such
participation. Project performance indicators presented in the PAD are contained in Annex 1.

  1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
  reasons/justification

  The project was not formally restructured. However in March 2005 IDA provided funding of
  $200 million to the Post-Flood Recovery Assistance program by reallocating unallocated
  proceeds from five ongoing credits1 and PSIDP was amended to provide the largest share
  ($154 million). Project (The objective of the Post-Flood Recovery program objective was: to
  support the speedy recovery of the country and of the affected population, particularly the
  poor and vulnerable, while emphasizing disaster vulnerability reduction over the long-term.

  As the Post-Flood Recovery Program is entirely different in nature to the original project it is
  evaluated separately in the ICR. See Box 1 and Annex 10.


                              Box 1: Post-Flood Recovery Program (PFRAP)

Background: Between July and September 2004, Bangladesh experienced devastating floods that caused
significant damage to the economy, especially key infrastructure (housing, schools, roads, municipal
infrastructure etc.), the agriculture sector and livelihood. PFRAP was financed through reallocation of $200
million from five ongoing credits with 77% ($154 Million) of the total coming from PSIDP.

Project Design: PFRAP had three parts (i) short-term rehabilitation (ii) medium-term reconstruction and
recovery and (iii) longer-term, multi-hazard risk management needs of the country. A quick disbursing
budget support for US$ 45 million included financing critically needed eligible imports (e.g. food grains,
edible oils & fertilizers).

Implementation: At credit closing disbursement averaged 70% with 95% of physical works completed. A
component to provide small loans to 400 thousand affected households only a little more than a third of
them had received loans by April 2007 with the remainder to receive loans by December 2007.

M&E: PMUs set up within each concerned line ministry and department/executing agency was accountable
for its respective infrastructure rehabilitation sub-component. A post-review work combining Procurement,
Financial Management and Technical Audits commenced in March 2007 and being completed now.
Preliminary outcome suggest that out of total 2642 post review contracts in infrastructure rehabilitation, 36
(about 1%) contracts are to be declared mis-procurement. There are other shortcomings in procurement,
financial and technical audit. Upon finalization of the report in December 2007, IDA will take this up with
GOB appropriately.




  1 The other credits are: Post Literacy and Continuing Education Project (Cr. 3467), Female Secondary
  Education Project (Cr.3614), Municipal Services Project (Cr.3177), Female Secondary Education Assistance
  Project II (Cr.3614) and Fourth Fisheries Project (Cr. 3217).

                         Box 1: Post-Flood Recovery Program (PFRAP)

 Safeguard and Fiduciary : Procurement processes followed Bank guidelines with the exception of
 14 works contracts for US$ 36.4 Million in the Primary Roads component was cancelled due to
 miss-procurement. An integrated post review (combing procurement, financial management and
 technical aspects) of all (2,599) small value contracts PFRAP carried out, less than 0.25% (7
 contracts) contracts assessed with major deviation on combined review. A suspected case of
 collusion in bidding for a Secondary School funded by other credit was cancelled by IDA.

 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation: These remain relevant. Another devastating
 flood took place in July ­August 2007.

 Achievement of Project Development Objectives: The PFRAP can be rated satisfactory since it
 rehabilitated 95% of the infrastructure identified in need of rehabilitation albeit with delay.
 Components of quick disbursing loans to affected households and disaster vulnerability reduction
 fell short of their objectives. However, 50% of the fund became very effective in restoring the
 livelihood of the 2007-flood affected poor.
 Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome: Bangladesh faces major challenges in reducing its
 vulnerability to flooding.
 Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance: The Bank and GOB agencies coordinated well
 to design and implement the program.
 Lessons Learned: Disaster preparedness should continue to be a central part of the Bank's
 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). Climate proofing infrastructure will need to be systematically
 addressed. Floods rehabilitation being multi-sectoral, coordination has strong impact to achieve
 quality implementation in both GOB and IDA sides. Future IDA projects on disaster should
 appropriately design implementation arrangement to minimize risks in coordinating the various
 bodies and activities. Packaging of works contracts with due consulting support in assessment and
 supervision will improve procurement and construction quality. Independent consultants financed
 by IDA can minimize implementation risks.




1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

As stated in the PAD of the original project the beneficiaries of the project were identified to
be: (i) the people of Bangladesh, who would have increased access to more adequate and
efficient infrastructure services; (ii) the government of Bangladesh which would benefit
through addition of infrastructure development resources and introduction of private sector
efficiency and management culture in the infrastructure sectors; and (iii) private sector
investors, both local and foreign, who would receive financial, institutional and policy related
comfort for investment in new infrastructure projects in the country.

The PAD described the macroeconomic benefits which would have accrued from successful
implementation of the project and which would have included: (i) reduced need for public
investment in infrastructure development, thus enabling the government to deploy more
funds to meet poverty alleviation and social development objectives; (ii) rapid development
of a modem and efficient infrastructure system in Bangladesh through the financial, technical



                                                   5

and managerial resources of the private sector; (iii) increased flow of foreign investment into
new infrastructure projects; (iv) enhanced Government capacity to tackle the policy,
regulatory and project related issues in the different
infrastructure sectors; and (v) significant employment generation in the construction and
operation of new infrastructure projects.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project had two components - project financing and sub-project2 transaction
development.

Component 1. The financing component was designed to provide support for investment sub-
projects with private sector participation. PSIDP provided a long-term debt facility (SDR
159.6 million US$225 million) in form of a line of credit from GOB to IDCOL a non-bank
financial institution. The credit was to be used to provide long-term finance to special
purpose entities established for the construction and operation of commercial infrastructure
projects on the basis of a subproject pipeline available at appraisal. This component included
technical assistance (SDR 4.67 million US$ 7 million) for investment advisory services to
strengthen IDCOL's capacity in project financing. The subproject financing institution,
IDCOL was in the process of being established at the time PSIDP was being designed.

Component 2. The second component was aimed at strengthening the capacity of line
ministries and parastatals to undertake transaction development (involving the conduct of
competitive and transparent procurement processes, marketing of sub-projects and managing
the entire process of structuring, documentation, bidding, negotiation and award of
concessions) of infrastructure projects for private sector investment. An
Infrastructure Investment Facilitation Center (IIFC) was established two years after PSIDP
was effective for subproject transaction development.




2  The ICR for consistency purposes applies the same terminology as the project documents wherein "project"
refers to the IDA credit i.e. PSIDP and "sub-project" refers to the pipeline of sub-projects available at appraisal
of the PSIDP comprising sub-projects in the power, gas, roads, telecom, and other sectors.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

The project was extended three times, for two years from December 2002 to December 2004,
for three months from December 2004 to March 2004 and for three years from March 2004
to March 2007.

The initial extension to the project was provided partly in response to the two-year delay that
occurred in establishing IIFC and to provide time to allow IDCOL disburse the US$ 80
million to Meghnaghat-1 IPP.

The 2nd extension was justified at the time on the basis of the following:
    ·   positive signs for private involvement in small-scale infrastructure provision;
    ·   developments in the legal and regulatory environment (telecoms regulator was
    functioning by then and the law establishing the energy regulator had been passed;
    ·   high-level Government interest in the development of an appropriate legal and
    process environment for BOT type private involvement; and
    ·   progress on several infrastructure investments that could provide a viable pipeline of
    sub-projects for IDCOL. This pipeline of sub-projects at the time of this extension
    included the Khanpur inland container terminal, rural piped water projects, a bus
    terminal/car park and a number of rural on and off-grid power projects under the RAPPS


                                               7

    scheme. However, the largest prospective sub-project for PSIDP financing that was then
    being developed was the Sirajganj 450MW power station and it consequently weighed
    greatly in the decision to grant extension of the project (c.f. Box 2 below).

The 3rd extension of the project in March 2004 was to facilitate financing to potential
pipeline projects above considering that it would take at least 36 months to implement a large
infrastructure project, such as a 450 MW IPP.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

QAG's review of quality at entry rated the project highly satisfactory with respect to it
having adequately reflected the lessons of experience. The project design took note of
positive and negative aspects of similar initiatives launched in Pakistan, India, Jamaica and
Sri Lanka and the experience of various investment promotion agencies in East Asia. The
PAD described some key experiences incorporated in the design:

    (a) In Sri Lanka, sub-project development and promotion initiatives were the subject of
    another project, leading to lack of synergy between the development and financing
    aspects. PSIDP therefore supported both i.e. IIFC was established under PSIDP to be
    responsible for sub-project transaction development;

    (b) by placing responsibility for appraisal and financial structure of sub-projects with
    IDCOL and responsibility for transaction development and facilitation with IIFC the
    project was designed to mitigate lack of capacity in government agencies whose role was
    to be limited to granting of concession and permits. This followed from the experience of
    the CCPAP-BOT Center in Philippines;

    (c) although the project did not have explicit political risk mechanisms associated with it,
    provision of IDA financing that necessitated Bank approval for sub-projects was thought
    to give a measure of comfort to private developers and commercial banks participating in
    sub-projects thus mitigating country risk elements; and

    (d) with its focus on developing clean procurement processes the project was designed to
    overcome political meddling in sub-project procurement.

Reform to address weakness in the legal and regulatory environment in the various
infrastructure sub-sectors was not addressed in the project and was a conscious design choice.
Analysis of the policy environment was contained in the PAD and concluded it was
conducive to private sector participation in the power sector, less so in telecom and not
conducive in the other sub-sectors. The main risk identified arising from uncertainty on the
reform program in the power sector was that the offtaker BPDB would not be able to pay for
private power given its poor financial and operational performance. The analysis concluded
however that the risk was mitigated by the assumption that IPPs would be phased in a way


                                                  8

that gave adequate time to adjust tariffs and improve performance. In the project's design,
projects other than PSIDP were to be the vehicles of the reform program and these are
detailed in the PAD. For example in the power sector these were ADB's 9th Power Project
approved prior to PSIDP and a mooted IDA project for FY99 and in the telecom sector a
IDA project ­ the Telecom Regulatory Support project ­ was being prepared at the time.

The project design (reflected in the project agreement between IDA and IDCOL) assumed
that PSIDP would support major sub-projects where the private sector would have majority
ownership. This was reasonable at the time the design was finalized given the pipeline of
major sub-projects and the substantial degree of foreign private sector interest. Thus, sub-
projects with other forms of private sector participation such as joint ventures, concessions
and management contracts were not envisaged. In addition some kinds of infrastructure were
excluded e.g. captive industrial power generation capacity. In retrospect, the design of PSIDP
was unnecessarily constrained in what it could finance. Its success was thus dependent on
the major sub-projects with majority private sector ownership being successfully realized. If
other kinds of public-private sector arrangements and more types of infrastructure had been
eligible and if IDCOL had been able to participate in their financing, these could have
catalyzed the project.

2.2 Implementation

No single factor accounts for the fact that only one, albeit major, sub-project was
implemented with PSIDP. Ensuring that the transaction regime worked efficiently and
transparently was the key condition in order that PSIDP participate in financing sub-projects.
At the time the project was designed and before it came effective, at least two sub-projects
(Haripur and Meghnaghat) had been procured competitively and transparently. However
the transaction processes developed and followed in these sub-projects were not applied in
subsequent IPP solicitations nor in solicitations in other sectors. Explanation of failure to do
so is due to interplay of the following key factors:

Procurement Issues

By the terms of the Project Agreement between IDA and IDCOL, in order for IDCOL to
participate in financing sub-projects, the Bank's procurement guidelines applied. Essentially,
these required either that (a) the sponsor be selected on the basis of international competitive
bidding (ICB), in which case the goods and works required for construction could be
procured according to the procedures of the sponsor; or (b) when the sponsor was not
selected on the basis of ICB, then goods and works to be financed by IDCOL would have to
be procured on the basis of ICB or with prior approval of IDA by using limited competitive
bidding (LCB).

The processes followed for a number of sub-projects, most notably Haripur (also including
the LaFarge Cement captive power plant and the Comilla power project) were deemed by the
Bank not to have followed these requirements, this making them ineligible for PSIDP.

GOB and IDCOL made vigorous representations to the Bank to allow procurement rules
pertaining to financial intermediaries in the Bank's guidelines apply. These allow
procurement according to "established private sector or commercial practices " to apply.
However as IDCOL was at that point in time a fund manager and not a financial intermediary
as it did not on-lend credit proceeds to sub-projects and absorb the credit risk of such sub-
loans, the Bank determined that the procurement requirements obtaining to financial
intermediaries should not apply. It went on to state that the objective, nature and size of loans
made under the PSIDP is fundamentally different from the 'line of credit' operations to which
procurement in loans to financial intermediaries apply.

In the case of the Haripur project that was supported by an IDA Partial Risk Guarantee the
Bank's guidelines for procurement of loans guaranteed (i.e. not financed) by the World Bank
applied. These stipulate that goods and works be procured with due attention to economy and
efficiency in accordance with basic quality, price, and delivery requirements. GOB
counterparts found it difficult to accept that the Bank could insure a sub-projects' political
risk when it could not allow use of IDA financing.

IIFC could conceivably have been influential in ensuring that the procurement requirements
were followed but delay in establishing and resourcing IIFC meant that it could not play this
role in the critical early years of the project. IDCOL has pointed out that as it was not


                                                 13

involved directly in the procurement process and because the selection of sponsor was
usually made by a government agency it did not have enough leverage to ensure compliance
with the provisions of the Bank's procurement guidelines. The line ministries receiving IIFC
supports in developing and structuring private sector infrastructure transactions and
formulating related policies were not found committed to implement or award these to the
potential private sector sponsors.

IDCOL endeavored to approach procurement agencies at an early stage of the process about
the need to comply with IDA guidelines applicable to the selection of sponsors/
entrepreneurs. IDCOL held workshops for public and private sector stakeholders to raise the
level of awareness about the applicability of Bank guidelines in developing projects by
private sector sponsors on several occasions.

Though the procurement requirements in the Project Agreement between IDA and IDCOL
cannot be regarded a flaw in the project design because it was simply a case of the project
applying Bank rules, nevertheless the requirements and the considerable effort expended by
Bank and GOB counterpart staff in analyzing and reviewing the individual cases to
determine whether or not they complied with the requirements sapped the project's
momentum, gave rise to considerable frustration among Bank staff and GOB counterparts
and thus had a damaging impact on implementation.

   Box 2: Procurement issues in the Haripur, REB 3x10MW Power Projects and Sirajgangj
                                                    Projects.

Haripur 360 MW Power Project: the process of selecting a sponsor for Haripur started with a set of pre-
existing unsolicited proposals submitted by potential sponsors of different projects and then developed a
bidding format for a single defined project. It thus did not canvass expressions of interest from the universe of
potential sponsors through an open advertisement process. As a result the Bank's Operations Procurement
Review Committee (OPRC) held twice that the process did not meet this key requirement of international
competitive bidding (ICB). Following the 2nd OPRC review the matter was referred to the Bank's Appeals
Committee which again found that the lack of open advertisement at the start of the process a compelling
reason for not waiving the ICB requirement notwithstanding that the process had obtained a very competitive
tariff and that internationally reputed developers had participated in the process. If AES had been able to
conduct a downstream procurement for goods, works or services in the project in accordance with ICB, use of
PSDIP funds could have been used for these. However AES could not do so and as a result, IDCOL could not
participate in financing of the project. However, IDA has provided a Partial Risk Guarantee to support the
project.

(b) REB 3x10MW Power Projects. On February 23, `00, the Bank's OPRC expressed its inability to accept
IDCOL's and the project team's recommendations for no-objection for two principal reasons. It found that the
differential prequalification criteria adopted by the Rural Electricity Board (REB) were inconsistent with
IDA's Procurement Guidelines, and does not satisfy the test of "equal opportunity to bid" required under para.
2.1 of the Guidelines. It was also argued that the finally selected sponsor would have qualified even under the
higher standard prescribed for foreign firms under the bid. On this point OPRC opined that the process did not
ensure full competition since the project opportunity had not been advertised internationally.

Sirajganj 450MW Power Project. The procurement procedures followed by BPDB for the development of
the 450 MW Sirajganj power plant were formally reviewed by the Bank in January 2004 and deemed
acceptable. Though deficient, the process was deemed robust enough to lead to an acceptable result in
particular since the outcome in terms of tariff offered by the sponsor was recognized to be competitive (US
cents 2.7895 per kWh). However the government did not proceed with issuing the license to the sponsor
despite strenuous representation by the Bank pointing out the implications of re-tendering the project. In
communicating its finding that the bid submitted by Summit was non-compliant, the Power Division in
September 2004 cited the sponsor not having been the lead sponsor for the development of a 110 MW plant at
Khulna (a key technical requirement was prior experience in developing an IPP). This aspect had in fact been
reviewed by the Bank which in providing its no objection, had advised how the sponsor's perceived lack of
experience would be addressed (i.e. downstream EPC contracts in the project would be with world-class
companies). The Government's decision to re-tender the project after a bidding process that had been deemed
by Bank review to have been transparent was very disappointing and drained confidence that PSIDP could
achieve its main objective of financing a large pipeline of generation sub-projects. The project would in all
likelihood have been closed then were it not for the reallocation of the credit for the Post Flood Recovery
Assistance Program.

Governance and Sector Policy Reform

Poor governance manifested in lack of transparency in procurement of infrastructure projects
played reduced the deal flow. In her capacity as Chair of the Local Consultative Group, the
World Bank Country Director wrote to the Prime Minister in 2004 to point out that as a result
of a pattern of questionable tendering and re-tendering by GOB of power generation projects,
no new generation projects were brought on stream in the two year period through September
2004. While on visit to Dhaka in August 2005, the World Bank President was quoted in the
Bangaldeshi press `Big power projects unfortunately are one of the principal targets for
corruption. So, that is an area where reforms are necessary.'

The decision to pursue the objectives of PSIDP in a weak policy environment was to become
controversial during the course of implementation especially with regard to the power sector.
Bank teams responsible for management of the project after 2002 were skeptical that a
project designed to facilitate private sector investment in the sector could be successful
absent substantive measures to raise electricity prices and improve corporate governance and
management in BPDB and DESA.

Failure to embed transparency in transaction processes in solicitation of infrastructure
contributed to weariness with the project among Bank teams that dealt with it. As the
project progressed Bank teams became increasingly skeptical that the design of the project
was viable given its avowed focus on ensuring good transaction processing. The
mechanisms to ensure this in the design (the role of IIFC and the line agencies) were clearly
not working in the way that had been envisaged. This led project teams to conclude that the
focus of the project (i.e. providing sufficient commercial debt and making the transaction
regime more efficient in order to attract private investment for large infrastructure sub-
projects c.f. Rationale for Bank Assistance above) was misplaced and that an approach which
would tackle sector reform across a broad front would be necessary.

International financial crises coming soon after the project was made effective caused
reputable sponsors of private infrastructure to retreat from emerging markets

At the time PSIDP was being designed there was strong foreign private sector interest in
infrastructure sub-projects. PSIDP project preparation assessed 9 sub-projects (5 of them
power sector) as having moderate to high probability of becoming PSIDP transactions. The
financial crises of 1997 in Asia and 1998 in Russia, and subsequent economic instability had
a damaging effect on infrastructure project finance in emerging markets, and specifically in
Asia. When the project was being designed in '96 private investment in electricity sector in
developing countries had grown exponentially from less than $1 billion in '91 to $43 billion
in '97. However the Asian financial crisis hit in '97 (and the Russian in '98) and by the time
the project became effective in '97 and set about mobilizing private investment for the
prospective infrastructure projects assessed in the design phase of the project, the investors
were already pulling back though it was not apparent then if it would be a temporary setback
or more enduring. Private investment in the infrastructure sectors in fact peaked in '97. In '98
worldwide private investment in the power sector halved and declined further in subsequent
years and by 2002 had fallen to $6.7billion. So in the five years after PSIDP became



                                                16

effective, the prospects for attracting private investment in the sector had soured or in other
words after '97 there were many less serious and reputable sponsors chasing projects in
developing countries. In the event only one of these sub-projects, the 450MW Meghnaghat
gas combined cycle was financed with participation of IDCOL power project using PSIDP
credit proceeds. However several of the sub-projects including the 360MW Haripur gas
combined cycle project and the100 MW Khulna Barge Mounted Power project were
supported by World Bank Group instruments though not by PSIDP3.

Delay in making IIFC operational; Lack of capacity in IIFC and line ministries.

IIFC started operating in January 2000, two years after project effectiveness. Delay in
making IIFC operational may have been due in part to lack of consensus in the early phase of
the project on the role it should play. During project identification, it was agreed that in
addition to the role of line ministries in project promotion, a "professionally staffed
Infrastructure Development Unit" should be established. It was pointed out at this time that
line agencies "do not take favorably to another institution encroaching on their turf and this
leads to weak ownership of potential projects" and that the structure of what was to become
IIFC would be such to accommodate line agency interests also.

Delay in making IIFC operational imposed financing constraints on it (it had lost 62.5% of its
eligibility-weighted fund utilization) that impacted on the expertise it could mobilize. IIFC's
capacity was only slowly developed and was lacking in the early years of the project. IIFC
has received significant technical assistance from CIDA and DFID4. In IIFC's own
assessment, consultants provided by the two consortia could be mobilized quickly but that
their knowledge of transactions processes was lacking in many cases. IIFC has pointed out
that the "procurer model" on which its services were based, whereby it acted as conduit of
consultants to government agencies, limited its effectiveness as the consultant's remuneration
was not based on clear success criteria. Another drawback was that the rates allowed
precluded it engaging suitably qualified but high-priced commercial management consultants.
IIFC later began to perform small assignments on a success-fee basis but could not apply this
to larger projects because of lack of resources.

In its early years IIFC did not have the network of contacts to be effective in its coordination
with government. IIFC therefore could not play a substantive role to facilitate transaction
processing of the 10 sub-projects identified during project design. Even in the case of the
power sector, where the Power Cell had been set up inside the Power Division to guide
policy making, it did not intervene effectively to improve the transaction regime.




3An IDA partial risk guarantee (PRG) supports the 360 MW Haripur Power Project, which was the first major
private power plant developed in Bangladesh. IFC supported the 100MW Khulna project with an A Loan of
US$23.5 million, B Loan of US$37 million and equity of US$3.3 million.

4CIDA and DFID's technical assistance was delivered by two consortia of consultants who provided support on
legal and regulatory frameworks for private participation in specific sectors and support on specific transactions.




                                                       17

It may be inferred that failure to establish IIFC in a timely fashion or to empower and
resource technical units in the line ministries in a way that would have made them effective
agents in improving transaction processes was reflective of then weak government
commitment to ensuring competitive transparent procurement of sub-projects.

IDCOL was restricted in the use it could make of the PSIDP credit

IDCOL initially could provide subordinated debt only. Later, the Project Agreement was
adjusted so that it could provide senior debt. It could not provide equity. It could only lend to
green-field sub-projects. It could only provide foreign currency loans.

A Mid Term Review was not carried out

Such a review was proposed by the Bank to be carried out in June 2001 subject to the
Government commissioning a report on the project's implementation and TOR were
prepared for such a report. Failure to carry out the MTR seems to have been in part due to the
perception that the project would be closed early because of lack of deal flow obviating the
need for an in-depth assessment of implementation experience that would have provided
grounds and directions for restructuring the project.

However a Mid-Term Review of DFIF/CIDA support to IIFC was carried out in December
2002 with participation of World Bank staff. It pointed out that IIFC had no executive
authority or decision making responsibility with respect to transactions or policy changes and
concluded that lack of progress in developing transactions and taking policy decisions was
largely attributable to government agencies. It proposed steps to widen membership of IIFC's
Board to include secretaries of the line ministries. If a mid-term review of PSIDP had been
carried out perhaps these and other measures would have been considered and implemented
with positive impacts on the project.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

As described in the PAD, M&E was designed to monitor: (a) assessment of sub-project
quality, costs, compliance with operational and financial criteria; (b) regular performance
audits of IDCOL; (c) the effectiveness of TA to IIFC and line ministries would be monitored;
and (d) environment and social mitigation in sub-projects.

Monitoring of sub-project quality only applied to the single project (Meghnaghat) supported
by PSIDP. Also regular monitoring of entity audit reports of IDCOL and IIFC were carried
out by IDA with no qualified observation.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

There were no major deviations from safeguard and fiduciary policies in the case of the
original project.



                                                18

Environmental Safeguards with respect to Meghnaghat: In 2000, ESG International,
consultants for AESML, submitted a Draft ESAR which included an Environmental Impact
Assessment ("EIA") and a Social Impact Assessment ("SIA"). Subsequently on June 12,
2000, a Draft Resettlement Action Plan ("RAP") was delivered to IDCOL in support of an
application for the loan. These documents were assessed by Multinational Environment and
Social Assessment Services ("MESAS"), IDCOL's external advisor for environmental and
social matters.

Resettlement: Within the framework of the RAP, AESML committed to five actions to
assist former households affected by the BPDB purchase of land:
    · Provision of scholarships for vocational training of one member of each project
        affected household that experienced loss of income in excess of 20 percent of its
        annual income;
    · Priority hiring of project affected persons subject to availability and suitability during
        construction of the Project;
    · Construction of a school on land provided by project affected persons in Islampur;
    · Contribution to construction of an access road to the Village of Islampur on land to be
        provided by project affected households; and
    · Building of a hospital near the project site intended to service the local community.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The Power Sector Development Technical Assistance Project was approved in 2004. This
ongoing project is designed to create capacity in power and energy ministry and government
agencies to develop sector policies, industry structure and regulation and to prepare, structure
and implement a few power sector investment projects.

Currently a number of IDA investment operations with institutional capacity components are
being prepared that take into account lessons learned in PSIDP (c.f. Section 6 Lessons
Learned below). These are:

    · The Siddhirganj Peaking Power Project in FY08 will support an integrated gas-to-
        power project that will provide 300 MW peaking power capacity with financing for
        the plant itself, a gas pipeline and transmission line. It will also support institutional
        capacity strengthening in the Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh the
        owner of the plant, including through outsourcing of plant operations and
        maintenance for a period of about six years.

    · The South Zone Power Distribution Project (Chittagong Area) in FY09 will support a
        key reform measure in the sector i.e. the unbundling of BPDB's distribution network
        activities into five regional corporatized entities. The project will finance
        rehabilitation and expansion of the network of South Zone Power Distribution
        Company Limited and support its institutional strengthening as well as supporting a
        program of policy and regulatory development focused on South Zone.




                                                 19

    · An Energy Sector DPL in FY09 will advance governance and regulatory reforms and
        initiate financial restructuring of sector enterprises.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance: High

The project objective of developing modern and efficient infrastructure was and remains
highly relevant. For example in the case of the power sector the project was designed to
address the then current generation capacity shortfall. The project in fact was successful in
curtailing the shortfall. At the time the Meghnaghat power plant financed by the project
began operating in November 2002 power supply matched demand. Since then, in part
because of failure to apply the good procurement and contracting practices used for the
Meghnaghat project, the gap has widened and is currently a shortage of almost 2500 MW
during the hours of peak demand. During the last five years only one project (80 MW
capacity) has been undertaken. Faced with this crisis, measures to curtail demand such as
closing markets by 7 pm and load shedding has curtailed economic activity (for example,
electricity use for irrigation has dropped by 50% between FY04 and FY07) and imposed
hardship on the population.

The project design of seeking to catalyze significant participation of the private sector in
financing, constructing and operating infrastructure facilities remains consistent with GOB's
priorities and with the Bank's assistance strategy in the sector. The GOB has on several
occasions reiterated its policy of seeking private participation in power generation in the
form of IPPs. This is entirely consistent with the Bank's operational guidance for staff that
states that private financing is preferred for generation and that public support in the form of
IDA/IBRD guarantees and other forms of credit enhancement are critical.

The project in successfully demonstrated professional, competitive and transparent processes
for infrastructure development is highly relevant. Political will is needed to mainstream
these processes.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The project development objectives were not achieved although it did achieve positive
outcomes.

Overall Objective: Develop modern and efficient infrastructure by promoting private sector
participation in the investment, operation, ownership and maintenance of infrastructure
facilities. PSIDP did not succeed in its overarching objective of facilitating and financing the
development of infrastructure with private participation on such a large scale as to have a
transformative impact. PSIDP's vision of developing vital and sizeable projects in all the
sectors that would demonstrate the attributes of efficient private sector led infrastructure and


                                                20

thus lead the way in modernizing Bangladesh's infrastructure stock was not realized.
However PSIDP did provide financing for a major power plant - the 450 MW combined
cycle at Meghnaghat. This and the Haripur project (supported with an IDA guarantee) were
world-class projects from the point of view of their financial structure (Meghnaghat was
Project Finance magazine's joint Asia Power Deal of the Year 2001), timely construction,
competitive cost of power and, subsequently, their excellent operational record.

The Meghnaghat and Haripur projects established a benchmark that badly structured and
opaquely bid projects could not attain. Thus it may be argued that the Meghnaghat and
Haripur projects had a large influence in fending off poor quality sub-projects.

Objective 1: Proactively develop and market sound sub-projects for private investment;

Through its technical assistance, PSIDP supported the development of transparent
procurement approaches, regulatory frameworks, and risk sharing mechanisms for private
sector infrastructure promotion and operations.

The technical assistance that was made available through IIFC to support the line ministries
in project preparation of individual subprojects that were identified as suitable for private
sector participation, was not by itself sufficient to prepare and structure them so that they
would be eligible for IDCOL financing. Despite the outreach activities of IIFC to
disseminate good practices in sub-project solicitation and to work with line ministries in
attracting and negotiating private sector infrastructure projects in wasn't enough to overcome
inertia and lack of initiative in line ministries where the senior personnel charged with
handling development of these sub-projects worked in a environment without clear rules of
how to apply the policy and who were subject to interference in their decision making by
their political superiors. This sub-component did thus not achieve its objective of providing
concentrated know-how to Government officials through support of a private projects deal
flow, but financed some relevant training.

However a major outcome of the project is that two viable institutions were created and
strengthened that are well positioned to play key roles in infrastructure development in a
more favorable and enabling political environment in the future.

Objective 2: establish speedy competitive and transparent procurement processes for
realizing private sector participation in such sub-projects;
Competitive procurement and licensing processes were followed for the Meghnaghat power
sub-project financed by PSIDP and for the Haripur project which was mooted for PSIDP
financing. It is disappointing that these processes were largely discarded in subsequent sub-
project development with the result that few large scale projects with private sector
participation have since been implemented. A satisfactory outcome would have been that
the procedures and processes used in Meghnaghat and Haripur were embedded as rules in a
legal regime that would have been immune to political interference.




                                                 21

Objective 3: provide appropriate mechanisms for reasonable risk sharing and mobilizing
commercial investment in the form of equity and debt financing for infrastructure sub-
projects;

This Objective was achieved as demonstrated by the Meghnaghat sub-project.

Objective 4: create suitable legal and regulatory structures in the various infrastructures sub-
sectors for the sustained and efficient operation of private infrastructure facilities.

IIFC has been directly involved in preparing the following policies and regulations
    · the public switched telephone network (PSTN) regulations (licensing procedures)
        issued by the Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (BTRC) in
        2004.
    · Private Sector Infrastructure Guidelines in 2004
    · Remote Area Power Supply Systems Guidelines (RAPSS) for micro electricity supply
        enterprises approved in 2007
    · Draft Coal Policy in 2007

A general objective of these policies and regulations is to promote the role of the private
sector in infrastructure. However it would need a stronger legal and regulatory regime of
governance for the sectors in order that private sector infrastructure facilities are developed
on a very large scale.

3.3 Efficiency

The economic and financial analysis of the PSIDP is carried out for AES Meghnaghat Project
(MPL) which is the only investment made by IDCOL.

The economic analysis suggests that the MPL project has a positive economic NPV of $1724
million and an EIRR of 65 % at 10 percent discount rate. The EIRR is very sensitive to the
assumption of WTP as the price at which the power is valued drives the economic returns.
Even assuming a conservative lower bound estimate of 8 Taka/kWh, the EIRR is
significantly higher than the 14% EIRR at the project appraisal stage. This implies that the
project has been favorable to the beneficiaries of improved power and succeeded in
alleviating the grave power situation in Bangladesh.

The financial NPV and FIRR are estimated to be $11 million and 11 percent respectively
using a 10 % discount rate. The financial returns are relatively modest. However, the
investment of US$ 300 million for a 450 MW power plant with a tariff of US$ 0.03/kWh
with good plant availability and off-take can be considered a financially viable project
particularly in the context of Bangladesh with nascent experiences with independent power
producers. The sensitivity analysis reveals that FIRR increases to 21% if the sale price is
assumed to increase to $0.04/kWh.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The overall rating of MU is justified on it not realizing the scale of development that was
originally envisaged nor achieving a mainstreaming of good procurement and
implementation practices. However the use of $80 million of IDA proceeds to demonstrate a
world-class 450MW IPP is itself a notable achievement that has made a significant
contribution to Bangladesh's economic growth and development.

The project had significant shortcomings in that it did not realize its overall objective of
facilitating and financing the development of infrastructure with private participation on a
large scale. However it did provide financing provided ($80 million in long-tenor, dollar-
denominated debt) for a major power plant (450 MW combined cycle at Meghnaghat) and
supported, in coordination with other donors, the development of transparent procurement
approaches, regulatory frameworks, and risk sharing mechanisms for private sector
infrastructure promotion and operations. However the procurement and contracting practices
that were developed were not mainstreamed i.e. they were not applied routinely in IPP
solicitations nor in solicitations in other sectors.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Meghnaghat project that was commissioned in November 2002 eliminated the power
supply deficit, albeit for a short period. Today it provides approximately 17% of
Bangladesh's power supply. Without Meghnaghat, economic activity would be reduced in
Bangladesh with negative impact on employment and poverty reduction.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project supported (with other donors) the creation of two viable institutions, IIFC and
IDCOL, to facilitate infrastructure development.

Since its inception, IIFC has built up its capacity in project development and policy advisory
work. Consultancy services that it has provided to line ministries and executing agencies
include project identification and pre-feasibility studies, road shows to potential sponsors, bid
preparation and bid evaluation, negotiation of concession agreements (e.g. for land ports
telecom and remote area power supply), regulation and policy development (e.g. telecom
regulations, coal policy and private sector infrastructure guidelines). IIFC now only provides
fee-based services to line ministries.

IDCOL is also well established. From the reflows of its financing to Meghnaghat IDCOL
financed a telecom and a satellite earth station project. Since 2002 IDCOL is implementing
part of the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project (REREDP)
jointly funded IDA, GEF, GTZ and KfW. Under the project, IDCOL has a target to finance



                                                 23

through 15 (Fifteen) participating Organisation (PO), 198,000 Solar Home System (SHS) &
few wind, micro-hydro and biomass projects by 2009. In 2006, IDCOL undertook the
National Domestic Biogas & Manure Programme (NDBMP) with assistance from SNV-
Netherlands Development Organisation. Under this project IDCOL through its 12 PO's
intends to finance about 60,000 domestic size biogas plants in the remote rural areas of the
country by the year 2010. In addition IDCOL from the reflows of its earlier loans &
government contribution has financed several projects including a power plant, network
expansion of a telecom project and two land ports.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

Government commitment that insists on transparent solicitation and transaction processing
has not been demonstrated. If such commitment is forthcoming the technical competencies
of the institutions established (IIFC and IDCOL) as well as the line ministries can ensure
sound structuring of investment projects.

The demonstration effect of Meghnaghat financed by PSIDP is difficult to asses but the fact
that none of the opaquely processed IPPs over the last 5 years or so have reached financial
closure is in part due to the competitive outcomes resulting from Meghnaghat. The
transparent and competitive process that was followed for it (and also for Haripur), the low
price that resulted and its operational record of high reliability since commissioning provide
a high standard against which proposed projects can be benchmarked.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The project was included in the first Quality at Entry report conducted by the Quality
Assurance Group and was rated overall as highly satisfactory. Aspects of the project that
scored highly satisfactory were its Concept, Objectives and Approach; Technical and
Economic Aspects; and Readiness for Implementation; Risk Assessment and Sustainability.




                                                   24

All other aspects were rated satisfactory i.e. Environmental Aspects; Poverty and Social
Aspects; Institutional Capacity Analysis; and Bank Inputs and Processes.

The project design assumed that PSIDP would support major sub-projects where the private
sector would have majority ownership. This was reasonable at the time the design was
finalized given the pipeline of major sub-projects and the substantial degree of foreign
private sector interest. Thus, sub-projects with other forms of private sector participation
such as joint ventures, concessions and management contracts were not envisaged for PSIDP
support. In addition some kinds of infrastructure were excluded e.g. captive power generation
(i.e. industry owned generation capacity). In retrospect, the design of PSIDP was
unnecessarily constrained in what it could finance. If other kinds of public-private sector
arrangements and more types of infrastructure had been eligible and if IDCOL had been able
to participate in their financing, these could have catalyzed the project.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

As may be inferred from the number and extent of reviews of procurement in several sub-
projects proposed for PSIDP support (see Box 2 above), the project received considerable
supervision effort in the context of these reviews.

As the project progressed, and it became clear very few sub-projects were being developed in
a way that would make them eligible for PSIDP support, Bank sector staff and management
responsible for supervising the project grew increasingly skeptical that the objectives of the
project would be realized absent implementation of far reaching sector reform measures and
improvement of sector governance. In addition, similar projects to PSIDP involving
financial intermediation for private financing of infrastructure (e.g. in Sri Lanka) had not
performed well. Consequently sector management and staff formed the view after 2001 that
the project was inherently flawed and that the Bank's supervision effort would not succeed in
turning the project around.

During 2004, Bank supervision of the project questioned the role of IDCOL in the design.
This view held that IDCOL had not been able to act as a commercially oriented entity but
acted rather as an agent of government. In addition, the supervision team took a negative
view of the way in which IDCOL was the sole beneficiary of reflows from the sub-loan to
Meghnaghat (the interest spread and principal repayments under the sub-loan revert to a
special fund which is segregated from the standard Government budgetary processes and can
be allocated only by the IDCOL Board). Disagreement on these issues had a negative effect
on the relationship with IDCOL at this time. .

The Bank was proactive and forceful in urging successive governments to address
governance issues in the power sector. For example in her capacity as Chair of the Local
Consultative Group, the World Bank Country Director wrote to the Prime Minister in 2004 to
point out that as a result of a pattern of questionable tendering and re-tendering by GOB of
power generation projects, no new generation projects were brought on stream in the two
year period through September 2004. While on visit to Dhaka in August 2005, the World


                                                 25

Bank President was quoted in the Bangladesh press `Big power projects unfortunately are
one of the principal targets for corruption. So, that is an area where reforms are necessary.'

Supervision of the project in the Bank passed from the energy group SASEI in the South
Asia region to the private sector group in December 2003 and back again to the SASEI in
February 2005. This discontinuity had a negative impact.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

It was inevitable given its long life that the composition of teams supervising the project
would change. It was perhaps not so inevitable that the Bank approach to the project would
undergo such discontinuity in approach leading to loss of ownership on the Bank side.

During long periods insufficient Bank expertise was mobilized to address the lack of deal
flow to which a somewhat hands-off approach was followed. This reflected a period when
the Bank also gave greater attention to sector policy reform issues to the detriment of getting
investment projects prepared and implemented.

Both the Bank and Borrower can also be faulted for not carrying out a mid-term review of
the project. Failure to carry out the MTR seems to have been in part due to the perception
that the project faced lack of deal flow obviating the need for an in-depth assessment of
implementation experience that would have provided grounds and directions for restructuring
the project.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

A lack of transparency in procurement of infrastructure projects played a role in reducing the
deal flow. It may be inferred that failure to establish IIFC in a timely fashion or to empower
and resource technical units in the line ministries in a way that would have made them
effective agents in improving transaction processes was reflective of then weak government
commitment to ensuring competitive transparent procurement of sub-projects. As a result no
new large power generation projects with private sector participation have been constructed
since 2002 to date.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Competitive transaction processes were used to secure two IPPs (Haripur and Meghnaghat)
that are "world class" due to the very competitive price of power produced from the plants,
their cost, and their excellent operating and environmental record. However these processes
were not mainstreamed in subsequent infrastructure development. The rating of Borrower
Performance is justified by the achievement of having demonstrated competitive
procurement processes in the case of the Meghnaghat that was financed with PSIDP and by
subsequent failure to mainstream the processes.

6. Lessons Learned

The project's main instrument ­ an infrastructure fund ­ was not sufficient to catalyze private
sector investment absent government commitment to ensure solicitation of sub-projects
through transparent and competitive process. Although the project had technical assistance
components to assist line ministries in sub-project preparation this was ineffective in a weak
governance environment.

The original project design envisaged that IDCOL would finance major greenfield
investment projects with majority private sector ownership. Other forms of private sector
projects such as joint ventures were not envisaged. If other kinds of public-private sector
arrangements and more types of infrastructure had been eligible, IDCOL could have built a
more diversified portfolio of investments that could have catalyzed the project.

Bank assessments of other projects like PSIDP involving financial intermediaries similar to
IDCOL that are agencies of government but at the same time independent of government
have concluded that such structures are inherently flawed due to governance and control



                                               27

issues stemming from acting as a fiduciary without a clear mandate and clear delegation of
responsibility. However this does not appear to have been the case in the PSIDP project as
IDCOL did in fact demonstrate its competency when it financed the Meghnaghat sub-project
under PSIDP and in subsequent project financings without PSDIP support. In addition as
the experience of financial intermediaries such as the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial
Services company and IREDA in India would suggest, it is not impossible in principle to
establish such public sector agencies with a high degree of professional competence that are
able to act entrepreneurially with operational independence at arms length from government.

Reform of the infrastructure sectors has advanced in Bangladesh under successive
governments. For example, in the power sector, there has been restructuring and unbundling
of previously integrated utilities and policy for private investment in generation has been put
in place. Reform in other areas, notably price reform and governance in public sector entities
has lagged. Being responsive to country conditions requires donors such as the World Bank
to build their engagement on the reform initiatives that the government has taken, to assist
with those reform steps the government can pursue in the near term and to acknowledge that
some reforms will have to await favorable political circumstances. There is considerable
scope in Bangladesh for the World Bank and other donors to design projects that build on
reform initiatives undertaken. The power sector projects that the Bank has under
implementation and preparation demonstrate this (section 2.5 above) by supporting
institution building in newly created entities and by supporting investment projects that are
vehicles for knowledge transfer across a wide range of core sector competencies such as
system planning, operation of advanced technology, procurement, human resource
development, financial and environmental management. In tandem with such projects,
dialogue on sector policy issues such as long term financing strategy is being pursued.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Issues raised by Borrower/implementing agencies include:
    · Delay in making IIFC operational
    · Ineligibility of some kinds of infrastructure for PSIDP financing such as captive
        generation owned by industry
    · Procurement rules of IDA that prevented use of PSIDP funds for some sub-project
        proposed

It is undoubted that delay in making IIFC operational meant that in the early years of the
project it was not available to line ministries as a source of technical expertise and facilitation.

The project design assumed that PSIDP would support major sub-projects where the private
sector would have majority ownership. Sub-projects with other forms of private sector
participation such as joint ventures, concessions and management contracts were not
envisaged. In addition some kinds of infrastructure were excluded e.g. captive industrial
power generation capacity. In retrospect, the design of PSIDP was unnecessarily constrained
in what it could finance. Its success was thus dependent on the major sub-projects with



                                                28

majority private sector ownership being successfully realized. If other kinds of public-private
sector arrangements and more types of infrastructure had been eligible and if IDCOL had
been able to participate in their financing, these could have catalyzed the project.

IDA procurement rules were a contentious issue in the project when some sub-projects
proposed for PSIDP financing were deemed not to have complied with key requirements of
international competitive bidding. In the case of the Haripur IPP for example, since the
selection process for the concessionaire had started with a list of pre-existing unsolicited
proposals, review by the Bank found that all potential sponsors had not been canvassed and
thus Haripur could not be financed using PSIDP although IDA did support it with a Partial
Risk Guarantee (which requires procurement in accordance with established private sector or
commercial practices which are acceptable to the Bank). It is may be noted that in the case of
the Sirajganj project (see Box 2 above) the Bank did provide its no objection to selection of
the sponsor even though the Bank found the process deficient. It was then disappointing that
subsequently the Government chose to re-tender the sub-project.

The project had two components - project financing and sub-project5 transaction
development.

Project Financing Component: The financing component was designed to provide support for
sub-projects where the sub-project sponsors had reached the limit of mobilizing market based
financing. PSIDP provided a long-term debt facility (SDR 159.6 million US$225 million) in
form of a line of credit from GOB to IDCOL a non-bank financial institution. The credit
proceeds were to be used to provide long-term finance to special purpose entities established
for the construction and operation of commercial infrastructure projects on the basis of a
subproject pipeline available at appraisal. This component included technical assistance
(SDR 4.67 million US$ 7 million) for investment advisory services to strengthen IDCOL's
capacity in project financing.

IDCOL successfully financed the 450MW Meghnaghat power plant with $80 million
financing ($20 million senior debt and $60 million subordinated debt). Reflows form this
investment were utilized to finance the DNS SatComm VSAT Hub Station and expansion of
Pacific Telecom Limited.

IDCOL arranged workshops, presentations and seminars on opportunities for infrastructure
investment with potential investors and financial institutions.

Transaction Development Component: The second component was aimed at strengthening
the capacity of line ministries and parastatals to undertake transaction development of
infrastructure projects for private sector investment. The coordinating institution for sub-
project transaction development was the Infrastructure Investment Facilitation Center (IIFC).

IIFC provided consultancy services on investment strategies & transaction development to
the following agencies:
               · Bangladesh Telecom Regulatory Commission
               · Ministry of Shipping
               · Bangladesh Land Ports Authority
               · Power Grid Company of Bangladesh
               · BEPZA
               · Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority
               · Chittagong Port authority
               · Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation
               · Power Division



5 The ICR for consistency purposes applies the same terminology as the project documents wherein "project"
refers to the IDA credit i.e. PSIDP and "sub-project" refers to projects for private sector financing i.e. the
pipeline of sub-projects available at appraisal of the PSIDP and later and comprising sub-projects in the power,
gas, roads, telecom, and other sectors.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The economic and financial analysis of the PSIDP is carried out for AES Meghnaghat Project
which is the only investment made by IDCOL.

This analysis at the ICR stage recomputes the financial and economic analysis at the
appraisal using observed data for 2002 through 2006. The analysis projects the net benefits
forward till 2022 which is assumed to be the useful life of the plant. The costs and benefits
are estimated using constant 2001 US$.

Financial Analysis

The project costs amounted to $300 million with $220 million in debt and sponsor's equity
contribution amounting to $80 million. The spending of the resources was spread over three
years between 2000-2002 and the plant began its operations in 2002. The plant sells power to
Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), which is distributed to residential and non-
residential consumers in Bangladesh. Therefore, the financial realization to MPL would be
the difference between revenues from selling the generated power to BPDB and the capital,
fuel, and O & M cost of constructing and operating the plant.

The financial NPV and FIRR are estimated to be $11 million and 11 percent respectively,
discounted at 10 percent over the life of the project. The financial returns are relatively
modest. However, the investment of US$ 300 million for a 450 MW power plant with a tariff
of USD 0.03/kWh with good plant availability and off-take can be considered a financially
viable project particularly in the context of Bangladesh with nascent experiences with
independent power producers. The sensitivity analysis reveals that FIRR increases to 21% if
the sale price is assumed to increase to $0.04/kWh.

Economic Analysis

In order to estimate the economic valuation of MPL, two elements are needed. First, an
indicative value of the economic value of the sale price to BPDB or a consumer willingness
to pay for the newly generated power is required. This would depend on the cost of the
counterfactual. What would have happened if the power plant was not built and what would
the consumers pay in the absence of power? The consumers (both residential and non-



                                               34

residential) would continue to depend on a second best (substitute) fuel that can meet their
energy needs. As the plant supplies electricity to primarily urban consumers, the substitutes
are assumed to be available in the market at a specific price. For lighting, the second best
alternative is kerosene. For cooking, either gas or woody biomass is utilized and the use of
electricity is negligible in Bangladesh. Running motive power is most important use of
electricity for industry, water lifting and irrigation. Non-residential consumers employ diesel
or gas engines instead of electrical motors if electricity is not available. Therefore, lack of
electricity for residential consumers will cause lack of light only and for nonresidential lack
of electricity will cause lack of light and running a motor.

The willingness to pay (WTP) for the power generated from MPL can be expected to be
similar to the current prices paid by consumers using gas, diesel, and kerosene to satisfy their
energy demands. The current price for kerosene and diesel is 40 Taka/liter and CNG prices
are $1.14/mcf. The market price for gas is much lower than the economic value of gas at
$4.5/mcf assumed to estimate the economic fuel cost of the plant.

If approximately similar proportions of residential and non-residential consumers in the
population are assumed, a simple average of the individual prices for each use weighted by
the respective population results in a price of 8 Taka/kWh. This estimation is similar
compared to the WTP computation by ADB for the Power Sector Master Plan where a lower
bound of 8 Taka/kWh and a higher bound figure of 14 Taka/kWh emerged.

Note: Electricity is not a commonly used option for cooking

Second, the economic value of gas used in operating the plant is computed. The gas price in
Bangladesh is regulated and kept below the economic cost which would take into account the
scarcity value of gas. A value of 4.5 $/mcf is assumed to arrive at the gas economic cost.

The economic analysis suggests that the MPL project has a positive economic NPV of $1724
million and an EIRR of 65 % at 10 percent discount rate. The EIRR is very sensitive to the
assumption of WTP as the price at which the power is valued drives the economic returns.
Even assuming a conservative lower bound estimate of 8 Taka/kWh, the EIRR is
significantly higher than the 14% EIRR at the project appraisal stage. This implies that the
project has been favorable to the beneficiaries of improved power and succeeded in
alleviating the grave power situation in Bangladesh.

Meghnaghat Project Background

The project company that developed the project was AES Meghnaghat Limited (AESML)
wholly-owned by AES Corporation, Inc. ("AES" or "Sponsor") of the United States. The
power plant consisted of a 450 MW combined cycle gas turbine ("CCGT") power plant built
on a 70-hectare site located at Meghnaghat, north of the Meghna River approximately 27
kilometer south of Dhaka. The project was built by two Hyundai group subsidiaries, namely,
Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company Ltd. ("HECCL"), providing installation,
erection and construction services and Hyundai Heavy Industries Company Ltd. ("HHICL"),
responsible for supply of major equipment. Major equipment components include two gas
turbine generators manufactured by Ansaldo Energia s.p.a. of Italy under a licensing
arrangement issued by Siemens GmbH of Germany; two heat recovery system generators
manufactured by Vogt-Nem, Inc. of the USA ("Vogt"); and one steam turbine generator
manufactured by Fuji Corporation of Japan ("Fuji").

At the time, the 22-year agreement secured the world's lowest tariff for BPDB, with the
Development Board taking the electricity generated up to 85% plant load factor.

In 2003, CDC Globeleq paid around $437 million, including equity and assumed debt, for the
450MW Meghnaghat and 360MW Haripur plants in Bangladesh.

Overall Assessment

The PSIDP has brought benefits to the people of Bangladesh through development of
infrastructure in private sector by providing support on capacity building, debt financing and
mobilization of capital; restoration of infrastructures and livelihood damaged by the floods.
The PSID part by IIFC did exceptionally well. It has been working under PSIDP TA support
to strengthen GOB capacity to secure private investment and expertise in infrastructure
projects. Under this, IIFC has been structuring several infrastructure projects for private
participation and providing support to the line ministries to bid out these projects for
ownership and operation by private sector on long term basis. IIFC has already provided
significant support in power, roads and communication, water supply, capacity building of
various ministries and line agencies. In addition to developing and structuring several
infrastructure projects in several sectors, it has been working on preparing a few policies
such as Private Sector Infrastructure Guidelines (PSIG), Coal Policy, Captive Power Policy,
RAPSS Guidelines and other sectoral restructuring work.

The Meghnaghat-1 IPP a large base-load private sector power plant was financed and built
under PSIDP with US$ 80 million IDA debt-financing through IDCOL. This has been
supplying reliable and cheap power to the national grid since 2002. Later on, IDCOL tried
hard to finance in the pipeline projects in power, transport, port, container terminal, telecom
and other sectors but due to different factors including restrictions on use of funds and
ineligibility of some kinds of infrastructure, the rest of about US$ 145 million IDA fund
could not be utilized.


Implementation of the Project

The overall support provided by World Bank in familiarizing PPP concept and promoting
project on PPP models was praiseworthy, except for the two years delay in inception for
establishing IIFC. In addition, the support from DfID and CIDA to IIFC was very good and
appreciable, by providing consultancy support in the initial phase of the project. The rapid
drawdown arrangement worked well, as Ministries and agencies could obtain consultancy
support very rapidly. However, there was tremendous pressure from the DfID and CIDA
supported consulting firms to draw more consultants' effort (billing) in the early phase. This
support could be more effective after creating some sort of enabling environment for private
sector investment; like, development of policy, law, guidelines, etc.

The emphasis in the project design should have been given to the Project Development
Function so as to generate more infrastructure projects (and hence businesses, generating
employment and giving a service to the nation) and then concentrate on the financing arm to
provide financing those sub-projects, only where there is a shortfall and commercials banks
do not come forward.

The IIFC was started two years late, in late 1999. Under the Bank's sliding scale system,
IIFC had already lost 62.5% of its eligibility-weighted fund utilization time by the time it
became operational. This was a serious setback for the company. Although this was planned
to be corrected at the mid-term review, as the review did not occur, the correction could not
be carried out.

Infrastructure Development Company Limited

Since its inception, IDCOL considered a number of projects for financing. However, IDCOL
only financed Meghnaghat 450 MW combined cycle power project. The following table
shows the projects considered by IDCOL and their status:

 Project                                                   Disposition

 AES Haripur Power Project     IDCOL could not finance the project due to the project's inability
                               to meet Bank's international competitive bidding (ICB) guidelines.
                               Sponsor walked away when it could not persuade BPDB to modify
 Cynergy Baghabari             the technical configuration of the plant from open cycle to
                               combined cycle.
                               This "inside-the-fence" power generation project was ruled

 LaFarge Cement                ineligible for IDCOL financing under IDA guidelines.



 United Summit Comilla 10X3    Although IDA initially gave no-objection to the issuance of

 MW Power Project              Preliminary Letter of Support (PLS), later the project was deemed
                               not to be in conformity with ICB guidelines.


 AES Meghnaghat Power          IDCOL has successfully financed this Project. The project reached
 Project                       commercial operation in November 2002.

                               Following receipt of IDA's concurrence, IDCOL issued a PLS for
                               this project. The progress of the project was restrained by a lower
 SSAB Container Port           court judgment that declared the award of the project illegal. The
                               government had appealed against the lower court decision and
                               reportedly lost the appeal.

 WorldTel Fixed Line           IDA has expressed reservations regarding proposed operator of the
 Extension                     project.

                               This project did not qualify as physical infrastructure.
 Imperial Hospital


 Sirajgonj Power Project       IDA initially declined to provide no-objection because the project
                               would require disbursement after the PSIDP closing date.




                                               42

Some of the above-mentioned projects however materialized with financing from other
sources outside the scope of PSIDP. If IDCOL could have participated in all or most of the
above projects, all the funds under PSIDP would have been exhausted within the original
project closing date. But project eligibility criteria under IDA credit had been very restrictive.
Therefore, IDCOL had very limited options for financing the projects.


Operational Experience

Infrastructure Investment Facilitation Center

From an organisation structure point of view, IIFC was created as a procurer of consultants
(the "Procurer Model") by the UK based consultants Profina Associates. Immediately after
starting activities, IIFC strongly advocated, and obtained concurrence from the World Bank
that IIFC should act as the provider of consulting services (the "Provider Model") to line
ministries and agencies. IIFC provided consulting services and the recommendations to the
line ministries to implement. This approach required a larger in-house expertise. However,
IIFC has been able to go on a path of commercialization by providing consultancy services to
many line ministries, their agencies, donors and private sector.

Infrastructure Development Company Limited

Despite considerable demand in the market, IDCOL could not exploit the opportunities due
to constraints imposed under the Development Credit Agreement (DCA). However, to
facilitate private sector participation and to raise institutional investors' confidence into
infrastructure projects, IDCOL arranged several workshops, presentations, and seminars.
These were aimed at introducing investors, development partners (representatives of all the
donor agencies), local banks and financial institutions with IDCOL's services, selection of
private sponsors for infrastructure projects through international competitive bidding, and
clarifying difference between project finance and other forms of traditional loans.

IDCOL also made two presentations, one for the ICT sector and another at the Federation of
Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) to explain in details the revised
steps taken by IDA: including relaxed and pragmatic interpretations of ICB guidelines,
introduction of local currency loans, and other measures contemplated for utilization of
PSIDP funds. New projects that entered in IDCOL's pipeline afterward were the results of
such efforts, which largely promoted private sector participation in infrastructure investments.

The first success of IDCOL was the 450 MW power plant at Meghnaghat where it invested
US$ 80 million. The re-flows from this investment were utilized to finance the DNS
SatComm VSAT Hub Station Project and expansion of Pacific Bangladesh Telecom Limited.
Through its successful processing of the Meghnaghat-I (450 MW) private power project,
IDCOL gained appreciation not only of the World Bank, but also of the ADB and
international banks.




                                                 43

Further, IDCOL was able to attract organizations like ADB, GTZ and Kfw as its donor
agencies for its commendable excellence in increasing access to adequate efficient
infrastructure services and in promoting private sector participation in Bangladesh financial
sector. The Solar Home System program under the Rural Electrification and Renewable
Energy Development Project (REREDP), started in 2002, is a remarkable success of IDCOL
through which it has been able to finance 110,000 systems up to March 2007 in rural areas of
Bangladesh.

Infrastructure Development Company Limited

IDCOL had access to SDR 159.6 million for financing eligible infrastructure projects.
However, due to restrictive nature of IDA credit IDCOL only financed SDR 61.892 million in
a 450 MW power plant. The remaining SDR 97.7 million was reallocated for Post Flood
Recovery Assistance Program (PFRAP), and the DCA was revised accordingly. Despite the
limitations, IDCOL could report the following successes:

              IDCOL successfully conducted due diligence and loan negotiations of AESML
              450 MW Power Project, the only project it was allowed to participate in. IDCOL
              has invested US$ 80 million in the project.

              IDCOL is successfully implementing a major part of the renewable energy
              component of the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development
              Project (REREDP).

              IDCOL has experienced a successful investment advisory services technology
              transfer. Since June 2002, IDCOL is doing all its financial, engineering and
              legal due diligence work of its own without any foreign technical assistance.

              IDCOL has become a self-financing organization independent of financial
              support under PSIDP from IDA (except for IA services) or GOB. It is meeting
              its operational expenses and has purchased office space from its own resources.

Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

After the end of PSIDP, IIFC is expected to become a commercial organization. However,
many of its mandated activities do not have strong earning potential (e.g. poverty alleviation
infrastructure such as RAPSS, innovative ideas etc.). In IIFC's activity focus, these are likely
to suffer in the long-term.

 1. A large portion of TA provided to IIFC was from DfID and CIDA under a drawdown
      concept with two consultant consortiums led by KPMG and Canada Bangladesh
      Infrastructure Consultants (CBIC). The arrangement had the advantage of very high
      speed of mobilization (well liked by ministries and executing agencies).                               The
      disadvantages were that consultants were generally more experienced in technical areas,
      environmental areas and gender issues. Knowledge of public-private-partnership (PPP)
      transactions was lacking6 in many cases. As a result, project progress slowed down,
      while consultants focused on issues considered not fundamental for the project.
      Moreover, one single factor deterred IIFC in effectively controlling the consultants ­
      there was no provision for IIFC to sign or approve the consultant's invoices. DfID
      carried out a mid-term review and most of their recommendations possess a lot of merit
      for a future grant-funded project.

 2. The grant-funded consultants were engaged by DfID and CIDA before IIFC became
      operational. As a result, IIFC had limited ability to influence the arrangements between
      the consultants and IIFC for receiving the technical support.

 3. IIFC could never achieve full staffing strength due to the two-year delay in setting it up,
      lack of financing and inappropriate organizational structure created by Profina
      Associates that advocated a procurer model for IIFC operation.

 4. IIFC has conceived and executed several times, the concept of success-fee based
      consulting for project development from the initial project recognition to financial close.
      This is a practice not seen anywhere in the world, for all the phases of project
      development taken together. The model possesses strong advantages of quick project
      progression, but due to IIFC's small balance sheet cannot be applied to larger projects.
      More study and understanding is needed, with World Bank support, to thoroughly
      understand it and also encourage private consultants to enter into the area of success
      fees consulting.

 5. Section 5.9 c of the Bangladesh Private Sector Infrastructure Guidelines states that, "To
      the extent possible, the Executing Agency shall match the technical, financial, commercial, legal and
      negotiation skills of the Investors. Each Ministry will prepare a plan for capacity building on Private
      Infrastructure Projects. In addition, the speed and flexibility of employing good consultants shall match
      that of the Investors". In order to achieve this, a centralized fund is needed to be set up
      within the Government that may provide TA funds to executing agencies upon request.

Lack of infrastructure projects in the market was one of the major obstacles in utilization of
IDA fund. GOB could increase the creation of opportunities for private participation in
infrastructure projects. In future, GOB should provide special attention in this regard.




6Frequently, it was stated that the rates allowed under the contract could only support such technically oriented
consultants and not high-priced commercial/management consultants.

1. The Project Development Function (e.g. IIFC) and the Project Financing Function (e.g.
   IDCOL) are two distinct functions necessary for developing and progressing a private
   infrastructure project through its seven stages of development7. In PSIDP, the Bank
   concentrated largely on the Project Financing Function. But facilitation in project
   preparation activities should have also been equally important. Generally speaking,
   commercial lenders can step in to provide financing, but private sector sponsors cannot
   step in to develop an infrastructure project. The executing agencies need to have the
   vision, financial and technical resources of the sponsors for developing an infrastructure
   business and the government officials are not expected to possess business acumen. The
   suggestion is therefore for the Bank to concentrate solely on developing the Project
   Development Function in Bangladesh as this is by itself a very large area. It is to be noted
   that the role of PICOM is primarily in the Project Development Function area.

2. IIFC was created two years after IDCOL. IIFC should have been created at least two to
   three years before. The PSIDP design was such that 10 large infrastructure projects were
   identified in the PAD for IDCOL financing but IIFC was not there to facilitate in the
   project preparation process.

3. No mid-term review was conducted by the Bank, although it was very necessary in view
   of IIFC's start-up delayed by two years, its severe financing constraints and PSIDP being
   a complicated project (not off-the-shelf for the Bank).

4. The Bank financing modalities for a private infrastructure project and a public
   infrastructure project are different. These differences relate to (a) the timing of the
   financial close in the project cycle (b) procurement rules (c) tender documents and the
   philosophies behind it (d) approvals or concurrences necessary and (e) environmental
   approvals.



7The stages refer to that described under the Bangladesh Private Sector Infrastructure Guidelines.




                                                      49

5. The staff of the Bank involved with the project possessed a high level of technical
    competency and understanding (in some cases, more than that by consultants). By
    contrast, the Banks processes and procedures are inflexible, slow and geared towards its
    traditional public sector financed projects.

6. Given that executing agencies have a long history of working on publicly funded projects,
    where the contract documents are well established and the executing agencies are told not
    to change or negotiate any clauses, the opposite is true for PPP, being a risk sharing
    process. The Bangladesh Private Sector Infrastructure Guidelines (PSIG) issued by GOB
    on PPP projects should be recognized and followed.

Major shortcoming of PSIDP, as already mentioned, was the restrictive nature of fund
utilization. Development of infrastructure facility through private sector participation will be
successful once the World Bank adopts flexible instruments for financing such projects.
Utilization of SDR 159.6 million fund by IDCOL was subjected to the following restrictions:

        IDCOL was initially created to provide subordinate debt only. Later the scope was
        widened to include senior debt as well. IDCOL could not make equity investments
        although there was considerable demand in the market.

        Its target market was limited to privately-owned green-fields infrastructure-either
        utility interactive or for public use- characterized as gas and related power generation,
        bulk water supply, telecommunications, municipal facilities and information and
        communication technology.

        IDCOL could provide only foreign currency loans, local currency loans were not
        allowed.

        Its targeted project must meet international competitive bidding ("ICB") criteria
        approved by IDA, which was the most constraining factor.



Proposed Arrangements for Future Operation

Infrastructure Investment Facilitation Center

The signing of forty-five consulting assignments with ministries and their agencies in its
initial seven years of operation indicates the good progress made by IIFC in providing
services to client ministries/ agencies and other organizations. IIFC services are in high
demand. Many of these projects will make fundamental changes in the country by providing
infrastructure services through private financing.

IIFC is actively pursuing long-term sustainability and self-reliance. The approach is to
become commercially viable by moving from its budget-based funding arranged through the
Private Sector Infrastructure Development Project (PSIDP) during its set-up phase, to a long-
term sustainable basis through consultancy fee based and success fee based earnings.

Over the last seven years of operation, IIFC has been able to create a high demand for its


                                                50

services among the different ministries, executing agencies and in private sector. Since its
inception, one of the main targets of IIFC was to operate on a self-sustaining basis by
becoming commercial through earning fees for service. IIFC has introduced an innovative
model of engagement like success fees based consulting. It is being well accepted by the
executing agencies since they can engage IIFC within one month or less. This unique model
of engaging IIFC has certain advantages including ensuring good project recognition, quick
mobilization of consultant, ensuring faster progress of projects and speeding up deliverables
with the focus of deal making. This model has proven to be successful with different clients
and is liked by clients for its advantages and strong in-house consulting skills. IIFC has also
participated in a few solicited consultancy works with internationally reputed consultancy
firms.


IIFC has provided services to many projects in various areas including power,
telecommunications, land ports, policy development and so on. It has developed its capability
in project development, project processing, policy development and creation of transactions.


The Government's recent initiative, the Private Sector Infrastructure Guidelines, is expected
to have far reaching impact on the development and implementation of infrastructure projects
in Bangladesh through private sector financing. IIFC has actively supported the preparation
of the Guidelines, approved by the Government in October 2004. The Guidelines will
increase private sector infrastructure projects substantially. With the view of operationalising
the Guidelines quickly, IIFC has been appointed as the Technical Advisor to the Private
Infrastructure Committee (PICOM). IIFC's work for PICOM is expected to result in long-
term changes in the country

IIFC signed agreement with the Bangladesh Bank for two years for providing support for the
Investment Promotion and Financing Facility (IPFF) project as Technical Advisor. IPFF will
provide support to PICOM, with IIFC acting as Technical Advisor to both PICOM through
the Board of Investment (BOI) and the Bangladesh Bank.


IIFC will continue to provide consultancy services to its other clients in areas like power,
telecommunications, land ports, water supply, roads etc. IIFC is taking initiatives for the
capacity building of both public and private sectors in public private partnership (PPP)
concepts. It is developing a capacity building plan for the nation and creating countrywide
awareness on PPP and the guidelines.


Infrastructure Development Company Limited

While created in 1997, IDCOL's sole function was to administer the Private Sector
Infrastructure Development Fund (PSIDF) and on-lend funds to eligible privately sponsored
infrastructure projects. Projects were designed to be funded off-balance sheet and IDCOL
was eligible for some up-front and monitoring fees only. It was envisaged that IDCOL's role
as a lender would continue only as long as the international capital markets were unable to
meet Bangladesh's requirements for long term finance for infrastructure projects and then be
merged with a private or public financial institution as its project finance division.


                                               51

IDCOL's Board in its 83rd meeting dated 17 April 2005 decided to convert IDCOL from a
mere fund manager into a full fledged financial intermediary. Subsequently, GOB
contributed BDT 350 million to IDCOL as equity and would provide further BDT 150 million
shortly. Two land ports, two power plants and one cellular telecom project were financed
under IDCOL's balance sheet. Although IDCOL still remains committed to finance physical
infrastructure projects only, in addition to financing large infrastructure, IDCOL now
considers small and medium infrastructures for financing.


Apart from large and medium infrastructure projects, IDCOL is the pioneer financial
institution promoting renewable energy in remote rural areas of Bangladesh. IDCOL, with
the support of its partner organizations visibly changed lives in nearly 110,000 households
and businesses in remote areas of Bangladesh through its successful solar energy program.
With support from SNV, Netherlands Development Organization and KfW, Germany,
IDCOL has undertaken `National Domestic Biogas and Manure program', under which
60,000 domestic size biogas plants will be installed in Bangladesh by the year 2010.


IDCOL's stakeholders include the government, private sector, NGOs, multilateral institutions,
academics and the people of Bangladesh at large. Already supported by the World Bank,
Kfw, GTZ, SNV, DGIS, and with likely financing from ADB, IDCOL has emerged as a
partner of choice for bilateral and multilateral institutions.

Annex 10: Post Flood Recovery Assistance Program.

The project was not formally restructured. However in March 2005 IDA provided funding of
$200 million to the Post-Flood Recovery Assistance program by reallocating unallocated
proceeds form five ongoing credits. PSIDP was amended to provide the largest share ($154
million). As the Post-Flood Recovery Program had entirely different objectives to those of
the original project it is evaluated separately in the ICR.

Objectives of the Post Flood Recovery Assistance Program. This was to support the
speedy recovery of the country and of the affected population, particularly the poor and
vulnerable, while emphasizing disaster vulnerability reduction over the long-term

1. Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes

1.1 Project Preparation and Design

During the monsoon and later, between July and September 2004, Bangladesh experienced
devastating floods that caused significant damage to the economy, especially key
infrastructure (such as housing and buildings; primary, secondary and municipal roads, etc.)
and the agriculture sector. With approximately 38% of the country, including the capital
Dhaka, already inundated, a localized monsoon depression in late September brought
additional flooding to the central and southwest parts of the country.

Subsequently, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) put together a joint
cross-sectoral Flood Response Team in response to the Government of Bangladesh's (GOB)
request. This team carried out an assessment of the flood damages and the post-flood
rehabilitation requirements and formulated a recovery program in close collaboration with
GOB and in consultations with non-government organizations (NGOs), other donors,
academics and the private sector; the assessment also included field visits to a sample of
affected districts. A joint WB-ADB report, which included social, economic, environmental
and sector specific assessments, was finalized in January 2005 with GOB's comments.

The total impact of the 2004 floods was assessed to be about US$ 2.3 billion (or 4% of the
GDP), with 36 million people (or 26.5% of the country's then population) in 47 (out of 64)
districts affected. The GOB and several NGOs did a commendable job in responding
immediately to the emergency flood situation by providing cash grants, roofing materials,
and by starting food-for-work and cash-for-work programs. In addition, the Bangladesh Red
Crescent Society helped reconstruct housing and shelter in several areas and also provided
agricultural inputs. The international response amounting US$ 76 million was mainly used
for immediate relief and rehabilitation needs, and several bilateral donors channeled their
resources through the NGOs for the post-flood relief and rehabilitation programs.

Initially the Bank's 2004 Post-Flood Recovery Assistance Program (PFRAP) had a three part,
unbundled strategy to help Bangladesh respond to these devastating floods. At the time it was
conceived, the recovery program aimed to take into consideration (1) short-term



                                                 58

rehabilitation (2) medium-term reconstruction and recovery and (3) longer-term, multi-
hazard risk management needs of the country. The PFRAP was financed through the
reallocation of US$ 200 million from various categories under five ongoing Credits: (1)
Post-Literacy and Continuing Education Project (PLCE, Cr. 3467-BD) (2) Female Secondary
School Assistance Project II (FSSAP-II, Cr. 3614-BD) (3) Private Sector Infrastructure
Development Project (PSIDP, Cr. 2995-BD) (4) Municipal Services Project (MSP, Cr. 3177-
BD) and (5) Fourth Fisheries Project (FFP, Cr. 3276-BD). Given that a large portion of the
PSIDP faced imminent cancellation, 77% (US$ 154 Million) of the total reallocation came
from PSIDP. Although the Development Credit Agreements (DCAs) for these five projects
were amended to accommodate the revised disbursement categories, the Project
Development Objectives (PDOs) of the PSIDP were not formally revised.

Initially, the PFRAP had a livelihood restoration component for US$ 10 million which was
fully IDA-financed and an infrastructure rehabilitation component for US$178.09 million.
The infrastructure rehabilitation component initially included (1) Primary Road Network for
US$40 million (Bank financing of US$ 32 million) (2) Secondary Road Network for
US$ 31.25 million (Bank financing of US$ 25 million) (3) Municipal Infrastructure for
US$ 30.33 million (Bank financing of US$ 26 million) (4) Primary Schools for US$ 49.38
million (Bank financing of US$ 40 million) (5) Secondary Schools for US$ 24.78 million
(Bank financing of US$ 20 million) and (6) Fisheries for US$ 2.35 million (Bank financing
of US$ 2 million).

A quick disbursing budget support for US$ 45 million was made to GOB to ensure
immediate rehabilitation of the affected population, infrastructure rehabilitation, and for
economic recovery by financing critically needed eligible imports (which included food
grains, edible oils, fertilizer, industrial plant machinery and raw materials).

While the initial targets for some of the above-mentioned components demonstrated a sense
of reality, it can be said fairly safely, in hindsight, that most of the initial targets were not
fully based on robust assessment and hence tended to be over-optimistic. Due to the monsoon
rains, the construction period in almost all areas of Bangladesh is generally limited to only
five-six months a year and that, given the short time span of two working (dry seasons) under
PFRAP, completion of the post-flood infrastructure construction was constrained. In
addition, national political turmoil, especially in the later part of the last year of
implementation, took a certain toll on the rehabilitation of some components, the secondary
road network in particular. In the light of these problems most of the components were
restructured as implementation continued.

The PFRAP's overall objective and implementation strategy was to support the speedy
rehabilitation and recovery of the economy and the affected population, particularly the poor
and vulnerable, and at the same time emphasize disaster vulnerability reduction in the longer
run. However, no attempt was made to front-load policy conditionality on the project in
recognition of the fact that such conditionality would impede the emergency recovery
objectives of the program during its rapid preparation and implementation. The program
objective, although simple was strategic since it was based on intense interaction and
collaboration with GOB, other donors, and stakeholders involved.



                                                  59

1.2 Implementation

Project implementation has been successful with the rehabilitation activities covering
infrastructure and livelihoods in almost half of Bangladesh, in 47 districts and 262 upazilas.
At Credit closing on March 31, 2007, disbursement averaged 70% with 95% of physical
works being completed. Since the success of the emergency assistance depended on the
speed of obtaining sustainable results on the ground, effective implementation of post-
disaster assistance activities was critical. Emergency recovery operations should take into
consideration local implementation capacity and the fact that the capacity might be hindered
in the aftermath of a disaster. Anticipating the fact that implementing agencies need to be
empowered in order to take timely decisions and to be able to access funds without
cumbersome bureaucratic requirements while maintaining acceptable fiduciary controls,
actual implementation under PFRAP was assigned to existing project management units
(PMUs) or project coordination units (PCUs) under the ministries (except for the secondary
school rehabilitation which was implemented by the Education Engineering Department of
the Ministry of Education).

Due to the emergency nature of the reconstruction program and the need to minimize the
time required to engage new consultants, consulting services were procured, using the sole
source selection method, from consultants already employed for existing works under the
different projects. Also, the complex multi-sectoral operations needed a lot of central
oversight and protracted decision making processes would have to be avoided. In this
context, the coordinating role of the Economic Relations Division (ERD) was crucial as it
helped speed up the program implementation; in particular, the four biweekly
implementation review meetings held in February and March 2007 prevented several works
contracts from any cancellation as was initially apprehended.

The evaluation of 14 work packages for the Primary Road network component had been
under IDA procurement review and consequently an INT investigation was completed in this
regard. Subsequently, in February 2006, IDA processed the cancellation of US$ 36.4 million
related to this component due to misprocurement. However, this entailed the cancellation of
US$ 4.4 million from the other components' ongoing implementation activities, in addition
to US$ 32 million cancelled from the Primary Road allocation; as a result works in the other
sectors/projects were affected as well. [Meanwhile, the Roads and Highways Department
(RHD) has made a refund to IDA, an amount for approximately US$ 3,000 is still to be
refunded.] Cancellation of these funds has put a dent on GOB's commitment to the flood
program and on overall governance in donor-aided projects. Since the primary road network
component was cancelled, there was hardly any contribution to this important sector under
the program. But, as stated above, GOB's procurement procedures need to be more
transparent with due diligence at all stages in order to avoid such cancellations.

It was envisaged at inception that 1,700 kilometers (km) of upazilla Roads, including
rehabilitation and reconstruction of bridges and culverts and 13 growth center markets would
be undertaken as part of the Secondary Roads component. During implementation these
targets were revised to 1,100 km of Upazilla Roads, 13 growth center markets and 1,051



                                               60

meters of bridges and culverts. Eventually, under PSIDP funding, 888.41 km of the roads, 7
growth centre markets and 832 meters of bridges/culverts were rehabilitated.

Under the Municipal Infrastructure component, 1,350 km of urban roads, 1,125 meters of
bridges and culverts, and 42 km of drainage in 119 municipalities were planned to be
rehabilitated with IDA financing, including US$ 11 million under PSIDP and US$ 15 million
from the MSP. The re-fixed targets during implementation were 620 km of roads, 85 meters
of bridges and 7 km of drainage, all of which were completed on time.

However, weak implementation of the bridges/culverts rehabilitation works, compared to the
road rehabilitation, has raised the concern that overall road connectivity, for the secondary
road network as well as in the municipal infrastructure component, may not be fully adequate.
4 contracts and 12 partial contracts were cancelled under the secondary road network and
under the municipal infrastructure 10 contracts were dropped during implementation.

Under the Primary School component, rehabilitation activities initially included repairs to
17,000 schools and reconstruction of 918 fully damaged schools which would be used as
flood shelters in the future. Provision for supplying furniture was also there. The Bank
financed US$ 14 million from PLCE and US$ 26 million from PSIDP. For the Secondary
School Component, construction of 181 two storied schools/flood shelters, vertical
extension of 179 schools and supply of furniture to 360 schools were planned to be financed
through FSSAP II (US$ 15 million) and PSIDP (US$ 5 million). Due to duplications of site
selection, remoteness of locations, river erosion (land problems), no tender being dropped,
etc, the targets for the Primary Schools was revised to cover reconstruction of 746 schools
and 69 for the Secondary Schools. In addition, the implementation of the secondary school
construction and vertical extension was also contingent upon ensuring sufficient allocation
and release of GOB's Annual Development Program (ADP) fund. For the Primary Schools,
the Bank delayed its recovery of the initial deposit of the Special Accounts up to March 2007
in order to help the agencies tackle the demand for uninterrupted cash flow. In addition to the
supervision by the executing agencies for implementation of the works in damaged Primary
and Secondary Schools, the existing teachers and local school management committees also
had an opportunity to supervise and obtain quality construction.

The Livelihood Restoration component, administered through the Palli Karma Sahayak
Foundation (PKSF) and its Partner Organizations (POs), consisted of a micro-credit program
designed to provide 400,000 loans to eligible families for rehabilitation needs. Recovered
funds would also be available for lending in successive years. 119 POs have been selected to
disburse the amount of US$ 10 million to 314, 334 borrowers by December 2007 for
purposes like renovation of damaged houses, rehabilitation of post-flood microcredit
activities, raising tube-well bases, ensuring availability of seeds, providing alternative
livelihood for hilsha fry catchers, and the rehabilitation of existing income-generating
activities.

However, there was a delay of more than a year for the Livelihood Restoration Program
(LRP) which the PKSF had encountered while negotiating with the Ministry of Finance to
channel the LRP funds on a grant basis. Although the LRP has been disbursed 100% to 119



                                               61

POs at the end of the credit, only 36.4% has reached the poor as of April 2007 and the
subsequent delivery is expected to be completed by December 2007. This expectation is
based on PKSF's strong institutional capacity; PKSF is also expected to create a permanent
Disaster Management Fund (DMF) upon completion of the LRP.

The Fisheries component included rehabilitation of 31 flood affected fish farms under the
Department of Fisheries and was fully completed using US$ 2.0 million reallocated from
FFP. These were completed on time with no major implementation issues.

1.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The PFRAP identified and supported those sectors where the Bank was already financing
regular investments in order to ensure rapid and effective implementation. Each concerned
line ministry and department/executing agency was accountable for its respective
infrastructure rehabilitation sub-component, and the actual implementation was assigned to
existing project management units (PMUs) or project coordination units (PCUs). As such, a
large part of the program was implemented by the Local Government Engineering
Department (LGED) under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural development and
Cooperatives, with which the Bank has had a long and successful working relationship. The
LGED, with its existing quality control laboratories and a robust MIS system, could readily
provide updated information for ongoing contracts.

However, despite LGED being recognized as a competent implementing agency, several
contracts under the Secondary Roads and Primary Schools components had to be cancelled.
While there were some extenuating circumstances, such as lack of land, river erosion, remote
areas with limited accessibility, etc., LGED could have taken more stringent measures
through proactive monitoring and evaluation from the very beginning to ensure timely
completion of the cancelled contracts. Six months prior to project deadline (March 31, 2007),
ERD took an unprecedented initiative to regularly coordinate and monitor the
implementation of the infrastructure rehabilitation and livelihood components that
accelerated the implementation and provided IDA with more frequent updates on
implementation progress and likely cancellations. This measure helped IDA and the
executing agencies to build greater partnership through this complex operation that continued
in the ICR preparation process and ended in ERD providing consoloidated Borrower's
comments on IDA's draft ICR.

1.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Due to the emergency nature of the flood-damage rehabilitation program, an environmental
assessment was not carried out. However, a rapid environmental assessment was undertaken
as part of the damage and needs assessment exercise. Since the program only supported
rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure and school facilities but no new
construction, potential environmental impacts were envisaged to be low. The rehabilitation
and reconstruction works did not have any adverse social impacts either and no land
acquisition and resettlement was involved. The rehabilitation of infrastructure was conducted




                                              62

on the basis of the environmental and resettlement frameworks that had already been agreed
and were being applied under each project.

The program had very large number (2,599) of contracts subject to post review. Recognizing
the fiduciary risks on emergency nature of floods operation requiring fast restore damages
and economic recovery, IDA contracted a qualified Chartered Accountant Firm to carry out
an integrated post review of contracts (combing procurement, financial management and
technical review) to determine compliance of operation with defined rules/guidelines of Bank
and the Government and assess implementation capacity. The consultants' assignment
comprised of performance audit with respect to procurement, financial management and
technical/physical inspection. The report was finalized with review of the executing agencies
and IDA. Only less than 0.25% contracts are suspected for major deviation.

Procurement

Overall experience related to the procurement process of PFRAP is mixed: although most of
the contracts under implementation picked up pace in the last nine months, there was a
substantial number of contracts which could not be completed on time and hence had to be
cancelled.

The procurement process of the PFRAP under the credits MSP, FSSAP II and PLCE were in
line with the agreed implementation schedule and followed Bank guidelines. The respective
executing agencies regularly updated their procurement plans and shared them with the Bank.

Mis-procurement: Cancellation of Credit proceeds for the 14 works contracts under the
Primary Roads component amounting to US$ 36.4 Million was done in February 2006.
Meanwhile, a suspected case of collusion in bidding for a Secondary Schools contract (NW-
01) is cancelled.

Financial Management

Financial Management progress of some of the components, namely the Primary Schools and
Secondary Schools, has been constrained due to the delay in the release of GOB funds and
GOB authorization to use IDA funds. Timely issuance of authorization to enable agencies to
use IDA allocation and quick release of the funds approved under ADP within the
disbursement closing date would have helped physical implementation progress further. The
size of the special account for the Secondary Schools had been identified to be an issue
hindering smooth flow of the funds in a timely manner and, as such, corrective measures
were taken.

Financial Audit

An audit report including audit findings from the five different public entities was submitted
to IDA which has been reviewed with suggestions for revisions. However, the Quick
Disbursing Support executed by the Bangladesh Bank was not audited by private auditors.
The Bank will need to review a consolidated audit report on the PFRAP for the cumulative



                                              63

period from the inception of the program till the end of FY 06. [The issue was highlighted in
the March 2007 Implementation Review Mission Aide-Memoire as well.] Although the ERD
has requested the Foreign Aided Project Audit Directorate (FAPAD) to conduct the pending
audit, line ministries' involvement in ensuring the required cooperation from some
implementing agencies and more proactive and timely actions from FAPAD is needed.

Disbursement

The revised total amount funded from PSIDP, upon cancellation for the primary road
network, is US$ 117.6 million and with a further US$ 46 million allocated from other credits,
the total funds allocated for PFRAP was US$ 163.6 million. Of this amount 70% or $114.5
million has been disbursed as of March 31, 2007. A further US$ 10.05 million will be
cancelled as part of the contracts cancelled under the secondary roads and primary schools.

Post Completion Operation/Next Phase

A post-review work combining Procurement, Financial Management and Technical Audits
was started from March 2007 for a period of four months but took longer period to reconcile
the consultants' initial findings with the concerned executing agencies. Being a first such
integrated post audit work in the country, it is aimed to highlight the program sustainability
including assessing government's and executing agencies practices of fiduciary/
accountability framework and cover the use of hazard resistant standards and adequate
operation and maintenance. Besides a handful post review contracts (16 out to total 2,599)
identified to have apparent collusion, there are other shortcomings identified in contract
procurement and execution by the consultants that have modest detrimental impact in terms
of procurement, FM and technical requirements in infrastructure rehabilitation works. Finally,
there is a need to review flood program implementation arrangement and contract packaging
for effectiveness in all future flood program design and implementation.

Meanwhile, GOB will review the progress of the on going contracts under the three
remaining Credits (MSP, FSSAP II and PLCE) which have not yet closed. If situation so
demands, it was agreed that the biweekly meetings with the executing agencies and IDA may
restart. Also, the respective implementing agencies will submit bi-weekly progress reports to
IDA.

While no specific transition arrangements are envisaged for this emergency rehabilitation
project, it will be useful to explore more programmatic approaches to financing disaster
recovery, at the sectoral level, including the possibility of innovative IDA credits for this
purpose. As is the case in Bangladesh, recovery funding for more regular natural hazards
should be treated as a recurrent expenditure and while the exact location and type of hazard
will vary from year to year, an average annual cost may be estimated and financed through a
revolving fund, a Disaster Management Fund (DMF). The DMF could be funded from
regular budgetary appropriations as well as external financing. Also, building elevated roads
or two-storied school buildings (which could also be used as flood shelters) in flood-prone
areas may also be included in future infrastructure project design.




                                                64

2. Assessment of Outcomes

2.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The development objectives, design and implementation remain relevant and are consistent
with the country's ongoing development priorities. It is important that financing activities
that are consistent with long-term disaster risk management, which in turn is critical to
sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction, become central to the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) and sectoral assistance strategies. The current CAS (2006-2009)
emphasizes the fact that the Bank, along with its CAS partners, will support efforts to
mainstream disaster management in relevant government institutions and will continue to
support the improvements Bangladesh has made in disaster management.

In the case of PFRAP 2004, the premise of emergency disaster relief, in which a rapid
response is desirable, is debatable since the Bank did not put the program in place and
disburse until several months after the floods started receding in late September 2004. This
was because initially the source of funding was not agreed upon although, eventually, the
funds for rehabilitation had to be reallocated from several ongoing credits. In comparison,
GOB, NGOs, and other international agencies, responded quickly, with the Bank doing so
only with the Quick Disbursing component of PFRAP. The experience and lessons from this
program following the 2004 floods in Bangladesh will be instrumental for the design and
development of future emergency rehabilitation projects in the country.

2.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The PFRAP can be rated satisfactory since it achieved its emergency recovery objectives. Its
design objective fed directly into the primary outcome objective of assisting in the recovery
of the affected population through supporting flood damaged infrastructure rehabilitation,
livelihood revival, and reduction of vulnerability, which was also in line with the country's
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).

The Quick Disbursing Support Component helped ensure successful rehabilitation of the
affected population, infrastructure and for economic recovery as it financed critically needed
eligible imports.

On the other hand, for the Livelihood Restoration component, PKSF encountered a delay of
more than a year while negotiating with the Ministry of Finance on channeling the LRP
funds on a grant basis. Speedier decision-making of the Government on channeling the funds
to PKSF would have timely benefited the flood-affected poor people upfront. Also, the
maximum ceiling of loan size (Taka 3000) for each borrower was insufficient compared to
the needs, given the increase in prices of essentials. Additional consultations with all
stakeholders could have made this scheme a more pragmatic one which could have benefited
the poor significantly.




                                               65

The Primary Road Network component was dropped from the program altogether following
the cancellation of US$ 36.4 million. Given this experience, it is obvious that the GOB
agencies and their consultants have to ensure due diligence to the actual requirements of
rehabilitation in the context of the unit rates and the resource envelope. Because of these
irregularities in this component and the Credit cancellation, the repair and rehabilitation work
on the ground was not carried out and the consequent suffering is (still) being borne by the
general public.

The Secondary Road Network Component achieved more than 80% of the road rehabilitation,
79% for the bridge rehabilitation and accomplished 76.9% for the growth center markets.
The growth centre market management committee as well as LGED should have provided
more attention to timely completion of this component. For short term infrastructure
emergency rehabilitation needs, small contracts, without multiple slices, might have allowed
the works to complete on time and facilitated participation of more contractors.

Reconstruction of the Primary and Secondary Schools faced an inordinate delay initially of
almost one year, as it awaited GOB/ECNEC approval of the Project Proforma (PP). However,
the executing agencies expedited the procurement process by finalizing preparation of the bid
documents during this time and awarded the contracts once the PP was approved. Timely
availability of counterpart funding also delayed the implementation of the
rehabilitation/reconstruction works. Implementation provided an opportunity to the teachers
and local school management committees to supervise the quality of repair and
reconstruction of the damaged schools. However in future, it may be considered whether
such repair works may be avoided since it is difficult to quantify and supervise such small
works spread throughout the country.

Under the Municipal Infrastructure component financed by PSIDP, with works in 52
municipalities in Dhaka division, the decentralized units of the executing agency LGED,
were used effectively to monitor and supervise the works instead of creating new
implementation units in each municipality. In addition to the revised target of 629 km of
roads, 7 km of drainage and 85 m of bridges rehabilitated, a further 900 m of slope protection
work and construction of more than 3000 m of retaining wall were also constructed.

2.3 Efficiency

No NPV or ERR was calculated for this emergency rehabilitation project. No financial rates
of return were calculated either.

2.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The overall outcome of the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory, based on the new
Guidelines (August 2006) on Implementation and Completion Results Report (ICR).




                                                 66

2.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development:

Rehabilitated infrastructure provides physical connectivity to restore the lost economic
activities. The schools provide better facility for education and are very effectively used by
the affected people in the 2007 floods and Sidr. LGED's rural road maintenance program
provides livelihood supports to the destitute women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening: The program strengthened the institutional
capacity in assessment of damage, design of infrastructures to be restored, construction
management and quality control. The post audit review did not come up with gross
deficiency in project implementation.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

Roads rehabilitated became source of shelters during the 2007-floods and Sidr.

3. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The overall risk that the project's development outcomes will not be realized is moderately
substantial, since its sustainability is likely -- mostly in terms of follow-on projects which
could provide similar short-term emergency rehabilitation support if required (similar to
PFRAP 2004) or, looking ahead and learning from this experience, more systematic ways to
address post-disaster risks. Emergency projects have to be related to longer-term efforts for
disaster management and mitigation.

4. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

4.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Shortening the initial delays in making the program effective quickly, through reallocations
from five different credits, may have helped upfront the affected people since the floods
started receding in September 2004 but the Bank loan was effective only from March 2005.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Overall the quality of supervision is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. Implementation issues
and solutions were correctly identified and timely discussed with the Borrower. The Bank's
missions had technical experts in all major project sectors who helped solve technical



                                                   67

bottlenecks and ensured better coordination among various GOB agencies. The procurement
and FM teams provided timely and quality advice. Given complex nature of the operation
spreading over 6 executing agencies, this put burden of coordination both within the Bank
and with the executing agencies. In retrospect, the Bank may have taken earlier action to
formally notify the Borrower about the cancellation of the Primary Road Network
Component since it was not until February 2006 that the Borrower was formally informed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The Bank Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory due to points (a) and (b) above.

4.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance

Overall Government Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. Government showed
commitment for implementation throughout the project period but avoiding delays while
negotiating with the Ministry of Finance to channel the LRP funds on a grant basis (for the
Livelihood Restoration Component) and ECNEC approval of the Project Proforma (PP) for
the Primary and Secondary Schools Component would have expedited satisfactory project
outcomes. In addition, mis-procurement under the Primary Road Network has put a dent on
GOB's commitment to the overall program.

The coordinating effort from ERD's side, mostly in the second year of the project execution,
by managing five implementing agencies, ultimately led to successful implementation of this
type of time-bound emergency rehabilitation project. The fortnightly coordination meetings,
chaired by ERD, were found to be very effective.

5. Lessons Learned

PFRAP 2004 addressed mostly investment needs, largely in infrastructure, by allocating
funds from five different credits. While this arrangement supported the recovery of the
country and of the affected population at the time, it is felt that such an arrangement may be
avoided in future. Instead GOB needs to have its own Disaster Management Fund (DMF),
which could be funded from regular budgetary appropriations and external financing, to
address the vulnerability of the poor during recurrent disasters. The use of the DMF would
vary year to year depending on needs and the Fund could also be used to finance recurrent
expenditures on mitigation measures.

In addition, tailoring objectives to emergency needs have to be reflected clearly in GOB's
strategic vision and project goals have to be aligned to desirable outcomes on the ground. In
this respect, flexible but strict fiduciary and procurement frameworks should be put in place
so that project implementation is not delayed. Experienced and adequately trained staff,
wherever possible, should be relied upon to ensure smooth implementation. Most
importantly, sufficient Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding has to be ensured
afterwards so that the rehabilitated and/or reconstructed infrastructure is maintained at a



                                                 68

certain standard. Future Bank assistance should focus more on improving the institutional
framework within which Disaster Management is managed and financed.

For the Livelihood Restoration Program timely decision making of GOB in channeling funds
to PKSF could have benefited the actual flood affected people when assistance was sorely
needed. Further consultation with various stakeholders could have assessed the maximum
ceiling of the loan size at a more pragmatic one; in many cases, the size of the loans
(maximum Taka 3000) was insufficient vis-à-vis the actual financial need for disaster
preparedness or other disaster rehabilitation activities of the affected people. In addition,
helping the poor during a disaster by involving them in different Income Generating
Activities (IGAs) is found to be necessary as part of such a rehabilitation program.

For the Primary Roads Component, Roads and Highways Department's (RHD) public
procurement processes need significant improvement to ensure transparency and
accountability. Compliance by the RHD (as well as other agencies) in introducing and
adhering to the GOB's Public Procurement Act needs to be strengthened further. Drawing
from the mis-procurement case for the Primary Road Network, risk mitigation measures
should be introduced early on in future procurements, such as introduction of electronic
government procurement (e-GP) which will ensure bidding documents available
electronically, electronic submission of bids, and appointment of an independent advisor to
ensure due diligence of the bid evaluation process.

It is important to re-examine whether an umbrella approach, such as used in the 2004 PFRAP,
is an appropriate and suitable approach since the approaches and types of work, their
requirements and concomitant processes (for example, procurement) vary within each sector
(and counterpart agency). Alternatively, each sectoral post-flood rehabilitation component
could have also been funded from ongoing sectoral investment projects with slight
amendments to the DCAs. For example, the MSP already had a flood rehabilitation
component with a separate disbursement category in its DCA and this could have been
utilized to speedily implement the flood damage rehabilitation requirements of the affected
municipalities within the project itself. Also, the Bank's appointment of a single Task Team
Leader to supervise all components of PFRAP covering different sectors, and that only from
April 2006, was not a very timely decision. But the strong support and coordinating
supervision from the Country Management Unit (CMU) helped disbursement and
achievement of the program benefits.

Despite the fact that Bangladesh has made notable progress over the years in its capacity to
deal with natural disasters, particularly through strengthening weather monitoring and early
warning systems, the endemic nature of natural hazards for a country such as this suggests
that disaster preparedness should continue to be a central part of the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS). In future a way to establish clear recovery objectives is to
explore if investment projects, particularly in the infrastructure sector, can be made `disaster
sensitive' by having the flexibility for rapid disbursement and rehabilitation in the event of a
catastrophic natural disaster.




                                                69

Floods being multi-sectoral, coordination within IDA and Government is crucial to assess
damage, design and supervise such projects. Program implementation need to be rethought to
avoid lack of coordination that ERD took up only at the fag end of PSIDP. Again contract
packing needs to be rethought also for speedy implementation as small sized contracts do not
draw attention of large/ quality conscious construction firms.

Annex 12. Summary of Borrower's ICR for Post Flood Recovery Assistance Program

Implementation of the Project

Livelihood Restoration Project

For successful implementation of this project adequate stakeholders were involved. General
project management was satisfactory, except delay in signing of SGA between PKSF and
Ministry of Finance. PKSF engaged adequate staff and management capacity to administer
the fund effectively. Through formulation of a Disaster Management Loan Policy (DMLP),
PKSF selected POs and sought loan demand from them in more structured ways. Moreover,
standard performance indicators were developed for effective monitoring of the project.
Being pleased with the effective utilization of fund Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has
decided to declare it as grant to PKSF.

Primary Road Network

RHD adopted all sorts of possible efforts to make the project successful. Even consultants
were engaged for design and supervision. But due to misprocurement the project was not
finally implemented.

Secondary Road Network

Time was a constraint for successful implementation of the project. To achieve the planned
physical target within a short span of time of two years was very difficult. In addition, sudden
price hike of the construction materials also affected in achieving the full-target.

Municipal Infrastructure

The project was incorporated with another ongoing World Bank financed project (Municipal
Services Project). Thus a significant amount of time was saved bypassing the conventional
procedure of approving a new project. Considering the limited institutional capacity of the
smaller municipalities, the field offices of the LGED were given the prime responsibilities to
implement the project. As the numbers of municipalities were quite large (52) and their
locations were widely dispersed, the decentralized units of LGED (offices at the sub-district
level) were used without creating implementation units at each of the municipalities.

Primary Schools

The project was highly successful. There were no major implementation issues of the project.
Approval process of the project was slightly more lengthy than expected. So, the startup of
the project was delayed by about six months. LGED used its proven institutional experience
and capacity to complete the project timely instead of initial delays.

Secondary Schools

The project took only 12 months to be implemented. Completion of preliminary site survey,


                                                71

planning, design, soil investigation within scheduled time made the project successful.
Timely tabulation of tenders and prompt disposal were experienced in this project.
Throughout the project there was satisfactory project management by EED. The provision of
responsibility of 80% fund to non-technical Project Director posted from the outside EED
and 20% GOB fund controlled by the Chief Engineer caused delay in case of payment to the
contractors. But the regular supervision of the field engineers worked as motivational factor
for the contractors to implement the project within scheduled time.

Quick Disbursing Support

Timely engagement of required staff and effective management including provision of all
inputs by the Bangladesh Bank authority made the project a successful one. Required goods
were imported from the countries complying with World Bank Procurement Guidelines. No
more than 50% of the component was used in the aggregate for the import of any single item
on the positive list. Cost of imports made only after July 2004 was considered eligible for
replenishment.

Operational Experience

Livelihood Restoration Project

The experience of this project would encourage PKSF to take realistic and large scale project
to face disasters with all out cooperation of World Bank in future. Access to Disaster
Management Fund (DMF) along with regular micro credit program has increased the
acceptability of the POs among the borrowers.

Primary Road Network

The project was cancelled.

Secondary Road Network

It was experienced that for short-term physical construction operations, small contract would
have been the better options rather than taking three-five roads under the same contract.
Construction of one road in one contract and one bridge in one contract including one market
in one contract would have been the most suitable option for quick construction as well as
facilitating the participation of more contractors.

Municipal Infrastructure

LGED provided quality supervisory support, through its district quality control labs, for
ensuring timely completion of the packages under the project by establishing a robust MIS
system, which provided updated information. During implementation no operational problem
was encountered.




                                               72

Primary Schools

The program was spread over 34 districts. The communities extended their help for site
selection and security of the constructions materials. LGED provided quality supervisory
support for ensuring timely completion by establishing an MIS system. During
implementation, there was no operational problem.

Secondary Schools

Through this project EED gained considerable experience about dealing with a high-
prioritized project with limited time and manpower. This experience will definitely help in
future to deal with such type of urgent project more systematically.

Quick Disbursing Support

Fund withdrawal time from the World Bank was very short. But authorized commercial
banks responded positively. They cooperated to collect the relevant L/C documents promptly.

Exchange rate used 1 SDR = 1.43 US$
Considering that the project implementation period was less than two years, the disbursement
(fund utilization) is quite high, especially if the US$ 32 million allocated to RHD, but not
utilized due to misprocurement, is taken into account.

Disbursement by the time of the loan closing date is expected to increase, as payments
waiting to be disbursed will be completed by that time.



                                               73

Additionally, many sub-project areas were located in remote disaster affected areas and they
could not all be reached within the timeframe of the project.

Livelihood Restoration Project

World Bank disbursed the proposed US$ 10 million to PKSF. Through 119 POs PKSF will
disburse the total fund to 3,14,334 borrowers by the end of December 2007. The progress of
the project was considered 100%. PKSF is working systematically to successfully achieve
the ultimate objective. It is expected that this program would be able to bring positive
changes in the lives of flood-affected people by providing them the opportunity to restart
economic activities in a more organized way. Due to intervention of the program their
awareness towards health care and safe drinking water has also increased. Rehabilitation of
various Income Generating Activities (IGAs) has enabled them to increase their household
income, which would increase socio-economic status.

Primary Road Network

The project was cancelled.

Secondary Road Network

About 94% of the physical target of the project was achieved. 994 km of upazila roads, 10
growth center markets and 850 meters of bridges/culverts were constructed. Of the proposed
US$ 25 million, US$ 1.704 million was cancelled. The main economic benefits of road
improvements are expected to save vehicle operating costs and travel time. The main benefits
of market improvement are envisaged to be increased market turnover. The project
compulsorily ensured involvement of at least 30% women in the construction and
maintenance activities and did not allow any wage discrimination between male and female
which have ultimately far reaching contribution to the gender equity i.e. empowerment of
women.

Municipal Infrastructure

100% operational objective of the project was achieved. Under this project it was planned to
rehabilitate 716 km of roads, 18 km of drainage, and 509 meters of culverts/bridges.
However, during implementation phase, the targets were re-fixed. Towards the end, 629 km
of roads, 7 km of drainage and 85 meters of bridges/culverts were rehabilitated. In addition,
911 meters slope protection work and construction of 3,231 meters retaining wall was also
accomplished.

Primary Schools

It was planned to reconstruct 853 flood-damaged primary schools. However, due to
duplication of site selection, the revised target was set for 745 schools, which were
successfully reconstructed within scheduled time and the overall progress of the project was
87.65%.

Secondary Schools

The objectives of the project were achieved 100%. EED completed the construction of
planned 69 institutions with required furniture and tubewells spending US$ 4.15 million
against the proposed US$ 5 million financed by the World Bank. Activities of this project are
aimed at improving the quality of secondary education in rural areas. An in-house baseline
survey to investigate the initial impact of the project in rural population revealed positive
impact in the rural life of the people.

Quick Disbursing Support

World Bank gave US$ 43.9 million against the agreed US$ 45.0 million. 100% objectives of
the project were achieved. Total amount was transferred to the Government account of
Bangladesh Bank for budgetary assistance. The fund was used to purchase food grains,
edible oil, fertilizers and machinery parts.

As the project was cancelled for being misprocured, no risk was identified to development
outcome.

Secondary Road Network

The sudden price hike of petroleum and some construction materials was a major risk.
Therefore, it is recommended to keep provision for price escalation in the contract. As
government initiated its flood rehabilitation works simultaneously through different agencies,
there was a possibility to face the shortage of bidder. LGED strongly handled the issue by




                                                75

motivating the bidders to participate in the bids and overcame the delay due to political
unrest by rescheduling the work plan and running all possible works simultaneously.

Municipal Infrastructure

Roads below the normal flood level was raised and rehabilitated with adequate number of
cross drainage structures. In vulnerable cases rehabilitation of road works included slope
protection and retaining wall. In wet prone locations (inside markets, through water bodies
on both sides) RCC/CC pavements were constructed instead of conventional bituminous
pavement. The overall risk to development outcome appeared to be low.

Primary Schools

As this was an emergency operation and resources were mobilized from unspent money of
existing projects and there was no structured project preparation and appraisal, there was risk
of failure in achieving complete development outcome. However, LGED overcame all
drawbacks through effective institutional integrity.

Secondary Schools

As the institutions were planned to undertake construction in remote areas, there was
possibility of non-cooperation by the local people whether local people would accept the
project as a participatory one. Moreover, due to the remoteness, it was really difficult to start
works within the scheduled time, which was a significant risk against successful timely
implementation of the project. Through effective project management, EED mitigated the
possibility of all risks.

The PFRAP was created as a response to the 2004 floods in Bangladesh and a number of
projects, notably the PSIDP was restructured to provide funds for it. The Government
performance, especially which of ERD, was remarkable in the sense that, without their rapid
response, the flood-affected areas would not have received any benefit under this project.
Nevertheless, the management of such a large number of projects, through a number of
executing agencies was a difficult proposition that ERD ultimately managed successfully.
The enormity of the situation can be gauged when the complexities are considered. The
PFRAP was planned to implement through five (5) executing agencies in seven (7) projects
within a period of less than two (2) years. Both ERD and the World Bank played key roles in
accelerating the pace of the implementation. At one stage, fortnightly co-ordination meetings
were held in ERD with all stakeholders and the World Bank.

Lessons Learned

Livelihood Restoration Project

To implement Livelihood Restoration Project prompt & timely action should be taken by the
all stakeholders. Better coordination is needed among all stakeholders for smooth
functioning. Loan size should be determined in accordance with the losses of the affectees.
To reduce vulnerability of the affectees different insurance product should be introduced.
Steps could be taken to involve the affectees in different IGAs at the time of disaster. Along
with instant long-term action plan should be adopted to cope up with disasters.

Implementing agency suggested that some sorts of `unallocated fund' in the GOB budget
might be more effective for disaster management. Capacity building program for municipal
staff to undertake similar activities is necessary. For expeditious implementation of the
emergency projects, the government might consider reducing the steps of project approval.

Lessons Learned

Livelihood Restoration Project

The project has been able to achieve remarkable progress due to all out cooperation of World
Bank. Long-term relationship between World Bank & PKSF helped for smooth functioning
of this project.

Municipal Infrastructure

On emergency government request, instead of following a long process of project preparation,
available and identified unspent resources of ongoing projects/ programs may be reallocated
to address the urgent requirements of the country. Donors could be more expeditious in
implementation of the emergency projects by reducing layers of project approval.

Secondary Schools

Successful implementation of this type of time-bound project depends on good understanding
and cooperation between EED and the World Bank.

Proposed Arrangement for Future Operation

Livelihood Restoration Project

PKSF will create a permanent Disaster Management Fund. After the completion of LRP the
fund will be merged with PKSF's own Disaster Management Fund. This fund will be used as
revolving loan fund to provide loan to the disaster-affected persons at the time of disaster or
disaster preparedness activities. Along with PKSF, POs will enrich their own Disaster
Management Fund.

Secondary Road Network

In future projects, where the duration is short, small sized contracts should be encouraged in
order to avoid implementation delay and broaden the base for participation.

Primary Schools

On emergency government request, instead of following a long process of project preparation,
available identified unspent resources of on-going projects may be reallocated to address the
urgent requirements of the country. The GOB and the World Bank could be more expeditious
in implementation of the emergency projects by reducing layers of project approval. Site
selection of the emergency rehabilitation should be verified before final approval of the
government for expediting the implementation and directing benefits to the beneficiaries as
early as possible without hampering the regular education of students.

Secondary Schools

This was a closed project and had no scope of future operation unless World Bank funds a
similar new project. If a new project is taken up, the experience gathered by EED shall be
useful.
