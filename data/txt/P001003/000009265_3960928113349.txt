MEMORANDUM AND RECOMHENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA BISSAU
FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE RERABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed
development credit to the Republic of Guinea Bissau for SDR 18.5 million
(US$23.6 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The propoEed credit
would be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity and would help finance
an Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project.  The Project would be cofinanced
by other donors for US$14.9 million equivalent.
2.        Background and Strategy. Since independence in 1974, Guinea-Bissau
has faced the major task of rebuilding its economy which was heavily damaged
during the war of independence. The combination of excessive centralization
and weakness of the administration had resulted in a deep economic and
financial crisis. To correct this situation, the Government has embarked on
a comprehensive Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) with the objectives of
liberalizing trade, introducing more restrained fiscal policies and
production incentives, correcting foreign exchange disparity, and other
market-oriented measures. The SAP has been supported by two IDA Structural
Adjustment Credits, an IMF Structural Adjustment Facility and other bilateral
and multilataral donor assistance, and has started producing positive
effects.   The infrastructure sectors have a key role in SAP.   Improved
transportation will contribute to broadening the market and freeing
productive forces, especially in agriculture.  Road infrastructure, which was
partially improved during IDA's First and Second Highway projects, must be
further improved to provide adequate access to agriculture production areas.
Furthermore, government strategy, as presented in its Transport Policy,
focuses on strengthening the operations and financial management of all
public transport companies and on training of skilled and semi-skilled
personnel required for operations and management of the sector. In the urban
sector the accent wlll be on improving the housing and sanitary conditions
which deeply affect the productivity and health of the labor force.
3.        Guinea-Bissau's transport sector comprises 2,630 km of roads, of
which about 752 are in poor condition and which, if well maintained, would
be generally adequate to meet the country's needs; a deep water port, managed
by the port authority, JAPG, which receives most of the international
traffic, and 27 small coastal and river ports; and an international airport
and 17 landIng strips for domestic traffic under the Department of Civil
Aviation.  The country has no railway.  Road and river transport take an
equal share of the domestic freight traffic, with little going to air
transport. Regarding public transport companies, the country possesses a
national airline, TAGB, which carries about 252 of the international
passenger traffic and all domestic traffic; RODOFLUVIAL which took over
freight transport from two previously existing public trading companies and
passenger river transport from the national shipping agency, GUINEMAR; and
a bus company, SILO DIATA, which is severely constrained by lack of workshop
equipment and spare parts.   All have suffered from debt problems and
inadequate  revenues  from  operations.    Despite  the  presence  of  these
parastatals, the private sector takes a significant share of the transport



- 2 a
sector market, particularly road tranoport, but its productivity is low
because of spare parts shortages and inadequate repair facilities.
4.       lBatol Is Lor IDA ZLmMk!sL  t.  The IDA country assistance focuses
on creating the conditions for long-term development of the economy and
remedying financial imbalances by limiting new investments to the most
essential needs. The transport sector, which may require about 301 of public
investment over the next five years, is a critical area where failure to
achieve a balanced development would Imply heavy losses in other sectors and
slow down the impetus on liberalization created by the SAP. Continued IDA
involvement will help to reduce this risk. Although other donors may be
interested in financing equipent and civil works, none has shown interest
in supporting overall strengthening of the institutions.   The results
achieved under previous projects ouggast that this would best be done through
continued IDA participation. Biasau's sanitary conditions which recently led
to an epidemic of cholera, and the very poor living conditions of most of its
population justify involvement in municipal management and housing programs.
Furthermore, IDA's support of tile project will intensify the policy dialogue
on road maintenance financing and investment planning for the transport and
urban sectors, and will help enlist the support of donors towards high
priority projects.
5.        Project Obiectives.  The objectives of the project will be to (a)
consolidate progress made under the Bissau Port Project and the two highway
projects and, in particular, establish sound and efficient infrastructure
maintenance capaecity; (b) remove bottlenecks to increased agricultural
productivity, particularly in the South, by improving parts of the existing
feeder road network; (c) address weaknesses in the areas of road management,
transport planning and financial management of the public transport
companies, and further encourage private participation in the transport
sectors (d) contribute to a more economical balance between the road and
river transport modest (e) implement a comprehensive training program for
managers,  and  skilled  and  semi-skilled  personnel  needed  for  the
infrastructure sectors; (f) improve municipal services in Bissau and other
centers; and (g) expand on the sites and services operation initiated under
the Social and Infrastructure Relief Project (Cr. 2020-GUB approved in May
1989), as well as provision of demonstration houses, in order to more fully
address the need for low cost housing.
6.        Prolect  DescriBtion.    Project  components  will  comprise  (a)
institutional support to the Ministry of Social Equipment (MES) and its State
Secretariat of Transport (SET) to strengthen the planning and management of
transport and urban projects, and monitoring of transport companies,
including training programs and sector studies; (b) assistance to the public
transport companies (SILC DIATA, RODOFLUVIAL, JAPG and TAGB) through
provision of equipment and spare parts, tools and technical assistance to
strengthen their management and maintenance and to facilitate involvement of
the  private  sector  in  their  operations;  (c)  road  infrastructure
rehabilitation and maintenance including improvement of feeder roads and
training of domestic contractors in labor-based road works; (d) urban
development including preparation of a Housing Policy, establishing systems
for housing finance, expansion of solid waste collection, distribution of
plots and houses, and developing municipal services in Bissau and other
centers. The total project cost is estimated at US$43.3 million equivalent

with a foreign exchange component of US$34.3 million (792). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A, Amounts and mrthods
of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Guinea Bissau are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8070-
GUB dated November 6, 1989. is also attached.
7.        Actions Agreed.  Agreement was reached with the Government  on the
following: (a) the scope of restructuring SILO DIATA, GUINEMAR and TAGB, and
action plans for involving private participation in each of the public
transport companies, including changes required in their ownership or
management, to be implemented by January 1, 1992; (b) implementation of the
Transport Policy and new transport regulations; (c) an action plan for TAGB
to create a new company in Guinea Bissau involving a venture with an
international aviation company; (d) restructuring of the Road Fund and
improved collection of road user charges; (e) the criteria for adjusting
periodically tariffs for services of the public transport companies and road
use charges, as well as annual reviews of physical and financial performance
and action plans of MES, SET, Bissau Municipality and public transport
companies; (f) annual auditing of the accounts of Bissau Municipality and all
public transport companies; (g) operational and financial targets for the
public transport companies; (h) a survey of occupants of existing dwellings
on land to receive services; implementation of an action plan, including any
resettlement, to be agreed with IDA; (i) the three-year (1990-92) transport
and urban investment programs; (j) annual reviews of rolling three-year
transport and urban investment plans and annual budgets and expenditures; and
(k) criteria for selecting priority investments including: the need to
adequately fund rehabilitation and maintenance before new construction and
upgrading; economic rates of return for investments to be at least 122; and
any proposed investments in the urban and transport sectors over US$1.0
million equivalent to be agreed with IDA. Conditions of Effectiveness are:
(1) appointment of the coordinator, accountant and training advisor for the
Project Coordination Unit in MES; (m) implementation of a revised system for
adjusting tariffs for each public transport company; (n) undertaking measures
satisfactory to the Association to enable an increase in revenues for the
Road Fund; (o) assumption of SILO DIATA's foreign debt by the Government; (p)
publication of new transport regulations; and (q) Participation Agreements
between MES and each public transport company. Agreement on criteria for
allocating serviced plots and houses is a condition of disbursement for the
sites and services and housing component.
8.        Justification and Risks. The project would reduce transport costs,
contribute to the training of Guinea Bissau's skilled manpower, stimulate
local production and contribute to poverty alleviation by providing an
opportunity for the public to purchase land for low-cost housing. It would
provide better access to agriculture production areas, and would contribute
to a healthier environment for the urban population. The main risks are: (a)
non-compliance with the transport policy;   (b) Government reluctance to
facilitate private sector participation in works and transportation; and
(c) delays in implementation due to constraints in the absorptive capacity
of MES.    The  Government,  however,  has  given  its  commitment  to  the
implementation of the transport policy and has agreed to measures to select
and fund infrastructure projects with emphasis on rehabilitation and



- 4 .
maintenance programs. Furthetmore, detailed action plans will be prepared
for private participation in each of the Public Transport Companies. The
establishment of a Project Coordination Unit in MES and a Transport
Coordination Unit in SET will ensure that Implementation of this multi.
faceted project is well managed and that performance of the public transport
companies are constantly monitored.
9.        RecaMe_ tiou.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
