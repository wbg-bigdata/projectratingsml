IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Cr. 2074-GUB)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Project (IRP) in Guinea-Bissau, for which Credit 2074-GUB in the amount of SDR 18.5 million
(US$23.6 million equivalent) was approved on December 14, 1989, and made effective on June 5,
1990.
The credit was closed on December 31, 1996, a year later than originally planned. It was
fully disbursed and the last disbursement made on April 11, 1997. No cofinancing was involved.
The ICR was prepared by Leslie R. Pean, Task Manager, AFTU2, in the Africa Region,
reviewed by Mr. Mahmood A. Ayub, Country Director (CD14), and edited by Mrs. Pushpa N.
Schwartz.
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission of
June 1996. The ICR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement, supervision
reports, field visits, discussions with the project staff, and materials in the implementing agency files,
and the project file. The Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR providing information for
the statistical tables, and commenting on the draft ICR. These comments have been incorporated.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Cr. 2074-GUB)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    IDA assisted the transport and infrastructure sectors in Guinea-Bissau through six previous
credits: the First and Second Roads Projects (Cr. 878 and 1473/F0l 8-GUB), the Port of Bissau
Project (Cr. 1392-GUB), the First and Second Reconstruction Import Credits (Cr. 1531 and A 14-
GUB), and the Social and Infrastructure Relief Project (Cr. 2020-GUB). The operations supported
by these credits sought to modernize the Port of Bissau, strengthen road management, provide spare
parts and equipment, and rehabilitate road and water transport, improve basic services and
community facilities, and generate employment. The Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (IRP) was
designed to meet the country's needs and was in line with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
which sought to create conditions for long-term economic development and remedy financial
imbalances by limiting new investments to the most essential needs. The transport sector, which
could have required 30% of public investment over the coming five years, was a critical area where
failure to achieve balanced development could have implied heavy losses in other sectors and a slow
down in the impetus for liberalization under the Government's Structural Adjustment Program
(SAP).
Project Objectives
2.    The main objectives of the IRP were to (a) strengthen Government institutions involved in
the transport sectors in the management of maintenance and operations; planning and coordination of
sector activities; and financial management of public transport companies; (b) contribute to a greater
equilibrium between road and river transport; (c) remove bottlenecks to increased agricultural
production; (d) improve municipal management and services in Bissau and other centers and
provide serviced plots and construct low-cost demonstration houses; and (e) support a
comprehensive training program to increase capacity in Government agencies, municipalities, and
the private sector to operate, maintain, and manage urban and transport infrastructure and services.



Implementation Experience and Results
3.    In spite of the many difficulties arising from the shortfalls in the availability of counterpart
funds and cofinancing by other donors. project objectives were substantially achieved. The major
and significant factors that affected implemenitationi were: (a) resistance to the restructuring and
private participation in the public transport companies, and (b) chironic delays in the availability of
counterpart funds and unwillingness of other donors to participate as co-financiers.
4.     The institutional capacity of the MOPCU and MTC was significantly improved through
technical assistance (TA) and the training provided that benefited 1012 people through some 51
courses. The private sector institutions benefited as well. IRP brought about participation of the
private sector in the transport sector in a transparent and impartial manner. The bus company, SILO
DIATA, was dissolved and a mixed public-private company, TRANSTER, was established in its
place. A privatization study on RODOFLUVIAL, the public trucking and river transport company
dealing with the transport of merchandise, was completed, based on which its privatization is
underway. The privatization of trucking transport component is already completed and the
privatization of river transport component is nlow under coordinationi of the Managemenit Unit for the
Reform of Public Enterprises (UGREP). Managemenit of the Port of Bissau was privatized and the
port's operational efficiency has improved markedly. TAGB, the national airline company,
benefited from TA and provision of equipment and traininig provided for its repair shops;
privatization of the TAGB is also underway and is being carried out under UGREP.
5.     Only 50 kms of the planned 180 kms of paved roads, including the Bissau-Nhacra and the
Safim-Joao Landim roads, were rehabilitated and the rest were to be upgraded through cofinancing
that did not materialize. Anothier II kms of paved roads and 4.5 kms of unpaved (earth) roads in
Bissau were rehabilitated. Some 130 kms of rural feeder roads in the eastern part of the country
were improved with financing from the European Community (EC); another 60 kms of rural roads
that were to be rehabilitated with labor-intenisive methods were not because of the absence of donor
financing. About 244 kms of roads were maintainied in the southerin and northern regions of the
country. With respect to the construction and rehabilitationi of ferry ramps nothing was
accomplished because of inadequate finanicing; however, the ferry ramps at Sao Vincente and Joao
Landim were rehabilitated, even though this had not been originally planned. Two new rafts were
acquired for Joao Landim and Sao Vincente with Europeani Community financing. Equipment, spare
parts, and materials for road and waterway maintenance and logistical support were provided to the
General Directorate of Roads and Bridges (DGEP). A road mainteniance program for 1990-95 was
developed for the rehabilitation of 1,615 kms of roads, or about 320 kms each year. A Road Fund
was established to finance the future maintenance and rehabilitation of the road network.
6.     Under the urban program: (i) low-cost houses were constructed on urban lots in Bissau,
Bafata, Bissora, and Buba to test their viability; however, only forty or about 50% of the planned
number were built, as the remaining funds were diverted to the urgent rehabilitation of urban roads
and the drainage system in Bissau; (ii) studies were completed that analyzed the mechanisms for
reorganization of the municipality of Bissau and suggested ways to improve its revenues; and (iii)
vehicles and equipment to be procured for garbage collection in Bissau could not be purchased
because the necessary financing from the French did not materialize. Because of shortfall in IRP
financing, the urban program was reduced in size and some funds were transferred to implement
other IRP components.



iv
7.     The project finances had to be reallocated on four different occasions because of shortfalls
in financing. The project suffered from delays in counterpart financing and deficiencies in financial
management; three audits were qualified. The closing date was extended by one year to December
31, 1996.
8.     With the on-going reorganization of the Road Fund, the results achieved under the IRP are
likely to be sustainable. The training and upgrading of skills had beneficial effects in increasing
management capacity in both the public and private sectors. The success of the training argues for
its continuation to assure better maintenance and operation of the couLntry's infrastructure. IRP
contributed to the creation of small- and medium-size companies in civil architecture, road
maintenance, and other technical areas and led to the consolidationi of existing companies. Bank
performance was generally satisfactory, while the Borrowe-'es performance was deficient in
implementation, particularly witlh respect to counterpart finaniciing, lack of financial accounting, and
delays in allowing the participation of the private sector in lie transport companies.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
9.     The implementation of IRP and its outcome can be judged as partially successful. The
experience gained was useful in designing the ongoing Transport and Urban Infrastructure Project as
well as the preparation of the Water and Energy Project. These follow-up projects can be expected
to further strengthen institutional capacity and sustainahility of infrastructure maintenance in
Guinea-Bissau.
10.    The key lessons learned from the IRP are: (a) Project activities and their related costs need
to be carefully analyzed and take into account the further deterioration of infrastructure that can
occur between project preparation and implementation. (b) Cofinancing should not be counted upon
unless the co-financiers give their firm assurances. Reliance on a substantial amount of cofinancing
that did not materialize led to implementation delays, chaniginig priorities, scaling down of the
project, demoralized staff, and a revision in the Project Agreement. (c) The Borrower should be
asked to make a firm commitment for the funding of maintenanice and operations of the
infrastructure through a mechanism such as the Road Fund. A Special Account should be considered
and established in accordance with the norms of the Bank's Special Accounit.

B.    BACKGROUND
I.    Since independence in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has faced the major task of rebuilding its
economy which was heavily damaged during the war of indepenldence. The Government embarked
on a comprehensive Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in 1987 to liberalize trade, restrai-. public
expenditures, and introduce production incentives and other market-oriented measures. The
infrastructure sector had a key role in the SAP. Improved transportation was essential to broadening
the market and freeing productive forces, especially in agriculture. Road infrastructure, partially
improved under the IDA-supported First and Second Highway Projects, needed further improvement
to provide adequate access to agricultural production areas. The Government's strategy, as presented
in its Transport Policy, focused on strengthening the operations and financial management of all
public transport companies and on training skilled and semi-skilled personnel essential for
management and operations of the sector. In the urban sector, housing and sanitary conditions
needed to be upgraded urgently to enhance the productivity of and reduce the health risks for the
labor force.
2.    The country's transport sector comprised 2,630 kilometers (km) of roads, 75% of which
were in poor condition; a deep-water port, managed by the port authority, JAPG, and 27 small
coastal and river ports; and an international airport and 1 7 landing strips for domestic traffic, under
the Department of Civil Aviation. Road and river transport had an equal share of the domestic
freight traffic. The national airline, TAGB, carried about 25% of international passenger traffic and
all domestic traffic. RODOFLUVIAL, the Public Trucking and River Transport Company, took over
freight transport from two earlier public trading companies and passenger river transport from the
national shipping agency, GUINEMAR. The bus company, SILO DIATA, was severely constrained
by the lack of workshop equipment and spare parts. All transport modes suffered from debt
problems, poor financial management, and inadequate operational revenues. Despite the presence of
these parastatals, the private sector had a significant share of the transport market, particularly road
transport, but its productivity was low because it, too, lacked adequate repair facilities and spare
parts supply.



3.     IDA involvemenit in the linfrastiuctujre Rehabilitation Project (IRP) was based on the critical
importance of transport for the long-term developmenit of the economy and to remedy financial
imbalances and limit new transport investmenits to the most essenitial needs and improve municipal
management and housinig programiis to alleviate the very poor living conditions in the urban areas.
C.     STATENIENT/EVAXI.jVI10N OF PROJECT OBJEC TI ES
4.     The major- objectiv\es of I RP were to
(a)    establishi a sounid and etfficient infrastructire mainiteniance capacity,
(b)    reniioxe hottlenecks to increased agricultural productivity, particularly in the South,
by implrox \Hig parts of the existing feeder- road netvork;
(c)    address  cakncsses in roa(d maniagement, transport planning, and financial
rianagememnt of the public transport companies, and further encourage private
participat ion i1 transpoll:
(d)    contribute to a more econ:olmical balanicc between the road and river transport modes;
(e)    inplement a comprehenisive training programi lor maniagers and skilled and semi-
skilled personal Ineeded for thc infIrastrLIctuel- sectors;
(t)    improve ilunicipal seCvices in Bissau anid other urban centers; and
(g)    expanid on the sites and services operation initiated under the Social and
Inlfrastiuctuire Relief l'roject (Cr 2(020-GUB13). as well as build low-cost
demronstration houises to help address the need for more housinig.
5.     The project comprised the following components: (a) institutional support to the Ministry of
Social Infrastructure (MIES) and its State Secretariat for Transport (SET) to strengthen planning and
management of transport and url-ban projects and monitoring of transport companiies, including
training programs and sector stuldies.: (b) assistance to tilc public transport companies--SILO DIATA,
RODOF.UVIAL. .AP( , and I ,AGB--bv providing equipimienit and spare parts, tools, and technical
assistance (TA) to strcngthen their managemnenit and mainitciance capabilities and facilitate private
sector involvemeint in th.ci  operations: (c) ioad infrastriuc-tire rehabilitation and maintenance,
including improvement ol feeder roads and training of domestic contractors in labor-based road
works; and (d) urban development, including preparatiotn of a Hlousing Policy, establishing systems
for housing finan-ce, eNpais,on of sold-waste collectiorn, distributioll of plots and houses, and
developing municipal ser-vices in 13issau and other cities.
6.     The objectives of the IRP werc clear and appropriate given the urgent need for the
Government to restructure its policies to the realities of the market place, reduce its fiscal
imbalances, increase the participation of the private sector. and provide adequate investment and
maintenance resources and skills for essential inftastructuLe in both the urban and rural areas. They
were in liie with the Bank's ('ountrv Assistance Strategy that sought to create conditions for long-
term development of thc cconomiy and remedy the financial imbalances by limiting new investments
to the most essential neecds. espicciallv in a sector that would have required about 30% of public
investment over the ncxt five years, 1989-94. But given the critical institutional weaknesses and the
very poor condition of the existing, infrastructure and inadequate repair facilities, equipment, and
materials, the ob jectives xcrc too dcmanding and ambitious, especially as the hoped for cofinancing
did not materialize. Pro'ect implemncitationi delaN s \ycre caused by the chronic shortfalls in

cofinancing, which led to shiftling priorities and frequenit reallocation of available fhinds.
D.     ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
7.     In spite of the many difficulties arising fiom the shortlills in IRI' iRIlancing, the project
objectives were substantially achieved.
8.     At the completioni of the IDA-assisted Seconid Roads Projfect in 1 988 the couinitry had no
private companies engaged in road constructioni, rehabilitation, or maintenance. I RIP entcouraged the
creation and participation of private companies in the transpori sector in a transparent anid imilpartial
manner. Jobs were created and the qualifications and skill, ol pesoninlel in thec Ministry of Public
Works, Construction and Urban Affairs (MOPCUI. which relaiced MlFS) and the MNinistrv of
Transport and Communications (MTC) were implroved. Iicrciascd emiplo'ment and the
employability of people througi tr-ainiilng and enhanced skills n Wshlionied th-e ilmlpact of structural
adjustment and privatization. Many of the employees of M(JPU anid N/1i  . xNho were laid-off as a
result of institutional streamlininig, found employment in Ih'e I  a "tiel comiiparic> engaged in road
construction and rehabilitation.
9.      Institutional support and training, were highil\ satisfa( tor\, attend(led h\ I () I2 people with a
level of success higher thani 90%, provided throughi 51 separaie courses. [hc tr.aininl0 programn had
included people coming from MOPCU (33%). MTC (23,o,) aid 44%' wit\ otIsl)c  origilns, iciliding
private companies. The program helped to improve the technical and proftssioinal capacily of the
national staff. The operational capacity of the Coordination I nts inl( il(1  and Ml ' was
strengthened. Several individuals who benefited 1ronit 1A and r     . are io w       upt tii" other
development projects in the country, some are filling respons lHe technical posit ions in various
ministries, while others have established their own privatt conlsulltilng hbuInesses
10.    As for the reforms of transport companies, at credit et l ctiveles>. thc lour transport
companies (Silo Diata, Rodofluvial, JAPG, TAGE3 antd CGiincinar) eNre notl\ in a delicient or even
unrecoverable, operational and technical situation. Ihe hus conipaiy - Sl( I I) IATA. had onily one
bus, operating on the lile Bissau-Dakar without any securit\ .:ondilt in. Matleivlliallce,
administrative and financinig services were not operating. There \ere no accontling registrations or
capacity to pay the debts of the enterprise, namely wvagcs  Klr,ical k  wh\n ic\cliding some taxis,
there were no urban transportation in Bissau. As for ROI)OIl 1  'ViAl. in lost the market in the

of merchandising to the road ones, due to the noni existenice t i centers for agriculture pr-oducts whicl
would justify the transport of large quantities and the terinim,tion ol the credit flacilities given by the
government, tihrough a special credit line, for the acquisition ot truckisC. AP( hlad sionificant
difficulties in the managemenit of the port of Bissau. no ol oii iin adn inisirative and financial areas,
but also in operational and security matters. Becausc of its dfIhcienlt cxpniaitaiilom. IPG was
draining resources from t'he national budget whille not offering a miniul iniii service e.g. lack of
loading facilities, to the port users. TAGB, the nationial airliOe pr esenied la-re dilficulties in terms
of management and operations. It did not have its ow\n plaiws to  uralllntce intercontinental
connections, and decided to associate with EAS; this association only brouglit problemis to both
enterprises because, as they never made an ob jective coFItraLt. he'\ wlert mi con,stat discussion. As
for GUINEMAR, it presented several managemilenit irregilar (tIes and (didi tom  n.lamatCc the mlillimum
agency services to the ships coming alongside the Port of bivSau

11.   In this context, actions conducting to the launching of a liquidation and privatization process
of these companies were favored instead of technical assistance to improve their competitiveness at
the operational level. Among the public transport companies, the bus company--SILO DIATA. was
dissolved and a new company, TRANSTER, with over 60% private ownership was created il its
place. GUINEMAR was dissolved and several private maritime companies were created with
technical assistance from the project. A privatization study on RODOFLUVIAL, the public
merchandise trucking and river transport company which liad steadily been loosing market share,
was completed and private participation in its ownership is underway: the privatization of trucking
transport component is already concluded and the privatization of river transport component is now
under the coordination of UGREP. IRP finaniced the repair of three of RODOFLUVIAL's boats.
Traffic signs and the buoy systems for river transport were also improved. Management of the Port
of Bissau was privatized, a mixed company, GUIPOR, with 70% private ownership, was created in
the place of JAPG; the port's operational efficiency has improved to handle increased traffic. TA
was provided to TAGB, the nationial airline, for its repair shops; and privatization of TAGB is also
underway under the coordinationi of UGREP.
12.    About 50 kms of the planned 180 kms of paved roads, including the Bissau - Nhacra and
Safim-Joao Landim roads, were rehabilitated and the rest were to be upgraded through cofinancing
that failed to materialize. Another I I kms of covered roads and 4.5 kms of urban roads in Bissau
were rehabilitated. Some 130 kms of rural feeder roads in the eastern part of the country were
improved with financing from the CE; another 60 kms of rural roads that were to be rehabilitated
with labor-intensive methods could not be, again because donor financing did not materialize; the
TA needed for this purpose was, therefore, not required. The construction and rehabilitation of ferry
ramps was not accomplished because of inadequate financing; however, the docks at Sao Vincente
and Joao Landin were rehabilitated, even thoughi this had not been originally planned. Two new
rafts were acquired for Joao Landim and Sao Vicente with EC financing. Equipment, spare parts,
and materials for road and waterway maintenanice as well as logistical support were provided to the
General Directorate of Roads and Bridges (DGEP). A road maintenance program for 1990-95 was
developed for the rehabilitation of 1,61 5 kms of roads, or about 320 knis each year. About 244 kms
of roads were maintained in the northern and southiern regions of the country. A Road Fund was
established for the orderly maintenance and rehabilitation of roads. TA was provided to the National
Engineering Laboratory (LEGUI) and its facilities were rehabilitated.
13.    Under the urban program, (i) low-cost houses were constructed on urban lots in Bissau,
BafatA, Bissora, and Buba to test their viability; however, only 50% of the planned number were
built, as the remaining funds were diverted to the rehabilitation of urban roads and the drainage
system in Bissau; (ii) studies were completed that analyzed the mechanisms for reorganization of the
municipality of Bissau as well as the ways to improve its revenues; and (iii) vehicles and equipment
that were to be procured for garbage collection in Bissau could not be purchased because the
financing from the French was not forthcoming.
E.    IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
14.   Implementation of the IRP was affected by several factors. A major one was the lack of
cofinancing. During project preparation, several donors active in Guinea Bissau's development
showed interest in cofinancing for the IRP, among them the African Development Bank (AfDB), EC,
and the French, German, and Portuguese aid agencies. In the end, despite sustained efforts to obtain
cofinancing, besides IDA none of the other donors provided any support. About half way into the
implementation the EC came in to support rehabilitationi of the rural feeder roads in the eastern part



5
of the country. Because of the shortfall in financing, IRP targets had to be scaled down and funds
reallocated for the most urgent tasks as described on this report.
Factors Subject to Government Control
15.    Local counterpart finanicing. It was anticipated that the Government would provide
financing for IRP through the National Fund for Development (FND) and the Road Fund. Its
contribution from FND was less than $100,00, in contrast with its obligation to provide US$1.4
million equivalent. Some additional resources came from the Road Fund, but these fell far short of
the level originally programmed under the IDA Credit Agreemenit. IRP resources thus fell short by
US$4.2 million. A Special Account for IRP was established abroad and managed by the Central
Bank of Guinea Bissau; but serious difficulties arose with account reconciliation and inadequate
funding of the account, which in turn delayed payment of invoices to contractors by the IRP
Coordination Units. These problems were overcome after an agreement was reached between the
Government and IDA that led to the establishment of a Special Project Account with the
International Bank of Guinea-Bissau that was managed directly by the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) in MOPCU.
16.   Institutiolal factors: MES was responsible for IRP durlilng the preparation phase, but during
the implementation phase responsibility was devolved to MOPCU and the MTC, after MES ceased
to exist. Coordination between these two m inistries was inieffective at times because of their failure
to resolve differences on key issues whichI resulted in implemiienitationl delays.
F.     PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
17.    Project sustainability is rated likely. The reorganization of institutional structures to
continue the activities carried out under IRP make its achievements sustainable. The reorganization
of the Road Fund under the new Transport Policy and, in particular, under the Transport and Urban
Infrastructure Project (TUIP). provides some assurance that the road infrastructure will be
maintained. A new decree was signed by the Government detailing specific resources to be provided
to the Road Fund from customs duties, gasoline taxes, and port taxes. Also a new management has
been put in place for the Road Fund and relationships and convenltions have been designed for the
Road Fund to transfer the funds collected to AGEOPPE to carry out road maintenance. With the
Road Fund reorganization, the system for carrying out road infrastructure maintenance will be put in
place and be sustainable.
G.    BANK PERFORMANCE
18.    Overall, Bank performance in identification, preparation, and appraisal of IRP was
satisfactory. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) correctly identified the risks that might be faced
during implementation, i.e.. noii-compliance witlh the agreed transport policy, Government
reluctance to facilitate private sector participation in works and transportationi, and delays in project
implementation because of conistrainlts in institutionial and management capacity. However, staff
failed to consider adequately the risk of cofinanicinig not becoming available. This was a major
shortcoming, as the lack of cofinancing affected the project outcome in a major way. Also an
important constraint on the project supervision was the discontinuity affecting the project team. Four
task managers supervised the project during the first four years of project implementation.
19.    Project supervision was satisfactory and helped to resolve problems quickly; for example,
the changes required in the Credit Agreement and reallocation of finances in the face of resource
shortfalls. The project was extended for one year to complete some road works.

H.    BORROWER PERFORMANCE
20.    The Borrower's performance in project preparation was satisfactory. However, there were
some deficiencies in the provision of counterpart funds, reestructuration of the Road Fund, and
management of the Special Account. Therefore, the Covenanit Compliance in respect to counterpart
funds is rated deficient. Chronic delays in counterpart funding in turn led to delays in project
execution. Also restrictions on Government expenditures imposed by the SAP, caused delays in
execution. Financial management of the public transport companies was weak. Three of the project
audits were qualified.
I.     ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
21.    The outcome of IRP is partially satisfactory. IRP promoted the private sector and
contributed to the creation of small- and medium-size companies in civil architecture, road
maintenance, and other technical areas and led to the consolidation of some existing companies. It
also led to the reform of public sector enterprises in the transport sector.
22.   IRP contributed to capacity building in the ministr-ies by helping to improve the technical
capacity and skills of personnel in the MOPCUJ and MTC and the privatized companies through
training and technical assistance. Finally, IRP rehabilitated physical infrastructure, thereby
promoting trade and improving the transport of goods and movement of persons in the country.
J.     FUTURE OPERATION
23.   The experience gained in execution of the IRP was useful in designing of the Transport and
Urban Infrastructure Project (TUIP--Cr. 2748-GUB), and is also being built upon in the preparation
of the Water and Energy Project. These follow-up projects should serve to strengthen institutional
capacity and sustainability of operation and maintenianice of the country's infrastructure.
K.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
24.    The key lessons learned from implementationi of the IRP are:
(a)    Project activities and their related costs must be carefully analyzed during project
preparation and due account taken of the possible further deterioration in
infrastructure facilities that can occur between the preparation and implementation
stages. The road, air, and marine transport infrastructure deteriorated further
between the appraisal and implementation and led to additional finalicilig needs for
which adequate provision had not beeni made.
(b)    Cofinancing should not be counted upon unless the co-financiers give their firm
assurances. The scope of IRP was formulated in a way that relied on a substantial
amount of cofinancing. When it failed to materialize, the project had to be scaled
down, which demoralized staff in the implementing agencies, led to a revision of the
Credit Agreement, and left some urgent needs unmet.
(c)    The Borrower should be asked for firim asSuranices of funding maintenance and
operations through a mechaniism such as the Road Fund. A Special Account should
be considered and established in accordance with the norms of the Bank's Special
Account for project financinig.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Cr. 2074-GUB)
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT
Introduction/Background
In November 1988, an IDA mission consisting of specialists in the infrastructure field
joined forces with the Guinea-Bissau authorities to appraise a proposed Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project. In the process, the following were identified as the key objectives of the
operation:
(1)   to strengthen the institutions involved in the urban and transportation sectors
(Ministry of Social Infrastructure and State Secretariat for Transport) in:
(a)   management of maintenance and operations
(b)   planning and coordination of sector activities
(c)   financial management of public transport companies;
(2)   to contribute to a better balance between road and river transport;
(3)   to remove bottlenecks to increased agricultural production, especially in the
South, by improving parts of the feeder road network;
(4)   to improve the management of municipal services in Bissau and other centers, and
to expand on the sites and services operation initiated under the Social and
Infrastructure Relief Project as a means of addressing the need for low-cost
housing;
(5)   to support a comprehensive training program to provide government agencies,
municipalities and the private sector with personnel equipped to operate, maintain
and manage urban and transport infrastructure and services.
The total cost of accomplishing these objectives was estimated at US$37 million. Given
that IDA credit proceeds were estimated at US$18 million and local counterpart funding at US$2
million, it became obvious that potential cofinancers would have to be identified and means
found of increasing the revenues of the Road Fund, the main source of counterpart resources.



Annex_1
Page 2 of 7
Cofinancing
The following agencies and organizations indicated their willingness to participate in one
way or another in financing the project: African Development Bank (AfDB), United Nations
Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), European Union (EU), Swedish Intemational
Development Agency (SIDA), Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (ABEDA), and
KfW of Germany.
Local Counterpart Financing
Under the terms of the original Credit Agreement, national counterpart contributions to
local currency expenditures, particularly on road maintenance. were to be as follows:
10% of overall cost in 1990
10% of overall cost in 1991
20% of overall cost in 1992
40% of overall cost in 1993
40% of overall cost in 1994
In order to meet these obligations, the Government proposed to rely mainly on substantial
changes in Road Fund revenue-collection powers, and inclusion/adjustment of other revenue
sources as follows:
(1)   gasoline tax (from 5% to 20% of c.i.f. value);
(2)   annual vehicle tax (from PG 5,000 to PG 8,000 on light vehicles, and from PG
10,000 to PG 16,000 on heavy vehicles);
(3)   tax on import of vehicles and spare parts (5%  and 10%  of c.i.f. value,
respectively).
At the same time, the toll system would be abolished, given the well-documented
difficulties affecting its operation and management.
Organization and Implementation
In order to facilitate implementation of the project, a Coordination Unit had been set up
with a mandate to supervise execution of all its components and to assist the institutions whose
capabilities and jurisdictions it was focused on, namely the then Ministry of Social Infrastructure
and State Secretariat for Transport. In the case of the Ministry, supervision was to be effected
by technical units attached to and coordinated by its General Directorates. The State Secretariat
for Transport was guaranteed technical assistance for LEGUI (National Engineering Laboratory)
and DGEP (General Directorate of Roads and Bridges) through UCT (Transport Consulting
Unit), and for DGHU under a contract with the consulting firms CESC and BCEOM.

Project implementation began in 1990 and was completed in 1994, although, for reasons
that had to do with the final disbursement, the actual project closing date was deferred until mid
1996. Consequently, and given the goals and objectives set out in the Appraisal Report in 1989,
it is considered important to enumerate the lessons to be drawn from the project as a whole, as
well as to make a special assessment of certain issues raised by its implementation history.
Assessment of Project Outcome
Despite the difficulties encountered in executing this project, it is the considered opinion
of the Guinea-Bissau authorities that its effects are readily apparent and that it must be regarded
as having proved a very positive undertaking, a conclusion borne out by the following results:
(1)   Rehabilitation and/or upgrading of both paved and earth roads in the interior,
especially in the southern region of the country, which has led to a significant
reduction in transport costs and to the expected degree of stimulus for the
agriculture sector. Building of ferry docking facilities on major rivers.
(2)   Development of serviced building sites and construction of low-cost housing in
both the capital and the interior, and the logistical support provided for the Bissau
City Council, have set the foundations for a policy of cost recovery in the housing
sector
(3)   The Ministry of Public Works, Construction and Urban Affairs and the Ministry
of Transport and Communications have been equipped with minimum operational
structures and with comprehensive data on the national infrastructure network and
housing stock, basic requirements for their respective roles. With establishment of
the technical units attached to the General Directorates, the essential conditions
have been created for a gradual transfer of technical capabilities through technical
assistance. Evidence of this can be seen in the fact that during the last years of the
project its technical management was entirely in the hands of Guinea-Bissau
nationals.
(4)   Creation of a stock of local capabilities through a lange of project-financed
training programs.
(5)   Gradual transfer of management responsibilities to the private sector from such
public transport enterprises as SILO DIATA, the Autonomous Port Authority, and
GUINE-MAR.
(6)   Creation of private enterprises in the sector, with an associated increase in
employment opportunities, mainly for individuals let go from the civil service.
The preceding factual and realistic statement of project achievements needs to be
accompanied by a short catalogue of those aspects of project organization that contributed to this
general outcome:



Annex 1
Page 4 of 7
(1)   Existence of a simple, functional organizational structure based on careful
definition of the duties and responsibilities of all parties involved - plus
compliance with/acceptance of these provisions.
(2)   Guarantee of an operational environment compatibl. \vith the importance of the
objectives in view - or, in other words, the logistics and equipment in place
covered the essential requirements of the structural organization created.
(3)   Appointment of stable work teams which took part in all phases of the project
(design, negotiations, execution). Selected on a basis of competence, capacity for
initiative, and contractual ties to the project, they were assured of remuneration at
the levels Guinea-Bissau professionals considered "acceptable minimums."
(4)   Careful formulation of, and the most scrupulous adherence possible to, a timetable
for physical and financial execution of the project. Continuous evaluation of
project work team performance through quarterly progress reports.
Bottlenecks and Remedial Measures
During the project implementation process, which began in June 1990, various problems
arose. In some cases they were satisfactorily resolved but in others were simply kept as much as
possible to a minimum:
Special Account:   (Memorandum on problems encountered during implementation of
the Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project and the steps taken to solve them.)
At project commencement, an account was opened abroad with Crecdito Predial
Portugues (Banco Comercial), to be managed by Guinea-Bissau's Central Bank. This invariably
involved a long bureaucratic process which led not only to delays in settling accounts but also to
difficulties in obtaining bank statements for purposes of Special Account reconciliation with the
World Bank's Disbursements Division in Washington.
Remedy: The problem was resolved in late 1992 when the Government decided to place
direct management of the Special Account in the hands of the Project Coordination UJnit.
Cofinancing:
There can be no doubt that the initial involvement of [potential] cofinancers in the project
[followed by their later failure to provide support] became the major source of difficulties. In
addition to the Bank, the only other contributor ultimately was the European Community, which
participated in specific rural road rehabilitation and maintenance programs.  The African
Development Bank had already shown interest in cofinancing the project at the time the Staff
Appraisal Report was being written, but because of penalties imposed on Guinea-Bissau for non-
payment of arrears to this financial institution no sums were ever actually forthcoming.



Annex I
Page 5 of 7
Local counterpart financing:
The Government was to participate in project financing through: (i) the Road Fund,
whose articles of incorporation were amended to enable it to support the Road Maintenance
Program; and (ii) the National Development Fund, which was to cover the cost of other local-
currency expenditures, specifically institutional civil works and operations. The Road Fund,
with great difficulty, covered 10% of the cost of road maintenance works, as follows:
1990        US$54,000
1991        US$68,150
1992        US$74,550
1994        US$111,320
National Development Fund performance was less satisfactory, since it contributed no more than
US$45,000, in the first year of the project (1990). In the circumstances, the Credit Agreement
had to be amended several times in order to avert suspension of the project. Notwithstanding, a
number of difficulties arose during the final phase of the project, when disbursements to
contractors scheduled to be made before the project closing date looked as if they might become
part of the public debt.
Lessons
The Government believes the foregoing material warrants the following observations on
issues arising from the implementation history of the project:
1.   In future, a fundamental concern should be to foster discussion of existing views as an
essential step toward formulation of a truly comprehensive sector policy which not only
establishes the mechanisms for project or program implementation but also lays out a national
maintenance strategy, independently of the provider of financing. In the Government's view, this
would assist greatly either in reducing the major obstacles to the mobilization of cofinancing, or,
should this prove impossible, in keeping project scope on a scale commensurate with basic
assured funding.
2.    The technical capabilities created by the project and vested in the special units attached to
government departments are essential functional elements that need to be preserved from the
"obliteration" that will otherwise be their lot. This dilemma, like the "abrupt" insistence on
privatization of the many work teams (brigadas) created through World Bank projects, raises
questions regarding the coherence and consistency of the policies applied under the different
projects, namely Road Projects I and II, SAL I, the Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Project (IRP) under review here, and the Transport and Urban Infrastructure Project (TUIP). The
project under review (IRP) provides a textbook example: the technical assistance provided to
ensure successful project implementation, while indispensable, absorbed 60% of the funding
earmarked for strengthening the institutional capabilities of the executing agency, a figure almost
double the volume of local counterpart funding.



Annex 1
Page 6 of 7
3.    Failure to heed the two preceding lessons can lead only to a situation where, while the
achievements of a project are verified by explicit data and values as the results of specific
interventions, the same objectives elsewhere may require new but vir.ually similar interventions.
This is tantamount to saying that the country benefits from the physical outcome of a particular
operation, but without any assurances that there has been a transfer of the skills and capabilities
that would ensure self-sustainability in the field in question.
4.    There appears to be a need to review the concept of "local counterpart funding" for
projects. When it is expected in fixed amounts that quantify governmental participation in or
commitment to financing a particular operation, it can seriously jeopardize important
undertakings. Guinea-Bissau believes it should be regarded instead as an assurance of the effort
the authorities are prepared to make in the future to ensure that wealth created by an initial
investment of capital is maintained. In other words, external financing is sought because a
country recognizes its financial and institutional inability to meet the needs on which the
program focuses. But such financing goes hand in hand with requirements for counterpart
funding which the sector is not yet in a position to generate. precisely because of the extent to
which the resources or services it supplies or performs have deteriorated. When this type of
situation is exacerbated by the accompaniments to acceptance of external assistance, the house of
cards collapses -the project or program closes down without having solved the problem, a
heavy debt has been created, and there is the added aggravation of finding that the same need
persists.
5..    As far as cofinancing is concerned, experience shows clearly that few donor agencies are
willing to surrender control over their funds to others. Each and every one of these institutions
has its own project implementation policy and criteria, besides its interest in appearing as the
prime mover in the actions to be carried out. The proposed arrangements to finance sites and
services programs under SAL I by UNCDF/UNDP. and under the present project by the
European Union and AfDB, are clear warnings not to have high expectations of the concept of
cofinancing, and in the future to insist on commitments being confirmed before loan agreements
are signed, or otherwise to scale projects to the volume of guaranteed funding.
Conclusion
Analysis and evaluation of the extent to which project objectives were
accomplished, and the experience gained through the project implementation process itself, lead
the Government of Guinea-Bissau to the following conclusions:
(1)   The outcome of the project was sufficiently positive in terms of its physical
components, namely road construction and maintenance, rehabilitation of urban
infrastructure, and construction of pilot housing.
(2)    The same can be said of withdrawal by the state from the management of
transport operations (SILO DIATA, Port Authority, and GUINE-MAR).



Annex 1
Page 7 of 7
(3)   Support for private sector promotion was also satisfactory, in the sense that newly
created enterprises were strengthened by the award of public works contracts.
(4)   Especially positive was the institutional support made available to the Ministry of
Public Works, Construction and Urban Affairs and the Ministry of Transport and
Communications, which made possible the achievement of fundamental sector
objectives.

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT (IRP)
AIDE-MEMOIRE FROM THE WORLD BANK's
SUPERVISION MISSION
(June 29-July 9, 1996)
Introduction
1.    An IDA supervision mission comprising Mr. Leslie Pean, mission chief and project officer,
and Mario Antao, consultant, visited Guinea-Bissau from July I to 9, 1996 to supervise and prepare
for closure of the Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (IRP).
2.    The mission met with the following government representatives:  Armando Ant6nio
Napoco, Minister of Public Works, Construction and Urban Development (MOPCU), and
Ansumane Mane, Minister of Transport and Communications. The mission maintained regular
contact and held working meetings with Domingos S. Pereira, Director General of Infrastructure
and Transport, Agostinho Fernandes, Director General of Housing and Urban Development, Ernest
T. Menezes d'Alva, IRP Coordinator, Joao Pess6a de Magalhaes, expatriate coordinator, and
Domingos F. Gomes, managing director of AGEOPPE.
3.    At the first meeting with the mission, the Minister of Social Infrastructure took the
opportunity to give a status report on the IRP project. Although the project was in its final phase, a
number of related financial issues still remained unsettled.
Roads program
Rehabilitation of roads network
4.    Road maintenance contracts for 1995 were cut down to less than 20% of those for earlier
years, and are still six months behind schedule. Of the 1,050 km of priority network roads, only
142 km of the paved system and 50 km of earth roads have received any current maintenance.
Public invitations to tender were issued in May of last year, and the contracts were signed at the end
of June that same year.
5.    SAO VICENTE-M'PACK ROAD, BULA-CANCHUNGO-CACHEU ROAD (Contract
No. 206/UCP/PRI awarded to NO CUMPU, for US$57,328.50, signed June 27, 1995). The works



Annex 2
Page 2 of 5
under this contract have been completed and accepted. With respect to payment, the performance
guarantee has yet to be released.
6.    SAO  DOMINGOS-VARELA  ROAD  (Contract No. 217/UCP/PRI awarded  to
GUINCONSTROI L.da, for US$112,000, signed June 27, 1995). This contract included not only
normal maintenance, but also a general upgrading of the road and heavy work between Pk 0 and Pk
12, including scraping [escarificacdo], upgrading and construction of the wearing course in laterite
gravel. The work has been completed and accepted.
Operation of Chuvas Dam
7.    EASTERN AND SOUTHERN HIGHWAY (Contract No. 209/UPC/PRI awarded to
SADU GUINE, for US$17,995. signed June 27, 1995).  Contract performance and billing
comp!eted.
8.    NORTHERN HIGHWAY (Contract No. 208/UCP/PRI awarded to NO CUMPU, for
US$4,740, signed June 27, 1995). Contract performance and billing completed.
Rehabilitation of urban roads
9.    BAIRRO MILITAR ROAD, 2nd segment (Contract No. 214/UCP/PRI awarded to
CONSORCIO NO CUMPU-SENARCO, for US$150,826.90, signed November 3, 1995). The
contract provided for rehabilitation of 690 m of roads and construction of 980 m of ditches [valetas]
and 18 m of water mains. The road component was completed last January, and the defects that
prevented provisional acceptance of this part of the project have now been corrected. Provisional
acceptance is now scheduled for the end of July.
10.   The drainage component is still in progress, owing mainly to the delays in the moving of a
large section of the water supply network within the work area. Some 200 m of ditches still remain
to be completed by the agreed deadline of July 20 of this year, provisional acceptance being
scheduled for the end of July.
Pluba road
11.   DRAINAGE COMPONENT (Contract No. 231/UCP/PRI awarded to URTEC-N, for
US$54,650, signed May 6, 1996). The contract provides for the construction of 480 m of ditches
[valetas] and 26 m of I x I water mains. About 50% of the works have been completed. No billing
has taken place. The works should be completed by the end of this month.
12.   ROAD  COMPONENT  (Contract No.  230/UCP/PRI  awarded  to  EMPRESA
GUICONSTROI, L.da, for US$17,350). Work on this component has not yet started, pending
completion of the water mains. The works should be completed by the end of this month.

ADB COFINANCING
13.   REHABILITATION  OF  ROADS  (Jugudul-Bambadinca, Jugudul-Mansoa-BissorA,
Bambadinca-Xime, Cati6-Rio Cumbija, Buba-Cati6). The program to be financed by the ADF is
still not ready to be launched since the Ministry of Cooperation has still not informed MOPCU of
its actual cost.
14.   In May of last year, the Minister of Public Works, Construction and Urban Development
sent a letter to the ADB requesting that the program be launched again. One the actual cost of the
program has been deterrnined, its component projects will have to be brought up to date.
Urban Program
Construction of 40 serviced lots and houses
Subdivisions in the interior (Buba. Bafata and Bissora)
15.   With respect to the construction of demonstration houses on serviced lots in the cities of
Buba (Contract No. 220/UCP/PRI awarded to the Thomas Nartey company), the work is somewhat
behind schedule because the company lacks capital, alleging that its bills have not been paid.
UCP informed the mission that there is only one outstanding invoice owing to that company,
pending the upcoming replenishment of the Special Account; since the amount involved is lower
than US$20,000, the minimum required for bill payment by direct disbursement, this invoice
cannot be sent to the World Bank for settlement.
16.   Bafata (Contract No. 221 awarded to the Mamadiu Djal6 company). These works are also
behind schedule, but in this case UCP has not yet received any bill for payment, owing to the
virtual absence of supervision on the part of the Ministry. The fact is that after the allocations for
the domestic brigades assigned to this component were used up, the Ministry lost most of them, and
supervisory responsibility passed to MOPCU's regional agents, who draw governnent wages and
do not have the logistical equipment to enable them to adequately monitor works in progress.
17.   Bissora (Contract No. 222 awarded to URTEC-N). The work is in its final phase and
provisional acceptance is scheduled for the end of July.
18.   Having reviewed the available documentation concerning the contracts mentioned in
paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 above, the mission did not find sufficient evidence to justify the delays. It
therefore asked the Government to take all necessary steps to bring the respective works back on
track as soon as possible.



Annex 2

Audit
19.   The mission received confirmation of the request for funding for the upcoming Project
Audit, covering the activities of the current fiscal year, which in this case runs until all payments
have been made, probably up to September or October. The finn of Ernst and Young, which has
audited the project for the past three years, has submitted a proposal of US$15,000 to audit the IRP
only, and the mission has no objection to this being financed by AGEOPPE.
Financial situation of the IRP
Status of requests for payment
20.   Given that the IRP project closed on June 30, 1996, the mission asked the UCP/IRP
Financial Department for an exhaustive survey of the status of all outstanding contracts, invoices,
and payment requests. As a result of this survey a number of documents were voided, either
because they had been drawn up without regard for the proper procedures or because it was found
that they were not eligible for payment. A list of those documents appears in Annex 1, "Payment
requests voided." Annex 2, "Payments outstanding at July 4, 1996," also reflects the findings of
the survey and contains a list of eligible invoices on which payment is currently being made.
Status of contracts
21.   During the process of the survey the effective costs of certain contracts were corrected so as
to objectively identify the commitments given by the IRP.
22.   Given that it was not possible by June 28. 1996 to achieve consensus between the
Government and CESO - Consultores Internacionais on the matter of the addenda to contracts nos.
14 (UCP/IRP), 15 (GT/IRP), 17 (UCT) and 19 (DGHIJ/CMB), the Government asked the mission
for a statement of no objection to signature of a contract with AGEOPPE whereby the latter would
provide MOPCU with support in aspects related to supervision of the road and urban works in
progress under the IRP, support in closing the IRP project, and all necessary technical assistance.
Having checked the terns of reference, the mission issued a statement of no objection to signature
of the contract. The mission also reminded the Government that it would not be possible to sign
any contract related to the IRP project after its closure on June 30, 1996.
23.   To monitor the status of the contracts, a table headed "Financial Monitoring of Credit
Agreement 2074-GUB" was drawn up. This table, shown in Annex 3, lists all of the IRP contracts,
broken down into disbursements and commitments, in US dollars and SDRs, through July 4, 1996.



Annex 2

Balance available under Credit Agreement 2074-GUB
24.   Annex 4, "Estimated financial implementation of the IRP at July 4, 1996," contains an
overview of the IRP's financial situation. The annex also shows the costs assigned to each
category, amounts already disbursed, amounts committed, and the balance available.
25.   The mission reminded the Government that the undisbursed balances available in any
category on the date of project closure cannot be subsequently withdrawn, which means that after
that date only those payment commitments made by June 30, 1996 can be honored. Annex 5,
"Commitment of IRP allocations (works, urban plots, and road maintenance)," contains a list of
active IRP contracts, and gives in column "Dif' the amounts to be billed and for which no request
has been received to date.
