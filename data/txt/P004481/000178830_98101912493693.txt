PHILIPPINES
WATERSHED MANAGEMENT AND EROSION CONTROL PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of the Philippines has requested Bank assistance in
financing a project which would reforest about 24,600 ha in the Pantabangan
watershed and about 7,500 ha in the Magat watershed on the island of Luzon.
The project would include provision for the preparation of a feasibility
study to deal with the problems of the large and complex Magat watershed,
implementation of range management and smallholder agro-forestry pilot
programs in that watershed, and initiation of an integrated forest protection
pilot program in two areas in Luzon. The project would be the first major
Government program to address the problems of the watersheds of the two
largest multipurpose dams in the country.
1.02      A feasibility study for the project was prepared under the pro-
visions of Loan 1227-PH by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) with
assistance from Engineering Consultants Inc. of Denver, Colorado, and
Mandala Agricultural Development Corporation of Manila. This report is
based on the findings of an appraisal mission composed of Messrs. E.G.
Giglioli and V.V. Talvadkar (Bank) and J. Chitty, A. Figueres and R. Strang
(Consultants) which visited the Philippines in June 1979. The Forest
Protection Pilot Component of the project was prepared by the Bureau of
Forest Development (BFD) of the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) and
appraised by Mr. C. Keil (Bank) in September 1979. Ma. Hill and Miss H.
Towsey assisted in preparation of the report.
Watershed Management
1.03      Of the 12.0 million ha of forest land in the Philippines, almost
5.0 million ha have already been denuded. Uncontrolled logging is
accompanied by the activities of shifting cultivators who frequently move
into logged-over areas, cut existing vegetation, and plant subsistence crops
for one to three seasons before moving on. Such areas are quickly covered
with cogon grass (Imperata cylindrica) which represses regeneration of tree
growth and adds to fire hazards. Each year some 200,000 ha of forests are
logged over, reforestation by the BFD compensates for only 5% of the forest
cut. Furthermore, much of the BFD reforestation effort has concentrated
on restoring growth cover with little attention being given to planting of
species for ultimate commercial use. Also follow-up maintenance of
reforested areas is lacking which frequently results in destruction by
weeds, animals or fire.
1.04      As population grows, the pressure on forest resources in the
Philippines will increase. Already imports of pulp, mainly long fiber, are
almost 100,000 tons annually. Bank projections indicate that by 1985 the



-2-
Philippines' annual demand for paper and paperboard would double from the
current level of 400,000 tons to 700,000-800,000 tons. Demands for
fuelwood are growing rapidly due to the rise in oil prices as well as
continuous population pressure. Although much of the fuelwood comes from
noncommercial forests, continuous fuelvood cutting is depleting resources
and contributing to serious siltation and erosion problems.
1.05      The Government is aware of the problems of forest destruction and
in 1975 Presidential Decree 705 was issued which provides for acceleration
of land surveys and classification, protection and rehabilitation of forest
lands, rationalization of the wood processing industry and strengthening of
forestry research. The Government has recently established a Presidential
Council for Ecosystem Management, which includes representatives from the
main Government agencies concerned, to provide policy leadership for a more
active forestry development program and to stimulate popular awareness of
the need to preserve forestry resources. The success of the Government's
program will depend on efforts to improve regulation of logging in existing
forests, the implementation of well-planned reforestation efforts, and
commercial tree farming and woodlot development. The ability of the
Government to implement these programs will in turn depend on substantial
strengthening of the Bureau of Forest Development and of other Government
agencies concerned with forest development and rehabilitation.
1.06      A total of approximately 1.4 million ha of the denuded land is
located in watersheds or catchments which are sources of water to important
irrigation, power and water supply dams. The potential threat to the
economic life of these facilities as a result of erosion and sedimentation
has caused considerable concern to the Government. The people living in
these watersheds have moved there due to population pressure and scarcity of
employment in the lowlands. They are extremely poor and survive on shifting
hillside agriculture and occasional labor income from Government public
works. Continuous degradation of the watersheds is reducing the productive
capacity of the land and its ability to provide a means of livelihood to the
people. Protection of land resources in the watersheds and increasing the
incomes of the disadvantaged resident population is an important Government
objective.
1.07      The very severe damage to denuded watersheds caused by typhoon
Didang in 1976 focused public attention on the urgent need for watershed
protection. Tree planting campaigns were initiated throughout the country
and in 1977 a Presidential Decree was issued requiring every citizen to
plant 12 trees annually. The MNR, through the BFD, is mainly responsible
for implementation of these ambitious programs. Recognizing the magnitude
of the problem and the burden placed on the limited resources of BFD, the
Government took another important step in 1978 declaring a number of
watersheds serving multipurpose dams to be critical, banning all logging,
and entrusting the immediate management of the catchments to a number of
designated lead agencies. Excellent legislation exists today to manage and
control logging and grazing and to undertake reforestation. However, this
legislation has rarely been enforced. Reforestation of watersheds is



presently being done by a number of Government agencies through a series of
small projects. Most of these efforts have concentrated on the short-term
objective of restoring ground cover, without any attention to the need to
develop a long-term, self-supporting system of land use for the watershed.
The existing tree planting campaigns, by offering employment only for planting
are, in fact, providing the local population with an incentive to destroy the
seedlings in order to get more employment. Any successful watershed
management program would have to give the local population a stake in the
survival of the trees.
Project Formulation
1.08      An erosion control study of the Pantabangan and Magat watersheds was
included in Loan 1227-PH for the Chico River Irrigation Project in March 1976.
The study was carried out by NIA with the help of consultants. The objective
of the study was to prepare a watershed management and erosion control project
for both watersheds. This study provided the basis for formulation of the
project. The proposed project envisages three main lines of approach to the
problems of denudation and degradation of the watersheds in the Philippines.
In the compact, relatively small and well-defined Pantabangan watershed, the
project would utilize the existing capabilities of the NIA to establish an
economically viable and technically sound system for preserving and enhancing
the productive capacity of the catchment, in association with the local
inhabitants, firstly, as paid laborers and ultimately as shareholders in a
joint agro-forestry venture. In the much larger, more variegated and more
complex Magat watershed the project would provide for a multidisciplinary
feasibility study of the catchment under the aegis of the National Economic
Development Authority (NEDA) to produce an area development plan for the
watershed. Concurrent with the study would be pilot range management and
smallholder agro-forestry programs, together with a NIA-operated agroforestry
plantation immediately around the proposed Magat reservoir. The third line of
approach would be provided by the BFD implemented forest protection pilot
component in which forestry occupancy management, forest guarding, forest fire
control and watershed rehabilitation would be dealt with as an integrated
whole in two trial areas in Northern and Central Luzon.
1.09      This would be the first Bank-assisted watershed management project
in the Philippines and the third Bank-assisted project involving tree farming
and forestry. The first one was the Pilot Tree Farm Project (Loan 998-PH)
which provided supervised credit for tree farming to smallholders through the
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for the cultivation of a fast
growing pine species (Albizzia falcataria) for pulpwood. Based on the success
of the pilot project, the Smallholder Tree Farming and Forestry Project (Loan
1506-PH) was initiated in 1978. Besides providing supervised credit for tree
farming to smallholders in Mindanao, the Visayas and Northern Luzon, it pro-
vided for the commercial reforestation of some areas by BFD in Abra province.
While the pilot project was successfully completed in 1979, the latter project
has lagged behind schedule. The main reason for this has been the slow rate
of smallholder enrollment due to problems of obtaning land certificates for
collateral and farmer reluctance through lack of experience. However, DBP
remains committed to the project and is working on ways to overcome the
problems and to stimulate progress. The BFD plantation component has been



-4-
delayed through lack of Government funds, though the delay is expected to be
made up to a large extent during 1980.
2. THE PROJECT AREA
Pantabangan Watershed
2.01      General.  The watershed is situated in the provinces of Nueva
Ecija, Nueva Vizcaya and Quezon on the island of Luzon, (Map No. 14583) and
has an area of about 82,900 ha, excluding the 8,000 ha of the Pantabangan
reservoir. The Pantabangan dam, built with Bank assistance (Loan 637-PH),
is in the southwest corner of the watershed, and is connected to the cities
of San Jose and Cabanatuan by all-weather gravel roads, with an onward
connection to lManila by the concrete surfaced Philippine-Japan Friendship
Highway. The terrain of the watershed is varied, consisting of flat areas
and rolling to rugged and steep mountainous landscape, dissected by narrow
flat-bottomed valleys. Population density in the watershed is substantially
below the national average and the per capita income is 12.5% of the national
per capita income. Summary statistical data are shown in Table 2.1.

2.02      Climate.  The climate in the watershed, consists of a dry season
from December through April and a wet season from May through November. The
average annual precipitation varies from less than 2,000 mm in the lower
elevations to over 3,000 mm in the mountains east of the reservoir, with an
average of about 2,800 mm. The heaviest precipitation occurs in the months of
May through August, the heart of the southwest monsoon season, and accounts
for about 70% of the annual rainfall with about 22% of the annual precipi-
tation occuring in July. The monthly temperature does not vary appreciably,
with an average high of 35.50C in May and a low of 20.0°C in February. The
watershed experiences strong winds from the east and northeast during the
months of December through April and light and variable winds during the rest
of the year. The mean monthly wind speed, measured 10 m above ground, varies
from 3 to 11 km/hour. The watershed lies within the tropical typhoon belt and
averages about three typhoons per year. Climatological data are summarized
in Table 2.2.

2.03      Topography, Drainage and Soils.  The topographic development of the
watershed is varied and complex. The upper reaches, which include the
headwaters of most of the principal streams draining the foothills of the
Sierra Madre mountains on the east and the Caraballo mountains on the north
and northeast, are mountainous and rugged highlands with a skyline elevation
of about 1,100 meters above sea level. These highlands have a youthful
landform development and are characterized by precipitous slopes and
towering sharp-crested ridges that are interspersed with V-shaped drainage
valleys. The topographic development of the lower relief areas ranges from
recent to late mature and is characterized by broad ridges interspersed
with wider drainage valleys. The agricultural land is concentrated in
alluvial valleys of the main river systems and the largest portion is
located in the northwestern part of the watershed along the Carranglan
river. The major rivers draining into the Pantabangan reservoir originate
in the mountainous area and generally flow in a southerly direction and
have steep gradients until they reach the vicinity of the reservoir.
2.04      Four soil series have been identified and mapped in the project
area: the Annam and Guimbalaon series in the higher reaches of the
watershed, the Mahipon series on the intermediate slopes, and the Bunga
series in the plains. Soils of Annam and Guimbalaon series are derived from
weathered igneous rocks, are 50 to 130 cms deep, clayey in texture, well
drained, acidic (pH 5.5), moderately high in organic matter and low in
potash and phosphate. These soils are suitable for tree and forest crops.
Soils of the Mahipon series are derived from quaternary alluvial talus
deposits, are moderately deep, clayey in texture, well drained on the
surface but with restricted internal drainage, are slightly acidic (pH 5.8),
reasonably high in organic matter, moderate in potash and low in phosphate.
The soils are suitable for rainfed rice and upland crops. Soils of the
Bunga series are deep, moderately well drained externally but poorly drained
internally, acidic (pH 5.5), relatively low in organic matter and deficient
in potash and phosphate. The soils are best suited for lowland paddy
production.
2.05      Erosion.  Soil erosion in the watershed is a serious problem, but
how much erosion is taking place and how much sediment is being deposited in
the reservoir is presently unknown. About 46% of the watershed area has
severe erosion, mostly on steeply rolling and very hilly terrain where the
soil cover is grass, savannah and secondary forest. Slight erosion occurs
on about 45% of the drainage area where the dominant soil cover is primary
forest. No apparent erosion exists on the level to nearly level irrigated
and rainfed rice lands accounting for about 8% of the drainage area.
2.06      Land Use.  The three major land uses are forests, grasses and
crops (Table 2.3). The forest area of 36,915 ha or 44% of the watershed,
consists of about 23,740 ha of primary forest and about 13,175 ha of
secondary forest. The primary forest area has undergone depletion in
recent years due to excessive logging. The loss of forest cover, coupled
with frequent fires, has resulted in severe erosion of former forest lands.



Grassland, which consists of mainly cogon grass (Imperata cylindrica),
comprises about 43% of the watershed and cropland about 12%. Land devoted
to diversified farming is usually benched and used for vegetable growing.
Shifting cultivation (kaingin) affects only 2,300 ha or 3% of the watershed
and involves the clearing of sloping land by cutting and burning the
vegetative cover for temporary cultivation. When the fertility of the soil
is exhausted or the soil eroded, the cultivators move to another site and
repeat the same cycle. Except for the lowland rice and residential areas,
the land is owned by the Government.

2.07      Population.  The 1975 population in the watershed was about 25,370
or about 4,335 households. Between 1970 and 1975, the population grew at an
annual rate of 4.1% compared to the annual national growth rate of 2.8% over
the same period. The higher growth rate was due to immigration into the area
from the nearby densely populated region of Ilocos and from the province of
Ifugao. According to surveys conducted by NIA in 1979, about 44% of the
households obtain their income primarily from farming and fishing, about 35%
from employment with Government agencies, mainly on NIA and BFD reforestation
programs, and the balance from seasonal work, cottage industry and service
jobs. The average per capita income in 1979 was US$75, with 77% of households
having average annual per capita incomes of less than US$140. The average
farm size is 1.9 ha with no appreciable difference in average sizes between
irrigated and rainfed farms. Except for a few small cattle ranches in the
area, livestock is of the backyard type and roam freely to forage. The
overall livestock numbers are not large enough to cause severe overgrazing.
2.08      Existing Reforestation Activities.  NIA has successfully planted
and maintained a number of different species on about 2,000 ha of the
watershed area over the past two years. The other major reforestation
effort is being conducted by BFD under the Philippines-Japan Technical
Cooperation Project which started in 1977. The project involves the
construction of two nurseries, reforestation of about 8,100 ha and
construction of about 125 km of forest roads over the period 1977-82. About
2,600 ha of reforestation and 75 km of roads were due to be completed by the
end of 1979. The project also involves the construction of a center for the
training of forestry technical staff. The Government of Japan is expected
to provide vehicles, equipment, fertilizers, audio-visual aids and the
services of technical experts.
Magat Watershed
2.09      General.  The Magat watershed, with an area of about 414,300 ha,
not including the proposed reservoir of 4,900 ha, is much larger and more
complex than the Pantabangan watershed. It is located in Northern Luzon and
occupies parts of the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya, Ifugao and Isabela. The
watershed encompasses three principal mountain systems of Northern Luzon:
the Mamparang mountains on the east, the Caraballo mountains on the south,
and the Cordillera mountains on the west. The proposed Magat dam, being
constructed with Bank assistance (Loan 1567-PH), is at the eastern fringe of
the Cordillera range, in the province of Isabela, about 350 km northeast of
Manila (Map No. 14585). The watershed is transversed by the concrete
surfaced Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway and is connected by all weather
gravel roads to the neighboring Benguet, Ifugao and Mountain provinces.
The terrain in the watershed varies from broad flat cultivated plains along
the main river valleys to high mountain ridges under primary forest and
reaching elevations in excess of 1,000 m above sea level. At 70 people per
sq km, population density in the watershed is twice as high as at
Pantabangan, although only about half the national average.



- 9 -
2.10      Climate.  The climate of the Magat area has no pronounced maximum
rainy season and only a slight dry period lasting from one to three months.
Average annual precipitation varies from less than 2,000 mm in the lowest
elevations of the watershed to over 4,000 mm in the Central Cordillera
mountains on the western edge of the watershed. The estimated average annual
rainfall for the watershed is 2,500 mm. The heaviest precipitation is
recorded in the months of June through November, accounting for 73% of the
average annual rainfall. November is the wettest month with 18% of the yearly
precipitation. Monthly variations in temperature are small, the average high
in May is 36.40C and the average low in January is 19.40C. The watershed is
within the tropical storm belt, and on average three typhoons per annum
pass through the area. September is the month of greatest danger (Table 2.4).

2.11      Topography and Soils.  The topography of the watershed can be clas-
sified into four distinct types: (a) the flat to undulating lowlands; (b) the
Mamparang mountains and the Palali range; (c) the Central Cordillera mountain
system; and (d) the Caraballo mountains. The lowlands, in the south-central
part of the watershed, are oriented in a south-west to northeast direction and
include some scattered low lying hills. The Mamparang mountains and the
Palali range are in a late to mature stage of topographic development,
characterized by moderate relief. The area is highly dissected and the ridge
tops and mountain peaks are relatively broad and somewhat rounded with average
skyline elevations between 700 and 1,000 m. The Central Cordillera mountain
system, whose ridges are oriented roughly north-south, constitutes the bulk of
the watershed. In the Banaue area, the characteristic topography is rela-
tively rugged and of high relief with peaks and ridges exceeding 1,000 m
above sea level. The valleys are deeply incised and V-shaped and cascades,
gorges, and waterfalls are frequent. Areas west and north of Banaue close to
the drainage divide, show higher relief and extremely rugged topography.
Valleys are sharply V-shaped and ridges and peaks reach elevations exceeding
1,700 m above sea level. The Caraballo mountains form the southern and
southwestern fringes of the watershed. Apparently in its early to middle
stage of maturity, the landform development is rugged. High relief, coupled
with peaks reaching more than 1,400 m above sea level, are characteristic.
Cascades and waterfalls are abundant, particularly in the upper reaches of
most streams. Soils in the watershed are very diverse and highly weathered.
Seventeen soil series, one soil complex and 33 soil types have been
identified. Surface soils range from gravels to clay.
2.12      Erosion.  Severe to excessive erosion has occurred on approximately
83% of the watershed. The major causes are fire, over-grazing, uncontrolled
logging, shifting cultivation, and high intensity rainfall on unprotected
land. In 1977 uncontrolled fires occurred on about 130,000 ha or 30% of the
total watershed area. In the planning studies for the Magat dam, the sediment
yield from the watershed at the damsite was estimated at 8.5 million tons/year
(2,050 tons/sq km/year).
2.13      Land Use.  The forest areas of the watershed have been subjected
to excessive logging, carried out with little attention to conservation
principles. Ranchers operating on the extensive cogon grasslands of the
watershed practice uncontrolled stocking, continuous grazing and uncontrolled
burning. In many cases land with sLopes in excess of 50% is being grazed. On
much of the grazing land most of the soil has been removed by erosion. The
irrigated and rainfed rice land is found on the alluvial flats bordering the
Magat river, while the terraced rice land is located on the steep hillsides in
the northern part of the watershed around Banaue. Shifting cultivation is
found on the steep slopes along the southern, eastern and northern edges of
the watershed.  Kaingin farms are typically between 2 and 4 ha.  After rough
clearing and burning the land is cropped to upland rice, corn and sweet potato
for a period of two to three years. The land is then abandoned because of
loss of fertility and competition from cogon grass.

2.14      Population.  The 1975 population of the watershed was about 293,000
people or about 50,000 households. The annual rate of population growth over
the 1965-1975 decade was 2.2%; slightly below the national average. The
population is predominantly rural and farming activities account for about 77%
of the gainfully employed. People who speak Ilocano as a mother tongue
predominate in the more fertile southern half of the watershed, where they
account for 65% of the population. The less densely populated northern part
of the watershed is wholly an Ifugao speaking area.
2.15      Existing Reforestation Activities.  The Bureau of Forest Development
has been engaged over a long period in a significant tree planting program.
A wide variety of species has been planted. Included are: giant ipil-ipil,
benguet pine, large leaf mahogany, narra, yemane, albizzia and teak.
According to BFD records there are about 11,000 ha of established plan-
tations scattered throughout the watershed. This is a small area considering
the rate of destruction of the forest cover of the watershed and that the
program was started in 1938. It is estimated that only about 30% of the
reported hectarage is an effective planted area because of the fire damage.

2.16      Magat Pilot Reforestation Area.  The area, comprising 7,500 ha of
steep and open cogon grassland, lies immediately upstream of the Magat dam
site on both banks of the proposed reservoir (Map No. 14631). The land is
generally steep and rugged with most of it having slopes greater than 40%.
Elevations range from 200 m at the reservoir waterline to 500 m at the highest
point. The area has an eastfacing slope which is dissected deeply by V-shaped
streams and gullies that drain into the Magat and Alimit rivers. Soils in the
area are shallow (25-85 cm), with restricted internal drainage, and moderately
acidic with pHs ranging from 5.3 to 6.3. The proposed pilot project area is
not inhabited, but there are settlements along its southern border engaged in
subsistence farming of open patches of logged over forest land which would
provide the population to work on and benefit from the project. The 1975
population in the area was about 7,300, comprising about 1,645 families.
Between 1970 and 1975, the population grew at an annual growth rate of 3.1%,
marginally above the annual national growth rate of 2.8% over the same period.
According to NIA surveys in 1979, almost 95% of the people in the area get
their primary source of income from farming and the rest from employment as
laborers with the government. The average per capita income in 1979 was
US$100, with almost 85% of households having average annual per capita incomes
less than US$155. The average farm size is about 2.4 ha.
2.17      BFD Pilot Protection Area.  The pilot component would be carried out
in two trial areas, Sta. Fe at the southern end of the Magat watershed in
Nueva Vizcaya province and Dona Remedios Trinidad in Bulacan province. Of the
forest district area of Sta. Fe, almost one half, i.e. 72,000 ha would fall
under the project. Of this, approximately 50% is commercially forested, 23%
is open land or grassland and the remaining 27% is land covered by non-
commercial shrubs and trees. Living in small scattered villages within this
forest land are some 520 subsistence farmer families of whom more than 50%
belong to cultural minorities (Igorots and Ilongots), the remainder being
Filipino ethnic settlers who have moved in from the lowlands. A large
proportion of the ethnic minority populace practices shifting cultivation
within the forest areas. In places where potential agricultural land is
scarce forest land is occupied and temporarily cultivated also by the
settlers. The forest district of Dona Remedios Trinidad, which covers some
55,000 ha of rugged forest land, would fall under the project in its entirety.
Most of the district used to be commercial forest but after logging in the
1950s and 1960s it has ceased to be productive forest. Living in this forest
land are some 260 families of which one-third are indigenous tribes (Dumagats)
and two-thirds settlers. Both groups depend heavily on the cultivation of
their kaingin areas. In 1976, a pilot forest occupancy management project
was started in the area. The response of the people to the project has been
positive but progress toward stabilization of agricultural plots and farmer
homes has been modest due to lack of adequate project funding.
3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The project proposed for Bank financing would include:
(a)  reforestation with agro-forestry and timber crops of about
24,600 ha in the Pantabangan watershed and a pilot program of
about 7,500 ha in the Magat watershed including the construction
of nurseries;



- 14 -
(b) construction and maintenance of about 345 km of forest roads in
Pantabangan and about 65 km in Magat;
(c) construction of charcoal ovens for conversion of fuelwood to
charcoal in both watersheds;
(d) provision of equipment and vehicles for forest protection and fire
prevention in both areas;
(e) provision of consulting services for assistance in installing a
system of commercial accounting, reforestation and marketing
operations, for establishment of revenue and profit sharing
procedures, and for study of the feasibility of spinning off the
project as a subsidiary of NIA;
(f) provision of consulting services to carry out a feasibility
study of integrated development of the Magat watershed;
(g) implementation of pilot programs in range management and
smallholder agroforestry in the Magat watershed; and
(h) initiation of integrated forest protection pilot programs
in the Magat watershed and in Bulacan province in Central Luzon.
Reforestation
3.02      Grasslands and unbenched lands presently under agriculture, includ-
ing hillside cultivation which are about 5% slope, would be planted to trees.
About 24,600 ha of such lands in the Pantabangan watershed would be planted
with a mix of forest and agro-forest species which would provide both a quick
financial return three to ten years from planting, from products such as
leafmeal, charcoal, fruits and nuts, and a long-term return, 20 to 40 years
after planting, from timber. After considering factors such as site suit-
ability and adaptability, erosion control capability, marketability, magni-
tude and timing of financial returns, employment generation, and fire risk,
the following species were chosen:
Species                         Product                    Ha

About 1,600 ha would be planted in 1980 and about 3,500 ha annually thereafter
from 1981 to 1987. The detailed plantation schedule by species is presented
in Annex 1, Table 1.  The projected seedling requirement, including
allowances for cull and mortality, would average about 2.8 million seedlings
annually from 1980 to 1983, increasing to about 8.5 million seedlings in
1985 and 1986 and dropping, thereafter, to about 2.5 million seedlings
annually (Annex 1, Table 3). At present there are two nurseries in
the Pantabangan watershed which could each produce between two to three
million seedlings annually. However, an additional nursery with an annual
capacity of about 3 million seedlings would have to be built immediately
since a part of the project area is at considerable distance from the
existing nurseries. In addition, temporary field sheds, each serving a
planting area between 350 to 600 ha, would be constructed to house men on
field work, store tools and materials, and ease logistics during planting.
3.03      The 7,500 ha of steep grassland in the Magat watershed would also
be planted with a mix of agroforestry and timber species. The main
objective would be to illustrate on a pilot scale, while gaining experience
in the process, the viability of a reforestation program in the Magat
watershed. The species mix would be as follows:
Species                         Product                      Ha
Giant ipil-ipil                  charcoal                  1,000
Agoho                               "                        500
Mimosa                              "                        500
Mango                            fruit                       950
Cashew                          nuts                       1,500
Yemane                       pulpwood and timber             600
Benguet pine                    t"    "i                   1,450

Mahogany /a                      timber                      500
Total Physical Area                                      7,500
/a   In addition, Mahogany would be interplanted in stands of
Giant ipil-ipil, Agoho and Mimosa.
The detailed plantation schedule by species is shown in Annex 1, Table 2.
Seedling requirements are expected to be about 2.0 million in 1980,
increasing to about 3.5 million seedlings in 1984 and then falling to about
1.8 million seedlings in 1986 (Annex 1, Table 4). A nursery would be
constructed under the project to meet these requirements. Field sheds would
also be constructed for every 350-600 ha of planting area.

3.04      Nursery operations for the incoming season would start in August
with repairs, hauling of soil and sowing continuing through October.
Potting of seedlings, seedling care and maintenance, including fertilizer
application, would continue through January. Transportation of seedlings to
the seedling depots would start in April. Planting areas would be surveyed
well before the planting period. Stripbrushing would be done to minimize
early weed competition and to facilitate hole digging, which would be done
at appropriately spaced points along cleared rows ahead of outplanting.
Seedling transport from nursery to field sheds would be done by pick-up,
while laborers would transport the seedlings from the sheds for outplanting.
Tree planting operations would start in late May or early June when the soil
would be sufficiently moist, and would be completed by early August to allow
enough time for the seedlings to get established before the onset of the dry
season. Kakawate, a fire and drought resistant species, would be planted to
serve as a firebreak to augment the effects of fire lanes and roads. Due to
the low nutrient status of soils in the project area, the use of fertilizer
would be important to ensure seedling survival and the attainment of
expected rates of growth. Fertilizer would be applied during outplanting,
during weeding about three months later and at early and late parts of the
rainy season the following year.
3.05      Timber species would have a minimum of three weeding operations
during the growing period. Ring weeding would be scheduled with fertilizing
to minimize costs. Fruit species would be ring weeded twice a year until
the crown cover would be sufficient to suppress weed growth. Problems with
pests and diseases are not serious today but could become significant in the
future. While use of insecticides and fungicides is not crucial for forest
species, it is essential for fruit crops such as mango and cashew to prevent
crop failure. In addition, flower induction by chemicals would be used to
prolong the fruiting period of mangoes and to take advantage of high
off-season prices. To minimize fire damage in the early years when the
original grass vegetation would be present, 20 meter wide firebreaks would
be constructed.
3.06      Harvesting of the reforested area would be undertaken as part of the
project. The project would rely on the responsiveness and versatility of the
private sector middlemen to transport and market the products of the project
areas. At some future date, when production has built up substantially,
investment in processing, transport or marketing of the products would be
evaluated and undertaken if found profitable. Harvested mangoes, unshelled
cashews, sun dried ipil-ipil leaves and timber would be sold to middlemen and
traders at plantation site. The fuelwood would be converted to charcoal in
the project area and then sold to middlemen. The project would provide for
charcoal centers strategically located so as to reduce transport costs within
the hilly and rough terrain of the project areas and to provide easy access to
water to minimize fire risks. A charcoal center would consist of nine ovens,
of the Brazilian beehive type each with a capacity of 50 cu m. There would be



- 17 -
15 charcoal centers in Pantabangan and 6 in Magat. Wood would be air-dried
for three to four months to a moisture content of 30% to 40% prior to loading
in the ovens, where carbonization would be completed in about four days.
Forest Road Construction and Fire Protection
3.07      About 150 km of forest roads exist in the Pantabangan project area
while there are none in Magat. About 95 km of primary forest roads and about
250 km of secondary roads would be constructed in Pantabangan, and about 40 km
of primary forest roads and 25 km of secondary forest roads would be built in
Magat (Annex 1, Table 5). The roads would provide access for workers and
materials during establishment, maintenance, protection and harvesting
operations. All roads would be constructed with the minimum amount of
earthworks, and the alignment would follow ridges whenever possible to avoid
heavy side cutting and thus minimize erosion. Particular attention would be
paid to drainage, drainage protection works and to the stabilization of side
slopes. The roads would be gravel surfaced, would be designed purely for
access and would have a pavement width of 4 meters and no shoulders. The
proposed design standards for the roads are shown in Annex 1, Table 6.
Sections of side drains, culvert outfalls, etc. would be protected against
erosion by lining with concrete blocks or grouted rip rap. Cross drainage
would be by concrete pipe culverts. Surveys have been completed for 42 km of
the first year's program and detailed design is almost complete for these
sections. Sources of alluvial gravel suitable for extraction of material for
pavement basecourse and concrete aggregates have been located in the project
areas. Provision would be made for equipment and workshop facilities for the
maintenance of the roads. The project would also provide for a forest
protection and fire control system which would consist of mobile patrol and
fire suppression crews, fire stations, look-out towers, communication
equipment, firefighting equipment and construction of fire lanes. In the case
of Pantabangan, the fire control system would be capable of dealing with the
whole watershed, including areas reforested under the Philippine-Japan
Technical Cooperation Project.
Administrative and Support Facilities
3.08      While the project would be able to make use of some of the
existing NIA facilities at Pantabangan and Magat, additional buildings would
be required. Provision would be made at Pantabangan for an administration
office, a workshop/motorpool, 25 detached staff cottages, 14 duplex staff
cottages and three staff dormitories, each with a capacity of 150 beds. A
clinic and ambulance would be provided to meet the health needs of the large
labor force. At Magat provision would be made for temporary buildings as
the project would be able to utilize at a later date the excellent
facilities built at the damsite for construction of the dam.
Magat Feasibility StudV and Pilot Programs
3.09      Because of its size, variety of environments and large population,
the Magat watershed presents problems of a far more complex nature than
Pantabangan. The proposed project would therefore include provisions for a
feasibility study of the catchment leading to a plan for the development of



- 18 -
selected critical subcatchments of the watershed. The study would include
basic data gathering, in depth studies of hydrology and sediment monitoring,
range management studies and development of land use systems to stabilize
shifting cultivators. The objective of the hydrology and sediment
monitoring program would be to identify the critical subwatersheds which
would be the priority areas for development. A striking difference between
the Magat and Pantabangan catchments is the heavy grazing of cattle in
Magat. Commercial ranching and related grass fires are major sources of
soil erosion. Range management studies would provide basic data on which to
develop a range management program adaptable to the characteristics and
restraints of the Magat catchment. The studies would include grass species
trials, grazing trials on improved and natural ranges, rotational grazing
trials and a census of the animal population. The studies would also
provide for the implementation of range management and smallholder
agroforestry pilot programs in the watershed. These would be implemented
concurrently with the studies and would assist in assessing the viability of
various approaches to solving the problems of the watershed. An area of
about 2,000 ha of shifting cultivation has been identified for
implementation of the smallholder pilot program. The complex land ownership
and land use patterns in Magat are likely to require a management system
involving several Government agencies working closely together toward a
common objective. The studies would be expected to provide answers as to
the best means of obtaining'such an integrated approach to dealing with
development of the Magat watershed. The project would provide for
consulting services, vehicles and equipment for the studies. Assurances
were obtained that consultants satisfactory to the Bank would be engaged
to assist with the studies under terms and conditions agreed with the Bank.
The studies would begin in early 1981 and be completed at the end of 1983.
Forest Protection Pilot Component
3.10      This component has already been developed to a stage where
preliminary plans are completed and the organization is well defined. The
project would provide for the detailed planning and implementation by the
Bureau of Forest Development of a three-year pilot operation in which forest
occupancy (kaingin) management, forest guarding, forest fire control, and
watershed rehabilitation would be considered in an integrated effort. The
component, which would take place in two trial areas in the Magat watershed
and Bulacan province, would comprise the settling of 300 forest occupant
families including improvement of their farms and provision of social
services; guarding of some 127,000 ha of forest land; fire control over
27,000 ha of forest area prone to annual fires; vegetative rehabilitation of
about 800 ha of denuded, erodable land and construction of soil erosion
control structures in critical locations; construction and maintenance of 20
km of roads and a network of 220 km of access trails; and provisions for
buildings, vehicles and equipment for BFD staff implementing these works.
Provision would be made for consultant assistance to help BFD plan and
implement the project and to develop and install an intensive monitoring and
evaluation system for the duration of implementation. As part of the pilot
component farm models would be developed designed to uplift the socio-
economic status of forest occupants and a forest protection mechanism
compatible with the models would be devised. Information on the costs and
benefits of this integrated forest protection program would be generated to



- 19 -
demonstrate the economic justification for its replication on a larger scale
and in many locations. Provision would also be made for consultant assistance
to carry out special studies in the third year of the implementation of the
pilot component aimed at synthesizing the collective experience from the
component. Assurances were obtained that consultants satisfactory to the
Bank would be engaged to assist BFD in the planning, implementation, monitor-
ing and special studies aspects of the pilot component under terms and condi-
tions to be agreed with the Bank. Preparation within six months of loan
signature of a detailed plan of operations and implementation schedule would
be a condition of loan disbursement for the forest protection pilot component
of the project. If successful, the component would allow for preparation in
its third year of larger follow-up projects of similar nature. Provisions for
such preparatory work are included in the project.
Cost Estimates
3.11      Planting operations would proceed up to the eighth year of
operation. However, in the latter years annual revenues from some of the
products would cover a substantial part of the annual investment needs. A
reasonable time-frame for the definition of the Bank project would be six
years since (a) the bulk of plantation establishment would be accomplished
over this period, (b) such a period would provide an opportunity for the
Bank to review decisions regarding processing, profit sharing, and the
ultimate organizational format of the project implementation unit which
would have to be taken by the Government towards the end of the six-year
period. Therefore, the project represents the initial six years of the
program costing about US$75.0 million, of which US$27.0 million or 36% is
foreign exchange. Cost estimates are based on actual costs for similar
nursery and planting operations in the two watersheds, detailed surveys of
42 km of roads in Pantabangan, equal to 10% of the proposed roads, and
feasibility grade estimates for the rest, adjusted to mid-1980 prices and to
conditions prevailing in the project areas. Unit prices for equipment,
materials and supplies are based on recent quotations received by NIA and
BFD. The Government exempts NIA and BFD from paying taxes or duties for
equipment, materials and services procured under foreign-assisted projects,
so all costs exclude such taxes. A physical contingency of 15% was used for
the roads due to the difficult and hilly terrain while 10% was used for the
rest of the works. Costs due to expected price increases over the
implementation period amount to about 28% of the total base cost plus
physical contingencies, assuming the following annual inflation rates for
civil works, equipment and services:
ANNUAL INFLATION RATE (%)

Financing
3.13      The proposed Bank loan of US$38 million would cover 50% of the total
project costs and finance the full foreign exchange cost of the project and
about 23% of the local project costs. The Government would provide the
remaining P 273.8 million (US$37.0 million) to NIA and BFD and other
concerned agencies from annual budget appropriations.
Procurement
3.14      Equipment, vehicles, and spare parts costing about US$9.1 million,
would be procured after international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank Group Guidelines. A preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of
imported goods, or the customs duty, whichever is lower would be extended to
local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids.  Local procurement practices
are appropriate for off-the-shelf items costing less than US$20,000 each
because the advantages of international competitive bidding would be clearly
outweighed by the administrative costs involved. The total cost of such
items for all components of the project would not exceed US$500,000. Bank
staff have reviewed local procedures and they are acceptable. There is
adequate competition and foreign firms can participate. A list of equipment
requirements is given in Annex 1, Table 7.
3.15      Construction of about 160 km of forest roads totalling about
US$4.0 million, and civil works (offices, staff quarters, workshops)
totalling US$2.3 million, are not suitable for international competitive
bidding since the works are scattered and small in size. These would be
carried out by contract under competitive bidding in accordance with local
procedures. Bank staff have reviewed the local procedures and they are
acceptable. There is potentially adequate competition and foreign firms can
participate. The construction over six years of implementation of about 250
km of forest access roads in the more inaccessible parts of the Pantabangan
watershed, amounting to about US$2.5 million, would be carried out by force
account.
Disbursements
3.16      Disbursements would be made at a rate of 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of directly imported equipment or 100% of the ex-factory price
of locally manufactured goods and 65% for imported goods procured locally.
Disbursements for civil works, plantation establishment, road maintenance
and forest protection and fire control would be 45% of certified monthly
progress payments or expenditures. Disbursements for force account work
amounting to US$30.6 million would be made against certificates of
expenditure, the documentation for works would show the quantities of major
items of works accomplished, and the expenditure would be based on agreed
unit rates. NIA and BFD would submit a detailed unit rate analysis with
supporting documents for Bank review before December 31, 1980, and whenever
any change in the unit rate is desired.



- 25 -
For the NIA component, disbursement for minor contracts (less than P 1
million) would also be made against certificates of expenditure based on
actual payments made to the contractors. The borrower would make available
all documents related to the force account expenditure and expenditure under
minor contracts for inspection by the Bank's supervision missions. The
project offices of the implementing agencies have the staffing and institu-
tional capability to provide such documentation in a satisfactory manner
(Annex 3). For consulting services, disbursements would be at a rate of
100% of total costs.
3.17      It is expected that disbursements would be completed by December 31,
1987, approximately one year after completion of the project. An estimated
schedule of expenditure, a semiannual disbursement schedule, and a proposed
allocation of loan proceeds are given in Annex 1, Tables 9-11.
Accounts and Audit
3.18      NIA and BFD are Government agencies and their accounts are audited
annually by the Government's Commission on Audit. Assurances were obtained
that the implementing agencies would maintain separate accounts for the
project and that after audit by the Commission on Audit, the project
accounts, together with the auditor's comments and opinion on the certifica-
tion of expenditure for force account work and for minor contracts, would be
sent to the Bank within six months of the close of each financial year.
Environmental Effects
3.19      The project is expected to have wholly beneficial effects on the
environment through limitation of uncontrolled burning, reduction of erosion
of the watershed, minimization of flash floods, and enhancement of the
productive capacity of the land.
4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      By Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 1002 of March 20, 1980, the
National Irrigation Administration was given the authority to manage, protect
and rehabilitate the areas of the Pantabangan and Mfagat watersheds included
in the project (Maps No. 14583 and No. 14631). The LOI also gave NIA the
authority to harvest timber and agro-forestry products from the project
areas.
4.02      The National Irrigation Administration would be the implementing
agency for the project in the Pantabangan watershed and for the pilot
reforestation program in the Magat watershed. NIA was established under
Republic Act No. 3601 in 1964 to investigate, study, improve, construct and
administer all national irrigation systems. Presidential Decree No. 552 of
September 11, 1974 further widened NIA's scope by giving it "broader powers
and authority to undertake concomitant projects such as flood control,



- 26 -
drainage, land reclamation, hydraulic power development, domestic water
supply, road or highway construction, reforestation and projects to maintain
ecological balance, in coordination with the agencies concerned". The
Government finances NIA through the sale of bonds or from appropriations. The
agency is presided over by a board of directors; the Administrator, who is
appointed by the President of the Philippines, is responsible for operations
and management. NIA has gained very considerable experience in tree nursery
and planting operations over the last few years in both the Pantabangan and
Magat catchments. The agency also has excellent engineering, design and
construction capability for roads and civil works.
4.03      Responsibility for implementation of the project in the Pantabangan
and Magat catchments would be with a Project Director who would report to the
NIA Assistant Administrator for Project Development and Implementation (Figure
4.1). Under the Project Director would be two Resident Managers, one at
Pantabangan and the other at Magat. The Project Director would be assisted by
a small managerial and technical staff. The Resident Managers would have
under them the Plantation, Maintenance and Transportation, and Processing
Divisions. The appointment of a qualified and capable Project Director would
be essential for successful project implementation. The management of the
large number of technical staff and labor, the wide range of project
activities and the tight timetables would require a person with considerable
managerial capability and experience. NIA has appointed a suitably qualifed
senior agricultural engineer as Project Director. Assurances were obtained
that NIA would afford the Bank an opportunity to comment on any new
appointment to the post during the period of project implementation.
4.04      Since the project would be profit oriented, it would be operated
on a commercial basis. A commercial accounting system would be installed
and detailed records of assets, costs and revenues by product would be
maintained. The Assistant Administrator for Administration and the Head of
the Accounting Department of NIA have indicated that there would be no
problems in the installation of a commercial system of accounting, and that
it would be consistent with NIA rules and regulations. Commission on Audit
(COA) officials concurred with NIA and are of the opinion that introduction
of a commercial system of accounting for the project would not be inconsist-
ent with the Government's accounting and auditing rules and regulations.
Assurances were obtained that NIA, in consultation with the COA, would
institute a commercial accounting system for the project acceptable to the
Bank by December 31, 1980.
4.05      Field crop agriculture would be restricted to land of 5% or less
average slope, unless the land is bench terraced. Existing benched,
vegetable producing areas in the Diayo and Canili watersheds would continue
operating but any expansion would be strictly controlled. Grazing of family
livestock belonging to local inhabitants would be permitted in designated
areas. The number of animals would be strictly controlled and stall feeding
would be encouraged. About 100,000 seedlings of mango, breadfruit,
jackfruit, guava, etc. would be provided free for planting in house lots and
around the villages to the residents of the Pantabangan project area.



- 27 -
4.06      Influx of population into the watershed would have to be regulated
so that the total population does not exceed the capacity of the project to
provide an adequate livelihood. With uncontrolled migration, people would
overuse the land and defeat the purpose of the project. NIA would control the
influx of people into the project area by a system of registration which would
give priority for employment to the existing residents. A 100l socioeconomic
census is currently being uandertaken and is expected to be finished by
mid-1980. The forest protection staff would be responsible for preventing the
clearing of land for hillside agriculture or uncontrolled grazing of cattle.
The control of population influx, of land use, and of fires would be extremely
difficult and prohibitively expensive to implement without the active
cooperation of the local population. The project would attempt to ensure such
cooperation by giving the people of the watershed a permanent and better
livelihood. Existing tree planting campaigns, by offering employment only for
planting are, in fact, providing the local population with an incentive to
destroy the seedlings in order to get more employment. To avoid a vicious
circle of plant-burn-plant, the resident population must have a stake in the
survival of the planted seedlings. This would be accomplished by providing
the people of Pantabangan not only with a labor income, but by associating
them with the financial profits of the project. Initially, a revenue sharing
scheme would be adopted since the project is not expected to generate a profit
till the eighth year of operation. A certain percentage or a fixed amount of
gross revenues would be distributed to the employees starting in the third
year of operation. Such an early distribution of revenues is important to
gain the confidence of the people in the area and to impress on them the
personal advantages to be derived by making the project successful. An
assurance was obtained that NIA would submit for Bank review by December 31,
1982, a plan for sharing revenues in the Pantabangan project area and
implement it by June 30, 1983. One year before project completion date NIA
would prepare a profit sharing scheme to take the place of the revenue
sharing scheme. The profit sharing scheme would take into consideration a
fair share for the employees and a fair return on the capital investment of
NIA. An assurance was obtained that NIA would prepare such a profit sharing
scheme for Bank review by June 30, 1985, and implement it by December 31,
1985. In addition to the individual incentive schemes outlined above,
communal incentives would be provided by assigning a portion of the revenues
or profits to the villages for projects such as scholarships, communal water
supplies, playgrounds, etc. to be chosen by the communities in consultation
with NIA. The size of communal Lncentives would depend on the forest
protection and fire prevention performances of the various communities.
4.07      In view of the importance of informing and involving the
Pantabangan population in the project, provision would be made for a strong
Public Information and Community Development Division (PICDD) reporting
directly to the Project Director,, The Division would keep the local people
fully informed about the project, especially the aspects of employment,
profit sharing, the need to protect the reforested areas, and the



- 28 -
substantial benefits to be derived from the project for individuals and
communities. People displaced by the Pantabangan reservoir have become
accustomed to receiving help from the Government without much effort on
their own. The Division would make clear to the residents that the project
was not just another welfare program but an opportunity for gainful employment
leading to a substantial stake in the future in partnership with NIA. The
Division would include trained sociologists to establish meaningful channels
of communication between the local communities and the Project Director.
The Division would also help the communities define the type of projects
which they would wish to carry out with the portion of profits assigned to
communal benefits.
4.08      A reforestation program and construction of a training facility are
being undertaken by BFD in one section of the Pantabangan watershed under the
provisions of the Philippines-Japan Technical Cooperation Project. An
assurance was obtained that by December 31, 1980, NIA and BFD would sign a
memo of understanding defining their respective roles in the Pantabangan
watershed. The memo would pay particular attention to setting out: (a)
BFD's role in terms of providing technical services for nursery and planting
operations, (b) NIA's access to the training facilities and programs carried
out by BFD in the watershed, and (c) NIA's role in providing a joint fire
protection service for both the proposed project and the BFD project.
4.09      The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) would be respon-
sible for coordinating the preparation of the Magat Watershed Feasibility
Study and the implementation of the range management and smallholder
agroforestry pilot projects. Under the supervision of NEDA, the relevant
Government agencies and ministries would prepare the report to deal with the
problems of the watershed. NEDA would also designate the appropriate agencies
to prepare plans for and to implement the two pilot projects.
4.10      The Forest Protection and Infrastructure Division (FPID) of BFD
would be responsible for the detailed planning and implementation of the
Forest Protection Pilot Component. It would be carried out within the
framework of BFD's existing district, regional and central organization.
The Chief of FPID would oversee project implementation with the assistance
of a small project monitoring and evaluation group, which would have to be
established. Day to day implementation would be the responsibility of the
two District Foresters concerned, with the respective Regional Directors
fulfilling administrative roles. In its third year the component would
employ 25 professionals, mostly foresters, about 80 technician level staff
and about 150 permanently employed labor. Most of the required pro-
fessionals and technicians are already employed by BFD in the regional
or district offices and would only need to be reassigned, although some
new recruitment would be necessary. About 16 specialists from other
Government agencies, including possibly the Development Bank of the
Philippines (DBP), would be called upon to make their services available to
the settled forest occupants.

Consulting Services and Technical Assistance
4.11      The project would provide for about 170 man-months of local consult-
ing services to assist NIA in (1) the installation of a commercial, management
information and accounting system; (2) the design and installation of a
revenue-sharing scheme initially, and a profit-sharing scheme later; (3) the
spinning off of the project unit as a commercial subsidiary of NIA and the
design of an equity-sharing scheme which would allow the employees to own
shares in it; and (4) nursery, planting and marketing operations for both
watersheds. For the preparation of the Magat Watershed Feasibility Study and
two pilot projects, it is estimated that about 150 man-months of local and
about 100 man-months of expatriate consulting services would be required.
Consulting services would also be provided to assist BFD in (1) detailed
planning of the Forest Protection Pilot Component; (2) monitoring of the
implementation of the component; and (3) special evaluation studies to prepare
a follow-on project. It is estimated that about 53 man-months of local and 7
man-months of expatriate consulting services would be required. The local
consulting service. are expected to cost about US$3,500 per man-month and
expatriate services about US$10,000 per man-month. The latter overall cost
per man-month would consist of a billing rate (including home office overhead)
of US$8,000 per man-month, international travel expenses of US$500 per
man-month, and local expenses of US$1,500 per man-month. Assurances were
obtained that all consultants engaged under the project would be employed
under terms of reference and under conditions acceptable to the Bank.
5. PRODUCTION
Present and Future Without Project
5.01      The areas to be reforeated under the project are open Imperata
grasslands, of very little Value and subject to frequent fires. The ensuing
erosion is rapidly reducing the productivity of the land. Without the
project, the land would continue to erode and to deteriorate and ultimately
become incapable of sustaining any vegetation. The end result would be the
increase of sediment in the reservoirs and the permanent loss of the produc-
tive capacity of the land.
Future With Project
5.02      The 24,600 ha in the Pantabangan watershed and the 7,500 ha in the
Magat watershed would be reforested with a mix of the following species:
Giant Ipil-ipil [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit]
Agoho (Casuarina equisitifolia)
Mimosa (Acacia auricolaeformis)



- 30 -
Mango (Mangifera indica, L.)
Cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.)
Yemane (Gmelina arborea Roxb.)
Benguet Pine (Pinus kesiva Royle)
Narra (Pterocarpus philippinenis)
Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King)
The hectarages and planting schedules are shown in Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2
and annual productions are shown in Annex 2, Tables 1 and 2.
Yields and Production
5.03      Leafmeal from Giant Ipil-ipil.  The varieties of Giant Ipil-ipil
that would be grown in the Pantabangan watershed for the production of leaf-
meal would be the Peruvian, Peruvian/Salvador cross and Hawaiian K 41
types. The varieties are adaptable to a wide range of soils and e?evations.
They do not tolerate soils of pH less than 5.0 and grow well up to elevations
of about 460 m. They are drought-resistant, but not adaptive to waterlogged
soils. Leaf yields range between 9 and 36 tons of dry matter per hectare in
the Philippines. Considering soil conditions and the climatic environment
of the watersheds, the following leaf yields are expected:
Year                             1        2         3          4        5 onwards
Yield (ton/ha dry matter)        -       6.0      11.0       13.0          15.0
Based on these yields and the proposed plantation schedule, annual leafmeal
production is expected to increase from 3,600 tons in 1981 to about 45,000
tons in 1988, to stabilize at that level up to 1999 and to decrease
subsequently.
5.04      Charcoal from Giant Ipil-ipil, Agoho and Mimosa.  Charcoal would
be produced in Pantabangan from fuelwood obtained from Giant Ipil-ipil. In
the case of Magat, charcoal would be produced from fuelwood obtained from a
mix of Giant Ipil-ipil, Agoho and Mimosa. The varieties of Giant Ipil-ipil
would be the Hawaiian Giants R8 and K28.  Agoho grows extremely fast on
rich, alluvial and well-drained soils. Early plantings and subsequent trials
in the Philippines indicate that it grows well in lower and dry sites, but



- 31 -
not on sites with elevations of 800 m above sea level. Mimosa is a recently
introduced species in the Philippines from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.
It has performed extremely well in most parts of the country, especially on
dry, rocky and shallow soils. It grows well in grasslands and is a good soil
builder. An evaluation of existing Ipil-ipil plantations shows that under
conditions in Pantabangan and Magat, the average projected height would be
about 11 meters at age 5. Based on this site quality indication and relevant
spacing, the following fuelwood yield would be expected:
Year:                 4       5         6        7        8         9        10
Yield (cu m/ha)      89      134       176      213      246       275      301
Based on trials in Magat, Mimosa is expected to have the same yield as Giant
Ipil-ipil. However, Agoho is expected to grow more slowly, to about 9 m in
height in 5 years. At this growth rate, the fuelwood yield from Agoho
is expected to be as follows:
Year:                  4       5        6        7        8         9        10
Yield (cu m/ha)       59      86       112      134      154       171      186
5.05      The fuelwood plantations would produce enough fuelwood for the
operation of 15 charcoal centers in Pantabangan and 6 in Magat. The annual
amount of fuelwood produced in Pantabangan would increase from 27,000 cu m
in 1984 to 135,000 cu m in 1988. This would be equivalent to an annual
production of 4,320 tons of charcoal in 1984 and 21,600 tons in 1988.
In Magat, annual charcoal production would increase from 4,320 tons in 1985
to 8,640 tons in 1988.
5.06      Mango.  The variety grown would be the "Carabao" mango which is
highly regarded in the domestic market and in Hong Kong and Japan. It grows
in a wide range of soil types and pH (5.5 to 8.0) but well-drained, loamy
soils give the best results. Half of the seedlings would be grown from seeds
and the rest would be propagated by grafting. The variety responds well to
fertilization; chemical spraying would be used to induce early flowering, and
appropriate insecticides and fungicides would be used for pest and disease
control. The average yield for the country is about 9.0 ton/ha, but small,
well-managed plantations on good soils yield up to 40 ton/ha. Based on soil
conditions in Pantabangan and Magat, the following mango fruit yields are
expected:



- 32 -
Year:                     6-7           8-9           10-14           15 onwards
Yield (ton/ha)            6.7          10.0           16.7               20.0
On the basis of these yields and the planting schedule, annual production in
Pantabangan is expected to increase from 2,670 tons in 1986 to about 40,000
tons in 1999. In the case of Magat, annual mango production is estimated to
rise from 4,160 tons in 1987 to about 18,715 tons in 1997.
5.07      Cashew.  The tree is native to Northwestern Brazil where the
climate has a distinct wet and dry season. It grows well in regions with
an annual rainfall as low as 50 mm but also thrives under conditions of much
higher precipitation if the soils are well drained. A climate with distinct
wet and dry periods is favored for production. Cashew does well on soils
which are too poor or too dry for other crops and it has been known to
respond profitably to fertilization in India. It is a hardy tree and survives
the attack of diseases, pests and animals and attacks from anthracnose fungus
can be controlled by fungicide sprays. On the basis of conditions in
Pantabangan and Magat, the following yields of raw nuts are expected:
Year:            1-3      4-6           7-9           10-14           15 onwards
Yield (ton/ha)    -       0.9           2.0            2.2                2.5
Based on these yields and the planting schedule, annual raw nut production
in Pantabangan is estimated to increase from 540 tons in 1984 to about 7,500
tons in 1999.  At Magat, annual production is expected to rise from 445 tons
in 1984 to 3,750 tons in 1996.
5.08      Pulpwood and Timber from Yemane.  Yemane, a species introduced
from the Sudan and Fiji, grows extremely fast on rich, alluvial, well-drained
soils. Early plantings and subsequent trials have indicated that it grows
well in low and dry sites, but not on very dry ridges with shallow soil.
It does not grow at elevations above 800 m. Due to poor soil conditions in
Pantabangan and Magat, plantings of Yemane are expected to have lower yields
than in other parts of the country such as Cebu. The anticipated yield is as
follows:



- 33 -
Year:                        7     8      9    10    11    12    13    14    15
Yield (cu m/ha)
Short-fiber pulpwood    43    48    53    58    61    63    65    66    67
Timber                     9    11    13    15    17    20    23    26    29
Total                 52    59    66    73    78    83    88    92    96
Based on these yields, the planting schedule, and the harvesting of about
440 ha annually in Pantabangan, starting in 1989, the production of short-
fiber pulpwood would range between 20,120 cu m and 26,840 cu m annually over
the period 1989 to 1998. Production of timber would range between 4,440 cu m
to 7,480 cu m annually over the same period. At Magat, about 85 ha would be
harvested annually starting in 1990, yielding short-fiber pulpwood production
ranging from 3,655 cu m to 5,525 cu m annually over the period 1990-96.
Production of timber would range betwen 765 cu m and 1,955 cu m annually over
the same period.
5.09      Pulpwood and Timber from Benguet Pine.  Benguet Pine is indigenous
to the Philippines and is used for reforestation of grassland. It grows in
a wide range of soil types and on elevations above 1,000 m. Although its
natural range goes below 400 m, the form and rate of growth falls off consi-
derably at elevations below 1,000 m. Under Pantabangan and Magat conditions,
the following yields are expected:
Year:                   13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22   23   24   25
Yield (cu m/ha)
Long-fiber pulpwood  55  55  55  55  55  55  55  57  57  57   56   56   56
Timber                14  17  20  23  26  29  32  34  37  40   44   47   50
Total              64  72  75  78  81  84  87  91  94  97  100  103  106
Based on these yields, the planting schedule, and the harvesting of about
325 ha annually in Pantabangan starting in 1992, production of long-fiber
pulpwood would range between 17,875 tons to 18,525 tons annually between 1992
to 2011.  Production of timber would range between 4,500 cu m and 17,225 cu m
over the same period. In Magat, about 115 ha would be harvested annually



- 34 -
starting in 1998, yielding long-fiber pulpwood production ranging between
6,325 cu m to 6,555 cu m annually over the period 1998 to 2010.  Production
of timber would range between 1,610 cu m to 5,750 cu m annually over the
same period.
5.10      Timber from Narra and Mahogany.  Narra, one of the premium hard-
woods in the Philippines, grows on a wide range of soil types. It does
well on open grasslands of Pantabangan and Magat. Large-leaf Mahogany
is one of the most successful broadleaved plantation species in the country.
It grows on shallow as well as deep alluvial soils, thrives under rainfall
of 1,500-5,000 mm and a dry season up to 5 months. In its native habitat,
it is found mostly in lower elevations and occasionally at elevations of
1,000 m. Both species are expected to yield as follows in Pantabangan and
Magat:
Year:                       20           25           30           35          40
Yield (cu m/ha)             58          106          160         213          250
Based on these yields, about 137,900 cu m of Narra would be available in 2019
in Pantabangan and 106,500 cu m in Magat. About 1,261,500 cu m of Mahogany
would be available in the same year in Pantabangan and about 498,500 cu m in
Magat.
6. MARKET PROSPECTS AND PRICES
6.01      Ipil-ipil Leafmeal.  The meal is obtained by drying leaves of
Ipil-ipil and grinding them to a texture suitable for mixing into animal
feeds. Leafieal is a valuable source of crude protein, vitamins, and minerals
in hog and poultry feed. For poultry feeding, Ipil-ipil leafmeal is a very
good source of yellow pigment for egg yolk, and shanks and breasts of
broilers. About 5% leafmeal is usually recommended in rations for poultry and
swine diets. Feeds composed of up to 5% leafmeal have not produced any ill
effects from the mimosine content in the leaves. The whole leaf contains both
nutrients and roughage and makes a ruminant feed comparable to alfalfa forage.
The Ipil-ipil protein level is high and is of good nutritional quality, with
amino acids present in well balanced proportions, much like alfalfa. The meal
is also a rich source of carotene, riboflavin and Vitamin K.
6.02      The main area of domestic commercial production of Ipil-ipil
leafmeal is the Central Visayas. It is a smallholder crop with leaves being
harvested, sun-dried, and sold to middlemen. The middlemen further dry and



- 35 -
grind the leaves before selling them to processors in Cebu. Processed
leafmeal is then shipped to mixed feed manufacturers in Manila where about
80% of the operating capacity of registered feedmillers is located. Manila
and its surroundings are the most important market for meat and poultry
products and hence almost 60% of commercial livestock raisers are located
within a 50 km radius of Manila. While commercial production of Ipil-ipil
leafmeal is not as widespread in Luzon, a number of livestock growers plant
and harvest their own Ipil-ipil and feed the leaves directly to animals. The
advantage of the Pantabangan project site for Ipil-ipil leaf production is its
proximity and easy access to the market center of Manila. While no extensive
network of leafmeal traders and middlemen exist in Luzon, the private sector
is enterprising, competitive, and capable of building up an efficient
marketing system for the sun-dried leaves.
6.03       Another source of demand for Ipil-ipil leafmeal in pelletized form
is the Japanese feed milling industry, where it is used as a substitute for
alfalfa. Major distributors exported about 10,000 tons annually to Japan
until 1977. Subsequently, Government policy required the satisfying of
local demand before exports were permitted. In 1978, due to increased
demand and lower production as a result of bad weather, there were no
exports and some alfalfa meal was imported. Supply and demand for Ipil-ipil
leafmeal seemed to be reasonably in balance in 1979.
6.04       Over the period 1974-1978, commercial feed production grew from
539,800 tons to 858,600 tons, an annual growth rate of about 12%. In
comparison, between 1976-78, the only period for which reliable data are
available, the hog and chicken population also increased annually at about
12%. Assuming that about 4% of the total feed production was Ipil-ipil
leafmeal, the commercial production of Ipil-ipil leafmeal in 1978 was about
34,300 tons. Over the period 1974-78, the price of Ipil-ipil leafmeal,
delivered in Manila, has risen from P 0.6/kg to P 0.84/kg, an annual
growth of about 9% in current terms but almost constant in real terms. The
demand for Ipil-ipil leafmeal is determined by its price relative to other
protein ingredients and sources of yellow pigment, and the growth of
livestock population. Based on current prices of other feed ingredients and
a least cost analysis of feed mix formulations performed by feedmillers,
Ipil-ipil leafmeal is favored over other ingredients if the price does not
to go beyond P 0.8/kg in 1978 terms. At this price level, about 5% of hog
feeds and 4% of poultry feeds contain Ipil-ipil leafmeal. The Ministry of
Agriculture, estimates that the consumer demand for pork and chicken would
grow at about 5% annually over the period 1978-1985, based on a real per
capita income growth of 3.0%. Assuming that the hog and chicken population
would grow at the same annual rate of 5%, the estimated domestic demand for
Ipil-ipil leafmeal would be as follows:



- 36 -
Year             Demand (tons)
1978                34,300
1985                48,300
1990                61,600
6.05      Based on an average yield of 15 tons/ha of Ipil-ipil dry matter,
about 1,000 ha of additional production area would be needed by 1985 and
about 2,000 ha by 1990. Although it is difficult to precisely estimate
future Ipil-ipil production in the country, other than from the project, it
is expected to satisfy domestic demand. Therefore, the incremental production
from the project area would have to be exported. The largest export market
for pelletized Ipil-ipil leafmeal is Japan. In the past few years, Japan has
imported between 400,000 and 500,000 tons of pelletized alfalfa meal annually.
This demand is expected to increase at about 10% to 12% annually in the future
due to the country's desire to increase domestic meat production viz-a-viz
direct importation. It is projected that such imports would amount to about
600,000 tons in 1980 and 900,000 tons in 1985. Due to the price competitive-
ness of Ipil-ipil leafmeal pellets (which historically have sold at a price
20% lower than alfalfa pellets), they could substitute for about 20% of
Japan's alfalfa pellet imports. This would mean an annual export demand for
Ipil-ipil leafmeal pellets of about 120,000 tons in 1980 and about 180,000
tons in 1990. Thus the 45,000 tons of dry matter produced under the project
would be readily absorbed by the export market. Today, pelletization
facilities do not exist near the project area or near Manila. However, the
investment needed is only about US$650,000 to pelletize the project output for
export. Since the feedmilling industry is well developed and enterprising, it
is expected that the private sector would make that investment. Pelletized
Ipil-ipil leafmeal is presently selling at about US$110 per ton f.o.b.
Manila. After deducting pelletization, drying, grinding and transportation
cost, the project-site price would be about US$54 per ton or P 0.4/kg of dry
matter in 1979. In the future, the price of the product, in real terms, is
expected to remain constant. For the economic analysis, the price has been
expressed, in terms of mid-1980 values, at about P 440/ton.
6.06      Ipil-ipil Charcoal.  Processing of fuelwood into charcoal has been
included in the project since the procedure is simple, inexpensive and
substantially increases the value of the fuelwood input. Charcoal is utilized
locally for domestic cooking and industrial purposes such as the chemical
industries, steel mills, paper mills and sugar refineries. The increasing
costs and uncertainty of supplies of substitutes for charcoal, particularly
bunker oil, has caused the demand for and price of charcoal to rise rapidly.
Restrictions on the use of fuelwood in urban areas has heightened the demand
for charcoal. Domestic demand for charcoal is influenced by the number of
urban households as well as by the price of substitute fuels. In addition,
increased industrial use of carbon-based products for the production of PVC
resins, acetylene, vinyls and other carbide products, is also expected to



- 37 -
increase the demand for charcoal. However, the relatively high transportation
costs for charcoal render it unattractive for sale in markets more than 100 km
away from the production site.
6.07      The project's charcoal production would be sold at the project site
to middlemen, who would then sell it in the household markets of the nearby
provinces of Nueva Ecija, Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela, Bulacan and Pampanga.
According to National Census and Statistics Office (NCSO) data about 87,000
families or 29% of urban households in these provinces use charcoal for
cooking purposes, about 130,000 families (43%) use kerosene or liquified
propane gas (LPG) and about 86,000 families (28%) use wood for cooking
purposes. Due to a ban on the use of firewood for cooking in urban areas in
order to reduce smoke pollution, and the scarcity of good quality firewood,
there has been a gradual change to charcoal by households presently using
firewood. Since the cooking is generally done outdoors, the change requires
no extra money or effort. In addition, due to the increasing price and
problems in the availability of kerosene and LPG, households using these
fuels are also increasing the use of charcoal for their heavier cooking
needs, generally done outdoors with rudimentary facilities. New households
are also facing problems in securing LPG supplies and paying for the initial
investment of the stove, etc. For example, the minimum cash outlay required
for bottled LPG would be P 40, whereas a bundle of charcoal can be
purchased for about P 5.
6.08      For comparison, the heating value of Ipil-ipil wood charcoal is
about 6,539 calories/kg and that of LPG about 11,404 calories/kg. The cost of
charcoal is about P 1.0/kg and LPG about P 3.3/kg. Assuming a relative
efficiency of 70% for the use of charcoal for cooking as compared to LPG, the
use of charcoal is about 25% cheaper. With increasing price and decreasing
availability of LPG, the use of charcoal will become even more attractive.
Since reliable data on prices for firewood are not available, a comparison is
difficult to make, though it is believed that costs of using charcoal and
firewood are comparable. The project is expected to produce about 30,000 tons
of charcoal annually by 1990, enough for use by about 60,000 families. At
present about 85,000 families (30%) in the project provinces use charcoal for
cooking and about 216,000 families (70%) use LPG or firewood. With a 2.5%
annual population growth rate in the future, about 107,000 more families are
expected to be created by 1990. No problems are anticipated in marketing the
project's charcoal production at full development, as it would be completely
absorbed by a changeover of less than 10% of the households historically
using LPG and firewood. Charcoal retailed in the neighbouring urban areas
at about P 1,000/ton in 1979. Deducting the retailer's margin, transport
and handling cost, the price at both project sites, would be P 700/ton.
It is expected that the price of charcoal would remain at this level, in
real terms, in the future. For the economic analysis, the price has been
expressed, in mid-1980 terms, at about P 840/ton.

6.09      Mangoes.  Mangoes are grown by smallholders as a backyard crop and
plantation growing of the fruit is not significant. According to BAECON
statistics, the area grown to the crop has decreased from about 45,000 ha in
1968 to about 35,000 ha in 1978 through land-use conversion and scrapping of
old areas. However, production has increased over the same period from
about 126,460 tons in 1968 to about 328,680 tons in 1978, an annual growth
rate of about 10%, due to increased yields. The island of Luzon is the
largest mango growing area, accounting for 60% of the area and 51% of the
national mango production. Shown below is the 1978 area and production
distribution by major regions of the country:

6.10      Mango trees fruit once a year but the fruiting season varies from
region to region. The northern regions such as Luzon produce earlier
(January and February) and the southern regions later (August). A few
areas, such as Cebu in the Central Visayas, produce mangoes throughout the
year through artificially induced flowering. Mangoes from the southern
regions are sold in Manila in the off-season for the affluent and tourist
market. However, inter-island trade of mangoes is small and for practical
purposes, each of the aggregated areas, Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao can be
considered independent in mango production and consumption. Within Luzon,
where the project is located, the major growing areas are Ilocos and Central
Luzon which produce surpluses, which are sent to deficit areas much as
Manila and Southern Tagalog. Most of the fruit is sold for the table market
and a small proportion, less than 5%, is processed or exported. Mango
exports, about 90% to Hongkong and 7% to Japan, have fluctuated between
5,000 and 7,700 tons over the period 1970-77 and averaged about 6,900 tons
annually.
6.11      Production in Luzon has grown at an annual rate of about 3% over
the past five years 1973-78. Over the same period prices received by
farmers have increased annually about 15% in current terms and about 2% in
real terms. Over the past two years, production and prices seem to have
stabilized at about 166,000 tons and P 2,000/ton. Export prices for
mangoes in 1977 averaged about US$290/ton or P 2,145/ton. The major
expansion of mango production areas has come through the financing programs
of DBP. Over the period 1974-78, DBP has provided financing for a total of
about 4,540 ha, with the peak of 1,940 ha in 1976 and then tapering down to
about 350 ha in 1978. It is estimated that about 65% of the areas financed
are in Luzon and that about 300 ha would be financed annually over the
period 1979-85. Based on the DBP supported areas and those of the project,
mango production in Luzon is expected to reach about 215,000 tons by 1990,
equivalent to an annual growth rate of about 4% over the period 1978-90.
Assuming a 3.0% annual real per capita income growth in the future, a
coefficient of income elasticity of 0.61, and a 2.5% annual population growth,
consumption in Luzon is expected to increase at an annual rate of about 4.5%
and reach 225,800 tons by 1985, 280,000 tons by 1990 and 347,200 tons by 1995.
The shortfall in production in 1985 and 1990 is expected to be met by
production from areas outside Luzon, and the shortfall in 1995 would come from
additional areas financed in Luzon after 1985. Therefore, an adequate market
exists for the mango production from the project area. Should the actual
annual growth in consumption fall to 3.0% annually, the historic growth rate
for the past five years, there would still be a domestic market in Luzon for
the project's production.
6.12      The province of Pangasinan, adjacent to the project area, is one
of the important mango growing provinces, accounting for about 24,300 tons
in 1978 or 15% of Luzon's production. It has a well developed system for
marketing which is dominated by contract buyers and the buying agents of
Manila wholesalers. In 1979, there were about 200 mango dealers operating



- 40 -
in Pangasinan, and contract buyers accounted for about 25% of the volume
bought from farmers, and agents about 52%. In 1978, the average price paid
to farmers in this area was about P 1,640/ton by contract buyers, about
P 1,980/ton by agents and P 2,185/ton by retailers. The price paid by
contract buyers was lower because of their particular method of operation.
Some contract buyers pay all costs (chemicals and labor) and share the net
sale with farmers on a 50-50 basis. Others estimate the production and
quality of the fruit and negotiate a price per tree, then harvest and haul the
fruit away. Excluding the volume bought by contract buyers because of their
special relationship with the farmers, the weighted average prices paid to the
farmer was P 2,050/ton in 1978.  Since the province of Pangasinan and the
project area are about the same distance from and connected by a good road
system to Manila, the price at the Pantabangan project site for mangoes in
1978 would be the same at about P 2,050/ton, while that for Magat would be
at about P 1,800/ton. These prices are expected to remain constant in the
future in real terms. For the economic analysis, prices have been expressed
in mid-1980 terms, at about P 2,460/ton at Pantabangan and P 2,210/ton at
Magat.
6.13      Cashew.  According to Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAECON)
statistics, production of raw cashew nuts in the Philippines was about 4,235
tons in 1978, grown over an area of about 3,690 ha. Almost 88% of the
production is grown in Palawan, Guimares and in Ilocos. Production of
cashew nut has been essentially constant over the past ten years except for
fluctuations due to weather conditions. Cashew trees are grown in the
Philippines in semi-wild and wild conditions as a smallholder crop. The
lack of proper tree maintenance, sparse distribution of trees resulting in
pollination problems, and improper harvest and post-harvest handling account
for the generally low yields. There is no organized marketing system for
cashew and there are no middlemen specializing in the trading of cashew
nuts. Wholesalers and traders, who deal with a number of other products,
buy nuts from farmers and sell them to retailers who contract out the nuts
for processing. The processing is done in small cottage industries, where
roasting and cracking of nuts is done under primitive conditions. The lack
of large volumes of production and unreliability of supply have not favored
the development of an efficient and viable processing industry. Most of the
cashew production for the Southern Tagalog and Central Luzon areas is
consumed in Manila. Cashews are consumed primarily as roasted and salted
nuts and secondarily in confectionary products. The local consumer
preference for cashew nuts is not strong and local demand is not expected to
increase significantly except for high-income families in Manila. Such
inreases in demand would not be significant in terms of the 6,000 to 8,000
tons of cashew nuts expected to be produced annually by the project over the
period 1990 to 1995. Therefore, the production from the project could be
disposed of in two ways: (a) the nuts could be processed locally and then
exported to Japan or the US or (b) the nuts could be exported to India. The
decision of which alternative to choose would have to be taken in the early



- 41 -
1990s when production from the project area would start. Though the first
alternative would retain the value added from processing within the country,
and increase foreign exchange earnings, it would involve the initiation of
(a) a grading system for cashew kernels, (b) an efficient processing industry
and (c) marketing of kernels abroad, almost from scratch. Unless there is a
very substantial increase in cashew production in the country, which presently
does not appear likely outside the project area, the second alternative
of exporting the raw nuts to India may appear more attractive as an initial
step. For purposes of analysis, it has been assumed that production of cashew
nuts in the project area would be sold for export to India.
6.14      The regional distribution of world imports of cashew nut kernels
has remained fairly constant over the years. North America's share of total
imports has ranged between 55-60%; Eastern Europe, including the USSR, imports
about 25%; Western Europe about 10%; the remainder of imports being divided
among a large number of countries. The combined imports of the US and Canada
have increased at a rate of about 4.0% per annum between 1960 and 1975. The
Soviet Union increased its imports at a rate of about 13.7% per annum during
the same period. In Asia, Japan showed a fast growth rate in imports, and in
the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand have continued to increase their
imports at a rate of about 7.0% per annum. Demand for cashew kernels appears
to be strong. Prices of cashewnut kernels,/1 in current terms, have more than
doubled in the past 13 years from about US$0.45/lb in 1963 (c.i.f. New York)
to US$1.82/lb in 1976 and to an exceptional high price of US$2.40/lb in 1977
due to supply shortages.  The price of kernels 300-320 wholes c.i.f. New York
has averaged US$2,800/ton in 1976, US$5,020 in 1977, and has maintained the
1977 levels in 1978.  Due to the acute supply situation, present levels of
cashew kernels prices are high and it is expected that in the early 1990s and
beyond, the price would stabilize to 1976 levels, equivalent to US$4,200/ton
expressed in mid-1980 values. This price has been used for the economic
analysis to determine the price for raw cashew nut in the project area.
6.15      Trade in raw cashewnuts has been virtually confined to imports by
India of East African raw nuts. India's cashew processing industry, with an
annual shelling capacity of 450,000 tons, is currently afflicted by an acute
shortage of raw nuts. With domestic production supplying only a third of
the industry's needs, India is vitally dependent on raw nut imports to keep
its plants operating. While local production has remained steady at 150,000
tons, imports of raw cashew have declined sharply in recent years from about
135,000 tons in 1975 to 10,000 tons in 1978 due to a shrinking availability
from its two traditional suppliers, Mozambique and Tanzania. In 1976 the
Government of India initiated a program to put about 145,000 ha under
cashew over the next six years, 60,000 ha under Government plantations and
85,000 ha under private plantations. Though the production from these
/ Grade 300-320 whole kernels in 25 pound tin c.i.f. New York.



- 42 -
plantations is expected to increase the capacity utilization of the process-
ing industry, there would still be a significant shortfall which would have
to be met by imports of raw cashew nuts. The relatively modest production
from the project area, about 9,000 tons of raw nuts annually, could easily be
sold to India.
6.16      Although price parity formulas between raw nut and kernel prices
would depend on the negotiations between the Philippines and India, it has
been assumed that the future margin /1 for India would be about 110% with
respect to raw nuts bought from the Philippines (the margin has varied
between 90% and 125% over the period 1973 to 1976 for raw nuts imported from
Africa). This would imply a price for raw nuts of about US$405/ton or
P 3,000/ton, f.o.b. Manila in terms of mid-1980 values. Taking into
account port handling and transportation costs, the price at the Pantabangan
project site would be about P 2,720/ton, and at Magat about P 2,470/ton.
6.17      Pulpwood.  In 1978, there were 23 firms in the domestic pulp and
paper industry with a combined production potential of about 370,000
tons/yr /2 of paper and paperboard. The potential falls short of current
domestic consumption by an estimated 60,000 tons/year. Eight companies have
integrated pulp and paper/paperboard manufacture, twelve are unintegrated
paper/paperboard mills, and three are unintegrated special pulp producers.
Pulp supply potential is around 215,000 tons/year or about 60% of the mills'
requirement. About 50% of the paper/paperboard production capacity and only
23% of the pulp mill capacity is located in Luzon. In the past, production
has been substantially below supply potential, mainly because of the lack of
raw materials. Except for the largest producer, Paper Industries
Corporation of the Philippines (PICOP), the pulp mills have suffered from
scarcity of pulpwood. Paper mills have suffered from the non-availability
of local pulp and at times, high prices of imported pulp and waste paper.
On the basis of Board of Investment (BOI) data, the estimated supply and
demand for paper and paperboard is as follows.

transporation and processing costs and profits.  Margin (%) = 100 x

/a  Existing mills plus known expansion plans.
/b Mission estimate.
6.18      The expected shortfalls in supply have to be balanced by imports and
increased capacities. Imports are now approaching 100,000 tons/annum
considerably more than Indicated above, because of underutilization of
existing capacities. In the long run, imports can be replaced by domestic
production, with the exception of a few special grades. The shortfalls in
pulp are even greater because domestic pulp production currently lags behind
the paper industry's requirements by roughly 100,000 tons/annum, about 65% of
which consists of long-fiber woodpulp which has to be imported. Assuming that
the use of secondary fiber is maximized and that of long-fiber is minimized,
and ignoring the possible additional use of nonwood pulps, about 1.9 milion
cu m of additional pulpwood would be needed annually by 1990, of which about
0.8 million cu m would be long-f'iber pulpwood. Assuming that one third of the
short-fiber deficiency could be met from natural wood, logging waste and
milling residues, and an equivalent of up to 200,000 cu m of long-fiber wood
from natural pine and other long-fiber raw materials, plantations would be
needed to produce about 750,000 cu m/annum of short-fiber pulpwood and about
600,000 cu m/annum of long-fiber pulpwood by 1990. These are aggregate
figures and refer only to projected demands of the pulp and paper industry for
domestic supplies. If the demand of possible export-oriented mills were
considered, the volumes required would have to be raised significantly. The
aggregate of current annual pulpwood plantings do not exceed the level needed
to sustain available mill capacities.
6.19      The harvesting of short-fiber pulpwood in the project area is
expected to begin in 1990, averaging about 27,000 cu m annually, consisting
of about 22,300 cu m in Pantabangan and 4,700 cu m in Magat. The project's
total annual production would represent only 3.6% of the projected gap in the
country's short-fiber pulpwood requirements in 1990. Long-fiber pulpwood is
expected to be harvested beginning in 1993, averaging about 32,500 cu m
annually, consisting of about 24,000 cu m in Pantabangan and 8,500 cu m in
Magat. The project's long-fiber pulpwood production would amount to only 5.4%
of the projected deficiency in the country's requirement in 1990. No
difficulties therefore, are expected in marketing of the pulpwood. The Bataan



- 44 -
Pulp and Paper Hill in Samaal, Bataan, about 200 km from the Pantabangan
project area, has a rated pulping capacity of about 100 tons/day. It has
been operating at 60-70% of capacity due to problems in supply of pulpwood.
It does not have its own pulpwood production areas and depends on imports of
woodpulp and pulpwood supplies (primarily logging wastes) from Cagayan,
Kalinga-Apayao and even Mindanao. Prospects for supply of pulpwood are
becoming worse both from the quantity and cost point of view. The mill
could easily buy an additional 25,000 cu m of short-fiber pulpwood, and
about 22,000 cu m of long-fiber pulpwood if the supply was locally
available. This would mean that the production from Pantabangan could be
sold in Bataan and be competitive with supplies from more distant areas such
as Cagayan and Mindanao. A new pulp and paper mill with capacity of 200
tons/day is expected to be put up in the 1980s in KalingaApayao, within
about 100 km from the Magat project area. Though there are no firm plans or
commitments, Kalinga-Apayao would be an advantageous site for such a plant
because of the availability of pulpwood supply from logging wastes and
available areas for plantations. Such a mill would require roughly 280,000
cu m of short and long-fiber pulpwood to operate at 85% of capacity.
6.20      In 1978, imported short-fiber wood pulp cost about US$295/ton,
c.i.f. Manila. Including a 50% custom duty and transport charges to Bataan,
it cost about US$458/ton at mill-site. Deducting the cost of pulp production,
estimated at about US$200/ton, the equilibrium price of short-fiber pulpwood
would be about US$65/cu m or P 470/cu m mill-site (without the customs duty,
the equilibrium price would be about US$27/cu m or P 205/cu m mill-site).
However, short-fiber pulpwood, mostly in the form of logging wastes from
Cagayan, is presently being sold in Bataan for about P 230/cu m. Deducting
the cost of local transport, the price of short-fiber pulpwood would be
equivalent to about P 150/cu m in 1978 at the Pantabangan project site.
It is expected that a paper and pulp mill would be built in the Kalinga-Apaya6
region in the late eighties, because of the relatively easy availability of
logging wastes, areas for reforestation, and availability of hydro-power. The
short-fiber pulpwood from the project area could sell at Magat for about the
same price as in Pantabangar., about P 150/cu m in 1978. In mid-1980 terms,
these prices work out to P 180/cu m at both sites.
6.21      The Bataan mill imported long-fiber woodpulp in 1978 at a cost of
about US$330/ton, c.i.f. Manila. Including a 20% custom duty and transport
charges to Bataan, the cost would be about US$408/ton mill-site. Deducting
the cost of pulp production estimated at about US$200/ton, the equilibrium
price would be about US$412/cu m or P 310/cu m mill-site. Taking into
account the cost of local transport, the price of long-fiber pulpwood would be
equivalent to about P 230/cu m at Pantabangan. In the case of Magat, the
price at project site is expected to be about the same. In terms of mid-1980
values, these would work out to P 275/cu m at both sites. Presently, most
of the short-fiber pulpwood is supplied as a by-product of logging operations.
However, in the nineties, a considerable supply would have to come from
plantations geared to pulpwood production and/or imports of short-fiber



- 45 -
pulpwood. Similarly, long-fiber pulpwood would have to be supplied in the
future, either from plantations growing pines and/or importation of long-fiber
wood pulp. It is extremely difficult to predict the local supply and prices
of these pulpwoods in the nineties. It has been assumed that in the future
the price levels will remain constant, in real terms.
6.22      Timber.  The project is expected to sell logs of Yemane, Benguet
Pine, Narra and Mahogany at plant-site. Yemane would be used in the local
market for cabinet making, light construction and for wood carvings. Benguet
Pine, Narra and Mahogany are used in high-quality furniture, interior
panelling, flooring and general construcion. Benguet Pine poles are used by
the NEA for electricity distribution lines. Due to the relative scarcity of
the three latter species, they sell at a considerable premium to Lauan, the
principal timber species in the domestic and export market. The project is
expected to produce an average of about 6,670 cu m of Yemane logs annually
between the years 1990 and 2000, and about 15,000 cu m of pine logs annually
between 1999 and 2019. In addition, around the year 2019 the project would
have standing timber of about 1.76 million cu m of Mahogany and 0.24 million
cu m of Narra. With the strong demand for wood, both locally and for exports,
and the dwindling forest resources, the production from the project would
easily be sold in log-form at the project sites. There exists a cadre of
financially strong and enterprising middlemen in the lumber trading sector who
would then sell the logs for processing locally or for exports.
6.23      After a strong recovery from a price drop related to the worldwide
recession of 1974-75, production and consumption of tropical hardwood logs
and their derived products have returned to their peak levels of 1973.
Moreover, the long term outlook for the international market appears highly
favorable. The rising costs of securing sufficient exportable supplies in the
face of growing demand indicates that the international price of tropical
hardwoods would rise substantially in real terms in the future. The price of
logs is expected to rise at a rate of approximately 5% per annum, over the
period 1978 to 1990. The average wholesale price in Manila of Lauan and Narra
logs in 1978 was P 560/cu m and P 975/cu m respectively. Due to the
recent ban on the harvesting of Narra, prices for Narra have increased
considerably commanding a premium over Lauan of about 75% in 1978 and over
100% in 1979. Historically, before the ban, Narra traded at a lower premium
of about 50% over the price of Lauan. Mahogany sells at about the same price
as Narra, and for the analysis it has been assumed that the price of logs of
both species would have a long-term premium of about 50% over Lauan logs, at
about P 1,000/cu m (mid-1980 values) in Manila. It is expected that the
price would increase at about 5% annually in real terms to about
P 1,700/cu m in the year 1990 and P 2,800 in the year 2000. Deducting
the cost of transport of about P 160/cu m for Pantabangan and P 380/cu m
for Magat, the road-side price for Narra and Mahogany would be equivalent to
about P 2,640/cu m in Pantabangan and P 2,420/cu m in Magat in the
year 2000.



- 46 -
6.24      Though good market price data do not exist for Benguet pine and
Yemane, some estimates have been made. Benguet pine poles have been bought
by the NEA for about F 1,165/cu m, f.o.b. Manila, in 1979. Pine logs for
use in the panelling market were reportedly being sold in Manila at a 20%
premium over the price of Lauan logs, about P 810/cu m (mid-1980 values).
Though sources of pine wood are relatively more remote and hence costlier
for extraction, the demand for pine logs is small and is not expected to
grow as fast as that for Lauan. On balance, it is expected that in the
future pine logs will maintain the present 20% premium over Lauan logs.
Incorporating a 5% real annual increase in price and deducting the cost of
transport, the price at the project site for Benguet pine logs is expected
to be P 2,155/cu m at Pantabangan and P 2,015/cu m at Magat in the year
2000. At present Yemane and similar types sell at about a 20% discount from
the price of Lauan, or P 540/cu m in log form (mid-1980 values). It is
expected that Yemane logs will maintain the 20% discount from Lauan logs in
the future. Incorporating a 5% real annual increase in price and deducting
the cost of transport, the price works out to be P 1,405/cu m, Pantabangan
and P 1,265/cu m, Magat in the year 2000.
7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      The project would be the first major Government attempt to manage
the watersheds of the two largest multipurpose dams in the country. In the
case of the Pantabangan watershed, the project would establish an economically
viable and technically sound system for preserving and enhancing the produc-
tive capacity of the catchment and for providing a permanent and improved
livelihood for the local population. It would also demonstrate a system of
watershed management which could be replicated in other watersheds requiring
urgent attention. The program would also stop the presently rapid rate of
destruction of the land resources in the Pantabangan catchment. In the case
of the large and complex Magat watershed the additional studies and pilot
projects would examine the viability of reforestation, range management and
smallholder agroforestry approaches to solving the watershed's problems. The
reforestation program of a steep area immediately adjacent to the proposed
Magat dam site would also reduce the rate of erosion and sedimentation in the
reservoir. The forest protection pilot component would cover an area of about
127,000 ha and help BFD in the development of a comprehensive forest
protection system which could be replicated on a larger scale in other areas.
Production
7.02      At full development, the project would provide an average annual
production of about 45,000 tons of leafmeal, 30,200 tons of charcoal, 58,700
tons of mango, 11,250 tons of cashew, 27,100 tons of short-fiber pulpwood and
24,500 tons of long-fiber pulpwood. In addition, the project would produce



- 47 -
about 6,670 cu m of Yemane timber and about 13,800 cu m of pine timber
annually, and at the end of 40 years, the hardwood species would yield about
2.0 million cu m. The charcoal and pulpwood production would represent an
annual import savings of about US$7.3 million. Leafmeal and cashew would have
an annual export value of US$10.0 million, and the hardwoods would have an
export value of about US$755 million.
Employment and Incomes
7.03      Based on an employment of 240 man-days per year per person, the
Pantabangan project area would provide sustained full-time work for about
4,710 people or 1,570 families by 1985, increasing to 5,685 people or 1,895
families by 1990 and peaking to 6,780 people or 2,260 families by 1995. The
monthly labor demands and availabilities in the watershed in 1980, 1985 and
1990 are shown in Annex 2, Table 3. Labor supply projections are based on a
long-term annual growth of 3.0%, the national rate, and are net of other
employment in the watershed. Based on these projections, labor demand would
significantly outstrip supply in the months of December and January in 1995.
However, considering the traditional mobility of labor in the Philippines
and taking into account the fact that families from Ilocos and Ifugao are
already migrating into the watershed, it is likely that the population would
grow faster than the 3.0% annually and that labor shortages would not arise.
In addition to employment for laborers, the project would provide work for
about 400 salaried personnel.
7.04      The people in the watershed have moved there due to population
pressures and scarcity of employment in the lowlands. Others were resettled
there after their towns were inundated by the Pantabangan reservoir. They are
extremely poor, with incomes below the absolute poverty level of US$200 per
capita and survive on subsistence agriculture and occasional income from
Government public works. Their average per capita income in 1979 was US$75,
with 77% of the households with incomes of less than US$140 per capita. The
average income today is about 37.5% of the absolute poverty level and 12.5% of
the per capita GNP of US$600. With the project, labor employment would
increase the per capita incomes of these families to US$300. Through revenue
or profit sharing the people would increase their incomes further. Assuming
that a minimum, fair return on NIA's investment would be 10%, about 20% of the
annual revenues could be passed on to the employees. The additional income
from sharing 20% of the revenues would increase incomes of the employed labor
to US$375 per capita by 1985, which would be over the absolute poverty level
and 49% of the 1985 projected per capita GNP of US$765. In 1990, their
incomes would increase to US$565, about 58% of the 1990 per capita GNP of
US$975. The comparisons indicate that the project would help narrow the
income gap between the project area and other parts of the country, and
between urban and rural areas. Shown below is a summary of the employment and
income figures for the Pantabangan watershed.

In the Magat project area, the project would provide fulltime employment to
about 1,200 people or 600 families by 1985 and about 1,990 people or 995
families in 1992. The people in areas adjacent to the project area who would
be employed by the project are poor, with average per capita incomes of about
US$100 and with 85% of the households with incomes of less than US$155 per
capita. The project would increase the per capita income to about US$275
from steady employment. The forest protection pilot component would
permanently improve the lives of about 300 forest occupant families.
7.05      Cash available to NIA, after deduction of employee's revenue sharing
and annual investment needs, could be used for other watershed management
projects and for contributing to the maintenance of many of the small and
scattered irrigation systems. Revenues are expected to start in 1981,
increasing to about US$3.5 million in 1985 and rising to about US$23.1 million
in 1995. After deducting about 20% of revenues for employee sharing and the
annual investment needs, the first year of excess cash generation would be in
1989, rising to about US$5.7 million in 1995.
Financial Rate of Return
7.06      The overall discounted cash flow rate of return for the project is
14%. The rate of return for the Pantabangan watershed subproject is about
14%. In order to obtain rates of return for individual products, the
overhead costs for road construction and maintenance, forest protection,
consulting services and NIA support services were allocated on the basis of
hectarage and the costs of general administration and community development
on the basis of labor employment. While the rate of return for Yemane is
low, it is an acceptable investment because the species does well on very
poor soils, has good erosion prevention characteristics, is fire resistant,
and is important from the point of view of keeping up a biological diversity
in the watersheds. The low return is due to its relatively poor quality as
a timber.
7.07      The individual product rates of return and their sensitivity to
wage rates, cost overruns and drops in revenues are shown below:

The minimum wage rate stipulated by law is P 10/man-day and is the going
wage rate in the area. However, NIA has a policy of employing labor at
P 16/man-day, the rate used for the cost estimates for the project. As can
be seen, the rate of return for leafmeal is most sensitive to the wage rate
increasing from 11% to 16%, due to the labor intensive nature of the work. On
the whole, the use of the wage rate of P 10/man-day would increase the rate
of return by 2%. A 10% increase in costs and a 10% decrease in revenues
individually decrease the rate of return by 2%. For the overall Pantabangan
project, the rate of return would drop to 10% if either the wages were to
increase by 90%, or the costs were to rise by 30%, or Mango yields or
revenues were decreased by 50%, or overall revenues were decreased by 20%.
7.08      The discounted cash flow rate of return for the Magat subproject
is about 14%. The individual product rates of return and their sensitivity
to wage rates, cost overruns and drops in revenues are shown below:

On the average, a wage rate of P 10/man-day increases the rate of return by
2%. A 10% increase in costs decreases the rate of return by 1% while a 10%
decrease in revenues decreases it by 2%. For the return to drop to 10%, the
wage rate would have to increase by 120%, or the costs by 30% or the
revenues to decrease by 25%, or mango yields or revenues to decrease by 40%.
Economic Rate of Return
7.09      The economic costs were calculated excluding price contingencies but
including physical contingencies. Local content of both costs and revenues
were multiplied by the standard conversion factor of 0.82 to convert them to
border prices. Labor was shadow priced at the going market rate of P
10/man-day. Since the project lands have few alternative uses, no value was
assessed for them. Output prices were adjusted to reflect import parity
prices for substitutes (Annex 2).
7.10      The overall economic rate of return for the project is 18%
(Table 7.4). At a discount rate of 10%, the estimated opportunity cost of
capital in the Philippines, the economic net present value of the project in
1980 is US$56.3 million. The rate of return for the Pantabangan watershed
subproject is 18%. An allocation of the overheads as done for the financial
rate of return is a good substitute for estimation of incremental overhead
costs needed if a single product was produced. Using that basis, the
economic rates of return for the various products and the results of the
sensitivity analysis are shown below:

The economic rate of return for leafmeal is particularly sensitive to the
shadow wage rate.  Based on irrigation projects in the Philippines, the
shadow wage rate in rural areas works out to about P 5/man-day. At this
wage rate, the overall economic rate of return increases by 3%. For the
economic rate of return to drop to 10%, the wage rate would have to increase
by 250%, or costs increase by 65%, or revenues would have to decrease by
40%. If there were no revenues from mangoes, the rate of return would not
fall below 10%.
7.11      The overall economic rate of return for the Magat subproject is
19%. The individual product rates of return and their sensitivity to wage
rates, cost overruns and drops in revenue are shown below:

On the average, the wage rate of P 5/man-day increases the rate of return by
2%.  For the economic rate of return to drop to 10%, the wage rate would have
to increase by 370%, or costs would have to increase by 65%, or revenues would
have to decrease by 40%, or mango yields or revenues would have to decline by
80%.
7.12      Risks.  No major technical risks are anticipated as a wide range of
tree crops and end products are included in the project to minimize the
dependence of the project on any single product. NIA has already demonstrated
substantial capabilities in the development of nurseries, tree planting opera-
tions and protection of the seedlings from fire in both project watersheds.
Success of the project would depend mainly on two factors: the ability of the
NIA project management to adapt to a commercial viewpoint and the full
involvement of the local population in project implementation. In order to
reduce the management risk provision is made for substantial consultant
assistance to strengthen the commercial and production aspects of the
project. Increased motivation of the resident population would be provided
for by strengthening NIA's already good public information services and by
introducing a series of personal and communal incentives to participation in
the project, additional to very significant employment benefits. The Forest
Protection Pilot Component is subject to a certain risk that existing
weaknesses in BFD's administrative capacity could delay its timely
implementation. However, the component is small in size, it stretches only
over three years and would be carried out by a single division of BFD in two
trial areas only. Besides a detailed operation plan and an intensive
monitoring and evaluation mechanism would be established from the outset
with substantial consultant assistance. These features should reduce the
administrative risk to manageable proportions.

8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations agreement with the Government was reached on
the following principal points:
(a)  NIA would afford the Bank an opportunity to comment on any new
appointment to the post of Project Director during the period of
project implementation (para. 4.03);
(b)  NIA, in consultation with the Commission on Audit, would institute
for the project a commercial accounting system acceptable to the
Bank, by December 31, 1980 (para. 4.04);
(c)  NIA would submit for Bank review by December 31, 1982
a plan for sharing project revenues with employees of the
Pantabangan project area and then implement such a revenue
sharing scheme by June 30, 1983 (para. 4.06);
(d)  NIA would submit for Bank review by June 30, 1985 a profit sharing
scheme, taking into consideration a fair share for employees and a
fair return on the capital investment of NIA, and that NIA would
implement such a profit sharing scheme by December 31, 1985 (para.
4.06); and
(e)  NIA and BFD would sign a memo of understanding by December 31, 1980
defining:
(i) BFD's role in terms of providing technical services for nursery
and planting operations.
(ii) NIA's access to the training facilities and programs carried
out by BFD in the watershed; and
(iii) NIA's role in providing a joint fire protection service for
both the proposed project and the BFD project (para. 4.08).
8.02      A condition of disbursement for the forest protection pilot
component would be that a detailed plan of operations and an implementation
schedule had been prepared for that component (para. 3.10).
8.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$38.0 million for a period of 20 years including 5
years of grace. The borrower would be the Republic of the Philippines.

WATERSHED MANAGEMENT AND EROSION CONTROL PROJECT
Accounting Procedures for Force Account Work and Minor Contracts
1.        Construction of secondary roads in Pantabangan, and the establish-
ment of plantations, forest protection and fire prevention, and the mainte-
nance of roads in both watersheds would be undertaken by force account. This
work is estimated to cost about US$30 million, which is about 40% of the
total project cost. This work would be carried out by NIA and not by contrac-
tors because of the complex nature of work which utilizes large numbers of
labor and materials and does not attract contractors. Disbursements for force
account work would be based on the statements of expenditure using unit rates
to be agreed by the Bank and NIA. The unit rates would be established by an
analysis of each work item which NIA would submit for Bank review before
December 31, 1980. The detailed accounts maintained by NIA would permit
periodic revision of the unit rates as necessary. Documentation to support
disbursements would identify the location of the completed works and super-
vision missions would verify that the work had been completed.
2.        A Bank mission visited the Manila office of NIA and examined the
relevant budgeting and accounting procedures NIA has instituted for force
account work in the field. The project office would submit to the Manila
office an annual program of activities for each cost center which would
include the nature of work, estimated material and labor requirements, with
prices for these items, and an implementation schedule. The annual program
would be reviewed by the Manila office and by an auditor attached to the
project by the Commission on Audit (COA). After relevant modifications, the
program would be sanctioned for implementation, with each activity being
provided a code. During implementation, the cost centers would submit
weekly reports to the Project Director, and the project office would submit
to the Manila NIA office a monthly progress report for each cost center,
providing information on implementation and costs with comparisons to
targets.  On completion of each activity, a summary would be prepared
providing information on actual and originally estimated inputs and costs of
materials and labor for future planning and budgeting purposes and for
revision, where necessary, of the agreed unit rates.
3.        Based on NIA's performance on other Bank-assisted projects and the
experience it has accumulated, it is expected that the requisition and issue

organized and that NIA would be adequately staffed to perform these
functions. Under normal procedures, the procurement of materials would be

auditor attached to the project. The auditor and, periodically, technical
personnel of the COA would inspect such delivered materials. The issuing of
materials to the different cost centers would be properly recorded and
debited against the appropriate cost center. Manila staff of NIA and,
periodically, regional-level auditors of COA would make field inspections to
check on usage of materials. When issuing payment to suppliers for materials
delivered, the disbursing officer would match the documents sent by the
project office and those sent by the supplier, and debit the amount.
Similarly, recording of labor time and cost would be undertaken in an
orderly manner. A time sheet would be prepared for every day, with the
weekly time sheet for the cost centers submitted to the Project Director,
and the monthly time sheets submitted to NIA in Manila providing names of
personnel, their duties, time spent and cost. This would be the basis for
issuing of wages. All accounts would be maintained and audited by the COA.
4.        Reimbursement for expenditures for minor civil works contracts
(less than P 1 million, or US$140,000) would be based on the statements
of expenditure procedure. NIA would retain copies of contracts, progress
reports or invoices and evidence of payments made to contractors for
periodic review by Bank staff.
