MEZORANDUH AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR Ad
IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Chile for US$45.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with 17 years'
maturity and variable interest rate, and would help to finance an irrigation
development project.
2.       BhekgX.gMd.  Though Chile is endowed with a great diversity of
natural resources, agriculture was long regarded as an inconsequential,
stagnant sector. Beginning in the mid-1960s, however, agriculture began to
respond to policy reforms, with an extended period of growth, only briefly
interrupted by the turmoil of the early 1970. and macroeconomic imbalances in
the early 1980..  Growth has accelerated to a rate of 52 %er annum since 1985,
rural-urban migration has been stemmed, and agriculture has become a dynamic
and increasingly vital sector in the economy. Currently, agriculture,
including forestry and fisheries, generates about 101 of GDP, employs 191 of
the labor force, and accounts for over one-third of the value of merchandise
exports.
3.        Recent growth is attributed largely to sustained liberalization of
the economy, macroeconomic stability, and fiscal stringency leading to a
favorable real exchange rate, particularly since 1985. Trade reforms and
deregulation of factor markets have been complemented by sectoral measures to
diminish the role of government in favor of private sector initiatives. With
a relatively small domestic market, exports have provided most of the growth,
led by fresh fruit, forest and fish products. The value of agriculture and
forest exports relative to net value of production increased from less than 51
in 1965 to 201 in 1982 and over 801 during 1988-90, while the share of total
foreign exchange earnings from agriculture, forestry, and fisheries rose from
81 in 1965 and 61 in 1973 to an average of 351 during 1988-90.
Import-competing crops have also responded to improved incentives and
productivity gains have helped to lower the share of food in total imports
from 202 in 1965 to 41 in 1988-90.
4.        About 352 of the cropped area is dependent on irrigation, including
all fruit orchards, which produced almost US$1 billion in foreign exchange
during 1991. For the past 15 years the role of the private sector in
irrigation has been promoted by public policies to transfer ownership and
operation and maintenance (O&M) of schemes to the users; recognize water
rights as a transferable private asset; require ex ante counterpart
contributions by beneficiaries of at least half the costs of public investment
under Law 1123; and reimburse up to 751 of the costs for small-scale private
investment with public funds allocated competitively under the Irrigation
Development Law 18450 (Lfl). These measures have resulted in much of the area
being operated and maintained by the users. Commercial farmers have also used



-2-
Lfl to invest in on-farm works that increase water security and use
efficiency. Howev-r, financial, technical, and institutional constraints have
prevented the vast majority of users from fulfilling their new role. The
ability of small farmers to prepare, construct, and finance their own on-farm
works and compete for LFR funds is limited. Moreover, for larger investments
that bring new areas under irrigation or rehabilitate and modernize
commonly-held headworks and conveyance and distribution systems, individual
constraints are exacerbated by organizational weakness. Thus, use of the LPR
by user groups and small farmers has been minimal and there has been no
investment under Law 1123. Consiquently, almost 40S of the irrigated area
still lacks secure water supplies, and incentives for improved efficiency in
water offered by transferable water rights have been undermined by
deteriorating works, improper and outdated design and inadequate 0&M.
5.        The Government has decided to increase investment in the irrigation
sub-sector in order to sustain agricultural and export growth, increase the
productive capacity of small farmers in poor rural areas, and protect
significant existing investments in irrigation infrastructure.  Toward this
end, the Government has taken several actions to increase the use of LFR by
small farmers' groups. It has also initiated under Law 1123 the completion of
the Pencahue Canal, which would bring under irrigation 12,400 ha by 1994 at a
cost of US$30.5 million. For rehabilitation and modernization and new small-
and medium-sized schemes not covered by the two above-mentioned programs,
potential demand for investment by user groups is estimated to have reached
US$500 million. The Government has requested Bank assistance in formulating
and financing a programmatic approach for responding to this demand. This
should address constraints on public and private institutions, efficiency,
equity, environmental and public savings considerations in the selection and
financing of potential investments, and the desire to support agricultural
development for small farmers.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project is in line
with the Bank lending strategy in Chile and the desire of the GOC tos
(a) ease bottlenecks to private investment and export expansion; (b) alleviate
poverty in rural areas; (c) prcmote environmentally sound investments; and
(d) improve the institutional capacity of the public sector. It is also
consistent with the 1990 World Bank Agricultural Sector Review, which
emphasized the need for the public sector to play a more catalytic role in
promoting private sector participation in rehabilitation and selected
expansion of the irrigated area. Bank involvement would facilitate
strengthening the role and capabilities of the private sector, improve the
allocation of public investment, and provide support for improved resource
management and environmental impact assessment capability in the sub-sector.
Finally, Bank financing would allow greater flexibility in setting terms for
capital cost recovery.
7.        The project would pay close attention to lessons learned from
projects in Chile and the LAC region as well as to the more general lessons
from wider Bank lending for irrigation. Although Bank-supported investments
in irrigation and drainage have been generally beneficial, the overall
operational performance has been poorer than expected and the sustainability
of many investments is uncertain. The physical infrastructure has often



-3-
deteriorated, leading in some cases to long-term declines in production and
low efficiency in water use. Inadequate O&M funding and institutional and
organizational problems have contributed to this shortfall in performance.
Borrowers often disengaged too early from projects and complementary services
have been inadequate or seriously delayed. Finally, cost recovery from
irrigation projects has not been good because of a lack of government
commitment and unreliable water supply due to poor O&M.
8.        Tie proposed project, the first Bank-financed irrigation investment
in Chile, would support beneficiary participation in irrigation development as
a means of avoiding many of the pitfalls associated with large-scale public
irrigation schemes. The Confederation of Canal Operators has been consulted
in project design and has played an active role in project preparation as have
local water user organizations. During implementation, farmer approval would
be required for proposed investments as well as for the proposed instituticnal
strengthening programs of their user o.ganizations. Further, to ensure that
investments do not actually subsidize and promote inadequate O&M by private
users, agreements would be reached with beneficiaries specifying standards for
OUM and remedies for non-compliance. There is little or no discriminatory
taxation of agciculture and O&M is largely in the hands of user groups;
however, government commitment would be required with agreements required for
setting overall parameters for cost recovery and implementing a credible
system for collection. To ensure the completion of on-farm works, private
investments would be supported through the Irrigation.Development Law, which
has proven to be an effective instrument. Extension services would be
provided under a successful ongoing public program in the Institute for
Agricultural Development (INDAP), which is targeted to small farmers and
supported by technical recommendations of the Agricultural Research Institute
(INIA). This is in line with the objectives of the recently approved
US$95 million loan for the Small Farmer Services Project, involving INDAP.
9.        Proiect Objectives.  The project would aim at improving the
operation and efficiency of existing and future irrigation schemes and
enhancing the welfare of small farmers in poor rural areas. This would be
done by improving the allocation and sustainability of investments and
strengthening the capabilities of user groups and small farmers.
10.       Project Descri2tion.  The project would include: (a) investment in
rehabilitation and modernization of existing irrigation schemes and in the
construction of new small- and medium-size schemes; (b) support to small
farmers for agricultural development to complement irrigation investment; and
(c) support for regularizing water titles and strengthening the managerial
capacity of user groups.
11.       To be eligible for financing under Law 1123, each investment would
have to have at least a 12S economic rate of return, be screened for potential
environmental impact, and have an overall environmental impact assessment. The
allocation of investment resources among eligible sub-projects would be based
on a system that includes both efficiency and equity considerations. Cohorts
vould be ranked by the net benefit-investment ratio derived from the net
benefit stream used for estimating the internal rate of return. Furthermore,
to enhance the achievement of equity objectives, up to 301 of total investment



-4-
funds could be used to finance eligible sub-projects targeted to the 100
poorest rural municipalities, regardless of their ranking, as long as they
meet the minimum economic aud onvironmental standards.
12.         Past experiences with public investment in irrigation worldwide
are replete with "white elephants" that appeared viable on paper but failed in
implementation largely because there was little or no participation of
beneficiaries in project design, implementation, and financing. Without
beneficiary participation, particularly on the financing side, economic
assumptions regarding expected benefits from proposed investments do not have
to meet the test of the market. Cost recovery that relies solely on indirect
recovery by taxing expected incremental benefits also suffers from this
weakness, because the farmer bears little risk if a costly investment fails to
achieve its objectives. To avoid this, the project would require both direct
and indirect cost recovery measures for the investments to be financed. The
level of direct cost recovery would be negotiated with the beneficiaries for
each individual investment. It would be between 10O1 to 501 of the cost of
investment, except in the case of small farmers when the level of direct cost
recovery could be below 502, subject to Bank approval.
13.       Project costs, including taxes and duties, are estimated at
US$118.7 million equivalent. Of this about US$45.0 million (382) represents
foreign exchange costs. Duties and taxes amount to US$19.7 million. Physical
contingencies have been estimated at US$0.2 million based on 5t contingencies
on all components except civil works, research and extension. Price
contingencies of US$11.6 million are based on Bank projected price increases
of about 3.71 annually during the life of the project. A Bank loan of
US$45.0 million equivalent is proposed to finance 451 of eligible project
costs net of taxes and duties. Bank financing would cover 1002 of foreign
exchange expenditures. The Bank would finance 411 of total public
expenditures on civil works, including studies and engineering and design
(US$43.0 million). It would also finance 1002 of technical assistance to MOP,
MAG, CYR and UC (US$2.0 million). Adaptive research (US$2.8 million),
technology transfer (US$1.7 million) and extension services by INDAP,
including required institutional strengthening (US$4.1 million) would be
carried out entirely with counterpart funds. Activities to strengthen user
groups, costing about US$2.5 million, would be also financed entirely through
counterpart funds. Finally the government would finance 1002 of incremental
recurrent costs for the UC and for the UAR (US$300,000).
14.       Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
proposed disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank-group operations in Chile are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 10850-CH, dated October 19, 1992 is attached.
15.       Retroactive Financint.  Up to US$4.5 million in eligible project
expenditures would be financed retroactively to April 1, 1992, to maintain
momentum gained during preparaton and to permit the initiation of works during
the off-season for agriculture.

16.       Actions Ar_egd.  Prior to negotiations, the Government sent to the
Bank: (a) a draft agreement with INIA to carry out the adaptive ressarch and
technology transfer; (b) final versions of reference bidding documents,
incorporating Bank comtents; (c) a capital cost recovery mechanisms and (d) a
plan for accounts and audits. During negotiations, tlhe Government of Chile
agreed to: (a) provide funding for adaptive irrigation research (about US$2.8
million) and for technology transfer (about US$1.7 million); (b) finance
extension services for small farmers in areas receiving project irrijation
investments, to be provided by INDAP through adequate counterpart
contributions estimated to cost US$4.1 million; (c) finance both the
regularization of water titles and training of user groups with counterpart
funds (US$2.5 million); and (d) provided a satisfactory Annual Work Plan (POA)
for 1992 and agreed to provide POAs satisfactory to the Bank for subsequent
calendar years by November 15 of the preceding year. The Borrower submitted
the following documents for 8ank's review and agreements (a) a draft
agreement with INDAP to carry out extension services; (b) full feasibility
studies for first-year investments; and (c) a letter confiraiug the Project
Coordinating Unit satisfactorily staffed and operating.
17.       Conditions of Effectiveness would be: (a) the signed agreements
with INIA to carry out the adaptive research and technology transfer and with
INDAP to carry out the extension services; (b) agreed terms of reference for
the agriculture technical support unit (UAR); and (c) accounting procedures
acceptable to the Bank for each agency and the UC.
18.       Benefits.  The main project benefits would include:  (a) expansion
of the irrigated area benefiting mostly small farmers in marginal rainfed
areast (b) enhanced environment and efficiency in water allocation resulting
from improved conservation and management of water resources; and (c) greater
water security leading to improved yields, better quality output, and
increased investment in high-val%ed export crops.
19.       Risks. Both the size and complexity of the proposed project appear
to be within the capacity of the public agencies involved. However, because
there has been no public investment in irrigation in the past 15 years, their
ability to coordinate and implement the project remains untested. To minimize
any risk, an inastitutional skills gap analysis was undertaken and measures
have been included to strengthen areas of weakness that could affect
implementation. Given the lack of success worldwide in cost recovery of
irrigation investments and the poor performance in Chile of recovering loans
from other sectors, the commitment of government to cost recovery is also a
risk. The overall risk of non-collection, however, would be substantially
reduced by having the Treasury collect the debt along with the property tax,
for which the collection rate is 99X.
20.       Environmental Aagects.  The project was classified as "A" because
of the potential for sub-projects to have a negative impact on the
environment. A sectoral assessment (EA) was undertaken to identify
environmental issues in the sub-sector, review the potential impact of
investments and recommend the institutional arrangements and strengthening
required for screening and evaluating investments, as well as monitoring and
mitigating adverse environmental impacts. All sub-projects eligible for



- 6 -
financing would be subject to an environmental impact assessment to detect
current and potential environmental problems and recommend appropriate changes
in design or mitigating measures. Such assessments would have to comply with
the corresponding legislation and the Bank's regulations included in its
Environmental Guidelines for Irrigation and Drainage Projects.
21.       The project would implement procedures for screening and assessing
environmental impacts of public investment in irrigation, which would
formalize the participation of affected groups in project design and
implementation. This selection process and cost recovery would help to curb
excess demand for irrigation and ensure the viability and sustainability of
investments. Rehabilitation of works and the strengthening of user groups in
operation and maintenance would improve water use efficiency and conservation.
Finally, support for adaptive research would also enhance efforts to deal with
critical environmental problems such as salinity.
22.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
