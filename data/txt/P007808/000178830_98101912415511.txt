I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A.   SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
Background
1.01      Panama's strategic geographic location at the crossroads between the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and the North and South American Continents, has
profoundly influenced the nature of the country's economic development. Trade
and communication routes across the Isthmus of Panama have existed since the
Spanish Conquest. The transshipment of passengers and merchandise flourished
following the construction of the railway across the isthmus in the 1850s, and
the completion of the Panama Canal in 1914 gave further impetus to the critical
role of trade and services in the economy. To this day, Panama's economy has
retained its externally oriented service-centered character (services accounted
for 48% of 1977 CDP), while industrial activity, despite recent growth, has
remained at a comparatively low level (15.6% of 1977 GDP).
1.02      Until shortly after World War II the major urban centers, Panama
City and Colon, were heavily involved in commerce with the Canal Zone and
international traffic through the Canal. Development of Panama's industrial
sector was slow due to its small market and limited resource base. During the
last two decades, however, local and foreign investment in manufacturing in-
creased given the stimulus of industrial incentive legislation, the growing
availability of industrial credit from private and public banks, and a climate
favorable for foreign investment. There was a notable shift of local merchants
and traders into manufacturing, particularly for the local market.
1.03      Growth in manufacturing in Panama exceeded 10% p.a. during 1960-70,
based largely on import substitution industrialization. However, the manu-
facturing sector experienced a slowdown in growth during 1972-74, growing more
slowly than GDP and even declining in 1974, but there are indications that
the nadir of this recession is now past (Table 1-1).

1.04      The slowdown in manufacturing growth that occured after 1970 was due
to a number of factors, including exhaustion of the first phase of the import-
substitution process and subsequently concern about government policies towards
the private sector, the uncertain prospects of the Canal Treaties, and the
collapse of a private construction boom in high income housing and commercial
buildings. The latter led to a sharp decline in demand for construction
materials which historically amounted to about 20% of industrial output.
Furthermore, domestic demand for industrial products was dampened as Panama
was hit with the successive external shocks of skyrocketing costs of fuel,
world inflation, and international recession. As a result of the decline in
the growth of manufacturing, the sector's share in GDP, 1/ which had steadily
increased from 13.1% in 1960 to 15.9% in 1970, declined after 1970, falling to
14.9% of GDP in 1975.
1.05      In contrast to manufacturing, the services sector (commerce; trans-
port, warehousing and communications; public and private services; banking,
insurance and financial services; and services sold to the Canal zone)
continued to grow and to dominate the Panamanian economy in 1975, accounting
for 49% of GDP (Table 1-2) compared to 45.2% in 1950. Within the sector,
the major expansion during the past three decades has been in commerce,
transport, warehousing, and communications as well as financial services.

Industrial Sector Structure
1.06      There has been relatively little change in Panama's industrial
structure since 1960, as shown in Table 1-3. Consumer goods industries still
accounted for 67.1/a of the total industrial product in 1975, although they
were down from a 72.7% share in 1960 mainly as a result of a decline in the
share of clothing and shoes.  oin the other hand, the share of food products
increased 7.5A during this period, and tne share of construction materials
industries (wood, wood products, metal products, metallic and non-metallic
minerals) were up from 16.3% in 1960 to 22.8% in 1975 due to increases in the
metal products industry. Finally, the share of intermediate goods industries
(chemicals, paper and products, leather and rubber) during 1960-75 remained
around the same level (6.5% in 1975). This industrial structure stems in
large part from Panama's small market size and limited resource base.

1.07      The majority of industrial firms in Panama, based on the number of
employees, are small. In 1975, 90.5% of the firms had between 5 and 99
employees. 1/ However, they employed only 56% of all industrial employees
and produced only 42% of industrial output of Panama. In contrast, the remain-
ing 9.5% of the firms (100 and more employees), with 44% of the employees of
the industrial sector, were producing 58% of the industrial output of Panama.
There was little change in the size composition of firms in Panama between
1970-75. However, larger firms increased their share of employees in the
industrial sector as well as the share of value added (Table 1-4).
1/   Enterprises with less than 5 employees are defined as artisan activities.

Investment in Manufacturing
1.08      The manufacturing investment statistics available are somewhat
incomplete. However, according to available statistics (Table 1-5), private
investment in manufacturing has been steadily and relatively increasing in the
period 1961-76 although following a cyclical trend. In 1961 the private sector
invested US$8.3 million (1.8% of GDP). This figure increased in 1970 to
US$28.7 million (2.7% of GDP). After a peak in 1974, when the private sector
invested US$91.2 million (5% of GDP), investment in manufacturing declined to
US$43 million (2.2% of GDP) in 1975, increasing again in 1976 to US$63.4
million (3.1% of GDP). It is estimated that in 1977 this figure declined as
a result of the uncertainty of the results of the negotiations about the
Canal Treaties. Overall private investment in 1977 has been estimated at
US$157 million (7% of GDP), a drastic decline from the average of 17% of GDP
during 1970-76.

1.09      Direct foreign investment is one of the major components of private
investment in manufacturing. The total value of foreign direct investment
increased at annual average of US$17.7 million between 1972 and 1975 (Table
1-6) with substantial increases in 1973 and 1974 but a sharp decline in 1975.
In 1976 there was a net disinvestment of US$6.3 million, reflecting the reces-
sion and uncertainties about the outcome of the canal negotiations.

Manufacturing Employment
1.10      The manufacturing sector employed about 47,000 persons in 1976, or
9.5% of the economically active population (496,000) (Table 1-7). While the
share of manufacturing employment increased 2.2% since 1960, the share of other
economic sectors increased even more. During the same period services and
commerce share increased 8.8% and 4.4% respectively. Employment increase in
these sectors offset the slight absolute declines in employment in agriculture
and the Canal Zone. With an aggressive promotional policy, the manufacturing
sector could provide significant additional employment opportunities for the
economically active population of Panama.

1.11      In 1976, within the manufacturing sector, food processing (food
products and beverages) accounted for 36.7% of total manufacturing employment,
clothing 14.4%, furniture 4.1%, publishing 6.4%, non-metallic minerals, mostly
cement and construction materials 6.1%, and metal products 4.8%. These six
industry sectors accounted for over 70% of total employment in manufacturing.
Decentralization of Industry
1.12      Panama City has the heaviest concentration of manufacturing activity
in the country (62% of industrial establishments), with much smaller indus-
trial centers located at David/Chiriqui (10%) and Colon (5%). Special fiscal



- 7 -
incentives (para. 1.19) are offered for manufacturing investment in nine
designated districts whether production is for the local or export markets.
1.13      In view of the difficulties in establishing manufacturing opetations
in the more remote, backward regions of the country, the fiscal incentives do
not appear to have attracted a significant amount of new manufacturing to the
designated districts. A new rural and urban growth and service center project
(URBE) has been formulated by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy,
with the assistance of the UNDP and USAID with the aim of fostering the devel-
opment of the Central and Western regions through improved public infrastruc-
ture and services and the promotion of private investment in agroprocessing
industries.
Exports
1.14      The structure of Panama's exports was substantially different in
1976 as compared to 1960, largely as a result of the increases in oil 1/
exports (Table 1-8). The growth of exports (in absolute and relative terms)
of the manufacturing sector has also been contributing to the diversification
of Panamanian exports. In 1976 manufactured exports, other than agroindustry,
amounted to US$13 million and represented 5.7% of total exports as compared to
less than 1% in 1965. Nevertheless, exports of these products represented
less than 5% of output.
1.15      The principal exports of Panama in addition to fuel and lubricants
are basically sugar, bananas and shrimp exported mainly to US and West Germany.
However, the exports of fish meal (to US, West Germany and Costa Rica), rum,
fish oil (Colombia) and miscellaneous manufactures have been increasing.
Panama is also exporting high quality clothing to the Caribbean area and
specialized heavy-duty security boots and shoes to Europe and the Caribbean.
Kraft paper bags are also exported to Central America.  In recent years Panama
has begun export of manufactured food products in small amounts including
banana puree (Europe, US), fruit extracts (Europe), mayonnaise and mustard
(Central America).
1/   In 1976 fuel and lubricant exports, which are largely heavy fuel oils,
declined, due mainly to changes in the international market for these
items. The growth of these exports has been aided by the incentives
established by the Government in 1974 (para. 1.30). Preliminary indi-
cations are that there was continued expansion of this trade in 1977.

1.16      Panamanian trade with the Central American Common Market (CACM) has
increased since 1970 with exports rising at an average of 60.6% p.a. and
imports only 39.9% p.a. until 1976. This is a drastic shift from the pattern
during 1965-70 when exports increased at 40% p.a. and imports 84.4% p.a. The
shift in the pattern of trade with the CACM countries is basically the result



- 9 -
of preferential treatment that Panamanian products receive under bilateral
agreements. Nevertheless, while exports to the region in 1976 were US$13.9
million (mainly to Costa Rica and Nicaragua), imports amounted to US$31.9
million (principally from Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala). 1/
The Colon Free Zone
1.17      The Colon Free Zone was established in 1953 as a source of employ-
ment and net export earnings. Since then net exports (re-exports minus
imports) have risen from US$6.2 million to about US$100 million in 1977 (imports
of US$700 million and re-exports of US$800 million). Aside from book-printing
and binding, and the repackaging of pharmaceuticals, the Colon Free Zone
accounts for little manufacturing activity, and is predominantly a warehousing
and transshipment center.
The Canal Zone
1.18      The new Canal Treaty was signed on October 17, 1977 and instruments
of ratification were exchanged on June 16, 1978. Formal implementation begins
October 1, 1979 and ends December 31, 1999 when the Canal and all ancillary
facilities revert to Panama. The immediate financial benefits to Panama
include net fiscal receipts of about US$57 million per year. The United
States has also pledged its best efforts to arrange up to US$200 million in
supplier's credits; up to US$75 million in guarantees under a USAID housing
program; a guarantee from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation
(OPIC) which will permit up to US$20 million in borrowings for development
finance in United States commercial markets; and US$50 million in military
sales credits. Assets reverting to Panama in 1979 include the three ports of
Balboa, Cristobal, and Coco Solo, the railroad from Balboa to Cristobal, two
unused airfields, much valuable land, and most service outlets of the Panama
Canal Company's supply division.
Imports
1.19      The structure of imports has been affected by the recent oil price
increases (Table 1-9) and, as a consequence, fuel and lubricants now represent
about 40% of imports. 2/ The other major import categories include pharma-
ceutical and cosmetic products, fertilizers, synthetic resins, tires, pdper
and fabrics (natural and synthetic). Imports of machinery for industry (mainly
sugar and construction), transportation, communications and for the production
of energy are also important. During the 1965-76 period the increase in the
value of imports was 3.7 times that of exports. Imports' share rose from 28.7%
of GDP to 38.1% in 1976 while that of exports remained unchanged.
1/   Further exploration of opportunities based on the bilateral agreement
seems to be appropriate.
2/   There was a slight decline in petroleum imports in 1976 as a result of
the fall in exports (para. 1.14) and a decline in domestic consumption
of fuel oils reflecting the increase in hydro-foam.

B.   INDUSTRIAL POLICIES
Incentive Legislation
1.20      Since the early post-war period, Panama has adopted a series of
special laws designed to promote investment in manufacturing. The present law
which determines benefits and conditions was passed in 1970 with modifications
introduced in 1971 and 1976. Benefits are provided to virtually any manufac-
turing activity with special provisions for exporting and for those located



- 11 -
in specified districts away from Panama City or Colon where the Government is
seeking to promote the growth of new industrial poles. To obtain the benefits
under the laws, locally incorporated enterprises (both foreign and domestically
owned) enter into contracts with the Government committing themselves to a
time-table for construction, to favoring the employment of Panamanians and to
using to the maximum available local inputs in production. The law is very
general regarding these commitments and no attempts have been made to quantify
them in the individual contracts. The contracts can be for a maximum of 15
years, except 20 years for those firms which locate in the new industrial
areas.
1.21      The benefits include exoneration from import duties and related
taxes on imported equipment and machinery and on imported raw materials,
intermediates and fuels used in the production process. Enterprises producing
for the local market receive exoneration of income taxes on profits only to
the extent that these are re-invested for expansion or to produce new products,
provided that the reinvestment exceeds 20% of net profit. 1/ In the case of
exports, profits from foreign sales are exempt from income taxes. 2/ Addi-
tional exonerations on land, capital, fixed assets and sales taxes are pro-
vided to exporters and to enterprises located in the new industrial centers.
1.22      The main benefit of the law for firms producing for the local market,
however, is the provision permitting the qualifying enterprises to request
protection through the establishment of quotas on competing imported goods.
Three types of quotas are permitted. In the first place, a firm may request
that, as part of the contract with the Government, imports be restricted
during the period required for it to initiate operations, so as to avoid
excessive inventory accumulation during that time of competing imported goods
which could adversely affect sales of the new enterprise. The level of imports
permitted would be based on that prevailing in previous years ("cuota de
normalizacion de importaciones").
1.23      Secondly, once established, a beneficiary firm can request quotas
for protection from "international dumping." The law defines "dumping" as
occurring when the exporting firm charges f.o.b. prices for exports to Panama
below those prevailing in its own domestic market or when there is a "sharp
decline" in the price of a product to Panamanian importers.
1.24      Finally, the law provides that import quotas can be established when
local producers are not able to supply the full amount required for the
domestic market as a means of ensuring adequate supplies for local consumption.
In practice, however, this has been broadly interpreted to provide virtually
1/   Firms located in the new industrial centers and which produce for the
local market receive full exoneration of income taxes for the first five
years of production and 50% exoneration for the next three years.
2/   For those enterprises exporting part of their production, the exoneration
applies proportionately.



- 12 -
full protection against imports for a large number of goods by establishing
nominal quotas for those items in order to abide by the letter of the law; for
example, in the case of some textiles, garments and shoes, the annual import
quotas are one dozen units or pairs.
1.25      At the present time about 260 items 1/ in the Panamanian tariff
nomenclature are subject to quotas but no attempt has been made to quantify
the importance of quotas or the extent of effective protection they provide.
While direct price comparisons of individual products have not been undertaken,
the general prevailing impression is that the essential openness of the
economy and the difficulty in administering quotas have prevented very large
differences in domestic prices vis-a-vis those prevailing in foreign markets.
The provision for quotas was introduced in 1971, replacing the 1970 structure
of tariff incentives which has been geared to promoting efficient industrial
operations. Under that system, products would have been granted initially
increased tariff protection for a specified period of time after which the
level of protection would have been gradually reduced.
Tariff Structure
1.26      The present tariff structure was introduced in 1957 2/ and has under-
gone only slight modifications since that time. Analysis of its impact is
difficult to undertake since a large number of the items (particularly among
non-durable consumer goods and intermediates) are subject to specific duties
(based on weights or units) while others are ad valorem. As most of the
specific rates have been unchanged, the general price increase which has
occurred over the last 20 years has substantially reduced the importance of
these duties.
1.27      An estimate of the average level of nominal tariff protection by
major product categories was prepared in 1973, based on a simple average of
individual items and prices prevailing at that time (Table 1-10). In general,
the rates were found to be relatively low except for the categories of
beverages and tobacco and crude materials. High tariffs for the first two
items, as in most countries, reflect revenue and social considerations. In
the case of crude materials, the average is affected by very high rates for
wood items. The recent widespread use of the incentive law to obtain exonera-
tion from duties on such imports, however, has sharply reduced the effective
yield of these tariffs (i.e., the ratio of actual duties paid to the value of
imports) and for this particular category the effective rate, which had
averaged around 20% in the 1960s, fell to slightly over 10% in 1974-77.
1/   It should be noted, however, that import quotas for a number of foodstuffs
have been in effect since the 1960s under the 1957 incentive law which
was primarily aimed at promoting agro-industries.
2/   The classification is very similar to that adopted by the five CACM
countries, reflecting the similarity in economic structures.

1.28      Import duties, which in 1960 had represented almost 35% of central
government revenues, accounted for only a little over 10% in 1976. As can be
seen in Table 1-11, the increase in exonerations stemming from increased use
of the incentive laws played a significant role in that decline.

1.29      Given the broad language of the existing law, virtually all new
investments and expansions since the end of 1970 have made use of these incen-
tives. In the three-year period through 1973 some 130 contracts were signed
with enterprises for new installations or expansion; the peak was reached in
1974 with the approval of 71 contracts. In 1975 and 1976, reflecting the
recession which had begun in 1974, only 38 and 39 contracts, respectively,
were approved. Preliminary indications are that in 1977 there was an increase
in the number of contracts approved.
Export Incentives
1.30      In addition to the fiscal incentives provided to promote new invest-
ment in export-oriented activities described above, at the end of 1974 the
Government instituted a system for the reimbursement of taxes for all exports
of non-traditional manufactured products; the main products excluded are sugar,
processed bananas, coffee, meat, processed shrimp, fishmeal, and petroleum
products. The reimbursement, equivalent to 20% of local value added, is in
the form of a tax certificate ("certificado de abono tributario," or CAT)
which can be used for the payment of any direct tax after a specified time
period. Limited use was made of this system, however, until the CAT was made
transferable in December 1976. According to MICI data, the value of the
certificates issued rose from US$246,588 in 1975-76 to US$585,854 in 1976-77.
1.31      As part of the effort to expand exports, the Government is now
considering establishment of a new Institute of Foreign Trade to provide
marketing, technical and promotional services for exports of manufactured
products. At present the MICI and its Center for Export Promotion are inade-
quately staffed and funded to provide these services, particularly for small-
and medium-size firms wishing to enter the export market.
C.   PROSPECT AND PROJECT IMPLICATIONS
Short-Term Perspectives
1.32      The prospect for improvement in manufacturing growth appears to be
reasonably good for 1978 and 1979 according to a recent survey of private
sector investment undertaken by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy.
After a three-year period of industrial recession, business executives polled
in the survey report they are more favorably inclined to initiate new invest-
ments due to a series of factors, including the removal of the uncertainties
surrounding the new Canal Treaties, stability in labor-management relations
and the government program of infrastructure works.
1.33      Through the end of 1979, the Government expects some recovery in
private investment in the construction industry for homes. This expectation
has received recent confirmation; after dropping 75% in the past five years,



- 15 -
the value of private construction permits in Panama City rose 40% in the first
five months in 1978 compared to the same period in 1977. Such a resurgence of
housing construction would have a favorable impact on the depressed construc-
tion materials industry.
1.34      Other investment projects are also moving ahead which will have
important effects, directly or indirectly, on manufacturing. The Government,
through the national industrial development bank, Corporacion Financiera
Nacional (COFINA), and a US company, are sponsoring a US$42 million oil
storage and transshipment facility to handle Alaskan oil destined for US East
Coast ports. Construction began in mid-1978. A US$14 million glass container
factory with Panamanian, German, US, and IFC participation is also underway.
Other proposed joint ventures involve US, Japanese, Italian and Colombian
investors. Although the attitude of local investors appears to be more
cautious than of foreign investors, COFINA's pipeline includes 14 locally
sponsored projects for consumer and intermediate goods with total costs of
about US$13 million. In addition, COFINA will provide financial assistance to
two new hotel projects with total costs of US$25 million--one at the new
Tocumen airport and the other adjacent to the new convention center.
1.35      The ratification of the Canal Treaties now makes it possible for
the Colon Free Zone authorities to incorporate into Free Zone an area of the
former US-owned airport facility (France Field) and integrate the port of
Cristobal into the Free Zone operation. The Colon Free Zone expansion
contemplates the use of France Field and the adjacent area as a site for
additional trading, distribution and manufacturing operations. Buildings
and related infrastructure for manufacturing are now being constructed in the
France Field area and high priority will be given to attracting light manu-
facturing and assembly industries. COFINA expects to help promote and finance
such industries.
1.36      The Government believes that private investment will be the key to
future economic expansion and employment generation. The authorities have
made considerable effort to assure local and foreign private investors of their
desire to provide attractive investment climate. Another important step the
Government took to encurage new private investment was the establishment of
COFINA, which is becoming the principal source of long-term financing for
the industrial sector. The proposed loan would provide major assistance to
COFINA by providing about 34% of its total resource requirements through
year-end 1980, and by helping COFINA to act increasingly as a catalyst in
mobilizing additional resources from banks operating in Panama.
Long-term Considerations
1.37      The strategic geographic location of Panama, its infrastructure in
transportation, communications, and services, the availability of human
resources with potential for developing important skills and the possibility
of developing a strong agricultural base are important factors that favor the
development of the industrial sector in Panama. These comparative advantages
suggest that in the longer run the Government emphasize the promotion of



- 16 -
export-oriented industries. In addition, small-scale industry could play an
important role in these efforts to strengthen and expand the existing indus-
trial sector in Panama. Small-scale industry could serve primarily the
domesic market and, at the same time, contribute to improving the distribution
of income and to the decentralization policies of the Government.
1.38      Among export-oriented industries, agro-industries based on food
processing have already experienced considerable success, both in nearby
countries as well as in the markets of developed countries, and there are good
prospects for further expansion. 1/ There has also recently been an expansion
in exports of wood and paper products and of leather which similarly could be
further developed.  Among other manufactured products, there has been substan-
tial growth in clothing exports. With the assistance of international and
bilateral agencies such as UNDP and USAID, prefeasibility studies to identify
additional investment opportunities for export, including the assembly
industries, have been undertaken.
1.39      There is a need, however, for an industrial survey which would help
identify additional subsectors of the manufacturing and service industries in
which Panama has important comparative advantage and which would provide
guidance in determining the most effective government policies to achieve
the objective of further industrialization and the expansion of manufactured
exports. This was discussed with MPEP and COFINA and both agreed that such
a survey was called for. MPEP and COFINA have agreed to be responsible for
carrying out the study. The study would also include a review of the small
scale industry subsector. MPEP has the necessary funds available for the
survey. The first phase of the survey would involve a review and updating of
the existing studies to establish priorities for further investigations; this
phase is expected to be completed by December 31, 1979. The Bank would, in
connection with the proposed project: (i) help COFINA and MPEP prepare draft
terms of reference for the survey; and (ii) follow up closely on its preparation
and implementation in connection with the Bank's normal project supervision
visits and economic and sector discussions.
1.40      Recovery in economic activity should permit restructuring of the
investment incentive laws to ensure efficiency in the industrial sector and to
promote investment in export-oriented operations rather than in uneconomic
import-substitution. In the meantime, under the proposed loan, COFINA would
be committed to undertake economic evaluation of subprojects so as to ensure
proper allocation of the financial resources being made available (para 3.07).
1/   As noted earlier (para. 1.16), bilateral treaties with the five CACM
countries provides special access for Panamanian exports but only limited
advantage has been taken so far of these opportunities.

Small-Scale Industry Lending
1.41      MICI established a lending program for small-scale industries in
June 1965. However, operating with limited financial and staff resources, it
approved only 99 loans totalling US$592,200 from June 1965 through December
1977. MICI makes loans of up to US$15,000 to small industry projects (the
ceiling was raised from US$10,000 to US$15,000 in early 1978) for either new
ventures or the expansion of existing ones. An interest rate of 7% is charged
on loans up to US$10,000 and an additional 1% for technical assistance on
loans exceeding US$10,000. Loans for fixed assets are made for up to five
years with six months grace and for working capital, three years with three
months grace. Loans approved are divided nearly equally between new enter-
prises (44%) and the expansion of existing ventures (56%). Since starting up
its operations in June 1965, the default rate of the program has been
unusually low (0.4% of total loans were written off as bad debts), and in
mid-1978 only about 7% of the US$300,000 in outstanding loans were in arrears.
1.42      Under the URBE project (para. 1.13), the MICI small-scale industry
credit program will be expanded and its portfolio widened to include small-
scale commercial and service enterprises. MICI has regional offices in David,
Santiago, Chiriqui, and Los Santos. According to MICI authorities, there is
considerable unsatisfied demand by eligible investors for the small-scale
industry credits. For example, requests are received at the rate of about
US$150,000 a year in Panama City alone. Under the proposed industrial credit,
COFINA would be permitted to relend to MICI up to US$1 million to help finance
the small-scale industry credit program (para. 4.10), after it has appraised
the program and after receiving approval of the Bank. The Bank would base its
approval on a field evaluation to determine the adequacy of the program. In
its review the Bank would focus, inter alia, on the onlending mechanism and
interest rate to subborrowers, on the adequacy of the technical assistance
arrangements under the program and on the criteria for eligibility of
sub-borrowers.

II. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
A.   BACKGROUND
The Financial and Monetary System
2.01      Panama's financial and monetary system is unique in Latin America.
There is no central bank and the US dollar is the country's unit of exchange,
with free circulation and no controls. The official monetary unit, the
balboa, exists only for accounting purposes and in coinage, but not in bank
notes. Regulatory functions are carried out by four agencies. The Ministry
of Finance handles treasury functions; the Comptroller General prepares and
audits fiscal and national accounting and issues public debt bonds; the
Ministry of Planning is responsible for the national budget, medium-term
financial programs, and presides over the National Banking Commission (NBC),
which supervises the banking system; and the Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP),
which also operates as a commercial bank, serves as the government's depository
and fiscal agent. Finally, the Finance Commission, made up of the heads of
these four agencies, designs and supervises the nation's fiscal policy.
2.02      The banking system in Panama is predominantly oriented to inter-
national business. As of December 31, 1977, the system comprised 83 banks
with total assets of US$16.5 billion, 1/ reflecting the government's conscious
and successful efforts to promote Panama as a regional financial center.
A recent banking law, effective since 1970, established minimum standards
for banks registered in Panama and created the NBC to supervise the system.
Commercial banks are licensed according to three categories: Type A, general
banks empowered to do business in and outside Panama; Type B, off-shore banks
limited to do business outside Panama; and Type C, representative offices.
Although local transactions are subject to standards set by the NBC under
the law, foreign transactions of general as well as off-shore banks are
almost entirely unregulated, except for limited supervision to ensure
responsible behavior. As a result of this attractive banking environment,
further enhanced by Panama's advantageous geographic location, many major
international banks from North America, Western Europe, and Asia, as well
as banks from other Latin American countries, have established offices or
branches in Panama.
2.03      As of February 1978, the banking system supervised by the NBC
consisted of 47 private commercial banks operating under a general license
(Type A), 25 private international banks operating under an off-shore license
(Type B), and 9 international private banks with representative offices,
and 2 government banks--BNP, a combined commercial and official bank, and
the Caja de Ahorros, a savings bank. In addition there are three other
government-owned financial institutions audited by the Comptroller General:
the Banco Hipotecario Nacional, a mortgage bank; the Banco de Desarrollo
Agropecuario, an agricultural development bank; and COFINA, a development
finance company. There are also five private savings and loan banks
1/   Panama's 1977 GDP is estimated at US$2.3 billion (current dollars).



- 19 -
and numerous unregulated small consumer finance companies. Although a National
Securities Commission was established in 1970, no formal stock exchange
exists; limited trading in financial certificates, bonds and stocks is handled
by authorized independent brokers. Bond issues have been made from time to
time by private enterprises, the Caja de Ahorros and the government itself.
Development of the Financial Sector
2.04      Panama's money supply is directly related to its balance of payments
and its ability to borrow externally. The government cannot control money in
circulation or the exchange rate. To a greater extent than usual, the capital
account of the balance of payments sets the monetary level of the country and
influences aggregate demand. Through the mid-1960s, Panama was highly dependent
on monetary policies pursued by the US Federal Reserve System, however, by 1965
some of its banks began to capture off-shore funds in the rapidly growing euro-
dollar market thus gradually reducing the system's linkage to the US Federal
Reserve.
2.05      As the eurodollar market continued to grow, not only legitimate
banks but also many spurious "banks" set up offices in Panama. After the
passage of the 1970 banking law, 227 so-called "banks" were stricken from
registry in Panama, leaving a firm but much smaller base of 20 reputable
banking institutions that grew steadily. The stated objectives of the
Banking Law were to ensure the solidarity and efficiency of the banking
system in order to (i) promote monetary and credit conditions conducive to
the stability and sustained growth of the national economy; and (ii) to
strengthen and promote the proper conditions for the development of Panama as
an international financial center. The new banking law fostered rapid growth
of the banking system. By December 1977 total bank assets reached US$16.5
billion (Table 2-1), fourteen times the 1971 figure, and financial sector
employment grew to over 7,000 persons while the sector's contribution to
GDP reached 6.6%.

International Banking
2.06      The greatest expansion of the system was in international banking.
Foreign loans rose from US$246 million in 1971 to US$8,277 million in 1977,
while foreign deposits increased at an even higher rate, rising from US$603
million to US$14,006 million. Interbank deposits represent the largest
share of off-shore deposits, accounting for 77% of the total at the end of
1976. However, the share of foreign individuals and private company deposits
has been growing, indicating increasing acceptability and trust in the
Panamanian banking system. Foreign private non-bank deposits reached
US$1,308 million by year-end 1976, of which about 10% were demand deposits.
The two principal uses of off-shore funds are for loans (61% in 1976) and
interbank deposits (30%).



- 21 -
2.07      The excess of off-shore sources of funds over off-shore uses provides
a potentially important source of funds for domestic loans. Partly because no
exchange risk is involved, banks have in fact been using foreign source funds
for domestic loans. By the end of December 1977, domestic loans had increased
to US$1,767 million from US$420 million in 1971 (321%), while domestic deposits
had increased much more slowly (180%) to US$1,195 million from US$427 million.
The ratio of domestic loans to domestic deposits indicates that the domestic
sector has benefited greatly from Panama's growth as a financial center and
its ready accessibility to banks with surplus funds. The exact amount is not
clear 1/ but it has been growing throughout the 1970s.
Domestic Banking
2.08      Despite the large number of banks operating in Panama, almost
two-thirds of domestic bank lending is handled by only six banks: five
private banks (Chase Manhattan Bank, Citibank, Banco de Colombia, Banco
Fiduciario and Bank of America) and the government-owned BNP. As of the
end of 1976 the major five private banks had domestic loans outstanding
totalling US$735 million compared to domestic source deposits of US$352
million. However, the share of local loan balances of the remaining
42 type A-licensed private banks will probably continue to increase as it has
in recent years (from 28% in 1973 to 38% in 1976) as these banks become better
established in the local economy.
2.09      Preliminary 1977 statistics show that the banking system has concen-
trated its domestic lending in commerce and consumer finance (37% of total
loans), public entities (23%) and real estate and construction (23%),
as shown in Table 2-2. Since 1971, lending to industry has remained relatively
constant at about 9% of total loans. As one might expect, commercial banks
tend to give priority to trade financing in the commerce sector where maturi-
ties are relatively short (up to two years) and credit analysis is uncompli-
cated. During the rapid growth of the banking system from 1971 to 1975 there
was heavy competition among a growing number of banks to make domestic loans, 2/
but the supply of funds that banks were willing to lend in the local economy
far exceeded the demand for trade financing. Therefore, commercial banks
turned to lending to (i) the public sector as the government increased its
involvement in the economy, and (ii) the construction and real estate sector,
encouraged by government policies favoring such lending and by a real estate
"boom" which was fueled in part by speculation. By 1975 overbuilding led to
several failures of real estate ventures and the subsequent loan losses by
commercial banks are reported to have been substantial. This experience and
1/   A simple comparison of domestic loans and domestic deposits suggests
a large inflow. In 1977, for example, domestic loans exceeded domestic
sight and time deposits by US$572 million; however, information on the
sources and uses of funds in the banking system is insufficient for
more detailed analysis.
2/   Most international banks with offices in Panama are keen to maintain
a favorable image in the host country by supporting the domestic economy.



- 22 -
the domestic recession led to a cautious attitude on the part of commercial
banks toward domestic lending in general and a slowing of the rate of growth
of domestic loans in 1977. Many of these banks, however, are optimistic that
the situation will turn around in 1978-79.

Interest Rates
2.10      Interest rates are unrestricted in Panama except that:  (i) interest
rates paid on savings accounts cannot exceed 4.5% p.a. for commercial banks
and 5.5% p.a. for mortgage banks; (ii) interest payments on demand deposits
are prohibited; and (iii) interest rates on time deposits are unrestricted
but time deposits cannot be established for amounts of less than US$14,000.
Interest paid on savings deposits is exempt from taxes. Furthermore, commer-
cial banks are required to invest a minimum of 50% of their local savings
deposits either in local housing mortgage loans with terms of at least
10 years or in 6.5% mortgage bonds issued by the National Mortgage Bank.
2.11      The openness of the Panamanian economy and banking system has
resulted in an interest rate structure for deposits and loans which is
based largely on eurodollar rates (LIBOR).  Banks compete for deposits by
offering rates closely related to the eurodollar market. Loans to non-
government entities usually have interest rates of 2% or more over LIBOR
for multinational companies and companies with top credit ratings. Interest
rates for other companies are usually fixed rates between 12% and 14% p.a. for
terms up to two years depending on the size and credit rating of the borrower.
Longer term loans, when available, usually carry adjustable interest rates
based on LIBOR.

B.   INDUSTRIAL CREDIT FACILITIES
Commercial Banks
2.12      Although industrial enterprises benefit from the ready availability
of commercial credit (Table 2-3), there is a scarcity of medium- and long-term
credit to industry as commercial banks traditionally prefer short-term trade
financing and are reluctant to provide longer-term financing of industrial
expansion projects or new ventures. Only the largest and most financially
sound industrial enterprises have access to medium-term (5-7 years) credit.
These firms are few in number, and the commercial banks consequently have made
relatively few industrial term credits.

Other Institutions
2.13      Three government entities, COFINA, BNP, and MICI, and one private
institution, Desarrollo Industrial, S.A. (DISA) provide term credit to
industry. COFINA, established in December 1975, is an autonomous government
development bank which specializes in industrial lending, including tourism,
agroindustries, and service industries. By May 1978 it had approved US$7.8
million in medium- and long-term loans. Its operations are discussed in
detail in Chapter III.
2.14      Apart from its functions as the financial and fiscal agent of the
government, BNP operates principally as a commercial bank. Between 1970
and mid-1977 BNP approved loans amounting to US$1,351.3 million, including
short-term operations. Over three-quarters of the loans were made to the
government sector (36.5%), commerce (25.8%), and housing and other construc-
tion (13.7%), while only 3% of total lending, including working capital
financing, went to the industrial sector. BNP has received two credits
from IDB to support small-scale industry. While the first (US$2 million
from Special Fund Operations--SFO, at 2%) has been fully disbursed, the second



- 24 -
(US$3 million from SFO and US$3 million from ordinary resources) has
become effective only recently. MICI operates a small-scale industry
program discussed in para. 1.41.
2.15      DISA, a privately owned finance company established in 1964,
has made selective loans to local industrialists including some of its
principal shareholders. As of December 1977 it had total resources of
US$10.3 million, loans outstanding of US$5.9 million and rather high liquid
assets of US$3.6 million. DISA has reduced its lending operations recently,
partly as a result of the recent economic recession.
Investment Funds for Industry
2.16      Public issues of shares and bonds of private companies have been
very limited. During the period 1970 through 1977 only US$3.9 million
in shares and US$3.3 million in private bonds were issued and sold to the
public. Most manufacturing investment is financed out of retained earnings,
private domestic savings and foreign investment, with the banking system
providing a relatively small share of investment funds for the industrial
sector. The expansion of long-term resources available to COFINA will help
to meet the unsatisfied demand for term credit, particularly over the next
few years when an economic recovery and resumption of industrial expansion
is expected.
C.   PROSPECTS AND PROJECT IMPLICATIONS
Panama as a Regional Banking Center
2.17      Taking advantage of Panama's strategic geographic location and its
unique monetary and financial system, the government has successfully promoted
Panama as a regional banking center. The growth in the number of banks and
in the volume of their business confirms the attractiveness of Panama's system
and the success of these policies. Among the principal benefits to the
country of the regional banking center are employment generation and improved
domestic credit availability.
2.18      There are good prospects for enhancing further Panama's standing as
a financial center. A good example is the recent creation of a regional export
bank which was proposed and promoted by the government. In January 1978 it was
incorporated in Panama as the Latin American Export Bank (BLADEX) and counts
among its shareholders Latin American central banks and commercial banks as
well as many of the largest international commercial banks and IFC. 1/ BLADEX
will promote and finance Latin America's non-traditional exports and, through
its operations, could make a substantial contribution to the creation of a
bankers' acceptance market in Panama. In addition, the Government is revising
its trusteeship laws to attract trust companies and also has plans for the
creation of a Latin American banking information clearing house.

Project Implications
2.19      The banking sector appears to have much potential as a supplier of
medium-term funds for industrial development as available resources far
exceed lending opportunities which bankers consider acceptable. Despite
the commercial banks' preference for short-term operations, the wide accept-
ance of adjustable interest rates in the domestic market has fostered a
certain willingness of commercial banks to make medium- to long-term (5-7
years) loans from short-term resources, but so far, to prime customers. Thus,
there appears to be a vital role which an institution such as COFINA could
play in helping to attract funds at appropriate terms from the commercial
banking sector in Panama for the financing of sound industrial projects. The
potential magnitude of resources available from the banking system indicates
that this should continue to be one of COFINA's primary objectives. COFINA
has already demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach through its
cofinancing activities with commercial banks for individual projects and has
been able to attract resources from the banking sector equivalent to four
times its own lending. The proposed industrial credit would help COFINA act
increasingly as a catalyst in mobilizing resources through cofinancing of
subprojects mainly with the international banks represented in Panama, and in
the longer run, through issuance of medium-term bonds, as it is expected that
COFINA's image would be materially enhanced by its association with the Bank.
III.  CORPORACION FINANCIERA NACIONAL (COFINA)
A.   THE INSTITUTION
Background
3.01      COFINA was created as an autonomous government-owned development
finance company in December 1975 to promote and finance productive industrial
enterprises in accordance with the government's national development plan, and
to encourage increased commercial bank financing of industry through cofinancing.
Prior to COFINA's establishment there had been no significant systematic effort
to provide medium- and long-term industrial financing in Panama. COFINA's
operations began slowly, in part constrained by the depressed economic climate
in Panama in 1976-77 and the uncertainty over the outcome of the Canal Treaty
negotiations, both of which slowed down private investment. COFINA therefore
focussed initially on promotion activities, to stimulate domestic private
investment and to encourage foreign investment in Panama. As of May 31, 1978,
its loan and investment portfolio of US$6.5 million is still quite small but
COFINA has become a well-known and respected element of the local banking
system.
Board of Directors, Organization and Staff
3.02      COFINA's Board of Directors consists of eight members including
the chairman, COFINA's general manager and an official representative of
MPEP. Board members are appointed by the President of the Republic for



- 26 -
an indefinite term. The present board members include representatives from
BNP, the Colon Free Zone, the Association of Industrialists, the Chamber of
Commerce and MICI. Overall COFINA has a fairly strong and relatively inde-
pendent board with strong representation by the private sector which has
contributed to a reasonable degree of operational autonomy. The board is
required by COFINA's laws to meet at least once a month but actually meets
every week and approves all of COFINA's investment, as well as loan proposals
exceeding US$150,000. COFINA is well managed. Management is assisted by a
loan committee consisting of the four division chiefs (para. 3.03) which meets
weekly to consider loan proposals. Decisions are adopted by a majority vote.
3.03      COFINA has four divisions as shown in the Chart 3-1:  (i) Credit;
(ii) Project Promotion and Investment; (iii) Finance, and (iv) Administration.
In addition COFINA has two one-man regional offices in Chiriqui and Colon, and
four advisors (economic, credit, projects and agroindustries). As of May 31,
1978 COFINA had a professional staff of 25.

3.04      Originally the Project Promotion and Investment Division was respon-
sible for identifying and promoting new projects and for evaluating all loans
exceeding US$1 million and all equity investments and cofinancing projects
with commercial banks, while the Credit Division was responsible for evalua-
ting all credit requests below US$1 million. This structure resulted in
project promotion activities primarily aimed at relatively large projects,
overlapping of functions and limited coordination between the two lending
divisions.  COFINA is at present restructuring the Project Promotion and
Investment and the Credit Divisions in order to eliminate these shortcomings.
The Project Promotion and Investment Division will now be responsible for
project promotion and the Credit Division will be responsible for appraisal
and supervision of approved projects. This should result in more efficient
use of COFINA's limited professional staff, better coordination of project
promotion and appraisal and more systematic supervision of approved projects.
It should also encourage COFINA's promotion of smaller projects which did not
receive sufficient consideration under the previous system.
3.05      The Finance Division is responsible for COFINA's liability manage-
ment and financial planning, and the Administration Division is responsible
for COFINA's internal accounting and control system. Both divisions are
relatively well managed and staffed with experienced personnel.
3.06      Since most of COFINA's staff have appropriate academic qualifica-
tions but few have adequate experience in development- banking or project
appraisal, COFINA's management is preparing a staff training program (para.
3.07). Moreover, management has a compensation study under way to determine
if staff compensation is competitive, particularly with that of private banks.
With the recent changes in its organization structure and the institution
of a comprehensive training program, COFINA's present level of staff should
be adequate to handle the projected expansion in its operations.
Appraisal and Supervision
3.07   -  COFINA's project appraisal reports are generally satisfactory but
leave ample room for improvement. The reports normally cover all important
aspects of a project (including calculations of internal financial rates
of return) except that the projects' internal economic rates of return (IERR)
are normally not calculated. 1/ Instead attention is paid to employment
generation, foreign-exchange earnings or savings and project linkages.
Project analysis is also frequently inadequate in its coverage of markets,
prices and management. COFINA's management is aware of these shortcomings
and intends to make improvements, including the setting up of a staff
training program. The training program would include sending selected
staff outside Panama for training and the hiring of external consultants.
The Bank would finance up to US$100,000 of the cost of the training program
1/   IERR calculations will be required for all subloans in excess of US$500,000
(para. 4.08).



- 28 -
under the proposed loan (para. 4.09). During negotiations agreement was
reached between the Bank and COFINA that COFINA would establish a training
program, satisfactory to the Bank, by April 30, 1979.
3.08      Since most of its loans and investments have been made within the
past year, supervision of clients has so far been a minor part of COFINA's
project activities. With the reorganization described in para. 3.04, however,
the Credit Division is expected to undertake the supervision of projects on a
regular basis.
Investment and Financial Policies
3.09      COFINA began its operations without a comprehensive statement of
investment and financial policies to guide its operations. COFINA's board
approved certain investment and financial regulations but these were incom-
plete and were established without sufficient analysis and relationship
to COFINA's operations. The need for realistic and clearly defined operating
policies is apparent in several areas of COFINA's operations. First, the
government wants COFINA to be involved in some of the large projects in
productive sectors which are included in the National Development Plan,
such as the new hotel at Tocumen airport, the new convention center hotel,
and the petroterminal for trans-isthmus oil shipments (para. 3.14). In
the case of the Tocumen hotel, COFINA issued a guarantee of US$4.5 million
although its maximum permissible exposure per client under existing board
regulations was limited at that time to US$1.4 million (15% of capital and
reserves). To avoid similar situations in the future, COFINA management has
proposed a comprehensive Statement of Objectives and Policies (Annex 1)
covering among other things concentration of risks, equity investments,
portfolio quality, financial limitations, interest rates and management of
special funds.
3.10      The major financial and investment limitations contained in the
Statement of Objectives and Policies are:
(a)  COFINA's maximum total exposure (loans, guarantees and equity
investments) for any single client will be limited to US$4 million
equivalent 1/ through 1982 (i.e., 20% of projected 1982 capital
and reserves) and thereafter adjusted to 20% of actual capital and
reserves, unless the government guarantees the financing exceeding
this limitation. This arrangement would allow COFINA to participate
in a meaningful way in larger projects during its formative years
without incurring excessive risks, and takes into account the fact
that COFINA is entitled to receive new capital contributions equal
to 0.56% of the surtax on imports (about US$2 million per year),
thus assuring paid-in capital and reserves of at least US$20 million
by year-end 1982.
1/   Except for the outstanding guarantee of US$4.5 million to the Tocumen hotel.



- 29 -
(b) COFINA will not make equity investments in any single
enterprise which exceed 20% of COFINA's capital and reserves.
Aggregate equity investments by COFINA will not exceed 75%
of COFINA's capital and reserves.
(c) COFINA generally will not finance more than 70% of total
project costs and in no case more than 80%. In addition,
the granting of loans for refinancing will require special
justification.
(d) The maximum permissible total debt is five times capital and
reserves. COFINA will not assume foreign exchange risks in its
operations.
3.11      During negotiations agreement was be reached (i) with COFINA and
the government on a final version of the Statement of Objectives and Policies
which would include the above limitations as well as COFINA's new policies
regarding interest rates (para. 3.19), and (ii) with the government that it
would guarantee any financing which exceeds COFINA's maximum exposure limita-
tions. The loan agreement provides that substantive changes in the Statement
of Objectives and Policies will be subject to Bank approval.
External Auditing Arrangements
3.12      COFINA's accounts are at present audited by the Comptroller General
of the Government of Panama. However, since COFINA is expected to play an
important catalytic role through cofinancing with commercial banks, it would
be essential for COFINA to have an independent external auditor, a step which
COFINA's management agrees would be preferable but which would require the
concurrence of the Comptroller. During negotiations agreement was reached:
(i) with COFINA and the government on COFINA's use of an independent external
auditor; and (ii) with COFINA that it would employ auditors acceptable
to the Bank who would prepare annual reports substantially in line with the
format suggested for DFCs associated with the Bank.
B.   OPERATIONS
3.13      COFINA's operations include loans, guarantees and equity investments.
A summary of its operations is shown in Table 3-1. From the start of opera-
tions in 1976, to May 31, 1978, COFINA has approved 36 loans amounting to
US$7.8 million, issued 4 guarantees totalling US$6 million and made 9 equity
investments amounting to US$1.5 million. In the first two years of operations
COFINA concentrated on lending; it did not issue guarantees or make significant
equity investments until 1978. Out of total cumulative loan approvals of
US$7.8 million at May 31, 1978, COFINA had committed US$6.1 million (78%) and
disbursed US$5 million (64%).

Operations by Sector
3.14      In its lending activities COFINA has concentrated on the manufac-
turing sector (Table 3-2). Of the US$7.8 million cumulative loan approvals,
US$5.7 million (73%) was for 30 loans to manufacturing enterprises. Tourism
received US$1.1 million (14%) for 4 loans and the transport sector US$1 million
(13%) for 2 loans. Of the 30 loans for the manufacturing sector, 22 approvals
(US$3.6 million) were for consumer goods, six (US$1.8 million) for construc-
tion materials and two (US$300,000) for intermediate goods industries. The
transport lending includes one loan of US$1 million for Petro Terminal de
Panama S.A., a US-Panamanian joint venture engaged in the trans-shipment of
Alaskan oil through the Panama Canal. Six other large projects are also
joint ventures between Panamanian and foreign companies. While joint ventures
amount to only 29% (US$2.3 million) of COFINA's total loan approvals, reflect-
ing their significantly larger average size, they account for 85% (US$67
million) of total costs of COFINA-financed projects.

3.15      In addition to its loan to Petro Terminal de Panama S.A., COFINA has
also invested US$1 million equity in that project, which at present accounts
for 71% of COFINA's equity investment portfolio. In comparison COFINA's equity
investments in six other projects average only US$50,000. Five of the projects
are in the manufacturing sector; the remaining one is for tourism. COFINA has
also issued three guarantees totalling US$5.6 million for tourism projects
and a guarantee of US$440,000 for one project in the manufacturing sector.
Operations by Purpose, Size and Terms
3.16      Of the 36 loans approved thus far, 10 of the approvals totalling
US$2.9 million are for new projects. Eleven loans totalling US$1.7 million
are for plant expansion, modernization and related working capital and eight
are special technical assistance loans (Table 3-3). The remaining seven
loans totalling US$2.3 million are for refinancing. Since in some cases COFINA
appears to have merely replaced short-term commercial bank loans with 9-10%
p.a. five year term loans, COFINA's new policy to be adopted in connection
with the proposed loan would minimize such refinancing in the future.

3.17      Individual loans vary in size from under US$25,000 to US$1 million.
The average size of loans approved is US$218,000, or US$250,000 if technical
assistance loans (para. 3.18) are excluded. The terms of COFINA's loans vary
from 2-10 years with an average maturity of 5.4 years, most loans having
grace periods of up to a maximum of three years. Although the average loan
maturity at present is rather short it reflects COFINA's limited long-term
resources and concern with liquidity management. With adequate long-term
borrowing secured, COFINA expects to make loans with terms of 8-13 years
maturity.
Technical Assistance Loans
3.18      As part of its lending operations COFINA has made technical
assistance loans for project feasibility studies with funds provided from
a US$900,000 line of credit from a preinvestment study fund established in
the MPEP, using the proceeds of an IDB loan and other funds made available
by the government. COFINA has approved eight such loans amounting to
US$758,000, committed US$734,000, and disbursed US$565,000 (Table 3-4).
All technical assistance loans are 10-year loans with a 3-year grace
period and an interest rate of 7% p.a.

Interest Rates on Subloans
3.19      The interest rates on COFINA's subloans range from 8% p.a. to 10%
p.a. with an average of 9.4% p.a. There appears to have been no consistent
policy for interest rates. While COFINA has given concessionary terms to most
projects in such government-designated development areas as Chiriqui and Darien,
certain projects in the Panama City metropolitan area have received similar
terms, indicating that the absence of a clear interest rate policy may have
subjected COFINA to undue pressure from borrowers for more favorable terms.
To avoid this and to move its interest rates closer to market rates, COFINA
decided in July 1978 to adopt a uniform interest rate of 10% p.a. After
approval of the Statement of Objectives and Policies, COFINA will set interest
rates according to a formula based on LIBOR and its own cost of funds (para.
4.06). COFINA has also decided to charge an appraisal fee of up to 1% and a
commitment fee of 1% on undisbursed balances, from 1979 onwards.
3.20      The increase in the wholesale price index in Panama has dropped
from 14% in 1974-75 to 7.8% in 1975-76 to 7.2% in 1976-77 and is projected
at 7.5% in 1977-79 and 7.0% thereafter. 1/ Given these projected rates of
inflation COFINA's interest rates are expected to be positive. Interest rates
in Panama are not regulated but set by the market, which is largely based on
the eurodollar market. Consequently, interest rates for medium-term industrial
loans have ranged from about 9-14% over the past three years. Using the above
formula, COFINA's interest rates should be substantially in line with these
market-determined rates.
1/   Because of Panama's use of the US dollar as currency, and its open
economy, its inflation in the future should be similar to OECD inflation
in US dollars.



- 34 -
Cofinancing
3.21      COFINA has been financing approximately 14% (US$11.4 million) of
the total project costs, while commercial banks have been providing about
58% (US$46 million), indicating the extent to which COFINA has helped mobilize
resources from the local banking system. Several of these commercial banks
reported that they considered COFINA's involvement important in deciding
to lend. In most cases COFINA has jointly financed projects without entering
into special arrangements with the cofinancier.  However, COFINA also enters
into specific cofinancing arrangements and so far has used two techniques.
In the case of 4 projects, COFINA provided full or partial guarantees to the
potential financier. In 3 others, COFINA agreed with the cofinancing bank to
take over the outstanding amount of the cofinanced loan after a certain number
of years, if requested, thus encouraging commercial bank cooperation while
allowing COFINA time to build up its own resources. The first such take-out
options could not be exercised until 1982, by which time COFINA expects to
have adequate funding from its own resources in addition to eurodollar lines
from local commercial banks. In the future, a third cofinancing technique
will be possible. COFINA will be able to use long-term resources from the
proposed loan and, in later years, from the proposed US Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (OPIC), guaranteed notes (para. 3.26), to enter into
cofinancing arrangements under which COFINA would assume a larger proportion
of the latter maturities of joint loans.
Portfolio Quality
3.22      Most COFINA's equity investments and all the guarantees have been
made only in 1978 and since most of the loans are still in the grace period,
it is too early to pass judgement on the quality of the portfolio. As of May
31, 1978, COFINA had experienced no loan or investment losses, no guarantees
had been called, no loans were in arrears, and COFINA had experienced late
interest payments on only one loan, a US$17,600 technical assistance loan.
COFINA requests security on all its regular loans of at least 100% of the
loan amount. Security obtained consists of real estate (valued at 80% of
maket value), plant and equipment (valued at 60% of market value), personal
guarantees and government bonds. While COFINA has also made ad hoc loan loss
provisions of US$97,000 for technical assistance loans and loans secured
mainly by personal guarantees and government bonds, it plans to institute a
policy for building up reserves for future losses. 'Agreement was reached
during negotiations that COFINA would make adequate provisions to cover possi-
ble losses and would maintain reserves at a level consistent with generally
accepted financial practices and in keeping with the extent and nature of its
portfolio (Section 4.12 of the Statement of Policies and Objectives).
Economic Impact of COFINA's Operations
3.23      COFINA's operations have made a significant economic impact.  The
total costs of the 37 projects receiving COFINA's financing are estimated
at about US$79 million (Table 3-6). Of this amount, however, one project,
Petro Terminal de Panama, accounts for US$45 million, and two other large
projects, a hotel and glass factory, for a further US$20 million. According



- 35 -
to COFINA's appraisals, approved projects are expected to create about
1,500 new jobs at an average investment cost per job of US$52,000. If the
three largest, and relatively atypical, projects are excluded, however,
the investment cost per job is reduced to an acceptable US$13,400.
3.24      Most of the projects are import-substitution projects, but according
to COFINA's appraisal reports new exports from 13 of the projects are estimated
at US$6.8 million annually. Of the 37 projects approved, 29 are in or near
Panama City, reflecting the concentration of industry in the metropolitan area
and the Canal Zone. However, most of the 29 are smaller projects, as the
large projects financed by COFINA are located in less developed areas. COFINA
has not yet financed any projects in Colon, which is a most depressed urban
area with the highest unemployment rate in Panama, but is making a special
effort to promote such projects. In this connection it has set up a one-man
office in Colon.

Financial Resources
3.25      As of May 31, 1978, COFINA had an authorized capital of US$20
million and subscribed capital of US$8.2 million. Of subscribed capital,
,US$6.2 million was paid in cash and US$2 million in 20-year government bonds
carrying an interest rate of 6% p.a. The bonds are redeemable at an annual
rate of only US$60,000 over 20 years with a balloon payment for the balance.
COFINA's management expects its total paid-in capital and reserves to reach
US$20.6 million by year-end 1982 with much of the increase coming from
contributions of import tax revenues.  By executive decree, COFINA receives
7.5% of a recently imposed 7.5% import surtax (or 0.56% of the import value).
This will provide COFINA with about US$2 million per year in new equity
capital and should assure adequate capitalization in the future.
3.26      In addition to its capital, COFINA either has or expects to
have available the following resources:



- 36 -
(a)  a 3% p.a. loan of US$5.7 million from USAID.  This
loan was previously made by USAID to DISA, which is now
repaying the loan to the government at an annual rate of
about US$570,000 over 10 years beginning in 1977. These
repayments are loaned to COFINA to be amortized over a
30-year period in incremental amounts with the total repayment
in 1978 amounting to approximately US$35,000 and with annual
increases thereafter of approximately US$21,000.
(b)  a line of credit of US$900,000 from a preinvestment study
fund (para. 3.18). COFINA pays 4% interest on funds
received and relends them at 7%. Repayment of these
funds corresponds to the maturities of subloans. COFINA
has so far approved US$758,000 and disbursed US$565,000
under this line.
(c)  a proposed private placement in the US of up to US$20 mil-
lion of 15-year notes with a guarantee from OPIC. COFINA
had considered using these funds in 1978 but has agreed with
OPIC to defer using them until market conditions become
more favorable (para. 3.34).
3.27      COFINA also has access to short-term credit lines from commercial
banks in Panama and may in the future utilize medium-term eurodollar loans.
As COFINA grows and becomes an established and recognized financial insti-
tution a further potential source of funds could be the issuance of its
own domestic medium-term bonds. Similar bond issues have been successfully
made in the past by Caja de Ahorros, the autonomous government-owned mortgage
bank, and by the government itself. Bond issues would, moreover, be consistent
with COFINA's long-term objective of developing the capital market in Panama.
Financial Position and Results
3.28      COFINA's assets and liabilities for 1976, 1977 and the first five
months of 1978 are summarized in Table 3-7.  COFINA's total assets increased
from US$4.3 million in 1976 to US$8.2 million in 1977 and had reached US$10.1
million 4y May 31, 1978. As of the latter date these assets consisted of
loans (48%), cash and short-term investments (14%), bonds (19%), equity
investments (14%) and other (5%). Equity investments were less than 1% of
total assets in 1977. Reflecting COFINA's rapid operational growth, loans,
which accounted for only 28% of total assets in 1977, increased 2.2 times in
the first five months of 1978 while cash ahd short-term investments dropped
by over US$2 million.
3.29      COFINA's assets were financed by equity (84% in 1977), long-term
debt (10%) and other liabilities (6%). In 1977 the debt/equity ratio was
only 0.2:1. leaving COFINA with substantial borrowing capacity. Under the
proposed policy statement the total of COFINA's outstanding and contingent
debts will be limited to a maximum of five times COFINA's capital and
reserves, which is reasonable.

3.30      COFINA has not yet reached break-even level and has incurred opera-
ting losses of US$189,000 in 1976, US$205,000 in 1977 and US$101,000 for the
first five months of 1978 (Table 3-8). However, government subsidies amounting
to US$1,163,000 over the entire period exceeded operating losses by US$668,000,
allowing COFINA to show a net surplus in each year of its operations. COFINA's
administrative expenses have been relatively high owing to start-up costs,
high promotional expenses, and the need for a minimum level of professional
staff. Furthermore, COFINA came into existence at a time of political and
economic uncertainty in Panama which hindered COFINA's portfolio growth and
added to its marketing and promotion expenses. In order to improve COFINA's
profitability, management has increased interest rates and will introduce
fees for appraisals, commitments and guarantees (para. 3.19).  Since COFINA
is adequately staffed at present to handle a substantial increase in opera-
tions, administrative expenses should drop significantly as a percentage of
total assets. COFINA projects a modest profit by 1980 (para. 3.35).

Projected Operations and Prospects
3.31      As of May 31, 1978, COFINA had a pipeline of 24 projects with total
project costs of about US$94 million. This pipeline includes only those
projects with a very high probability of implementation. In addition, COFINA
is studying several other projects for which implementation is possible but
less certain. COFINA plans to finance about US$23 million (24%) of the US$94
million project costs, about US$18 million of which in the form of loans and
US$4.7 million as equity financing. COFINA also expects to guarantee a further
US$5 million in connection with these projects. Table 3-9 presents COFINA's
existing pipeline of projects by sector for possible approval in 1978 and
1979. Fourteen of the 24 projects are new, accounting for US$87 million (93%)
of total project costs, while 10 of the 24 projects totalling US$81 million
are joint ventures between Panamanian and foreign enterprises, with the latter
also providing technology.
3.32      COFINA expects to approve 18 of the projects in its pipeline in
1978 with total costs of US$50 million, of which COFINA will finance US$16
million.  The remaining 6 projects will be approved in 1979.  Their total
costs will be US$44 million of which COFINA will finance about US$7 million.

3.33      Of the 24 projects in COFINA's pipeline 21 are relatively small,
with average total costs of US$1.5 million. COFINA expects to finance
US$14 million (43%) of the total costs of these projects. Fifteen of these
smaller projects are for consumer products; 4 are for intermediate products
and one each for tourism and construction. Most of the projects are located
in or near Panama City. One project, a US$2.7 million towel factory, would be
located in Colon, a high priority urban development area, and a US$3.5 million
tuna fish processing plant would be built adjacent to the new fishing port
at Vacamonte. Other smaller projects include food processing plants, clothing
manufacture, plastic and metal products. The remaining 3 projects are large;
their estimated costs of US$62 million account for 66% of total project costs
and 39% of COFINA's expected financing (US$9 million) in 1978-79. These
projects are: a new hotel in Panama City, a furfural plant and a pulp and
paper mill. As reflected in Table 3.10, COFINA expects to identify a signifi-
cant number of additional projects within the coming year, which would result
in a resource gap for 1978-80 of about US$35 million.

3.34      As indicated in COFINA's projected balance sheet (Table 3.11),
loans outstanding are expected to grow rapidly to US$48.5 million by 1982
and equity investments to increase by US$2 million each year. COFINA will
finance most of this growth with new equity capital contributions and
long-term borrowings. For the remainder of 1978 COFINA will rely on equity
capital increases, internal cash generation and some local bank borrowing.
The proposed loan is expected to cover the major portion of additional long-
term needs in 1979 and 1980. Financial projections assume that COFINA
will enter the US capital market in 1980 with a US$20 million private
placement of notes guaranteed by OPIC; however, the timing could be advanced
if market conditions and US dollar interest rates are favorable. Throughout
the forecast period COFINA's total indebtedness, rising to 3.7:1 in 1982,
would stay well below the proposed 5:1 maximum, and liquidity would remain
ample.

3.35       COFINA's new financial policies will help to bring about an accept-
able profit performance by 1980 (Table 3-12). In addition to increases in
net interest earned on its loans, COFINA will earn significant commission
income from appraisal fees, commitment fees and guarantee fees. As a result,
the interest rate spread on COFINA's lending operations is expected to average
about 3.3%. On the other hand, administrative expenditures as a percentage of
average total assets would decline gradually from a high 6.4% in 1978 to 1.4%



- 42 -
in 1982, in line with COFINA's operational growth. Consequently, the net
return on average total assets is projected to reach 0.7% by 1982 and the
return on equity 5%.

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
4.01      The proposed US$15 million loan would be the first Bank project
in support of industrial sector development in Panama. The loan would be
made to COFINA at the Bank's current interest rate (7.35 p.a. at present)
and standard 0.75% commitment fee, and would be guaranteed by the govern-
ment. Most of the loan proceeds would be used to finance the estimated
foreign exchange component of subloans and equity investments for the acquisi-
tion of fixed assets and associated permanent working capital by productive
private and public sector enterprises in the manufacturing and service indus-
tries, agroindustries and tourism subsectors. Up to US$1 million and
US$100,000, respectively, would be available for small-scale industry and
technical assistance financing.
4.02      The main objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) assist the government in building up COFINA as a strong
development finance institution which could effectively
promote and finance productive enterprises principally in
the manufacturing and service sectors;
(b) help finance COFINA's long-term development lending by
filling about 34% of COFINA's total resource requirements
through 1980;
(c) help COFINA act increasingly as a catalyst in mobilizing
resources through cofinancing of subprojects mainly with
international banks represented in Panama, and in the longer
run through issuance of medium-term bonds; and
(d) assist the government in formulating industrial develop-
ment policies which would have a favorable impact on Panama's
employment and aggregate income generation and help COFINA
devise a lending strategy to support these government
objectives.
4.03      The proposed loan would continue the Bank's efforts to assist in
the exploitation and processing of Panama's natural resources by promoting
investments mainly in non-traditional and export industries and by expanding
and improving the service industries that are likely to benefit from the
comparative advantage Panama derives from its geographic location.
B.   FEATURES OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
Subloan Maturities and Loan Amortization
4.04      The proposed loan would carry a fixed amortization schedule (level
principal payment) of 15 years including a grace period of 3 years. A fixed
schedule was requested by COFINA on the ground that this would enable them
to obtain and manage borrowing from other sources more effectively. Projected



- 44 -
cash flows show that COFINA would have adequate liquidity (Table 3.11) to meet
its repayments to the Bank and to other lenders. Subloan terms are expected
to vary from 8 to 13 years averaging about 9 years including three years of
grace. There would be some rollover of funds but this would not impose any
foreign exchange risk on COFINA as the Government assumes the full exchange
risk. The rollover funds would be used by COFINA for similar operations in
line with its statement of Objectives and Policies. The Bank loan would
account for only about one third of COFINA's resource requirements over the
next two years. The availability of some rollover funds would not affect
COFINA's strategy to mobilize domestic resources as envisaged (paras. 2.19 and
3.34). The Bank loan is expected to be fully committed by June 30, 1981 and
disbursed by December 31, 1982 (Annex 2).
Foreign Exchange Risk
4.05      Since the banking system in Panama operates in US dollars it would
be difficult for COFINA, particularly in the case of smaller borrowers, to
lend in the various currencies which are disbursed by the Bank. GOFINA's
competitiveness would be significantly reduced if it had to pass on the
foreign exchange risk on the Bank loan to its borrowers. During negotiations,
the government agreed that it would assume the foreign exchange risk between
the currencies of disbursement of the Bank loan and the US dollar.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.06      Procurement would be in line with standard practice for Bank DFC-type
projects under which COFINA would satisfy itself that the goods and services
to be purchased are suitable to the investment projects and are reasonably
priced. 1/ Panama presently imports most capital and intermediate goods, due
to the country's existing pattern of economic development and its emphasis on
commerce and service activities. Therefore, the foreign exchange content of
most industrial projects is relatively high. 2/ The funds of the proposed
Bank loan would be utilized to reimburse COFINA for 100% of amounts disbursed
under subloans. COFINA's disbursements may not exceed 70% of documented
total projects costs, which is estimated to represent the average foreign
exchange content of projects. 2/ The same reimbursement percentage on the
part of the Bank and financing limitation on the part of COFINA would apply
in the case of small scale industry financing. In practice, the actual COFINA
financing may be somewhat less than this 70% maximum since COFINA will give
careful consideration to the extent of its financial contribution in the case
of new subprojects or large expansions of existing ones, taking into account
the financial position and debt service capacity of the subborrower. Under
the technical assistance component the Bank will disburse 100% of documented
foreign exchange expenditures. Standard documentation would accompany with-
drawal applications under the proposed loan except for the small-scale industry
program; disbursements would be made under certified statement of expenditures
1/   See Annex 1, para. 3.10.
2/   A sample of a few projects financed by COFINA shows an imported component
ranging from 61% to 89% and averaging 76%.



- 45 -
with the supporting documentation retained by COFINA and available for periodi-
cal review by Bank supervision missions.
Interest Rates and Charges
4.07      COFINA would relend at interest rates set in accordance with its
Statement of Objectives and Policies. Interest rates would be adjusted period-
ically according to a predetermined formula to ensure consistency with market
rates and COFINA's need for an adequate interest rate spread over the cost of
its funds. The rate charged will be at least equal to the higher of LIBOR
plus 2% or COFINA's average cost of borrowed funds plus 3%. The interest rate
charged on subloans from Bank funds would be subject to a 10% floor and the
formula used to set interest rates would be reviewed and if necessary revised,
at least annually by the Bank and COFINA beginning not later than January 15,
1979. If no agreement on interest rates were to be reached within 60 days
from the start of such review, COFINA would discontinue making further commit-
ments under the Bank loan until an agreement is reached between the Bank and
COFINA. COFINA would also charge an appraisal fee of up to 1% and a commit-
ment fee of 1% on undisbursed balances. At present, the effective interest
rate which would be charged by COFINA would be about 12-13%.
Free Limit
4.08      Since the proposed Bank loan would be the first operation with
COFINA, a free limit of US$500,000 for individual subloans and an aggregate
free limit of US$6 million would be established. This would permit the Bank
to review about 80% of subloans by amount and 50% by number, and to work
closely with COFINA in helping it to perfect its appraisal capabilities. IERR
calculations would be required on all subloans above the free limit. To avoid
excessive concentration of Bank financing, the maximum subloan amount to be
financed out of the Bank loan would be US$2 million.
Technical Assistance
4.09      Up to US$100,000 would be available for COFINA to institute a
comprehensive staff training program which would include sending COFINA's
staff outside Panama and hiring external consultants. In the event that
funds from other sources become available for technical assistance, these
Bank funds could be used for sublending.
Small-Scale Industry Component
4.10      Under the proposed loan COFINA would provide support for the Govern-
ment's efforts to promote small-scale business. For this purpose, COFINA
would be permitted to relend to the MICI small-scale industry program (para.
1.42) up to US$1 million at the Bank interest rate without adding a spread to
cover administrative expenditures. However, this would have only a minor
impact on COFINA's profitability. The Bank would review in detail the
appraisal of this component by COFINA, and the conditions attached to the
proposed lending, before deciding on the MICI program's eligibility for Bank
financing. The Bank would also provide assistance and guidance in its super-
vision of this component.



- 46 -
C.   PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
4.11      The proposed project would assist the government in its efforts to
stimulate the recovery of private investment, to promote exports and-further
develop Panama's service industries. It is expected to have a favorable
impact on Panama's balance of payments, by providing longer-term funds, and by
increasing the resources available to COFINA to finance industrial projects
that lead to appropriate import substitution and a growth in exports. It
would help COFINA to finance subprojects in its pipeline involving aggregate
investment costs of about US$94 million as well as additional subprojects it
would identify. The economic impact of the subprojects presently in COFINA's
pipeline would be significant, providing about 2,000 direct jobs and generating
a substantial number of indirect jobs. The average cost per job, excluding
one large project (the Petro Terminal) is about US$17,000, which is reasonable
for Panama.
4.12      COFINA's promotional role in the industrial sector would be facili-
tated by the more optimistic mood among private investors and bankers following
the successful negotiations of the Canal Treaties, and by the government's
continued policy of encouraging foreign investment in Panama. In addition,
by acting as a catalyst in mobilizing the resources of the international
banks operating in Panama through the cofinancing of industrial subprojects,
COFINA will be helping to channel commercial bank funds at appropriate terms
into industrial development.
4.13      The risks presented by the project are acceptable.  While COFINA is
a new institution, with a relatively inexperienced staff, engaged in the promo-
tion and financing of industry in a country where banking has traditionally
favored commerce, the project should help COFINA to achieve a number of important
institutional improvements, including helping it to refine its operations, and
enhance its promotional activities. In terms of improving its professional
expertise COFINA would also benefit from the technical assistance component of
the proposed loan. Should the government be less successful than it expects
in its efforts to increase private investment in the industrial sector, the
demand for COFINA financing would be reduced from projected levels. However,
COFINA already has sufficient subprojects at an advanced stage in its pipeline
to utilize the proceeds of the proposed loan.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following:
(a) with the government on
(i) its bearing the exchange risk between the currencies
of disbursements and the US dollar (para. 4.05); and
(ii) its guaranteeing any financing which would exceed the
maximum exposure limits permitted under COFINA's State-
ment of Objectives and Policies (paras 3.10 and 3.11);



- 47 -
(b) with the government and COFINA regarding
(i) the final text of COFINA's Statement of Objectives and
Policies (para. 3.11);
(ii) COFINA's interest rate policies and formulas determining
such rates (para. 4.07);
(iii) COFINA's annual audit by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank and the scope of their reports (para. 3.12);
(iv) the free limit for COFINA's subprojects of US$500,000
with an aggregate free limit of US$6 million, the
calculation of IERR on subloans over US$500,000, and
a maximum limit on subloans of US$2 million (para. 4.08);
(v) preparation and initiation of a staff training program
by April 30, 1979 and the use of Bank funds for technical
assistance (para. 3.07); and
(vi) principles for permitting COFINA to onlend up to US$1
million for a small scale industry program (paras. 1.42
and 4.10).
5.02      During negotiations understanding was reached with COFINA and the
government on the undertaking of an industrial sector survey by the end of
1979 with Bank assistance (para. 1.39).
B.   RECOMMENDATION
5.03      With the agreements and understandings obtained, the proposed
project constitutes a suitable basis for a loan of US$15 million equivalent on
the terms and conditions outlined in Chapter IV.

ANNEX I
PANAMA
DEVELOPMENT BANKING PROJECT
CORPORACION FINANCIERA NACIONAL
Draft Statement of Objectives and Policies
Corporacion Financiera Nacional (COFINA), established under Law
No. 65 of December 10, 1975, will direct its activities in accordance with
the following policies:
1.        General objective
In making its assistance available, COFINA will pursue national
economic and social development priorities as reflected in present and future
national development plans. To that end, the Corporation will:
1.1 Grant short, medium and long-term loans and invest in the capital
stock of productive enterprises so as to foster activities and
ventures likely to further national economic development, parti-
cularly in the following fields:
1.1.1 Manufacturing, assembly and processing industries,
including those that involve the processing of agri-
cultural, forest and fisheries products; and
1.1.2 Transportation, tourism, mining and promotion of exports.
1.2 Provide consulting services and technical assistance designed to
foster industrial development.
1.3 Administer such special funds as may from time to time be placed
at its disposal.
1.4 Engage in whatever additional activities it regards as either
necessary or advantageous in the task of pursuing the objectives
enumerated here.
2.        General policy
2.1 As a national development institution, COFINA will provide assistance
designed to foster the spread of efficient business administration
in all productive sectors in Panama, with the exception of agriculture.
2.2 Assistance made available by COFINA will be in line with national
economic and social development priorities as reflected in Panama's
current and future development plans. COFINA will promote and
finance only projects that are technically and financially viable
and economically sound. COFINA's own economic appraisal of each
project will be based on a consideration of the following factors,
among others:



- 49 -
ANNEX 1
2.2.1 The possibilities of saving or generating foreign
exchange;
2.2.2 The contribution to development of a stock of skilled
manpower;
2.2.3 The employment opportunities generated;
2.2.4 The value added to the economy;
2.2.5 The effect on the national budget.
2.3 COFINA will not subsidize enterprises or projects either in the
public or private sector, although, if a project is not considered
financially viable in itself and the Government still has a
special interest in seeing it implemented, COFINA will administer
it for a fee to be determined. COFINA will not assume any
financial risk in such operations.
2.4 COFINA will undertake studies of those sectors in which a need
is known or thought to exist for its financial support, the inten-
tion being to ensure that its appraisal of projects is comprehensive
and complete. COFINA may also make any other studies likely to
facilitate examination of its own participation in the formulation
of national development policies, thus reinforcing its role as an
active agent in the national planning effort.
2.5 COFINA will have a directional role in the identification and
active promotion of investment opportunities in all productive
sectors of the national economy. When appropriate, the
Corporation will provide its clients with consulting services
and technical assistance in the fields of project planning,
organization and finance, and, in general, will work to ensure
that clients adopt modern management techniques.
3.        Investment policy
3.1 COFINA will make long, medium and short-term loans available on
terms and conditions -- grace and maturity periods, for
instance -- that can be varied to suit the particular require-
ments of each project. In cases considered appropriate, COFINA
will invest in the capital stock of productive enterprises,
guarantee obligations vis-a-vis third parties and itself issue
bonds and securities.
3.2 Each investment decision will rest on prior and complete
appraisal of the particular project based on a comprehensive
and well-documented report which sets out all pertinent facts
on the main aspects of the project (i.e., its technical,
market, administrative, financial and economic facets) and



- 50 -
ANNEX I
which examines and interprets them. This report will
also give recommendations regarding contractual agreements,
together with computations of the internal, economic and
financial rates of return expected from the project.
3.3 Financing made available by COFINA from its own ordinary
resources will not be less than US$50,000 for any one
project. However, the Corporation may consider applica-
tions for financing amounting to less than US$50,000 when
they are of economic interest.
3.4 COFINA will be careful to maintain a good balance in its
loan portfolio by means of a prudent spreading of its
commitments (loans, guarantees, participations) across
the various sectors of the economy specified as constituting
its proper sphere of corporate activity.
3.5  The risk assumed by COFINA in connection with any project will
be kept to a reasonable level. As a general rule, the total
sums committeed (in the form of loans, guarantees and stock
participations) by the Corporation to a specific project will
normally not exceed 70% of total project cost, and will in
no case exceed 80%.
3.6 So that the general level of risk borne by the Corporation
may be kept within acceptable limits, its total commitment
(loans, stock participations and guarantees or sureties) to
a single borrower will be limited to US$4 million equivalent
through 1982 and thereafter adjusted to 20% of capital and
reserves.
3.7 Exceptions may be made in regard to the restrictions enumerated
in paragraphs 3.5. and 3.6 above in cases where COFINA is
acting either as a depositary-trustee, or on behalf of the
Government as the administrator of funds earmarked for specific
projects, or when the obligations it has assumed vis-a-vis third
parties are totally and unconditionally covered under the
Government's guarantee.
3.8 As a general rule, COFINA will not invest more than 20% of its
own capital and reserves in the capital stock of any one enter-
prise. The Corporation's total investment in stock participa-
tions will not exceed 75% of its capital and reserves.
3.9 Under normal circumstances, COFINA will not grant loans for
the purpose of refinancing projects or enterprises.



- 51 -
ANNEX 1
3.10 In principle, COFINA will only participate in the financing
of a project when necessary equipment, machinery, civil works
construction and services are procured through widely based
invitations to tender. Wherever possible, international
bidding procedures will be required, although, should there
be local contractors or suppliers qualified to bid at competitive
prices, it will be considered sufficient if procurement procedures
are restricted to them. No proceedings for the procurement of
goods and services, or for the award of contracts, involving all or
part of the financial assistance obtained from COFINA may go ahead
until the borrower or the promoter of the project has consulted
COFINA.
3.11 COFINA will not finance infrastructure projects for roads,
buildings, etc., unless such infrastructure constitutes part
of a particular project and that project falls within COFINA's
special sphere of operations.
3.12 Part of COFINA's role will be to act as a catalyst in mobilizing
resources in the domestic banking sector or abroad through the
cofinancing of viable projects within Panama.
4.        Financial policy
4.1 The fundamental general aim of COFINA's financial policies will
be the administration of its funds in such a way that it will at
all times be in a position to meet its obligations and obtain a
profit margin which covers its operating costs and allows it to
maintain reserves that are adequate to keep up the value of its
capital in real terms.
4.2 COFINA will maintain a proper balance between the maturities on
its own&obligations and those on the loans it makes available.
4.3 In cases where COFINA borrows in currencies other than US dollars,
it will not assume any exchange risk. Such risk will be
assumed by the Government of Panama or by the final user of the
funds borrowed.
4.4 COFINA will charge a fixed interest rate on its loans based on
LIBOR and its own cost of funds such that the rate charged will
be no less than LIBOR plus 2% or COFINA's weighted cost of borrowed
funds in the preceding quarter plus 3%. Such rate would be deter-
mined at the beginning of each quarter and would be applied to all
loans approved in such period and will not be varied during the life
of such subloans.
4.5 In addition to interest, COFINA will collect a once-only fee
of up to 1% of total loan proceeds payable at the time of the
first disbursement. The purpose of this fee will be to cover
the cost of the studies and analyses made in connection with
project appraisal.



- 52 -
ANNEX 1
4.6  Whenever it extends a guarantee to a supplier, a bidder or
a lender, COFINA will charge a fee, the size of which will
depend on the nature of the particular project, the current
or expected future status of the borrower's business, the
extent of the commitment made, the amount guaranteed and
the duration of COFINA's commitment. In the normal course
of events, this fee will be not less than 1.5% per annum
of the loan proceeds actually disbursed.
4.7  All COFINA loans will be subject to a standard commitment
charge of 1% per annum on funds committed but not utilized
or disbursed; it will be payable from the date of signature
of the loan contract or at the latest from the thirtieth day
following receipt by the borrower of written notice of
COFINA's decision to grant the loan.
4.8  As a general rule, the maximum term of a loan or guarantee
will be 15 years from the date of the contract of loan or
guarantee to the date of the last repayment scheduled. The
maximum grace period will be five years from the date of the
loan contract. Approval of a loan or guarantee application
shall remain effective for a maximum of six months from the
date of the decision to approve.
4.9  All expenses such as legal fees, bank charges, commissions
and the cost of analyses and studies other than those covered
by normal COFINA charges will be regarded as recoverable
expenses during the loan application and contract period.
4.10 COFINA will require adequate collateral for all loans it
grants, which may be in the form of securities, mortgages,
pledges, bonds and shares that have market value. The type
and amount of collateral required will depend on the
nature of the assets put forward and the readiness with
which they can be liquidated, on the position of the
guarantors and on other considerations, particularly the
feasibility of the particular project.
4.11 In certain specific circumstances, such as inability to
meet repayment obligations or failure to carry out loan
conditions fully, COFINA, having duly notified the
borrower, may either partially or totally suspend his
right to further disbursement of loan proceeds.
4.12 COFINA will make adequate provision to cover possible losses
and will maintain reserves at a level consistent with
generally accepted financial practices and in keeping with
the extent and nature of its portfolio of loans, guarantees
and other investments.



- 53 -
ANNEX 1
4.13 Whenever COFINA requires credit facilities with which to
finance its lending operations, it will obtain funds locally
or abroad by negotiating loans or issuing bonds. The Corporation
will be prudent in taking on financial obligations and will not
contract, assume or guarantee any debt if as a result of that
particular operation the whole ensemble of obligations contracted,
assumed or guaranteed by the Corporation would then exceed five
times the value of its capital and reserves.
5.        Relations with enterprises financed
5.1  When making capital stock investments, COFINA will not endeavor
to obtain control of the particular company or project. As a
general rule, the maximum investment by COFINA in shares will be
limited to 25% of the capital stock of a single body corporate or
borrower. The Corporation will also normally avoid taking on
management responsibilities for the projects or companies it
invests in, although this does not mean that it may not insist
on placing a representative with the right to be heard and to
vote on the Board of Directors of some or all of the companies
in which it holds shares or to which it has made loans not yet
repaid or to which it has extended guarantees.
5.2  On reaching a decision as to the type and amount of financial
assistance it will provide in a particular case, COFINA will
take into account all the financial requirements of the project
itself as well as the general financial position of the borrowers
concerned.
5.3  In accordance with sound banking practice, COFINA will insist
that its borrowers obtain and keep up adequate insurance policies,
that they maintain accounting records as dictated by generally
accepted business principles and that they furnish such information
on their operations and costs as may be required by COFINA. The
Corporation will have the right to inspect borrowers' books,
operations and finances from time to time.
5.4  All information and business secrets divulged by a loan applicant
or borrower will be treated by COFINA as strictly confidential.
6.        Organizational policies
6.1  The management of COFINA will formulate administrative procedures,
regulations and guidelines designed to achieve maximum efficiency
in the conduct of the Corporation's operations and the provision
of its services.



- 54 -
ANNEX 1
6.2  COFINA's operating expenses and costs will be kept as low as
possible, although they will be consistent with the range of
its activities and the volume and quality of its operations.
6.3  COFINA will establish what indicators it regards as necessary
for the measurement and monitoring of the following:
6.3.1 Observance of all legal and operational procedures
and regulations;
6.3.2 The efficiency of those procedures and the accuracy
and precision of all accounting records;
6.3.3 The management of its assets and the utilization of
its funds; and
6.3.4 Maintenance of an adequate personnel cost control system.
6.4 COFINA will maintain an effective system for:
(a) the selection of key personnel;
(b) the implementation of personnel development policies in
keeping with Corporation needs and requirements in that
sphere.
6.5 From time to time, the management of COFINA will issue specific
regulations and put out manuals which interpret and facilitate
implementation of this Statement of Objectives and Policies.
