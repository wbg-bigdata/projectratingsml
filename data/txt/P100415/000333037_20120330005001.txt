F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective of the Project is to minimize the threat posed to humans and the
poultry industry by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other
zoonoses, and to prepare for, control, and respond to an influenza pandemic and other
infectious disease emergencies in humans. To achieve this, three areas will be supported
by the project: (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and
containment. Achieving these goals will contribute to diminishing the burden of disease
and loss of productivity, limiting the regional spread of HPAI, and enhancing economic
and social prospects at the national, regional, and global levels.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal


At the time of appraisal, in 2007, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) had made
substantial progress in post-conflict reconstruction following the Balkan wars of the
early 1990s. The government structure that emerged as part of the Dayton peace
agreements included a weak central State level Council of Ministers with limited
functions and means to raise revenues and two entities: Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (FBiH), and the Republika Srpska (RS). The FBiH is further decentralized
into 10 cantons which enjoy substantial level of autonomy, while the RS retained a
substantially centralized administrative structure. The responsibility for primary services
delivery to citizens largely remains the responsibility of the two entities (and cantons in
the FBiH), with a policy coordinating role performed at the State level. In spite of the
country‟s complex governance structure, the period of post-conflict reconstruction and
state building was a success story. Assisted with the substantial international aid, the
country managed to restore its basic services and infrastructure, and create necessary
institutional framework as a precondition for further development. In the context of the
Avian Influenza Preparedness Project, the central coordinating responsibility towards
Human Health was performed by the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA), while agriculture
and its related functions were under the purview of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Relations (MoFTER).

Since the end of the war BiH‟s economy had benefited from substantial external aid,
but at the time of appraisal it remained at only 70% of its prewar level. The
composition of GDP had changed markedly in the post-war period, the share of
agriculture had declined significantly while the share of services had dramatically
increased. While the overall trends had a similar direction in both entities, there were
notable differences. The primary production sector (agriculture, fisheries and forestry)
remained an important sector in RS at 20 percent of GDP, but had dropped to less than 10
percent in FBIH. Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (AGDP) was estimated at about
14% of the country‟s overall GDP while some 18% of the population was at least
partially employed in agriculture.

The poultry industry was one of the main agricultural sub sectors, producing
around 32 million broilers and one million laying hens, but only about one million of
which were raised in back yards. Annual production capacity for the industry was
around 10 kg of meat and 120 eggs per capita or about 2/3 of demand. Commercial
poultry farming was largely organized as industrial production, primarily involved in the
production of eggs and fresh/frozen chicken meat and processed meat products.
Commercial poultry operations were predominantly enclosed production facilities
equipped with fairly modern production technologies and sanitary practices. Poultry
raised on small household farms limited to a few chickens and/or other domestic birds




                                             1
presented the greatest infection and cross contamination risks, primarily from possible
contact with migratory wild birds.

BiH was considered at “imminent risk? for highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) due to the outbreaks in the country and region, and the known migratory paths
of wild birds. Cases of infection had been found in several Balkan countries (Croatia,
Turkey, Romania), but also in Western Europe (Germany). Asia had the largest outbreaks
including in Republic of Korea, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, South Korea,
Thailand, and Vietnam at the time of appraisal. This project was prepared as an
emergency operation in response to these threats under the Global Program for Avian
Influenza (GPAI) Project Framework Document of December 5, 2005.

There was an urgent need to improve BiH‟s capacity to prevent, identify, contain and
eradicate HPAI outbreaks, and deal with a potential pandemic should this
contingency develop. The Government of BiH has effectively worked together with the
UN specialized agencies (WHO, UNICEF and FAO) and development aid providers (WB,
EC, USAID) to develop adequate levels of prevention, detection and control of avian
influenza/pandemic human influenza in the case of an outbreak in the country. The
authorities of BiH and the above donors agreed to finance and implement a program to: (i)
improve awareness for effective crisis management of key veterinary and public health
personnel; (ii) improve public awareness of how to prevent spread of HPAI; (iii) control
any outbreak affecting humans through effective treatment; and (iv) quickly and
efficiently diagnose any HPAI infections. It was also agreed that the country needed
additional support to strengthen institutional capacities and ensure that a functioning
Compensation Fund was in place.

The rationale for this project included specific benefits to the medical and veterinary
services, and building on initiatives of the United Nations (UN) agencies and the
GoBiH. The project was designed to provide financial and technical support to raise risk
awareness, improve knowledge and understanding among the general population to limit
contagion, strengthen veterinary and public health services and mitigate the social and
economic fallout of a potential influenza pandemic. It built on prior work conducted by
the Government and UN agencies: the World Health Organization, UNICEF and
European Commission had taken the lead on the technical aspects of the Avian Influenza
risks and crises, however many of these efforts suffered from a lack of coordination. The
World Bank anticipated that these UN agencies would continue to take the lead in
providing technical assistance, while it would help with the coordination effort. In
addition, the scale of the response needed to contain and eradicate a potential avian
influenza outbreak and prevent transmission to humans required mobilization of financial
resources beyond the mandate and means of these organizations, and well beyond the
government‟s emergency reserves.

The World Bank was able to bring critical assistance to these efforts in the form of a
financing framework consisting of an IDA credit. In addition, the Bank offered its
operational experience in assisting other countries under the GPAI umbrella, and in
mounting emergency response operations. It was able to draw on valuable lessons



                                             2
learned from other countries facing similar threats and operating in comparable
environments. Furthermore the project offered an opportunity to use the crisis in
strengthening that capacity of institutions to improve response to highly pathogenic
outbreaks of a broader nature linking the veterinary health and human health which rarely
collaborate and improve overall public knowledge and awareness. This was crucial given
Bosnia‟s past experience with significant human contagion from Brucellosis primarily as
a result of poor handling of birthing material during lambing season.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators.

The project development objective was to minimize the threat posed to humans and the
poultry industry by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other
zoonoses, and to prepare for, control, and respond to an influenza pandemic and other
infectious disease emergencies in humans. To achieve this, three areas were supported
by the project: (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and
containment. Achieving these goals was to contribute to diminishing the burden of
disease and loss of productivity, limiting the regional spread of HPAI, and enhancing
economic and social prospects at the national, regional, and global levels.

       The key project indicators were:

   With regard to awareness of HPAI threat and how to prevent it:

       Behavior changes among key veterinary and public health personnel
       Improved public awareness of how to prevent spread increase, and behavior
        changes.

   With regard to HPAI outbreaks among poultry:

       Government culls birds at the infection points following international best
        practice
       Government provides timely compensation to farmers for culled birds

   With regard to HPAI outbreaks among humans:

       Infection diagnosed and contained
       Patients receive effective treatment for HPAI infection

Project indicators were essentially output focused each leading to the increased capacity
in the Entity level Ministries of Health, and of the Entity level Veterinary Services to
adequately identify diagnose and manage a contagious outbreak and to successfully
contain an emerging pandemic. This strengthened capacity was to be underpinned by an
effective communication strategy and public awareness campaign.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification



                                            3
The Project Development Objective was not revised at restructuring after the MTR
mission and the principal project aims remained as identified at design.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The primary project beneficiaries were small landholders keeping poultry in their
backyards, by disseminating simple measures to prevent contagion of poultry, and
improve the capacity to contain zoonotic outbreaks by strengthening veterinary services
and diagnostic capacities. The delivery of targeted public messages aimed at the wider
society in BiH, particularly vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly that would
be affected by a human pandemic influenza.

IDA Credit resources primarily went to the institutions at State and Entity level
responsible to identify, diagnose, and prevent the spread of the disease in the Veterinary
and Human Health sectors in both Entities, a culling compensation scheme, and limited
resources went on improving public information and communications.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Strategic Communications and Public Information (US$0.20 million)
aimed to provide support for a broad range of information and communication activities
to increase attention and commitment of government, private sector, and civil society
organizations, and to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general
population about the risk and potential impact of the disease. Implementation of the first
phase of the communications activities had already been undertaken, through UNICEF‟s
Sarajevo office. Bank financing supported implementation, and design and
implementation of subsequent phases aimed at specific target groups and institutions.

Component 2: Animal Health Protection and Disease Prevention and Control
(US$2.98 million) was to support implementation of disease prevention and control
strategies at national and Entity levels to address short, medium and long-term needs.
Areas for support were based on a review of (i) the epidemiological status of HPAI in
Bosnia-Herzegovina; (ii) the capacity of the State Veterinary Office (SVO) to cope with a
highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic including surveillance and diagnostic
capacity at the national and Entity levels; and (iii) the vulnerability of the poultry industry
to newly emerging infectious diseases. Support to Animal Health component was
coordinated the EC‟s Twinning Arrangement (financed by the Government of the Federal
Republic of Germany), and the Bank financed ARDP with the SVO providing technical
assistance on institutional aspects of the veterinary sector, particularly on the
arrangements toward food safety including inspection services, and support to
laboratories. The EC had financed a feasibility study on large-scale animal waste
disposal.

Component 3: Human Health Protection, and Disease Prevention and Control
(US$1.98) Aimed to (a) help enhance the coordination and planning of human health
related activities, (b) strengthen the capacity of investigation teams and virology



                                              4
laboratories in both entities, (c) help BiH rapidly join the European Influenza
Surveillance Network, (d) help develop the capacity of hospitals to adequately and safely
isolate and treat (suspected) human cases and, (e) finance the procurement of seasonal flu
vaccines and anti-viral drugs. Particular attention was to be paid to capacity building and
the training of staff at the various levels of the health system. This component contained
support to the Ministry of Civil Affairs at the State level, to enhance its capacity to fulfill
its mandate to coordinate human health policy and response for all of Bosnia-
Herzegovina. One of the most crucial activities for preparedness in the Human Health
sector was the finalization of a National Contingency Plan (CP), which would integrate
the CPs already prepared by each Entity. Most importantly the National CP would define
a clear „Chain of Command‟ in the event of a large-scale outbreak affecting human
health. WHO was leading this effort initially with a series of workshops in June 2006.
The final CP, integrating the two Entity-level plans was awaiting parliamentary
ratification at the time of appraisal; the AIPP provided financing for implementation and
any necessary revisions or updates to this plan. WHO had completed an assessment of
laboratories throughout BiH, which formed the basis for the technical planning for the
upgrade of laboratories under the Project. In addition, WHO, with EC support, was
strengthening the overall surveillance system for seasonal flu, which would also help
with faster identification of any unusual flue strains which might arise.

Component 4: Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme (US$0.75) Experience from
early HPAI outbreaks demonstrated that households were more likely to report sick
animals if they have credible assurances from government that they will be compensated
in the event that their animals must be killed to prevent further spread of disease.
Therefore, in order to provide sufficient incentive for early reporting by citizens of sick
animals, and hence timely response by government authorities, within this component
funds were allocated for compensation in case of outbreak. As evidenced by the
experience from the culling campaign (that followed the AI occurrence in wild birds in
February 2006), the compensation mechanism in the CP for AI provided a basis for
timely, efficient and transparent compensation payment to farmers, however it needed
formal documenting and embedding in the standard operating procedures.

Component 5: Implementation Support, and Monitoring and Evaluation (US $0.45)
One of the key characteristics of the HPAI threat is the difficulty in predicting the course
the pandemic will take. An important feature of the project, therefore, was the flexibility
to adapt to a changing situation with the ability to reallocate funds between components
and categories, and possibly draw up new activities. The component was designed to
support costs associated with project management and coordination. It comprised two
sub-components: (i) Implementation Support to the Technical Support Group in the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations; and (ii) Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E).

1.6 Revised Components

While the objectives of the components did not change, substantial reallocations and re-
prioritization took place and other activities were modified from the original design to

coordination of all efforts.

Component 1– Substantial efforts towards developing a public awareness strategy had
been conducted by UNICEF to improve public awareness to the risks of avian influenza.
The project built upon UNICEF‟s initial efforts and provided support to comprehensively
deliver these. An important element in the communication strategy however, was to
define the flow of the internal communication within the various levels of government
from the State to Entity and interagency communication reflecting the National
Contingency Plan. Such a document reflecting the communication guidelines for the
various levels of government as well as the broader range of stakeholders was finalized
and agreed to by all necessary parties in the last year of implementation to ensure proper
information flow within all relevant levels of the governmental administrative structures
as well as for handling information with the public at large.

Component 2 – This component originally planned to support some 7 regional
laboratories located in both entities. Once the analysis of needs and capacities was done,
the figure was revised to support one laboratory in each Entity and to strengthen the
capacity of the Veterinary Institute of Sarajevo that was poorly located in a fairly densely
populated zone where highly pathogenic tests were not deemed safe to execute under EU
practices. This decision was also driven by the relatively small size of the country,
relatively good transport infrastructure, and economies of scale that would reduce
operating costs by concentrating diagnostic services. A strategic view was taken to build
the long term veterinary diagnostic capacity in the country. The Stup site near Sarajevo
was identified as a suitable location by all signatories of the project and comprehensive
reconstruction of the partially destroyed facilities to a level BSL2 (with capacity to
eventually expand to BSL3) was undertaken. The cost for these laboratory facilities were
substantially higher than had been anticipated under project financing and the Cantonal
authorities of Sarajevo provided significant funding. In addition, given that these new
facilities would become the national reference laboratory of not only Avian Influenza but
other zoonoses, part of the funding gap was closed from the Bank financed ARDP project
involved with strengthening the newly formed State Veterinary Office, the Food Safety
Agency, and the Plant Health And Phytosanitary Agency all playing key roles in
improving Food Safety in Bosnia line with EU requirements.

Given that the construction of such a structure is time consuming and immediate
diagnostic capacity was needed, it was agreed that lab equipment and training would be
initially provided on the existing premises of the Veterinary Institute so that once the new
laboratories would be completed, all the instrumentation, equipment and staff would be
moved to the new premises. Albeit certified AI testing is already practiced at the institute,
final acceptance and certification of AI testing in the new premises is scheduled for
December 31, 2011. Brucellosis testing is expected to be certified within the coming year
while other tests will be gradually introduced with the expectation of having the full
laboratory operational within an approximate period of three years. The project did not
invest in culling incinerators as in many other countries to contain contamination form
dead animals. Some four truck based mobile incinerators with the capacity to incinerate



                                             6
large livestock to control Brucellosis were acquired with SIDA funding from another
project and are available for the incineration of birds in the case of an outbreak.

Component 3 – The health sector had already benefited and still receives substantial
donor assistance since the war particularly in Sarajevo, including a Bank financed
project. Upon consultation with the Technical Support Group (TSG) it was agreed that
support in Human Health and hospitals and diagnostic capacity would primarily be
needed in training of staff and development of Standard Operating Procedures to
strengthen current ICU measures to limit contamination and contagion. This decision was
substantially driven by the outbreak of H1N1 in 2009 where immediate assistance was
needed and, as in most of the neighboring countries, for the purchase of adequate
quantities antiviral and flue treatment medication, protective clothing and disinfectants..
Overall, Bosnia‟s response to the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 was deemed effective reflecting
the result of the coordination measures and procedures developed under the National
Contingency Plan based on individual Entity plans and implemented under this project.

Component 4 – As in the other countries of the region, the disease only produced a very
minimal number of contaminated animals and the IDA resources dedicated to this activity
were reallocated to component 2 and the reconstruction of the Stup laboratory in
particular. In order to safeguard against the possibility of a similarly highly pathogenic
zoonose requiring large- scale culling of animals, as part of the reallocation, the
governments of both entities had to include a budget line dedicating resources to the
compensation of farmers in the event of a highly pathogenic zoonose outbreak.

Component 5 - The project was designed to have implementation responsibilities
substantially integrated within the administrative structure of the State government. After
more than a year of very little implementation activity, it was decided that the SVO
would assume the primary coordination responsibility and component coordinators in
each of the Ministries responsible for Human Health and Veterinary Services in each
Entity would take the responsibility to implement the activities related to their subsector,
while activities related to communications would remain centrally managed under the
SVO.

1.7 Other significant changes

The project was restructured with an amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
(DCA) and Reallocation of funds. As reflected previously, the project closing date was
extended for 6 months from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011 in part due to
effectiveness delays, and the very slow start of the project implementation. The IDA
allocation of the Compensation Fund in the total amount of US$ 0.55 million was
redirected principally to the Animal Health and Human Health Components‟ activities.
The condition for approving the reallocation was to receive assurance that the Entities
will allocate sufficient funds from reserve funds towards a new budget line to be in
measure to compensate farmers for the culling of animals in response to contain an
outbreak. The assurance was received from the Borrower.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes.
The project had a very slow start, with effectiveness delayed by over 8 months after
Board approval. Furthermore, the project had been designed to be implemented directly
by the primary stakeholder ministries and agencies through the representation at the TSG.
The intent to fully integrate implementation into the respective ministries and agencies in
BiH‟s very complex, sometimes mutually antagonizing, and often slow administrative
structures was overly ambitious. The project implementation only effectively took off
some 12 months after effectiveness once the separate component coordinators were
appointed in each Entity to focus exclusively on the implementation of the activities
identified under the project. Furthermore, many of the rehabilitation works envisaged
under the project were under budgeted, especially when taking into account the
administrative requirements regarding building permits, utility connections, and
prevailing environmental and zoning regulations. Once designed in accordance to code,
construction costs were substantially higher than originally estimated. Due to the early
implementation delays, a certain pressure to close small projects with relatively high
administrative costs, and other donor projects supporting some of the structures involved
with this project, no additional financing was sought, but a lot of effort was spent on
collaboration with parallel donor activities to obtain a maximum of synergies.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Relevant lessons learned from implementation of projects in the agricultural and
health sectors of Bosnia and Herzegovina informed the design of the proposed
project. They have also been drawn from the design of previous World Bank/IDA and
FAO-supported emergency recovery projects. These include the Vietnam Avian
Influenza Emergency Recovery Project, which was the first Bank-financed project in
response to the Avian Influenza. In addition, lessons have been drawn from the design of
the Kyrgyz Republic AI project, which was the first country-specific project drawing
from the GPAI, and projects that were being prepared for Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia,
Georgia, and Albania.

The project was prepared as an emergency intervention although it was inherently more
of an institutional reforms project. The project required substantial policy decisions and
agreement on prioritizing the facilities that would benefit from the rehabilitation, and
agreeing on communication mechanisms channels and flows from the State to Entities
and respective Ministries and subordinate government structures. These designs in BiH
were substantially more complex and time consuming than in most other ECA countries.
Due to time pressures to deliver what was an emergency project, ultimate decisions as to
which facilities would precisely be benefitting from investments were left open to be
made during implementation. Appropriate coordination of the activities with other
donors was rightfully given a high priority and avoided a lot of potential duplication and
overlap, and helped benefiting from preparatory work that had already been undertaken.

In accordance with the Country Management policy to better integrate projects in
ministries and build lasting capacity in our client ministries, it was decided that the
project implementation would be fully integrated in the respective stakeholder institutions.



                                             8
In BiH with a particularly complex government structure and a weak State capacity, this
decision contributed significantly to the implementation delays until ultimately individual
component coordinators were appointed to take over the responsibility for component
activities. However, delays were also in part due to the perceived lack of urgency since
the pandemic situation never effectively took hold and thus stakeholders did not feel the
need to implement urgently.

The project substantially benefitted from efforts that were already underway at project
design supported by UNICEF, the EU which through their studies and surveys were able
to identify and illustrate the gaps that would be filled by the AI project. Avoidance of
overlaps and duplication was achieved with close cooperation with programs of other
donors.

2.2 Implementation

The Project became Effective on March 28, 2008 with over nine months of delay
from the board approval date. Implementation of the Project was the responsibility of
the Technical Support Group (TSG), consisting of technical advisors representing the
State Veterinary Office (SVO) in the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations,
Ministry of Civil Affairs, FBiH and RS Ministries of Agriculture (Veterinarian Services),
FBiH and RS Ministries of Health, a full-time consultant for communications, and a part-
time monitoring and evaluation consultant. While these staffs were fully embedded in
their respective Ministry and had the technical capacity to make decisions they often did
not have the political mandate to do so, in part due to the notion at political levels that the
risk had been averted since the pandemic never declared. Also the members of the TSG
had difficulties in managing day to day affairs related to the project such as preparing
TORs, providing technical specifications for goods to the procurement and fiduciary staff
at the PIUs. This led to the hiring of the full-time component coordinators assigned to
the relevant ministry in each Entity, once these individuals were in place implementation
proceeded at a rapid pace.

Component 1 – Activities were slow to start mainly due to the delays of nearly 2 years
with appointing a communications advisor and agreeing on the shape and structure of the
communication strategy. It was time consuming to undertake consultation with all
stakeholders to ensure adequate ownership and implementation of the recommendations
defined in the communication strategy. An agreed strategy by all stakeholders had only
been finally delivered in December of 2010 and adopted in March 2011.

Component 2 – Activities under this component required substantial agreement from all
the veterinary services in the country while keeping in mind the mandates of these
services in each Entity. Reaching these agreements required time which led to delays in
identifying the locations that would benefit from investments. Once agreements were
reached however, progress was rapid, for instance the Stup facility was reconstructed in
less than a year. The disease notification system was only actively developed towards the
end of the project in part to adequately integrate it in the registries and databases that




                                               9
were developed as part of ARDP so as to have a fully computerized system that would
provide the basis for risk based interventions.

Component 3 – The activities under this component were coordinated with the ongoing
support the Bank provides to the Health sector in BiH and support from both the WHO
and the EU. Substantial efforts were needed to adequately mesh these activities with
each other and avoid duplications and ensure coordination. A greater number of
activities were undertaken in the RS under this component because of the relatively lower
state of readiness of its hospitals and laboratories to cope with a pandemic situation and
to strengthen the Entity‟s epidemiological diagnostic and treatment capacities.

Component 4 – As previously noted, BiH had experienced a minor HPAI breakout and
had compensated producers for losses from culling campaigns. The compensation
manuals eventually developed by each entity formally reflect mechanisms to ensure that
resources reach the intended beneficiaries acceptable for the purposes of the Bank in
terms of transparency and traceability.

Component 5 – The SVO assumed the primary implementation coordination role which
together with the component coordinators led to a successful implementation of the
project.

PIUs in both entities were handling procurement, contract management and fiduciary
responsibilities relying on the technical input from the TSG. While this arrangement
provided for technical capacity to be built directly at the level of the agencies in which
the activities were performed, it presented implementation challenges and delays. The
lack of familiarity of procedures and document formats that needed to be prepared by
technical specialists as part of the procurement and contract management process
required a lot of back and forth between PIUs procurement staff and technical specialists
until final design and specifications were agreed and bid evaluation criteria adequately
understood. This led to a number of cases of repeat procurement, especially for complex
works and specialized medical equipment and consequently delays.

Disbursements were very slow at the beginning also in part because the initial activities
primarily dealt with consulting services executed by individuals which required relatively
low funding. Once beneficiary institutions were finally agreed, works and designs clearly
defined, disbursements accelerated quite significantly. In spite of the difficulties at the
beginning of the project, at reconciliation of accounts after the grace period of 4 months
after the closing date of June 30, 2011, the project had disbursed some 3.275 million SDR
or over 99% of the originally allocated resources. Most activities had been delivered and
project indicators substantially met. This is a significant achievement given that the
project had been only half disbursed some 15 months before the closing date.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization




                                            10
Design. The M&E system and the list of key performance indicators addressed the PDO
adequately both in quantitative and qualitative terms. As with most AI operations in the
region, M&E indicators were primarily focused on outputs. Delivery of these outputs
would improve the overall awareness and knowledge of the public to reduce contagion,
and provide the stakeholder institutions the tools and capacity that would lead to proper
diagnosis, improved readiness to respond to any pandemic flue outbreak in the human
population and control zoonoses among animals.

Implementation and Utilization. Overall responsibility for M&E was with the Project
coordination unit at the SVO. Initially the M&E findings were not reported very
systematically; however, over time, the quality of information improved. In the last two
years, M&E reporting was handled by MOFTER. It hired an M&E specialist to review
and monitor all investment projects under its responsibility. The M&E officer collected
data from line ministries and other implementation agencies and compiled this data into
semi-annual or quarterly progress reports, focusing on status of physical implementation
by component, use of project funds and monitoring indicators. The quality of the data
collected was generally adequate.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Following procedures for Category B projects under the World Bank policies (OP/BP/GP
4.01, Environmental Assessment) an Environmental Management Plan was prepared. The
document was substantially prepared by the Client (with a hired consultant) in July 2006
and available at appraisal. A site specific EMP for the veterinary laboratory of Stup had
been prepared separately and was disclosed in August 2009. Compliance with mitigation
measures set forth in the EMP for the Stup Laboratory was assessed during the mission
by the World Bank environmental specialist, and the implementation of the EMP was
fully satisfactory. Procurement and financial management were satisfactory and all
financial management and audit reports were provided on time and were found
satisfactory with only minimal qualifications by the auditor.

A procurement review undertaken in late 2009 found no significant deviations in
procurement processes and generally reflected satisfactory contract management.

Late in the project on the site of the Stup laboratory an occupied residence was reported
that had been previously gone unnoticed during the site survey. The case was discussed
with the regional safeguards representative and his team who recommended a full
investigation on the status of the residence and its occupier. The investigation was led by
the team‟s Environmental Specialist and Social Scientist together with the ECCSD
colleague in the field. A full review of cadastre records, land registry records at municipal
and cantonal authorities, as well as a sanitary inspection confirming the habitability of the
premises in proximity of the laboratory lead to the conclusion, in consultation with the
regional safeguards advisor, that the structure was fully legal and therefore did not trigger
OP4.12.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase



                                             11
As previously mentioned the project was prepared as an emergency intervention,
however simultaneously it was envisaged as a steppingstone to improve institutional
capacity in both veterinary and human health sector. In BiH, discussions on institutions
implicitly involve the division of responsibilities between the State and Entities. As such
during implementation, especially as it relates to the veterinary sector, the focus was to
provide infrastructure and capacity at the level of the State that is properly coordinated
with Entity level veterinary services. That has driven the decision to build a large central
diagnostic laboratory for the veterinary sector that is supported not only by the Bank but
by other parallel donor funded activities.

One of the principal policy drivers in BiH is the eventual accession to the EU and the
need to build institutional capacities that lead towards EU compliance. This policy
towards building effective capacity is actively supported by the EU implementing parallel
reforms, and ongoing ARDP Bank financed project, which provide substantial resources
to that effect. The project activities were effectively woven into these ongoing programs
supported by various donors. As such, much of the technical design work in the Human
health facilities was substantially financed by the EU to EU specifications requiring
extensive investments also in ancillary facilities such as pretreatment of waste before
release into public waste systems, zoning restrictions permitting and certification of
design which were supported by the Banks‟ contribution. With ongoing reforms in the
sector in parallel to the project, BiH‟ health care system performance indicators are
approaching OECD levels of health outcomes.

This long term strategy based on EU-accession, that underpins the overall country policy
coupled with significant support and contributions, even from local government, will help
with the sustainability of the investments and continued use with adequate budgets and
resources. While currently the veterinary reference laboratory in Stup only deals with
Brucellosis and AI and is not fully used to capacity, it is planned to become the reference
facility for testing of several zoonoses, in addition it will play a growing role in testing of
animal based products as part of the SVO mandate in the country‟s food safety system.
As of the date of this writing, a formal proposal to remove the laboratory from under the
Faculty‟s responsibility and make it an independent body in accordance with EU
regulation related to reference laboratories is being discussed among all government
stakeholders. This facility does fill a large capacity gap at the level of the SVO to have
access to state of the art laboratory to fulfill its vast mandate to secure the health of BiH‟s
animals but also as it relates to its role in securing a safe supply of animal based food
products approximating EU requirements and helping BiH‟s access to EU markets.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project development objectives, design and implementation arrangements were
prepared in line with the Global Program for control of avian influenza and preparedness
and response program approved by the Bank Board at February 9, 2006. The Balkan
region is a major thoroughfare for migratory birds travelling North in the spring and



                                              12
South in the fall thus significantly putting at risk any local wild fowl but also the
significant number of poultry held in backyards in free range conditions. Building
capacity to avert the risk posed by this situation in all the countries of the region was
essential. In line with that program, the overall objective of the project was to strengthen
the Government capacity for reducing of the threats posed to humans and the poultry
industry by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonoses,
and preparing to control and response by enhancing both animal and human health
infectious disease response and control capacities. To achieve this, three areas were
supported by the project: (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response
and containment. Converging towards these goals contribute to diminishing the burden
of disease and loss of productivity, limiting the regional spread of HPAI, and enhancing
economic and social prospects at the national, regional, and global levels.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project has substantially delivered the activities identified at appraisal including; (i)
the technical assistance provided to the project beneficiaries and stakeholders and the
communication strategy to improve communication flows and minimize the threat of
avian influenza; (ii) the necessary goods and equipment to the animal and human health
laboratories and hospital ICUs; (iii) rapid response teams were established and well
equipped; and (iv) necessary normative acts and manuals have been prepared and adopted
both for animal and human health components; (iv) seasonal vaccines and antiviral drugs
were procured and distributed on time. The project demonstrated very good cooperation
among the animal and human health ministries and agencies including the coordination
with the different sector international organizations like UNICEF, EC, WHO and FAO
and ongoing Bank operations thus avoiding any needless overlapping or duplication at
the project level. The activities of the project did clearly link to the objectives of
awareness building, preparedness and panning as well as the effective containment of any
outbreak at the level of both, veterinary and human health. Overall, the project had a
Moderately Satisfactory achievement of its development objectives.

On communication activities, the initial KAP survey demonstrated that only about a third
of the population was effectively informed of the risks presented by the pandemic, as
well as good hygiene measures to prevent contagion. Subsequent to the awareness
campaign the figure rose to 45% which is reflected in the results framework including a
3% margin of error typical for such a survey). However, this figure is likely to have
reached the 50% envisaged at appraisal since after completion of the communication
strategy a further public awareness campaign was conducted reflecting the objectives
identified in the strategy, however time was insufficient to conduct a last KAP survey
thus the higher figure cannot be confirmed. The completion of the communications
strategy defining clear flows of information within the various government structures
and agencies, and the blueprint for an effective public communication and awareness
building campaign with a 45% positive response to awareness reflect a Satisfactory
achievement of the prevention and containment objectives as related to
communications.




                                             13
Effective support to the overall diagnostic capacity in the veterinary sector and the
coordination mechanisms adopted between veterinary services at State and Entity levels
substantially address the preparedness and planning concerns in the livestock sector.
The disease notification system developed under the project is presently being digitized
and integrated with the new livestock registry and farm registry thus providing the basis
for early tracking of outbreaks and through movement records, the veterinary services
have the ability to undertake targeted mitigation measures and quickly determine the
source of any outbreak. Training at all levels has provided the capacity to cope with a
highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic including surveillance and diagnostic
capacity at the national and Entity levels. While laboratory capacity for proper typology
of HPAI in the veterinary sector is clearly in place, the large share of funding absorbed
by the Stup facility could be questioned, but is justified in the context of the role it is
expected to play in converging towards EU food safety criteria for animal based products.
Finally, the necessary documentation to ensure an effective, transparent, and rapid
disbursement of compensation funds in case of a culling campaign was effectively
developed. The system has proven to work in an early outbreak and the entities have
established a budget line in their emergency fund as part of the contingency plans to
compensate farmers for losses of livestock in case of a culling campaign. Based on the
improved capacity for planning and preparedness as well as the improved capacity to
respond and contain any outbreak the outcome in the veterinary sector from project
investments is rated Satisfactory.

In the Human Health Sector - the Project developed SOPs for hospitals and ICUs and a
National Contingency Plan prioritizing ICUs for addressing highly contagious outbreaks.
BiH effectively link-up with the WHO European Influenza Network. Effective handling
of H1 N1 outbreak demonstrated improved coordination at Entity and State level to
respond to highly contagious outbreaks. Sampling, transport (including IATA
certification) and diagnostic capacities improved with real time PCR including trained
staff fully capable of typing and sub-typing of viruses. The dropping of the works in
Kosevo human health laboratory did not affect the capacity for adequate typing and sub-
typing of the H5N1 virus as it is presently known. However, testing is undertaken in bio
safety conditions that would not qualify for ISO17025 accreditation for testing of a
highly virulent pathogen with high morbidity that could evolve from H5N1 should it
eventually mutate. This reflection needs to also be made in light of the limited resources
BiH has to finance the operating costs of a high level bio safety laboratory, and its
proximity to Western Europe where such capacity readily exists within less than a hour of
flight and a couple of hours by road. The outbreak and effective containment of the
H1N1 has shown the effectiveness of the project activities to minimize the threat posed
by HPAI and similar highly infectious pathogens to the population of BiH. Based on
activities completed, the substantially improved capacity for planning and preparedness
as well as the improved capacity to respond and contain a pandemic outbreak the
outcome in the Human Health sector is rated Moderately Satisfactory.


3.3 Efficiency




                                            14
The economic analysis considered the short-term financial benefits and costs of the
project and the associated program under a with-project and without-project scenarios.
The analysis considered only the lower bound on the potential economic benefits that
would accrue. The analysis did not attempt to quantify the costs and benefits preventing
the spread of the virus to humans. Nonetheless the analysis concluded an internal rate of
return (IRR) of 25 percent using a conservative approach. The project investments were
justified on the basis of the positive externalities associated with prevention and
containment of a highly infectious disease such as HPAI.

The analysis considered two events, one of sporadic nature, similar to the minor outbreak
in early 2006, while the other event would be catastrophic. The probability of a sporadic
outbreak was assumed equal to 100 percent without a project, constant every year, while
the probability of a catastrophic outbreak was assumed to increase from 40 percent to 50
percent over time. Both the probabilities of sporadic and catastrophic outbreaks were
assumed to be smaller and declining under the with-project scenario. It was assumed that
a sporadic outbreak would cause 5 percent of poultry to perish, while a catastrophic event
would result in a 25 percent mortality. Given that a HPAI outbreak did not occur no
losses resulted from AI thus the benefits from mitigated losses cannot be calculated using
the method used at project appraisal.

Due to the lack of data to clearly link project investments in institutional capacity, the
economic benefits are difficult to quantify and the analysis under the ICR is primarily
qualitative. The project‟s major long-term economic benefits stem from strengthened
capacity in early response management for both human and animal health for pandemic
emergencies through the development of an appropriate program of rapid response,
detection and containment measures, including appropriate implementation and
monitoring arrangements. Response to pandemic and influenza-like diseases has been
well coordinated and timely as reflected in the handling of the H1N1 outbreak in 2009
reflecting the cumulative benefits generated from the project investments in capacity
building for Health and Veterinary staff knowledge, diagnostic infrastructure and
equipment, and stockpile of vaccines antiviral drugs, and protective gear. The better
response was also assisted by the improved early warning system developed and link to
the WHO and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm.

Overall diagnostic capacity in terms of both quality and reliability was achieved for both
human and animal diseases, through the provision of new facilities, equipment, training
and the introduction of RT-PCR technology for molecular diagnosis. Diagnostic time has
substantially decreased, while test accuracy has improved.

The improved coordination of the SVO with the veterinary services at Entity level
increased cooperation between Epidemiologists and Veterinary Inspectors to protect and
prevent spreading of animal disease and strengthened local planning and emergency
response delivery capacities and, thus, developed synergies between different
interventions and donors activities.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                            15
The overall outcome rating is “Moderately Satisfactory?. The project was and still is
highly relevant for BiH especially since it has build capacities that also help it in its
primary policy objective towards EU integration. The project followed a template under
GPAI PAD for Bank projects in a number of countries to address the threat of HPAI,
however great care was taken to ensure that each activity was adequately linked into
longer term objectives that would benefit from adequate support as part of satisfying EU
cross compliance. Objectives and design maintained their relevance throughout the
project. The project was flexible in its implementation to address short term needs such
as H1N1 assistance with anti viral medication and equipment for Rapid reaction teams. In
addition, it was well integrated in ongoing donor activities which ensure its sustainability.

The moderately satisfactory outcome rating relates primarily to the incomplete output
indicator for construction of a BSL2+ Human Health reference diagnostic laboratory. The
component was vastly under budgeted to cover the costs of a structure at this high level
of bio safety. It was also not crucially needed since capacity for typology does readily
exist in the country. Given the limited resources BiH has (like most of our client
countries) to finance the operating costs of a high level bio safety laboratory, and its
proximity to Europe where such capacity readily exists within less than a hour of flight or
a couple of hours by road, such an expensive facility would not really be justified. The
IATA staff training financed by the project in this context plays a particularly important
role. Nonetheless, this particular indicator was not fully met.

The project was efficient, although, counterfactual comparisons could not be made
between the IRR calculated at appraisal and another calculated at the end. However,
consideration of qualitative benefits, with a relatively modest level of investment leads to
the conclusion that the project‟s investments were justified and that it will have long-term
economic benefits, especially when linked to the need to meet EU requirements.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Women and children are key actors in backyard poultry sector and, thus, key
beneficiaries of the project. The Public Awareness campaign specifically targeted school
children and teachers, amongst others. Backyard poultry are important contributors to
rural livelihoods for poorer people. When sensitizing the public in awareness campaigns,
efforts were made to ensure avoidance of panic and market shocks for poultry products,
thus safeguarding this important source of income and nutrition. While sudden drops in
prices would have been devastating for industrial production, small holders with limited
resources to begin with would in all likelihood have suffered the most.

Institutional Change/Strengthening

In BiH‟s complex governmental structure, the recognition of a clear communication
channel and an effective disease notification system will help ensuring measures are



                                             16
being taken nationwide to address any outbreak and thus improving responsiveness.
Overall coordination between State services such as the SVO and the Entity services has
improved with the recognition that crisis or pandemics need a systematic approach.
Recognition of the need for the human health and veterinarian sectors to cooperate based
on mutual trust and benefit at all levels has been recognized during the project
implementation.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The improved collaboration among the animal and human health ministries and agencies
across State and Entities is a clear unintended positive outcome. Overall the veterinary
and human health systems have learned to properly collaborate and inform each other in
cases of outbreaks. This will be a valuable benefit since only a few years ago, BiH had a
significant number of Brucellosis cases in humans. Brucellosis in humans is rare and
typically related to poor handling of animals and birthing material which with a simple
information campaign and adequate information and practices by veterinarians and health
care workers can be readily improved. The improved awareness and communication
combined with the other investments in diagnosis, response and containment have a
longer term beneficial effect for managing a number of contagious diseases including
rabies for instance affecting both animals and humans. Finally, the strengthening of
institutions, building of capacities, application of EU standards for building codes and
reconstruction provided the basis for the country to move closer to EU compatibility
which will facilitate its integration in the future.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(Not Applicable)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate – the financing under this project was very limited, and consequently
efforts were made to invest project resources where needs and impact where expected to
be greatest. In agreement with the TSG substantial investments went into the veterinary
national reference laboratory in Stup, under the ownership of the Veterinary Faculty of
FBiH. While largely complete, some auxiliary works such as landscaping and utility
upgrades remain to be done, but is beyond the scope of AIPP. These works are scheduled
and financing is aligned through the Bank‟s ARDP project, under its objective to support
the management of Brucellosis as part of improving veterinary capacity as it relates to
improving food safety and EU alignment. The Entity governments are working together
in agreeing to the modalities to successfully conclude the facility at which time the site
will be certified as reference for AI and Brucellosis in a first phase and to be expanded to
other diseases in the future. Given that this laboratory is part of the overall State
Veterinary Reference capacity, it is expected that the government will make every effort
to resolve this issue expediently. MOFTER is now in process of assigning the facility an
independent status to ensure that the facility‟s reference diagnostic status for zoonoses in
line with international requirements. As such the facility will also play a crucial role
interfacing with Entity inspection and veterinary services to play a growing role in
ensuring improved food safety as it relates to animal based food products converging



                                             17
towards EU food safety requirements. Thus the future of the facility in terms of ensuring
operating resources and use of the developed capacity is relatively secure.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

While BiH has a relatively developed poultry sector, with much of the production inside
and out of contamination danger, there was a large number of small holders applying
backyard management with little capacity to diagnose and little incentive to call
veterinary services in case of disease of one animal. The role of women and children in
poultry management on smallholder farms in BiH was clearly identified at appraisal, and
incorporated into the design of behavior change and communication activities. These
groups presented as significant risk for contagion in BiH, but could even become regional
risk.

The challenge was in part to determine on whether the risks of a pandemic were to be
primarily addressed at incubation in animals or whether it needs to be addressed from a
human health perspective. The Bank team brought knowledge of global good practice as
defined in the GPAI PAD which focuses on the strengthening of veterinary capacities to
mitigate the pandemic. Determining where the priorities would be was difficult taking in
to account the specific country scenario, and adequately integrating parallel Bank and
other donor funded activities. Ultimately, the choice to provide similar importance to
both sectors served Bosnia well during the H1N1 where human health services were
tested and the system responded well.

While institutional arrangements for implementation were complex they corresponded to
a model that was widely promoted in the region to better embed capacity directly in the
beneficiary government institutions. Albeit delays were encountered as a result, decisions
to prioritize investments and activities benefited from adequate ownership from
stakeholder agencies, which was of crucial importance in the complex government
structure of BiH. The design of the project was left sufficiently open to allow effective
decision making by the TSG, and integration of other donor financed activities to avoid
overlap, and integrate findings of studies that were being undertaken to determine
existing capacity to react to a pandemic situation.

Environmental and safeguards aspects were adequately considered at entry with an
overall EMP, backed up by a specific EMP for the reconstruction of the Stup laboratory
facility.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory



                                           18
The Bank fielded six supervision missions from project effectiveness March 2008 till
closing in June 2011 with a Mid-Term Review mission in May 2010. There have been
three TTLs for the project, while this often leads to some lack of continuity, under this
project, thanks in part to the continuous involvement by country office staff in
supervision, only minimal transition problems occurred. The Supervision missions were
well staffed, including health and veterinary specialists in most missions. The team
included a communication/operations specialist on some of the missions. The
procurement specialist offered very strong support throughout the project. Missions
effectively identified and proposed practical resolutions to threats to development
outcomes achievement.

Interim Project Support missions were organized in response to specific problems in
implementation, such as issues with the Animal Health component‟s progress or delays in
disbursement or procurement. At each mission, agreed actions were clearly stated in a
mission aide-memoire. The mission aide-memoires were comprehensive, well prepared
and clearly articulated agreed actions for each project component and, thus, helped ensure
that the PDO was achieved. The fiduciary and safeguards policies were satisfactorily
monitored by the sector decentralized sector specialists based in the country office.
Procurement and financial management were satisfactory and all financial management
and audit reports were provided on time and were found satisfactory.

The supervision teams were responsive and flexible in working with the client to address
immediate needs as was the case during the outbreak of H1N1 and authorization to
procure additional antiviral medication and protective equipment for hospitals.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The project followed a template under GPAI PAD for Bank projects in a number of
countries to address the threat of HPAI. It proved to be relevant for BiH and was aligned
with the Country Strategy, and of the potential threat a pandemic could cause not only
within the country but in the region overall. The Bank undertook extensive efforts to
properly coordinate the various donor funded activities in the two sectors to achieve a
maximum of impacts and avoid overlapping or even duplication. The Bank was
proactive in responding to client requests and was effective in eventually developing a
mechanism with the client that worked in delivering a multi-sectorial project in a
complex administrative structure with often competing interest and weak State leadership.
The Bank was supportive of the overall donor and government strategy to further the
greater vision of building Sate capacity. While at first sight this may have been
questionable in terms of optimal resource application as it relates singularly to the project
objectives, the important efforts in getting endorsement by all parties, State and Entities
does help BiH in on its path towards sustainability of State institutions and eventual EU
integration.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                            19
The structure of the government was always going to make an emergency project dealing
with institutional arrangements difficult in BiH. Due to the political challenges in
reaching agreement between State and Entity government and the often conflicting
interests of each, decisions requiring involvement at the top were slow. The delayed
agreements on PIUs, composition of the TSG affected effectiveness, but also in the final
determination of which institutions would ultimately benefit from investments negatively
affected project implementation. While consistently slow in its decisions in its defense
Government was always supportive of the project objectives, and once the mechanisms
for implementation were fully agreed they proceeded without significant disruptions.

A successful feature performance was cooperation between Ministries, i.e. Health and
Agriculture at the level of the State and in both entities which was a challenge, but was
essential for effective public strategy through the project‟s activities. Part of the delays in
taking decisions was the result of the reduced pressure due to the failure of the pandemic
to take hold. This affected ownership by government and while it could be expected that
different Ministries involved as stakeholders, would lead to some friction regarding
budget allocation, these were only resolved through lengthy meetings with intensive
Bank involvement. The TSG proved to be an adequate vehicle for reaching agreement but
it suffered from delays in reaching political confirmation for agreed actions from the
Council of Ministers.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The SVO as the coordinating agency played a key role in the ensuring implementation
under the project remained on track. It generally was pro-active and did a commendable
job in coordinating the efforts under the project across Ministries and Entities. Overall,
the SVO demonstrated strong commitment to achieving the objectives across all
components. Through the IPSOS agency conducted KAP surveys, there was adequate
beneficiary and stakeholder involvement in the preparation and delivery of
communication messages. While appointed with some delays, the Technical Support
Group (TSG) played a key role in coordinating stakeholders and project activities across
the human and animal health sectors.

There were delays in the mobilizing PIUs which were responsible for contract
administration, procurement and fiduciary safeguards. However, the eventual
appointment of experienced PIUs that had previous experience with Bank projects
ensured a minimum of disruptions. FM arrangements in place, internal controls, project
accounting, financial reporting, flow of funds and auditing arrangements met the Bank
requirements and the recommendations of the Bank missions were fully implemented.

The agreement by the TSG for the appointment of component coordinators to help with
implementation of daily activities substantially improved implementation performance
and played a key role in substantially delivering all the activities under the project and
substantially meeting project PDOs.




                                              20
Relationships and coordination with key partners were excellent, including with USAID,
WHO, UN, UNICEF and FAO, all of whom were actively involved with implementation
of the public awareness and communications, and the animal and human health
components. Project implementation was undertaken in close consultation with the donor
community and the TSG and project representatives participated at the regular emergency
meetings. Exchange of information between donors the Bank and implementation
stakeholders brought synergy, and helped in the best use of resources.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory mainly due to the
difficulties related to reaching decisions of fairly basic nature such as the appointment of
PIUs, TSG staffing that created severe delays in project effectiveness. While there was
broad agreement on the project objectives and intent‟s agreeing on the final beneficiary
institutions, determining which facilities would benefit from support was needlessly long.
More directly at the implementation level, the poor support technical specialists provided
to procurement, for instance, lead to several rounds of re-bidding for the same equipment
due to insufficiently clear technical specifications. Responsiveness in a number of cases
was inadequate and issues only resolved with the Bank‟s direct input.

6. Lessons Learned

A global template can enable rapid, good project design. The GPAI PAD was in
place and was used as the basis for the preparation of this project. The existence of a
sound, global plan ensures that an effective project can be formulated relatively rapidly at
a time of urgency, due to uncertain circumstances related to an emerging infectious
disease

Close coordination with specialized UN agencies can enhance the quality of
technical assistance. WHO, UNICEF and FAO gave technical assurance for project
implementation by working together with the Bank‟s implementing partners and agencies.
This is applicable to a wide range of Bank projects, depending on their particular
technical areas.

In order for a project to be successfully implemented, it is necessary to have a full
engagement of the people in charge of direct implementation of project activities,
including, fostering inter-institutional and inter-sectoral cooperation, planning and
reporting, the preparation of annual work programs and budgets, preparation of TORS
and specifications for goods and works bidding documents, preparation of quarterly and
annual progress reports etc

It stands to reason that a small project such as this one could have readily been integrated
into an ongoing operation. The emergency nature of these interventions, however,
combined with the complexity of the topics involving multiple agencies and
ministries as stakeholders require a high level of coordination to avoid „turf battles?



                                             21
and to ensure the full ownership by all. Albeit expensive in supervision proportionally
to loan size these small stand alone projects with dedicated implementation
responsibilities seem to have better outcomes and cooperation across the sectors than
merged operations..

The human and veterinarian health sectors need to come closer and link on the basis
of good cooperation, mutual trust and benefit at all levels and resisting turf battles. These
sectors cannot function on their own in the areas of joint interest, particularly in the
resolution of problems they have in common, such as zoonoses, but also to track
evolution of epidemic outbreaks and cross species infections and monitoring.

Component 3: Human Health Protection and Disease Prevention and Control

      Hospitals in both Entities developed their preparedness plans in case of large number of
       patients needing hospitalization for the flu. Where appropriate these were done in
       accordance with the instruction prepared by the respective Public Health Institutes.
      Law on protection of population from infectious diseases has been adopted
      Three sessions of Global network, related to Human health, for distance learning
       executed. The topics were: (i) Clinical management of serious cases of H1N1, (ii)
       Hospital preparedness for pandemic; and (iii) Communication in pandemics and risk
       management.
      Training materials on Clinical management of serious cases of H1N1 were additionally
       distributed to all doctors working in the intensive care units and that can be in a situation
       to cure people infected with serious form of pandemic influenza. Also, materials from
       other sessions were delivered to persons in charge of preparedness of health institutions
       and communication in both entities.
      Standard operating procedures and protocols for management of avian/pandemic
       influenza were also considered in both entities, also through educations/training for
       primary practice doctors, as well as for rapid response teams in case of cases of
       avian/pandemic influenza appear.
      Rapid response teams in both Entities were officially established and made operational
       with clear definitions of their obligations and tasks. Initial education for RR teams was


                                               30
       completed. All the necessary equipment for field work of RR teams was procured and
       detailed operating plans of work in the field for RR teams were prepared.

       practical work on specific and special equipment at the viral laboratory (automatic
       extractor, PCR), as well as on diagnostic protocols, keeping and sending samples etc.,
       conducted at the National Influenza Center, The long-term cooperation between the two
       institutions was established, based on the exchange of information, experience, operating
       procedures and mutual visits.
      Experts from the Veterinary Faculty in Sarajevo, University of Sarajevo, conducted the
       training for the staff of the viral laboratories of the Veterinary Institute “Dr Vaso
       Butozan? in Banja Luka and RS Public Health Institute in Banja Luka, related to practical
       work in the diagnosis of influenza virus. Long-term cooperation between the institutions
       was established.
      In the period of initial project implementation phase, FAO, on the level of B&H,
       organized integrated simulation exercise for avian influenza in animal and human
       population. The objective of this exercise was to test the revised plan of urgent measures,
       pointing out the significance of early detection and response, pointing out the need for
       close cooperation between all relevant stakeholders. This exercise served as good
       indicator of deficiencies in preparedness, at the beginning of project implementation.
       That's why there was no need to organize introductory simulation exercise at the
       beginning of the project.

       As every year, in season 2009/2010, 15.000 doses of seasonal flu vaccines are procured
        through RS Health Insurance Fund. Those vaccines are for patients who are in at-risk
        groups according to WHO guidelines and are free of charge. This amount is not sufficient
        to vaccinate all patients from risk groups. All remaining, including health workers, must
        pay for the seasonal vaccine. Through AIPP, in season 2009/2010 we have procured
        additional 10.000 doses for RS which were distributed in accordance with priorities
        determined by special working group nominated by MoH. Priorities, considering actual
        pandemic, were: health workers, assistant staff in health institutions, pharmacists, persons
        situated in social institutions and collective residence centers.

                                                33
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


The Project Development objective of the Project is to minimize the threat posed to humans and
the poultry industry by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonoses,
by enhancing animal and human health infectious disease response and control capacities.

The project focused on communication & awareness programs concerning both human health and
poultry management, on training/capacity building of key staff in the health and veterinary
systems, laboratory renovation and rehabilitation and triage and intra-hospital operational and
safety procedures.

The project cost benefit analysis at the time of appraisal was based on short-term financial
implications of the spread of the virus and the loss of poultry stock during contained sporadic
and/or widespread outbreaks. The analysis appraised an internal rate of return (IRR) of 25 percent.
The project investments benefits stream was based on the positive externalities associated with
prevention and containment of a highly infectious disease such as HPAI.

Given that a HPAI outbreak did not occur during the life of the project did not collect
comprehensive quantitative data to enable conventional calculations of economic rates of return
and to reasonably attribute overall changes to the project. Still, the Project‟s efficiency can be
evaluated on the basis of early indications of improved efficiency of the early response
management of health and veterinary systems, efficiency in implementing the hospital procedures
for emergency, and efficiency gains in the stocking and distribution of vaccines.

PROJECT BENEFITS

The project‟s major long-term economic benefits stem from strengthened capacity in early
response management for both human health and veterinary systems for epidemic emergencies.
The better preparedness of the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities in detection, prevention and
treatment. The creation of a stockpile of antiviral drugs also served for the treatment of the
patients. Another major benefit was the increased intensive care capacity through the
establishment of first ICU for infectious diseases and training. Trained key staff have been
actively engaged and contributed as trainers for a better management of AI, pandemic influenza
and other diseases situation.

The increased capacity of the veterinary service in control, end eradicate zoonoses at the source
of infection before it becomes endemic has resulted in enormous costs savings. Although the
analysis did not re-calculate the financial projection of the possible losses due to an AI epidemic,
it is reasonable to partly attribute to the project the lower financial losses and lesser funds for
compensation should an epidemic occur now.

The project invested heavily in national and regional capacity building. Strengthening local
planning and emergency response delivery capacities would include developing the synergies
between different interventions and donors activities.

Component 1: Strategic communication and public outreach

Component of strategic communications and public outreach in AIPP Project was conducted for
the whole of BiH. This component was to inform all society sectors about the risk of HPAI and
other zoonoses, what proper protective measure could be taken, and equally important, to reduce
unjustified fear of disease, and also, to increase attention and commitments of Government,
private sector and civil society organizations and raising awareness, knowledge and
understanding among the general population about the risk and potential impact of the disease.

With adaptation of the National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan (NPIPP) approved at the
State level, the focus of the communication component is transferred to enhancement of the
internal communication network.

Subcomponent: Communication Advisor

The following outputs were produced for health and pension sector under this subcomponent:
    (i)     Communication strategy for avian influenza and other zoonoses outbreak completed
    (ii)    Guidelines for the testing of simulation of AI and other zoonoses outbreak
    (iii)   Information campaign plan recommendations produced and delivered
    (iv)    Workshops for PR officers/interactive training delivered
    (v)     Public communication Workshops for local veterinarians delivered


Subcomponent: Workshop on communication skills –interactive training

         Workshop on communication skills - interactive training for PR officers of key
institutions involved in communication chain by NPIPP held. The aim of this activity was to
provide additional training in the field of communication during crisis situations for PR officers,
who usually most often communicate with the public.
Subcomponent:Workshop on communication skills – local veterinarians

         Workshop on communication skills – for local veterinarians held. Veterinarians are the
best sources of information related to zoonoses. The workshop provided a basic knowledge in
communicating with the public in order to provide population with information that will improve
knowledge of health risks related to zoonotic diseases and to reduce panic during the crisis
situations.

Subcomponent: Printing of NPIPP

        600 copies of NPIPP were printed and evenly distributed to all institutions involved in the
chain of command and communication by NPIPP. Copies of NPIPP delivered to all institutions
were included in NPIPP management chain. Aim of this activity was to facilitate performances
of key staff during the influenza.

Subcomponent: Workshop on risk communication strategies

        Worshop for key staff included in NPIPP management and communication chain were
held in Fojnica and Teslic (70 people attended). Although this activity was originally part of the


                                                38
AH component, it was shifted into a communication component, and had a positive role in
implementing the objectives of this component. Aim of these workshops was to improve
communication capacity at key institutions included in communication and management chain by
NPIPP and Contingency plan, and also introducing the key medical and veterinarian staff into
their roles and responsibilities through hierarchical and communication schemes of
communications during crisis situations. Participants expressed satisfaction with workshops,
gained knowledge and a desire for similar workshops (accompanying survey). The workshop has
contributed to the reconnection of key staff, and pointed to the communication problems that can
be solved.

Component 3: Human health protection, disease prevention and control

  (i)        Hospitals developed their preparedness plans in case of large number of patients
             needing hospitalization for the flu. This is done in accordance with the instruction
             prepared by the Public Health Institute.
  (ii)       RS Law on protection of population from infectious diseases has been adopted by RS
             Peoples Assembly on 35th session, on 25. and 26. January 2010.
  (iii)      During 2009, three sessions of Global network, related to Human health, for distance
             learning executed. The topics were: „Clinical management of serious cases of H1N1“,
             „Hospital preparedness for pandemic“, and „Communication in pandemics and risk
             management“. Sessions were attended by representatives of Clinics in Banja Luka
             and East Sarajevo, general hospitals RS-wide, Institute of physical medicine and
             rehabilitation Banja Luka, Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Republic of
             Srpska.
             Materials from the session „Clinical management of serious cases of H1N1“ were
             additionally submitted to all doctors working in the intensive care units and that can be
             in a situation to cure people infected with serious form of pandemic influenza. Also,
             materials from other sessions were delivered to persons in charge of preparedness of
             health institutions and communication in both entities.
  (iv)       Standard operating procedures and protocols for management of avian/pandemic
             influenza were also considered in both entities, also through educations/training for
             primary practice doctors, as well as for rapid response teams in case of cases of
             avian/pandemic influenza appear.
  (v)        Rapid response teams officially nominated by Ministry of Health and Social Welfare,
             which included definition of their obligations and tasks. Initial education for RR teams
             was done. All the necessary equipment for field work of RR teams is procured.
             Detailed operating plan of work in the field for RR teams was prepared.
  (vi)       Representative of Ministry of Health and Social Welfare participated on Learning
             exchange event organized by the Government of Vietnam and the World Bank from
             14-17 April 2010 and International Ministerial Conference on avian and pandemic
             influenza (IMCAPI) from 19- 21 April 2010 in Vietnam.
  (vii)      The education of microbiologist from the viral lab of the PHI, regarding principles of
             practical work on specific and special equipment at the viral laboratory (automatic
             extractor, rtPCR…), as well as on diagnostic protocols, keeping and sending samples

            etc., conducted at the National Influenza Center, Viral Laboratory in Ljubljana,
            Slovenia, led by virologist Dr. Katarina Prosenc. The long-term cooperation between
            the two institutions was established, based on the exchange of information, experience,
            operating procedures and mutual visits.
   (viii)   Experts from the Veterinary Faculty in Sarajevo, University of Sarajevo in Bosnia and
            Herzegovina, conducted the training for the staff of the viral laboratories of the
            Veterinary Institute “Dr Vaso Butozan? in Banja Luka and Public Health Institute of
            the Republic of Srpska in Banja Luka, related to practical work in the diagnosis of
            influenza virus. Long-term cooperation between the institutions was established.
   (ix)     In the period of initial project implementation phase, FAO, on the level of B&H,
            organized integrated simulation exercise for avian influenza in animal and human
            population. Exercise was held in Sarajevo, December 3-4, 2008. The objective of this
            exercise was to test the revised plan of urgent measures, pointing out the significance
            of early detection and response, pointing out the need for close cooperation between
            all relevant stakeholders. This exercise served as good indicator of deficiencies in
            preparedness, at the beginning of project implementation. That's why there was no
            need to organize introductory simulation exercise at the beginning of the project.


Project component 4: Support to the B&H Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme

The compensation manuals have be developed and adopted by the State Veterinary Office and
Entities. The documents are formal procedures are based on the mechanisms developed as part of
the culling campaign organized in 2006. There have subsequently been no further outbreak and
no disbursements made against the project funds. A budget line is included as part of emergency
contingency plans to address culling campaigns.
