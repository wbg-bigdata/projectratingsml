  Project development objective

  The overall objective o f the Project is to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry industry by
 the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonoses, by enhancing both animal
  and human health infectious disease response and control capacities. To achieve this, three areas will be
  supported by the project: (i)prevention, (ii)preparedness and planning; and (iii)response and
  containment. Achieving these goals will contribute to diminishing the burden o f disease and loss o f
  productivity, limiting the regional spread o f HPAI, and enhancing economic and social prospects at the
  national, regional, and global levels.
 Project description[Details can befound in Appendices 2 and 2a]

  Inaddition to the Bank and government co-financing described below, various other international
  organizations-including      the European Commission(EC), World Health Organization(WHO), United
  States Agency for InternationalDevelopment (USAID), UnitedNations Children's Fund(UNICEF)-are
  active in assisting the Government o f Bosnia and Herzegovina to address the threat o f Avian Influenza.
  The Project has been designed in close cooperation with these organizations to leverage the maximum
  financing possible and to avoid duplication o f efforts. The complementary activities o f these
  organizations are briefly explained below. However, the exact levels o f financing of these donor activities

 It is of critical importance that all sectors o f society are properly informed about the risks from HPAI, in
 order that proper protective measures can be taken, and, as importantly, to reduce the risk o f unwarranted
 fear about the disease (e.g., unnecessarily reducing consumption o f poultry products). This component
 would provide support for a broad range o f information and communication activities, to increase the

attention and commitment o f government, private sector, and civil society organizations, and to raise
awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general population about the risk and potential
impact o f the disease. Implementation o f the first phase o f the communications strategy has already been
completed, through UNICEF's Sarajevo office. Bank financing would implement subsequent phases.

The most effective way to reduce the threat from HPA, to both the economic sustainability o f domestic
poultry production and human health is to prevent the disease from establishing itself in domestic poultry.
This component would support implementation o f disease prevention and control strategies at national and
entity levels to address short, medium and long-term needs. Areas for support are based on detailed
assessments o f (i)the epidemiological status o f HPAI in Bosnia-Herzegovina; (ii)the capacity o f the
State Veterinary Office (SVO) to cope with a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic,
including surveillance and diagnostic capacity at the national and entity levels; and (iii)the vulnerability
o f the poultry industry to newly emerging infectious diseases.

Implementationo f the Animal Health component will be assisted by the EC's Twinning Arrangement
(financed by the Government o f the Federal Republic o f Germany) with the SVO to provide technical
assistance on institutional aspects o f the veterinary sector, particularly in food safety, inspections, and
support to laboratories. The EC will also finance a feasibility study on large-scale animal waste disposal

At present, there have been no human cases o f HPAI infection reported in BiH. However, it is likely that
at some point in the future, suspected or confirmed cases will occur, and rapid and coordinated
interventions will be necessary. Under this component, the project will (a) help enhance the coordination
and planning o f human health related activities, (b) strengthen the capacity o f investigation teams and
virology laboratories in both entities, (c) help BiH rapidlyjoin the European Influenza Surveillance
Network, (d) help develop the capacity of hospitals to adequately and safely isolate and treat (suspected)
human cases and, (e) finance the procurement o f seasonal flu vaccines and anti-viral drugs. Particular
attention will be paid to capacity building and the training o f staff at the various levels o f the health
system. This component contains support to the Ministryo f Civil Affairs at the State level, to enhance
their capacity to fulfill their mandate to coordinate human health policy and response for all of Bosnia-
Herzegovina.

One o f the most crucial activities for preparedness in the Human Health sector is the finalization o f a
National Contingency Plan (CP), which integrates the CPs already prepared by each Entity. Most
importantly the National CP will define a clear `Chain o f Command' in the event o f a large-scale outbreak
affecting human health. WHO is leading this effort, through a series o f workshops undertaken in June
2006. The final CP, integratingthe two Entity-level plans has been completed, and is awaiting

parliamentary ratification; the AIPP will provide financingfor operationalizationofthis plan. WHO has
also recently completed an assessment of laboratories throughout BiH, which will form the basis for the
technicalplanningfor the upgrade of laboratories under the Project.

In addition, WHO, with EC support, is working to strengthenthe overall surveillancesystem for seasonal
flu, which will also helpwith faster identificationof any unusual flu strains which might arise.

Experience from world HPAI outbreaks has clearly shown that individuals are more likely to report sick
animals if they have credible assurances from government that they will be compensated inthe event that
their animals must be killed to prevent further spread of disease. Therefore, in order to provide sufficient
incentive for early reporting by citizens of sick animals, and hence timely response by government
authorities, within this component funds for compensation will be provided. As evidenced by the
experience from the culling campaign (that followed the AI occurrence in wild birds in February 2006),
the compensation procedure prescribed and elaborated in the CP for AI ensures timely, efficient and
transparent compensation paymentto farmers.

One of the key characteristics of the HPAI threat is the difficulty in predicting the course the pandemic
will take. An important feature of the project, therefore, will be the flexibility to adapt to a changing
situation with the ability to reallocate funds between components and categories, and possibly draw up
new activities. The component would support costs associatedwith projectmanagement and coordination.
It would comprise two sub-components: (i)ImplementationSupport to the Technical Support Group inthe
Ministry of ForeignTrade and EconomicRelations;and (ii) Monitoring and Evaluation(M&E).

A.       STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1.       Country and Sector Backgroundand Global, Regionaland National Dimensions

(a)      Country and Sector Background

1.       Bosnia and Herzegovina has made remarkable progress in post-conflict reconstruction, social
integration and state building since the end of the 1992-95 war. However, the economy stands at only
70% of its prewar level. The business environment is not as investor-friendly as it needs to be to attract
the levels of investment required for sustained economic growth.            Some 50% of the 4.1 million
population is at or near the poverty level. The lack of employment opportunities is a major factor limiting
the resettlementof refugeesand internally displaced persons.

2.       The composition of GDP appears to have changed markedly in the post-war period. According to
official statistics, the share of agriculture has declined significantly while the share of services has
increased.    While the overall trends follow a similar direction in both entities, there are notable
differences. The primary production sector (agriculture, fisheries and forestry) has remained an important
sector in Republika Srpska (RS) at 20 percent of GDP, but has dropped to less than 10 percent in the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBIH). Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (AGDP) makes up
about 14% of the country's overall GDP. It is estimated that 18% of the population is employed in
agriculture.

3.       The poultry industry represents one of the main agriculture sub sectors, and production currently
falls just short of meeting the national market demand for its products. It is estimated that BIH has
around 32 million broilers (estimated annual production capacity), 1 million laying hens, and
approximately 1 million animals raised in back yards. Annual production capacity for the industry is 10
kg of meat and 120 eggs per capita (annual consumption in BiH is 14 kg of poultry meat and 180 eggs per
capita). The total annual production of poultry meat for 2004 is estimated at approximately 43,000 tons,
and for the same year production of eggs was around 450 million. Average market price for poultry meat
i s US$2 per kg, and the price of an egg i s US$O.O8. Commercial poultry farming is largely organized as
industrial production, primarily involved in the production of eggs and fresh/frozen chicken meat and
processed meat products. The commercial poultry plants are enclosed operations which use modern
equipment and technologies. Other poultry are raised on small household farms limited to a few chickens
and/or other domestic birds.

(b)      International Dimension

4.       East Asia is the region most affected by HPAI to date, with Cambodia, China, Indonesia,
Thailand, and Vietnam all reporting human infections. The number of countries affected by HPAI in East
Asia has increased and now includes Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Lao PDR, Mongolia, South
Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. The geographical spread of HPAI, the human dimension and the potential
enormous social and economic impact are unprecedented. Despite control measures the disease continues
to spread, causing further economic losses and threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of poor
livestock farmers, jeopardizing smallholder entrepreneurship and commercial poultry production, and
seriously impeding regional and international trade, and market opportunities. With outbreaks rapidly
spreading in other regions such as Europe and Central Asia (ECA) and Africa, there is a growing
realization that the international community faces several transnational challenges that do not emanate
directly from the policies o f individual states. Correspondingly, these challenges cannot be countered
solely by the actions of individual states, because they present a threat to the entire world. An important
emerging transnational threat is the spread of infectious diseases across national borders, which has the




                                                  11

potential to undermine countries' stability, security, economic development, human capital accumulation,
and not least, the welfare o f the population.

(e)     Regional and National Dimension

5.      Until recently, avian flu outbreaks were limited to Southeast Asia. In July 2005, outbreaks were
registered in domestic poultry and fowl in seven regions o f Russia. Four months later, outbreaks in
poultry o f HPAI H5N1were reported in four regions o f Kazakhstan. Since 2005, outbreaks o f avian flu
have occurred in many countries outside East Asia.               After crossing from China into Russia and
Kazakhstan, outbreaks were reported in Albania, Azerbaijan, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,
Cyprus, Croatia, France, Greece, Germany, Italy, India, Iran, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland,
Turkey, and Ukraine. Seasonal migration o f birds contributes to transmission o f new strain variations to
different geographical regions. In October 2005, H5Nl was reported among migrating swans in Croatia,
which lies on the northern border o f Bosnia and Herzegovina.

6.   On February 16, 2006, four swans from Pliva Lake in Jajce Municipality were brought to the
Reference Laboratory o f the BiH State Veterinary Office (Poultry Center o f Sarajevo Veterinarian
Faculty) for testing. Two o f the four swans tested positive in preliminary serologic tests; necropsy
findings for these two swans indicated the presence o f AI. State authorities subsequently mounted a
coordinated and thorough response to what was in essence a real-time emergency simulation.                      The
preparation mission o f March/April2006 was presented with substantial detail on this response, and noted
that implementation o f the veterinary control measures elaborated in the Contingency Plans (CP) appear
to have successfully halted any further spread o f the infection. In particular, the CP's clear "chain o f
command" rules allowed local authorities to act with confidence. In addition, on March 9, 2006, a case o f
AI was confirmed in a rooster inthe municipality o f Bajina Basta (Serbia). As a consequence, the nearby
community o f Bratunac in BiH was declared an endangered area, and measures were instituted as
prescribed by the CP. The infection also appears to have been halted in this area. No new cases have
been reported since then.

7.      The emergence o f outbreaks in neighboring countries has had a negative impact on both poultry
production and consumption in BIH. Based on data from large-scale traders, poultry consumption
appears to have fallen by about 30-40 percent after the recent cases emerged in Croatia and Romania.
Official production fell by more than 50% in mid-2006, with some o f the major producers almost fully
halting production'. The decline in production and consumption have been accompanied by a drop in
market prices o f about 10 percent, while farm-gate prices o f chicken declined from 2.3 KM/kgto 1.4 -
 1.5 KM/kg.

2.      Rationale for Bank Involvement

8.      HPAI control programs require a multi-disciplinary approach to integrate technical, social,
economic, political, policy, and regulatory issues in addressing a complex problem.                  Working in a
collaborative manner with other agencies (WHO, UNDP, UNICEF, EC, USAID), the Bank is well-placed
to apply the evidence and lessons learned from international best practice in the various regions to help
ensure that BiH's emergency preparedness plans and capacities are ready for the H P A I challenge. The
Bank has a strong comparative advantage in providing integrator skills and multi-sectoral perspectives,


I As poultry production needs to be plannedinsuch a way that 36 days old chickenare available daily, the
production chain cannot be stopped instantly. Therefore, the real extent ofthe reduction can be seen only with a
two-month delay, time required to completethe fullproduction cycle.


                                                     12

and in addressing the institutional dimensions of the response to such emergencies. It can also bring
extensive experience and skills in analyzingand addressingthe social and economic impact. Importantly,
the Bank has a long recordin BiH in bringingtogether the relevant ministries, government agencies, and
the donor community, and inhelpingensure high levelpolitical coordination.

9.       Given the Bank's work with local and internationalpartners in BiH and at the international level
to address both preparedness and outbreaks and to assist with institutional assessments, the Bank can
assist Bosnia and Herzegovina in leveraging additional resources from other international and bilateral
agencies. In addition to its financial role, the technical assistance provided by the Bank has been
important in similar global or regional emergency situations such as SARS, Tsunami relief, and
HIV/AIDS. The Bank's national and regional support will be closely linked with the activities of FAO,
WHO, OIE and the EU, and the proposed project is fully consistent with, and draws heavily on the global
strategies proposedby FA0 and WHO.

B.       PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1.       Lending Instrument

10.      The project is to be supported by a Credit from the InternationalDevelopmentAssociation (IDA)
of US$5 million equivalent. In addition, the Bank is working on helpingto mobilize additionalresources
from bilateral and international agencies. Activities under the IDA-financed project will complement
activities supported by other international partners and donor agencies (EC, UNDP, UNICEF, USAID,
and WHO) and help ensure the availability o f adequate resources to fund the priority investments and
technicalassistance which BIH has identifiedas critical needs in implementingits response to HPAI. The
Project is supported by the Bank-financed Global Program for Avian Influenza Control and Human
Pandemic Preparednessand Response(GPAI) approved by the Bank's Boardon February 9,2006.

11.      As per the GPAI, a country will qualify for support under the GPAI when it demonstrates its
commitment and readiness to implement early detection and rapid response measures appropriate to the
specific country conditions. A country request for assistance would be eligible for financing under the
GPAIwhen it meetsthe following eligibility criteria:

(i) For countriesinendemicsituationwhere new human infectionsare beingdetected, it hasprepared
     and is implementingan HPAIControl Strategy;

(ii)For newly infectedcountrieswith an activeoutbreak of avian flu among poultry, but no human
     infections, the existence of an appropriate program of rapid response, detection and containment
     measures, including appropriate implementation and monitoring arrangements that the international
     agencies and donor community, includingthe Bank, could support.

(iii)For countries at risk,with no outbreak, or that are at an early stage of an outbreak, government
     commitment and appropriate plan of early detection and rapid response, including appropriate
     implementationand monitoring arrangements that the international agencies and donor community,
     includingthe Bank, could support.

(iv)For countries with very low income levels and very low capacity circumstances, including
     LICUS countries, special criteria and waivers would apply if a full-blown human pandemic were to
     materialize, to ensurethat assistancewould be available if and when needed, even ifthe country itself
     would hardly be able to generate or mobilize any effective AI response, to safeguard the global-
     public-goodnature ofthe global avian influenzaobjective.



                                                  13

12.      The joint BanWWHOAJNICEF pre-Appraisal mission o f MarcWApril 2006 made an assessment
o f the readiness o f BiH to proceed with a program of support under the GPAI. It concluded that BiH
meets the eligibility criteria as per (iii)above. The level o f commitment o f BIH is high: (i)a letter
requesting the Bank's assistance was received on February 24, 2006; (ii)draft assessment plans and
preparedness plans on the response to an avian influenza pandemic were prepared by the Government
prior to the appraisal mission; and (iii)appropriate implementation and monitoring arrangements have
been discussed and agreed.

13.      ProjectCharacteristics. The financial assistance under the project will be provided as a Credit.
The Credit is being processed as an emergency investment operation usingprocedures under OP 8.50 -
Emergency Recover Loan (ERL), and it meets all applicable Bank policies, practices and standards as
discussed below.

2.       ProjectDevelopmentObjectives

 14.     The overall development objective is to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry
industry by HPAI infection and other zoonoses, by enhancing both animal and human health infectious
disease response and control capacities. To achieve this, three areas will be supported by the project: (i)
prevention, (ii)preparedness and planning; and (iii)response and containment.

3.       ProjectComponents

15.      The project would finance activities under five components: (i)Strategic Communications and
Public Information; (ii) Animal Health Protection, and Disease Prevention and Control; (iii)Human
Health Protection, and Disease Prevention and Control; (iv) Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme; and
(v) Implementation Support, and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). Even though the activities are
organized by sectoral components, the project strongly endorses an integrated national plan that ensures
common objectives across sectors for dealing with the avian flu issue.

16.      Building on the work initiated by the Entity Public Health Institutes with the support o f UNICEF,
several communications interventions will be financed, chief among them the further development and
implementation o f the already drafted communication strategy. The draft strategy includes, inter alia,
improved communications strategies between and across government agencies (National Communication
Plan); protocols for coordination of the outbreak and crisis communication for professionals
(veterinarians, human health medical personnel, inspections, civil protection, state border service, etc);
materials and targeted training for educators; capacity building in communication techniques for health
workers, teachers and media professionals; and, at the community level, awareness raising and
communication for behavior change activities through all appropriate communications channels. While it
is crucial that each sector involved in public awareness and communications work under an overall
strategy and broader framework, the actual implementation o f communication and public information
activities will necessarily be carried out sectorally with a core set o f common objectives (more details are
included in Annex 2A).       UNICEF took the lead role in implementation o f the first phase o f the
communications strategy, with financing from USAID in the amount o f US$0.21 million. IDA financing
would complement the planned UNICEFLJSAID interventions, especially after the first year of
implementation. Three sub-components are foreseen:

        Developing basic communication materials;
        Developing and testing messages and materials to be used in the event of a pandemic or emerging
         infectious disease outbreak; and

17.     The most effective way to reduce the threat from HPAI to both economic sustainability of
domestic poultry production, and human health, is to prevent the disease from establishing itself in
domestic poultry. This component will provide support to the implementation of disease prevention and
control strategies established at national and entity levels to address short, medium and long-term needs.
Areas for support are based on detailed assessments of: (i) epidemiological status of HPAI in BIH; (ii)
                                                             the
the capacity of the State Veterinary Office (SVO) to cope with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
epidemic, including surveillance and diagnostic capacity at the national and entity levels; and (iii)the
vulnerability of the poultry industry to new emerging infectious diseases.

18.     The component would have four sub-components:

        Enhancing HPAI prevention and preparedness capability;
    0   Strengthening of Veterinary Services, disease surveillance, diagnostic capacity and applied
        research;
    0   Strengthening HPAI control programs and outbreak containment plans as well as capacities to
        implement those plans; and
    0   Improving bio-security in poultry production and trade, and isolating its potentially adverse
        effects on other aspects of people's lives.

19.     The European Commission is actively providing support to animal health objectives through a
twinning program with the SVO. This program is under implementation, initially during 2007-2009 to
support capacity building with the SVO in the areas of legislative reform, food safety, phytosanitary
regime, inspections, and laboratory upgrading.

20. '   Both Entities have developed contingency plans. With the aim to further improve planning and
coordination, the project will (a) help conduct simulation exercises, (b) support the revision of the plans
and (c) support the preparation of social distancing plans and clean-out plans for hospitals. The
surveillance system will be strengthened through: (i)the training and equipping of investigation teams,



                                                   15

(ii) the equipping of 1 virology laboratory in RS and two in the FBiH (one for virus typology in Sarajevo,
and one for virus identification in Mostar); and (iii)the strengthening of the communicable diseases
monitoring and reporting system. It is expected that all these efforts will result in BiH joining the
European Influenza Surveillance Network. To help reduce the risk of a genetic recombination/ mutation
of the virus, the project will support the immunization against seasonal influenza of populations at high
risk. The capacity of the health sector to adequately isolate and treat suspected or confirmed human cases
of avian flu will also be strengthened. Particular efforts will be made to train health staff at different
levels of the health system, improve their knowledge of infection control measures and facilitate the
adoption of the most appropriate attitudes and behaviors so they can both protect themselves and
effectively take care of their patients. The interventions supported under the Project will be based on
BIH's epidemiological and programmatic needs, and well-assessed options for meeting them. The
interventions will be grouped inthree sub-components:

     0   Enhancing public health program planning and coordination;
     0   Strengthening of the national public health surveillance system; and
     0   Strengthening health system response capacity.

21.      The European Commission (EC) has allocated US$l80,000 equivalent from its ongoing project,
being implemented with WHO support, to continue strengthening the surveillance systems in the human
health sector. In addition, for the period 2007-2009, the EC will contribute EUR 500,000 to strengthen
the overall human health laboratory system. This support will be complementary to the laboratory
upgrades provided under the AIPP.

22.      Experience from world HPAI outbreaks has clearly shown that individuals are more likely to
report sick animals ifthey have credible assurances from government that they will be compensated inthe
event that their animals must be killed to prevent further spread of disease. As evidenced by the
experience from the culling campaign that had followed AI occurrence inwild birds in February 2006, the
compensation procedure prescribed and elaborated in the CP for A I ensures timely, efficient and
transparent compensation payment to the farmers. The CP contains the necessary forms and instructions
for personnel and institutions involved in culling, and ensures reimbursement of the farmers within a
timeframe of 7-10 days post-animal depopulation. The only factor that can compromise the effectiveness
of the existing compensation procedure, and thereby decrease the incentive for farmers to participate in
A I control efforts, is the limited budget available for this purpose. Currently, compensation costs related
to animal disease outbreaks are covered from the emergency fund (entity level budgets). Compensation
costs on the scale of that needed for the A I outbreak.experienced in February 2006 can be easily covered
by the government. However, if AI would occur in an area close to large-scale poultry farms, the
available budget under the current culling arrangements would not come even close to covering the
resulting expenses. Therefore, in order to provide sufficient incentive for early reporting by owners of
sick animals, and hence enable a timely response by government authorities, funds for compensation will
be provided within this component. A mechanism for the mobilization of these funds will need to be
agreed as a condition of disbursement (under the Animal Health Component), as well as distribution of
the responsibility for repayment among national and entity governments.

23.      One of the key characteristics of the HPAI threat is the difficulty in predicting the course the
pandemic will take. An important feature of the project, therefore, will be the flexibility to adapt to a
changing situation with the ability to reallocate funds betweencomponents and categories, and potentially
to draw up new activities. The component would support costs associated with project management and
coordination. It would comprise two sub-components:

     0   Implementation Support to the Technical Support Group and PIU/PCU
         Monitoring and Evaluation(M&E).

4.     LessonsLearned and Reflectedin the Project Design

24.      Relevant lessons for the design of the proposed project have been drawn from implementation of
projects in the agricultural and health sectors in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They have also been drawn
from the design of previous World BanWIDA and FAO-supported emergency recovery projects. These
include the Vietnam Avian Influenza Emergency Recovery Project, which was the first Bank-financed
project in response to the Avian Influenza. In addition, lessons have been drawn from the design of the
Kyrgyz Republic A I project, which was the first country-specific project drawing from the GPAI, as well
as projects currently under implementation in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, and Albania.

25.      Lessons learned indicate that project success depends to a large extent on the speed of the
response provided. Particularly when dealing with smallholders' production systems, a speedy, efficient
and transparent distribution of suitable key inputs is clearly a major factor in limiting the impact of a
crisis and hastening recovery. A performance audit of some of the emergency projects supported by the
Bank in various regions drew the following general lessons: (i)emergency projects should avoid policy
conditionality; (ii)project design must be simple and take into account a realistic assessment of the
existing Borrower's capacity and other stakeholders capacity; (iii)a speedy project processing and
approval are crucial to provide a prompt response and a substantial contribution to project success;
(iv) procurement arrangements need to be flexible and should be finalized at an early stage;
(v) mitigation and prevention measures should be included in the design to minimize impacts of a
possible recurrence of the disaster; and (vi) realistic assessments should be made of counterparts'
absorption capacity, as well as o f the effective communications and coordination mechanisms among all
relevant stakeholders.

26.      The main recommendations arising from the first 18-month implementation period of the
Vietnam Avian InfluenzaEmergency Recovery Project are:

     (a) Preparednessis a key factor. While Vietnam had a national strategy document to control avian
         influenza in the domestic poultry population, it was not clearly understood and shared by all
         relevant agencies and stakeholders, and some aspects of the response were lagging behind.

     (b) A two-pronged strategy is recommended. This should include: (i)the control of avian
         influenza at the source in high-risk regions (through aggressive measures including culling,
         movement control and vaccination campaigns for poultry and ducks); and (ii)simultaneously



                                                    17

        prepared short and medium-term measures to minimize the risks to humans and prepare for an
        eventual pandemic.
        High level government commitment is of the essence. For implementation arrangements, it is
        important to have a coordination structure that is empowered with multi-sectoral responsibilities,
        along with full-time project coordinators to implement activities in a "crisis situation".
        Moreover, this level o f coordination would foster effective integrated national response, including
        all technical ministries in charge o f agriculture/animal health and human health, as well as other
        relevant sectors, at the national and sub-national level, in case o f a human epidemic.
        HPAI Control Strategy and PreparednessPlans need to be linked to the broader agenda of
        regulatory and institutionalreforms. In particular, a revised "compensation framework" is an
        essential element to obtain real cooperation from affected stakeholders (farmers/producers) and to
        ensure the efficacy o f the surveillance and diagnosis mechanisms. Other long-term reforms
        include the restructuring o f the poultry industry and the development o f food safety regulations.
        Technical, scientific and operationalcapacity of the relevant participating agencies, and in
        particular National Veterinary Services, should be strengthened. The AI crisis highlighted
        several weaknesses in the animal health as well as public health services systems, including: poor
        surveillance at the local level, weak diagnostic capacity, lack o f epidemiological expertise and
        information system, and inadequate operating budget to bear the additional costs o f physical and
        human cost to contain the spread o f the disease.
        Control strategies must include awareness raising and public information campaigns. It is
        extremely important to raise awareness in the public and private sectors from the initial moments,
        and to strengthen effective coordination mechanisms for the implementation o f the necessary
        technical responses, involving the Government, the donor community, the private sector and the
        civil society.

        Regional collaboration is critical. Attention should be given to support the integration o f each
        country to a regional and global framework for the control o f HPAI, and more broadly o f all
        trans-boundary animal diseases and other emerging infectious diseases, to increase cost-
        effectiveness and ensure the harmonization o f activities and responses.

        Some important lessons learned from the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic2 are incorporated
in the design o fthe proposed project. They include:    I




    e   The need for high level political commitment and leadership is key.
    0   A comprehensive multi-sectoral approach is needed.
    e   Monitoring and evaluation is critical in the scaling-up o f a national response.
    e   Stakeholders at the country and international levels, are important in dealing with the AI threat.
    0   Building a strong fiduciary architecture is essential.

C.      IMPLEMENTATION

1.      PartnershipArrangements

28,     The Bank and the international community can play a key role in the response to Avian Influenza,
especially at the country level where there is a need to develop an overall framework to guide national
action plans that can be the basis for government and donor support. Such a framework should address

both animal and public health aspects as well as economic impact. Many o f the investments needed to
address this disease are core public health and animal health functions that are considered "global public
goods", thus, necessitating a global and regional response with support from the international community.
Such partnership arrangements have been developed in BIH with the technical agencies as well as with
bilateral agencies. Several meetings were organized prior to and during appraisal to briefthe international
partners on the Bank's plans to work with the Government in the design of a country-specific project and
to confirm their interest in participating in the financing o f the project.

29.     BIH is receiving support on the technical content of an Avian Influenza response from key
technical agencies. International agencies and donors have been active through a Task Force established
in BIH for coordinated support of AI. The European Commission (EC) has allocated US $180,000
equivalent from its ongoing project, being implemented with WHO support, to continue strengthening the
surveillance systems in the human health sector. In addition, the EC has allocated EUR 500,000 for the
2007-2009, to assist with provision o f biosafety equipment for human health laboratories and hospitals.
UNICEF has been working closely with the Inter-Sectoral Committee to design a draft communications
strategy. As importantly, UNICEF support for AI communications was funded by USAID in the amount
o f US $0.20 million. These activities are now nearly completed, and have delivered a wide range o f
communications tools to enhance the overall government response. UNDP has expressed its interest to
collaborate by making available US $100,000 to support AI activities. The aim o f the IDA-fundedProject
i s to support an integrated response to AI with all international partners contributing and supporting
BIH's preparedness and control program. Further work inthis regard will continue prior to effectiveness
and during implementation to ensure complementarity o f all such grant financing from international
partners.

2.      Institutionaland ImplementationArrangements

30.     Because o f the inter-sectoral nature o f this project and potential for an AI outbreak or human
pandemic that is national in scope, it is critical that both animal and human health experts, as well as
communications specialists, work together closely at national and entity levels to perform the day-to-day
tasks o f implementing the Project. Implementation o f the Project will be undertaken by a Technical
Support Group (TSG) consisting o f technical advisors who are representatives o f the State Veterinary
Office (SVO)3 in the Ministry o f Foreign Trade and Economic Relations, Ministry o f Civil Affairs, FBiH
and RS Ministries o f Agriculture (Veterinarian Services), FBiH and RS Ministries o f Health, and
consultants for communications and monitoring and evaluation.

3 1.    The representative o f SVO on the TSG will be a permanent civil servant and will serve as Project
Coordinator, reporting to the Minister o f MoFTER. The TSG will report to the Council o f Ministers
through MoFTER. The TSG government representatives will be responsible for coordinating with and
reporting to their relevant government departments, to guide and monitor implementation o f activities in
their respective areas. The TSG will be responsible for monitoring and evaluation, the preparation o f
annual work programs and budgets, preparation o f TORSand specifications for goods and works bidding
documents, and preparation o f quarterly and annual progress reports.

32.     Procurement, financial management and financial reporting services for the project will be
provided by the PIU Forestry and Agriculture in Sarajevo, and by the Health Sector PCU in Banja Luka.
More details on the implementation arrangements are provided in Appendix 2c.




   SVO has the mandate to coordinate veterinary services on behalf ofthe Entity Ministriesof Agriculture, Water
Management and Forestry.


                                                      19

33 .     Overall responsibility for overseeing and coordinating institutional and implementation
arrangements will be vested with the Minister o f Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (MoFTER) on
behalf o f Council o f minister^.^

34.      At the cantonal and municipalities levels, implementation would be the direct responsibility of
each cantonal/municipal veterinary/health authority. Small coordination units should be established at the
local level comprising officials from healthheterinary services to work under the supervision and
guidance o f the entity ministries.

35.      To facilitate the management and implementation o f the Project, a Project Operational Manual
(POM) satisfactory to the Association is to be prepared by the TSG as a Condition o f Effectiveness.

3.       Monitoringand Evaluation of OutcornesDtesults

36.      M&E activities related to the project will be the responsibilityo fTechnical Support Group (TSG)
supported by the PIU/PCU. These activities could be carried out by the regular staff o f the agencies (with
technical assistance from the project) or by contracting out these functions with specialized
agenciedinstitutes when appropriate.

37.      Monitoring project progress and the achievement o f objectives will entail a process o f
continuously and systematically reviewing the various project implementation activities. The objectives
o f the M&E activities are to: (i)measure input, output and outcome indicators (see Appendix 1); (ii)
provide information regularly on progress toward achieving results and facilitating reporting to the
government and IDA; (iii)    alert government authorities and the international partners to actual or potential
problems in implementation so that adjustments can be made; (iv) determine whether the relevant
stakeholders are responding as expected and intended by the project; (v) provide a process whereby the
implementation agencies can reflect and improve on their performance; and (vi) enable the project to
make necessary changes should the situation evolve.

38.      The results of relevant M&E activities will be reflected in the quarterly and annual progress
reports.    A section o f the progress reports will be devoted to issues identified during project
implementation and the strategies and actions to be taken to resolve such issues that affect progress.

4.       Sustainability

39.      Critical to the sustainability o f the Project will be the continuous ownership o f this initiative by
the various stakeholders, coupled with strong political support and the availability o f an adequate flow of
financial resources to carry out project activities. In addition, institutional sustainability would be ensured
by: (i)strengtheningo f programs to maintain public awareness o f the threat o f avian influenza and other
rapidly spreading infectious diseases; (ii)sustained surveillance and prevention and control activities,
particularly in high risk regions; (iii)strengthened country capacity to manage at national and local levels
the risk factors associated with the spread of avian influenza and other infectious diseases; and (iv)
effectiveness o f programs to control the spread o f avian influenza from birds to the general population.



4An inter-sectoralCrisis Committee was establishedinNovember 2005 under the chairmanshipof the MoFTER to
overseethe HPAI control and containmenteffort andto provide generalpolicies and guidance for avian influenza
control. An Inter-SectoralWorking Group (ISWG) was establishedby the MoFTERto provide technical responseto
the AI outbreak in February 2006, and led project preparationfor the BiH. Boththe Crisis Committee andthe
ISWG may continue to function as circumstanceswarrant. However, neither would have a role in implementation
of the Project.

PossibleControversialAspects

40.      The Project will support the implementation o f immediate term responses to a global influenza
pandemic   -- the classic "social distancing measures"-- such as quarantine, bans on mass gatherings, and
travel restrictions that may be politically and socially controversial.    This means that dialogue and
compromises are needed among different stakeholders, backed by a well-designed communication
strategy. A high degree o f political commitment to preventing and controlling the spread o f infectious
diseases such as a global influenza pandemic would be needed for managing controversies that will
undoubtedly arise.

6.       Credit Conditions

41.      The key conditions needed to minimize the risksto the Project would be addressed by the country
meeting the eligibility requirements for entering the Global APL.          Specific provisions have been
developed to meet the standard requirements covering organizational and staffing arrangements, as well
management, procurement and financial management arrangements. These have been addressed during
appraisal and were confirmed prior to Negotiations. Conditions of Effectiveness for the project would
be: (a) Establishment by the Recipient o f the TSG in a manner and with the composition and terms o f
reference satisfactory to the Association; (b) The Annual Work Program for the first year o f the
implementation o f the Project, satisfactory to the Association, has been prepared and adopted by the
Recipient and each Entity; (c) the Project Operational Manual, the EMP, and the FM Manuals, all
satisfactory to the Association, have been adopted by the Recipient and each Entity (d) a Project
Agreement has been executed on behalf o f the Association and each Entity, on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association; (e) for each Entity, a Subsidiary Agreement has been executed on behalf
o f the Recipient and the Entity concerned, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association.

42.      Conditions of Disbursement comprise: (i)execution o f a Project Agreement between the
Association and the Entity; (ii)execution o f a Subsidiary Agreement between the Recipient and the
Entity;(iii)for expenditures under Component 4, adoption by the Recipient and each Entityo fthe Poultry
Culling Compensation Scheme Manual; (iv) provisions for Retroactive Financing under components 1, 2,
3, and 5; and (v) the opening o f Project Accounts (for the Federation o f Bosnia and Herzegovina, the
initial deposit is to be equivalent to US $0.02 million; for Republika Srpska, the initial deposit is to be
equivalent to US $0.015 million).

43.      Financial Covenants. The Federation PIU in the Ministry o f Agriculture and the RS PCU
established in the Ministry o f Health will maintain financial management systems acceptable to the Bank.
The project financial statements, summary reports and the designated account will be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank on terms o f reference acceptable to the Bank. The annual
audited statements and audit report will be provided to the Bank within six months o f the end o f each
fiscal year.

44.      The audits will be conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) as
issued by the IFAC and on terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.

45.      The PIU and PCU will appoint an acceptable firm o f auditors under terms o f reference acceptable
to the Bank to carry out operational review o f the compensation payment system as part o f the annual
audit when compensation claims have been made.

D.      APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.      EconomicAnalysis

46.     The poultry industry in BH is relatively small.                  Overall 2004 production amounted to
24.5 million kilograms. Of that, about half is produced by large commercial poultry farmers and the rest
by individuals, mainly subsistence farmers (Table 1). Exports have been negligible, largely because o f
lack of veterinary certification.

47.     Poultry accounts for a relatively small part of households' consumption. In 2004, overall
consumption o f poultry amounted to 38.2 million kilograms, domestic production meeting 64 percent o f
consumption needs and imports accounting for the rest. One-half o f imports originated from Croatia.
Overall poultry consumption amounted to about 1.3 percent o f GDP, 3 percent o f total food expenditures
and slightly over 1 percent o f overall household consumption. Together with the consumption o f eggs
and processed poultry products, consumption of poultry and poultry-related products amounted to about
KM350 million in 2004, equivalent to 2.6 percent o f GDP and 2.1 percent the overall household
consumption.

EconomicImpactAnalysis

48.     The economic analysis considers the short-term financial benefits and costs o f the project and the
associated program under a with-project and without-project scenarios.                 The analysis should be
considered as setting only the lower bound on the potential economic benefits that would accrue. The
analysis does not attempt to quantify the costs and benefits preventingthe spread o f the virus to humans.

49.     The analysis considers two events. One is sporadic outbreak o f disease, as occurred in early
2006, and the other is a catastrophic outbreak. Table 2 lists the key assumptions o f the analysis. The
probability o f a sporadic outbreak is assumed equal to 100 percent without a project, constant every year,
while the probability of a catastrophic outbreak is assumed to increase from 40 percent to 50 percent over
time.  Both the probabilities o f sporadic and catastrophic outbreaks are assumed to be smaller and
declining under the with-project scenario. Further, it is assumed that a sporadic outbreak will cause 5
percent o f poultry to perish, while a catastrophic event will result in a 25 percent death rate.

50.      Under these assumptions, the Net Present Value (NPV) o f the project using a discount rate o f
10 percent is $0.3 million. The IRR for this project is unique and equal to 25 percent.

5 1,     As indicated above, the project presents the lower bound o f benefits to society. The estimated
economic benefitswould be substantially larger ifthe costs and benefits o f averting human hospitalization
are taken into account. For example, were an outbreak o f avian flu to result in human infection, the cost
o f hospitalization and possibly death would be substantial.

2.       Technical

52.      Animal Health.        Successful implementation o f the project depends on a phased multi-
disciplinary strategy based on a sound epidemiological approach to control H P A I outbreaks.              This
strategy has to take into consideration the range o f epizootic and epidemiological scenarios that exist or
may arise in BiH, as well as the different poultry production systems within the country, and different
levels o f incidence (ranging from high incidence with variable flock outbreaks, through low frequency
disease outbreaks with partial flock immunity, to sporadic outbreaks).           A balanced combination o f
appropriate disease control options, tailored to the specific characteristics and needs o f BiH, i s therefore
essential for the achievement o f the project objectives.

53.      Key technical issues being addressed by the project include: (i)    capacity o f the public and private
veterinary services; (ii)adequate regulatory and incentive framework (including sub-laws); (iii)
regulations and protocols in accordance with OIE standards and guidelines); (iv) adequate laboratory
facilities and staff capabilities; (v) harmonization o f disease information systems to improve BiH's
capacity to participate in the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) o f the OIE; (vi) bio-
security measures; (vii) minimizing contact between potential infected wild birds and domestic poultry;
and (viii) coordinating among public agencies and with the private sector to improve long-term planning
for infectious disease control.

54.      Human Health. So far, no human HPAI cases in humans have been reported in BiH. However,
the existence o f free-ranging poultry in backyards and close contact between human and poultry put BiH
at relatively high risk o f transmission o f the virus to humans. The assessments carried out show that the
capacity o f the MOHs, Public Health Institutes (PHIS)and other stakeholders to: (i)rapidly and accurately
detect HPAI cases in humans; (ii)adequately isolate and treat suspected or confirmed cases o f AI in
humans; and (iii)protect from the AI virus and other communicable diseases both populations at high
risks and the general population is still relatively limited.



                                                      24

  55.     First, the chain o f command is insufficiently defined, which could lead to many problems and
 delays, even in case of a limited crisis. Second, while investigationteams do exist at the Entity level
 PHIs, and cantonal and regionalPHIs, their capacity to quickly and effectively investigateand respondto
  local outbreaks appearstoo limited. Third, althoughefforts are beingmade by both Entities,the ability of
 health services to effectively isolate and treat suspicious or confirmed AI human cases is at present
 extremely limited. This is even true at the level of tertiary hospitals, where appropriately organized and
 equipped isolationrooms do not exist at present. Fourth, the investigationteams as well as laboratory and
 medicalpersonnel lack protective equipment and clothingand the current stocks of antiviral drugs appear
 too limited. Fifth, health services will rapidly become unable to cope with an explosive increase of the
  number of patients.

  56.     In such a context, priority needsto be given to: (i)the strengthening o fthe capacity of Entity and
  local investigation teams through training and the provision of necessary equipment, notably personal
 protective equipment; (ii)the creation of isolation rooms in hospitals, for effective isolation of the first
  cases of HPAI in humans; (iii) the training of health workers in infection control measures; and (iv) the
 preparation of plans to "clean out" hospitals in case o f a severe outbreak and the identification of
 culturally and socially appropriate social distancingmeasures in case of a pandemic. In parallel, actions
  should be taken to help: (a) strengthen the system for the surveillance of communicablediseases and help
 BIH become part o f the European Influenza Surveillance network; and (b) build-up adequate human
 microbiologyand virology laboratorycapacity in each Entity.

 3.       Social

  57.     Although there are several large and a number of medium-size commercial poultry producers,
, about 25% o fpoultry are kept by smallholders intheir backyards and managedby women with the help o f
 children. Such families are disproportionately likely to be inthe lower income quintiles.

  58.     The central roles of women and children in managing backyard poultry have important
  implications for the project:

          Given the involvement of children managing domestic birds (feeding, egg collection, herding
          geese and ducks, etc.), awareness and educational efforts need to ensure that children are
          effectively targeted and reached with appropriatelydesigned messages,through the schools.
     0    Reaching women with critical AI awareness messages and information will, similarly, require
          specific targeting and utilization of suitable dissemination and outreach channels. School-age
          childrencan bring leafletsto their mothers.
          In the event of culling, compensation will needto be providedto women owners, and the project
          will ensurethat mechanismsare in place to ensurethis.

 4.       Fiduciary

  59.     The financial management arrangements of the project are acceptable to the Bank. The overall
 FM risk for the project is moderate except for the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme that is
 consideredto be highrisk. However adequate mitigationmeasuresand internal controls are requiredprior
 to the disbursementof funds and some of the key controls are includedbelow (appendix 5). The financial
 management arrangements of the Federation PIU in Ministry of Agriculture and the RS PCU established
 in the Ministry of Health have been assessed and continuously monitored as part of project supervision,
 and have been found to deliver high quality fiduciary services to the projects.They have both established
 and maintained good financial management system for the implementationof the Bank financedprojects.
 The financial management systems will be expanded to support the proposed project and additional


                                                    25

expertise in financial management will be engaged and financed under this project. The internal control
and fund flow arrangements are yet to be finalized for the cash grants/Poultry Culling Compensation
Scheme component, but the basic control procedures for the existing compensation system for Avian
Influenza described in 2005 is a valuable basis for finalizing the procedures with the added complication
with additional sources of financing for the compensation from this project. The flow of funds under the
cash grantsPoultry Culling Compensation Scheme sub-component will only begin after appropriate
internalcontrol and fund flow procedureshave been documented in the financial manual that will be part
of the Project Operational Manual and after the Bank has assessed the internal control arrangements as
satisfactory. Appropriate flow of fund mechanisms is a condition of disbursement. Detailed financial
management arrangementsare described in Appendix 5.

60.      Procurement. The capacity of the PIUPCU to conduct procurement under Bank guidelines has
been assessed as satisfactory under the Forestry/Agriculture and Health Projects, respectively..
Procurement functions will be strengthened by the recruitment of an additional procurement specialist to
be responsible for procurement under this project in the PIU and PCU. Activities to be financed from the
Credit shall be undertaken in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Bank "Guidelines -
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 (the Procurement Guidelines).
Similarly, the selection and employment of consultants' services shall be governed by the "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 (the Consultant
Guidelines). Details on procurement arrangements are provided in Annex 4. The procurement plan will
be finalized during Appraisal.

5.       Environment

Environmental assessment             Environmental Category                       PI

61.      The two safeguard issues which pertain to the Project are those of environmental assessment for
methods to be deployed for disposal of culled poultry and of mitigating the negative impacts of mandated
culling of poultry on small scale backyard poultry producers. A delay in the completion and disclosure of
the Environmental Assessment from the normal appraisal stage has been approved, instead making this a
condition of disbursement for Component 2 - Animal Health, and Component 3 - Human Health. The
draft EMP has been completed, with the public consultation held on July 20, 2006 in Sarajevo. Following
this, the EMP was finalized in end-September 2006. Nevertheless,prior to Effectiveness, evidence of the
adoption of the EMP by the Recipient and each Entity needs to be provided to the Association.
Activities under the proposed project are not expected to generate any significant adverse environmental
effect, as a large part of the project is geared to support prevention activities. Overall, the project would
have positive environmental and social impacts. The primary potential environmental risks can be
grouped into three categories:

    (a) Inadvertent human exposure and spread of the virus due to: improper culling and disposal of dead
         birds (wild birds, sick and dead birds from backyard and commercial poultries); lack of, or
         improper use of personal protection equipment (PPE); improper disposal of farm waste (i.e.,
         bedding, manure, washings, etc. during and/or after an outbreak); and inadequate lab biosafety
         protocols.

    (b) Inadvertent release of chemicals in the environment from unsatisfactory decontamination
         procedures (for personnel, poultry sheds, and transport vehicles, etc.).

    (c) Release of chemicals and infectious agents into the environment from inadequate laboratory and
         medical facility waste management.




                                                    26

62.      Building capacity for collection and testing of Avian Influenza virus.              The Project's
investments in facilities, equipment, and training for laboratories will improve the effectiveness and
safety over existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting international standards
established by OIE. Upgrading for laboratories will include provision of appropriate facilities and training
for waste management and for bio-safety level 2 and 3 operations. Medical waste generated in health care
facilities will be managed using existing guidelines in BiH, which have been found satisfactory under
previous projects. The Project would also support updating these guidelines, training of health care
workers to manage medical waste following these guidelines, and, as appropriate, purchase of equipment
for the proper handling and disposal of medical waste in participating facilities. These provisions would
be included inthe Project Operational Manualto be prepared prior to effectiveness.

63.      Overall, the Project will assist the government to develop a strategy for managing future
emerging and re-emerging zoonotic and infectious diseases outbreaks. As such, the project would
improve environmental and social safeguards, in two areas: (i)mainstreaming environmental safeguards
into protocols and procedures for the culling and disposal of animals during an outbreak, in particular by
adopting OIE standards in these areas, and improving bio-medical waste management systems in health
facilities and laboratories; and (ii)development of policies on compensation for poultry farmers affected
by future outbreaks.

64.      Since the Project is assessed as a B-category project, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
would be implemented with project support (see project components). The EMP addresses safe culling
practices, and disposal of carcasses, laboratory wastes, and medical waste. This EMP also covers the
clean up of animal wastes of culled poultry by the local public veterinary services and minor civil works
supportedunder the Project.

7.       Policy Exceptions& Readiness

65.      The only policy exception requested has been with regard to the waiver of the completion of the
EA and EMP per para. 12 of OP 4.01. As noted above, evidence of the adoption of the EMP is a
condition for Effectiveness. The project meets the regional criteria for readinessfor implementation.

1.       The project would finance activities under five components: (i)Strategic communications and
public information; (ii)animal health protection and disease prevention and control; (iii)human health
protection and disease prevention and control; (iv) poultry culling compensation scheme; and (v)
implementation support, monitoring and evaluation.            It should be emphasized that even though the
activities are organized by sectoral components, the Project calls for, and strongly endorses an integrated
national plan that ensure common objectives across sectors for dealing with the threat of HPAI.

In addition to the Bank and government co-financing described below, various other international
organizations -- including the European Commission (EC), World Health Organization (WHO), United
States Agency for International Development (USAID), UnitedNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) - are
active in assisting the Government o f Bosnia-Herzegovina to address the threat o f Avian Influenza. The
Project has been designed in close cooperation with these organizations, to leverage the maximum
financing possible, and to avoid duplication o f efforts. With the exception o f UNICEF, the exact level o f

2.       It is o f critical importance that all sectors o f society are properly informed about the risks from
HPAI, in order that proper protective measures can be taken, and, as importantly, to reduce the risk o f
unwarranted fear about the disease (e.g. unnecessarily reducing consumption o f poultry products). This
component would provide support for a broad range o f information and communication activities, to
increase the attention and commitment o f government, private sector, and civil society organizations, and
to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general population about the risk and
potential impact o f the disease.

3.       Building on the work initiated by the EntityPublic Health Institutes with the support o f UNICEF,
numerous communications interventions will be financed, chief among them the further development and
implementation o f the already drafted communication strategy. The draft strategy includes, inter alia:
improved communications strategies between and across government agencies (National Communication
Plan); protocols for coordination o f the outbreak and crisis communication for professionals
(veterinarians, human health doctors, inspections, civil protection, state border service, etc); materials and
targeted training for educators; capacity building in communication techniques for health workers,
teachers and media professionals; and, at the community level, awareness raising and communication for
behavior change activities through all appropriate communications channels. A local Communications
Specialist will be hired to work in the Technical Support Group to coordinate activities under this
component. He/she will be assisted by short-term consultants to be engaged as needed to address specific
communications issues. In order to assist with the above tasks, three types o f activities are being
considered for financing:




                                                      39

    0   Developing basic communication materials, including developing and testing messages and
        materials to be used inthe event of a pandemic or emerging infectious disease outbreak;
        Developing training courses in communications methodology for veterinary staff as well as for
        health workers at the cantonal and municipal levels; and
    0   Collaboration among stakeholders, including state level authorities such as the Ministry of
        Foreign Trade and Economic Relations, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Security, as
        well as veterinary and public health authorities at the state, entity and municipality levels.

A.      DevelopingBasic CommunicationMaterials

4.      Activities to be supported would include developing and testing messages and materials to be
used in the event of a pandemic or emerging infectious disease outbreak, and further enhancing the
infrastructure to disseminate information at the state and local levels and between the public and private
sectors. Communication activities will support cost effective and sustainable methods such as marketing
of "handwashing" through various channels through the delivery of handwashing messages via mass
media, counseling, schools, etc. Communication materials would be integrated into Avian Flu specific
interventions as well as ongoing outreach activities of ministries and sectors, especially ministries of
health, education, agriculture, security and transport. Specifically, support would be provided for: (i)the
development and distribution of basic communication materials (such as question and answer sheets and
fact sheets) on influenza, influenza vaccine, antiviral agents, and other relevant topics; (ii)general
preventive measures such as "do's'' and "don't's" for the general public. Support would also be provided
for information and communication activities to increase the attention and commitment of government,
private sector, and civil society organizations, and to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding
among the general population about the risk and potential impact of the pandemic and to develop multi-
sectoral strategies to address it.

B.      DevelopingTraining Courses in CommunicationsMethodology

5.      This sub-component would support the development and implementation of training courses in
communications methodology for veterinary staff as well as health workers at the State and local levels.
It will include the preparation and dissemination of information materials, and the provision of
communications and information equipment for use at the state and local levels. Specifically, support
would be provided for (i)information and guidelines for health care providers; (ii)training modules (web-
based, printed, and video); (iii)presentations, slide sets, videos, and documentaries; (iv) and symposia on
surveillance, treatment and prophylaxis. In addition, support would be provided to strengthen networks
of communication offices, as well as mechanisms to increase coordination and consistency of messages
among risk communication managers. Training would be provided under this sub-component for spoke-
persons from priority sectors in managing the media, partnering with the electronic and print media with a
view to highlighting the national response, as well as accurately reporting on the monitoring,
preparedness, containment and mitigation plans, as the case may be. The Ministry of Education and
relevant partners will participate inthe development of educational materials to be used in schools.

C.      Collaborationwith Stakeholders

6.      The multi-dimensional problems associated with HPAI infection necessitate collaboration from a
wide range of stakeholders within each country, which has to be supported by broad communications and
information campaigns to improve public awareness. The major stakeholders include various ministries
(Finance, Agriculture, Health, Transport, veterinary services, national research institutions and diagnostic
laboratories), NGOs and civil society organizations, private sector companies and associations (e.g. large
poultry producers, farmers' associations, veterinarians and farmer involvement at the grass roots level).

The sub-component would support activities designed to improve the effective coordination and
collaboration among these stakeholders.

    IDA Credit:                           US$2.46 million

7.      The project would support a program to develop and implement HPAI prevention, containment,
control, and eradication activities in the livestock sector, specific to the needs o f BiH in the short, medium
and longer term. These activities reflect an assessment o f the particular risks, conditions, constraints,
needs and possibilities in the country, including a rapid assessment o f the veterinary services.
Government contribution to this Component will consist primarily in o f consumables (e.g. personal
protective equipment and supplies), minor goods, running costs o f various reporting systems, and in-kind
staff costs.

A.      EnhancingHPAI Preparednessand PreventionCapability (US $0.31 million)

8.      Al: Strengthening the National Policy and Regulatory Environment. The project will
support activities aimed at improving the policy, legal and regulatory framework that governs the national
capability to implement the recommended disease detection, control, prevention, containment, and
eradication measures in a uniform and effective way and in accordance with OIE standards and
guidelines. The project includes support for a detailed review o f current policies and the existing legal
and regulatory environment and for the drafting, as may be warranted, o f legal amendments, regulations
and implementation guidelines and manuals. Staff o f the Ministries o f Agriculture, SVO, and other
concerned agencies will, in topical working groups and with support by international experts on
veterinary laws and regulations, review the relevant laws and regulations governing animal disease
control and will draft the necessary legislative amendments, regulations and implementation guidelines.
Particular emphasis will be placed on regulations concerning the control o f notifiable diseases, the
delineation o f the respective responsibilities o f the veterinary authorities, private veterinary service
providers and farm owners. Specific areas o f emphasis are:
    0   Development o f legislation establishing a national program for registration o f poultry farms.
        Data related to farm location, type o f production and capacity (number o f animals, production
        output) will be necessary for planning, implementation and evaluation o f AI preparedness and
        control activities. This information will also be necessary for efficient indemnification o f losses
        incurred from the destruction o f livestock.
    0   Development o f legislation regarding biosafety requirements/conditions                 necessary for
        establishing and maintaining poultry farms. The capacity of relevant agencies should be increased
        to provide extension services/education to producers in support o f biosafety requirements.
        Development o f legislation mandating surveillance activities. This legislative framework will
        need to incorporate equitable solutions for distributing costs and responsibilities for surveillance
        between government and producers.

B.       Strengthening of Veterinary Services, Diagnostic Capacity, Applied Research, and Disease
Surveillance(US $2.3 million)

9.       B1: Strengthening Veterinary Services and Diagnostic and Applied Research Capacity.
There are wide divergences in the capacities o f the individual animal health laboratories within the
country. None o f the laboratories have an appropriate biosafety environment for handling AI agents. The
short term goals for the system include developing appropriate capacities and biosafety levels (BSL) in
regional laboratories involved in routine monitoringlscreening for AI. An evaluation o f capacities and
procedures in existing laboratories, to include biosafety protocols, will precede the determination o f the
specific steps that will be required to develop laboratory capacities.

10.      The longer-term goal is to upgrade all laboratories to at least Biosafety Level 2 and, depending on
the overall financing that becomes available, to establish one BSL 3 lab, which could handle not only
HPAI, but any other highly pathogenic organisms which need to be tested. Project financing will provide,
inter alia: civil works for rehabilitation and modernization o f the National Animal Health Laboratories
network (likely to focus on 5-7 labs); crucial diagnostic equipment; waste decontamination and disposal
equipment; refrigerators and microbiological cabinets; computers and software; and basic laboratory
furnishings. Additional support for laboratories would be provided under the proposed IDA-financed
Agriculture and Rural Development Project.

11.      B2: Strengthening Animal Disease Information Systems. The effectiveness o f an AI control
program will dependent upon the establishment o f a well functioning surveillance system, fed by valid
data collected in the field.    This surveillance system should permit rational allocation o f resources,
creation o f alternative actions, and objective evaluation o f activities performed. Surveillance programs
should be differentiated between wild and domestic birds and further delineated within the domestic
population between free-range and commercial poultry. In order to achieve optimization o f surveillance
efforts, risk areas (wild bird habitat) must be expanded and a scientifically based sampling scheme must
be developed for domestic poultry.        This will require assistance in obtaining sampling equipment,
developing arrangements for sample transportation, obtaining personal protective equipment and training
local staff.

12.      Support will be provided for basic equipment, training, surveillance, and integrated reporting
systems, for improved monitoring o f wild bird migration and "resting" points. This activity will be
coordinated with technical professionals from the biological sciences, with training focused on disease
recognition, safe handling o f potentially infected wild birds, and public communications.

C.       StrengtheningHPAI Control and Outbreak Containment Capacity (US $0.30 million)

13.      Project support will be made available for the implementation o f H P A I outbreak containment
actions, as set forth in the draft national action plan and to be further specified in the final plan and
associated implementation guidelines and manuals. The national action plan specifies the responsibilities
and functions o f a National Disease Crisis Coordination Center (NDCCC).                It also defines the
composition and responsibilities o f Local Disease Crisis Coordination Committees (LDCCCs) that will be
formed and trained now, and activated inany location where an outbreak is suspected andor confirmed.

14.      The project will finance and support activities related to the implementation o f the plan,
including, inter alia, technical assistance and training for enhanced emergency response, outbreak control,
data collection and interpretation, early warning systems, and basic epidemiology, as well as equipment
such as personal protective equipment for field and laboratory epidemiological staff, culling equipment,
and disinfection sprayers.     In addition, a specific unit for epidemiological communications will be
established.

D.       ImprovingBiosecurityin Poultry Production and Trade (US $0.07 million)

15.      Support will be provided for a training program on farm biosecurity practices. This training will
be primarily oriented towards smallholder operations, as larger commercial farms generally have quite
good biosecurity. However, large operations will also be targeted, particularly where they are nearby to
significant poultry populations in "backyards".

IDA Credit:                          US$1.96 million

16.      This component would support a program to further plan and implement preparedness, and
improve surveillance and prevention as well as response and containment activities in the human health
sector in the short, medium and longer term.

17.      On the basis o f the country's epidemiological needs and assessment of the particular conditions,
constraints, needs and possibilities in BiH, initial support under the project will concentrate on a few
essential areas. These will include the further refinement o f the contingency preparedness plans and the
establishment o f a clear chain o f command and coordination mechanisms, the rapid strengthening o f
capacities in intervention epidemiology (including simulation exercises), the expansion o f seasonal flu
vaccinations, and the strengthening o f the health sector capacity to isolate and adequately treat a few
suspected or confirmed cases o f AI in humans. In parallel, the project will help plan and support the
strengthening o f the surveillance system for communicable diseases and o f laboratory capacity as well as
o f the capacity o f the health sector to prevent the spread o f the AI virus among humans and to protect
groups at high risk. Finally the project would also support efforts to prepare for social distancing and
other interventions measures in case o f a pandemic.

18.      Activities to be supported under the project would be grouped in three sub-components: (a)
enhancing public health program planning and coordination; (b) strengthening o f public health
surveillance system; and (c) strengthening health system response capacity. Government contribution to
this Component would consist primarily o f laboratory and hospital consumables (e.g. personal protective
equipment and supplies), minor goods, and in-kindstaff costs.

A.       EnhancingPublic HealthProgramPlanningand Coordination (US $0.13 million)

19.      Legal aspects regarding communicable diseases (including highly pathogenic infections) are
covered by the Laws on the protection of the population from infectious diseases, which were adopted in
1995 in RS and May 2005 in FBiH. Current institutional arrangements for addressing Avian Influenza in
Humans in BiHparallel the organization o f the health system and responsibilities lie with the entities.

20.      Inthe past year, both Entities have made significant efforts to plan and coordinate activities. The
RS Preparedness Plan was adopted by the Government in October 2005. The FBiH "preparedness plan
for expected emergence o f the Pandemic Influenza" has been revised in February 2006, and has now been
approved by the Federation Government. In any case, these plans have now been superseded by the
creation o f a National Contingency Plan, produced through a series o f multi-stakeholder workshops



                                                   43

sponsored by WHO. The National CP contains clear chain o f command and individual responsibilities
and (b) the measures to ensure coordination between stakeholders working on animal and human health in
MOHs and between MOHsAPHS and other actors within the health sector. The National CP i s not yet
formally ratified by the full BiH Parliament; this is expected to be completed by mid-2007. The sub-
component would support the following three activities:

22.      Al: Refining Plans and Strengthening the Chain of Command. As noted, the WHO has
sponsored a series o f workshops which have led to an integrated National Contingency Plan (CP), which
addresses the shortcomings noted above. To help prepare all stakeholders to better cope with outbreaks
and ensure that individual responsibilities and procedures to be followed are well known, the project
would finance the conducting o f simulation exercises at the State, Entity and local levels, once the new
National CP is approved.

23.      A2: Review and Amendments of Laws and Bylaws. The project would finance technical
support to review and prepare necessary amendments to current laws and bylaws. More specifically,
assistance will be given for the review and/or preparation of, inter alia: (i)statutory provisions regarding
quarantine laws and how they apply in a public health emergency, (ii)laws and procedures for closing
businesses and schools and suspending public meetings during a declared state o f emergency, (iii)
medical volunteer licensure, liability and compensation for retired and non medical volunteers; and (iv)
worker's compensation laws as they apply to heath care and other essential workers.

24.      A3:     Social Distancing.      The project would support the development o f a detailed
implementation plan for so-called "social distancing" measures to be activated in case o f an epidemic.
Social distancing measures will typically be activated on advice from health professionals and
institutions, although they will not be the enforcing agencies.          The implementation plan will have
therefore to explicitly define institutional responsibilities for activation and enforcement o f social
distancing measures and for inter-agency and inter-ministerial coordination.          Training will also be
provided to "enforcement agents" such as the police and military in safe, efficient implementation o f
social distancing measures in ways that do not induce panic. Additional preventive actions that will
complement social distancing (such as personal hygiene promotion through various communication
channels, including hand-washing and proper cooking, and distribution and use o f masks) will also be
supported.

25.      A4: Clean Out Plans for Hospitals (Preparing for Coping with Severe Outbreaks and a
Pandemic). The project will also support the preparation o f plans and measures to be implemented in
case o f larger outbreaks or a pandemic. While a full-scale pandemic will rapidly overwhelm hospital
capacity, there is a need to prepare hospital "clean-out'' plans to help create a buffer for localized
outbreaks. Specifically, the project will support the preparation o f plans to reorganize and clean out
infectious clinics and other departments in hospitals to make them able to cope with an increase o f
suspected or confirmed AI cases. The plans will necessarily include measures to evacuate hospitals o f non
acute cases through, for instance, the canceling o f elective procedures or finding alternative
accommodation for non-emergency admissions.

B.       StrengtheningNational Public Health Surveillance Systems (US $0.95 million)

26.      At this point in time, there is no national surveillance system for communicable diseases. The
surveillance systems in place at the Entity level are based on routine health facilities reports for 62
diseases, which are compiled and analyzed by the hygiene and epidemiological departments o f the IPHs'.

'See the WHO report titled "assessment ofthe national surveillancesystemfor communicable diseases" and dated
September2004. A new assessment of the national laboratory capacity will be conductedby WHO inJune 2006.


                                                   44

Except in the case o f suspected or confirmed outbreaks, reports are sent weekly to the intermediary level
(regional or cantonal PHIS) and monthly to the Entity level. No specific surveillance system i s in place
for influenza and influenza-like (ILI) illness and BiH is not part o f the European Influenza Surveillance
network.

27.      Investigationand response teams exist at the Entity level (2 in RS in Banja Luka and Doboj and 1
in FBiH) and additional capacity can be mobilized at regional or cantonal level. These teams, however,
lack protective personal equipment, spraying devices and disinfectant.            Efforts to train staff in
intervention epidemiology have already started and recently (2005), 24 epidemiologists attended the
EPIET course organized by WHO with EU financial support. However, there is an obvious need to
further build-up capacity in intervention epidemiology and to train and/or retrain investigation and
response teams.

28.      There i s no national or Entity Influenza Laboratory and or no capacity in the health sector for
typing and sub-typingo f influenza virus strains. As indicated in the 2004 report on laboratory capacity in
BiH6,the capacity o f existing microbiology and virology laboratories need to be significantly improved
before the country can be considered to have an effective communicable diseases surveillance system.
Basic facilities and good expertise exists in the country. However, the existing laboratory capacity is
highly fragmented and the lack o f training and investment in the past 15 years have left the laboratories
operating at a level far below EU standards and the minimum bio-safety level 2 required for manipulating
highly pathogenic viruses. Three interventions are planned.

29.      B1: Improvementof Capacity in InterventionEpidemiology. The project will first strengthen
the capacity to investigate and respond to outbreaks, including: (a) investigation and collection o f
specimens in areas where AI in birds or poultry are reported, (b) safely and rapidly transport o f specimens
to laboratories (including to the UK reference laboratory) for diagnostic testing and virus sub-typing and
confirmation o f results and, (c) outbreak investigation and containment measures in areas with suspected
or confirmed human cases. To this end and building on activities supported by WHO (with financing
from EC), the project will support the Public Health Institute and regional/cantonal epidemiological
investigation and response teams through: (a) the re-training o f staff, (b) the provision o f personal
protective gears and other equipment and consumables (sprayers, disinfectants), the provision o f materials
and bio-safety boxes for the collection and transport o f samples and, (c) communications equipment.

30.      B2: Strengthening the Surveillance of Influenza and Communicable Diseases. In parallel
with activities listed in B 1 above, the project will complement the EU/WHO current efforts and pilot
project aiming at the strengthening o f the communicable diseases surveillance system. In particular, the
project will provide part o f the necessary IT equipment (computers, servers, software) and will contribute
to the building o f capacity for reporting and analysis o f epidemiological data.       In this framework,
particular attention will have to be paid to the active surveillance o f influenza with a view to help BIH
rapidlyjoin the European Influenza Surveillance network.

31.      B3: Strengthening the Laboratory Capacity. The project will contribute to building the
laboratory capacity and network.       More specifically, the project will contribute to efforts towards
upgrading two laboratories (1 in each Entity) to bio-safety level 2 and make them able to type and sub-
type influenza virus strains. In addition, the Project will assist with upgradingthe laboratory in the PHI in
Mostar, to enable it to provide virus identification capacity. To this end, the project will finance part of
the necessary studies, limited civil works and equipment as well as kits, reagents and other consumables
and personal protective equipment (PPE) for laboratory staff. The project will also finance training and

retraining o f laboratory staff.       If needed, the project would also finance appropriate sterilization
equipment and incinerators for the management and disposal o f contaminated lab materials.

C.        StrengtheningHealth Care ResponseCapacity (US $0.9 million)

32.       At this point in time, the BIH health sy,stem appears relatively unprepared to immediately and
adequately respond to even a limited outbreak, not talking o f coping with a pandemic. Seasonal influenza
vaccination remains limited and MOHs have only very limited stocks o f anti-viral drugs (only 400 and
1000 antiviral treatments are available in respectively RS and the FBiH).

33.       While the hospitals where the first AI suspected or confirmed human cases would be hospitalized
have been identified, these facilities are not ready to appropriately and safely taking care o f highly
infectious patients. Isolation rooms need to be established and properly equipped and health workers
from these facilities need to be trained or re-trained in many areas and to be provided with personal
protective equipment. Three types o f intervention are proposed:

34.       C1: EmergencyMeasures. Under the project, assistance will rapidly be provided to ensure that
optimal medical care to AI suspected or confirmed human cases can be offered and to provide essential
services to the community in case o f a pandemic. Towards this aim, the project will provide support for
the: (a) establishment o f isolation capacity in the hospitals and infectious clinics that have been already
identified (Banja Luka and Foca for RS; Sarajevo and Tuzla for the FBiH); (b) equipment o f the isolation
rooms; (c) emergency stocks o f medicines and consumables, (d) protective equipment for health workers
and; (e) training and retraining o f staff. In addition, an enhanced triage capacity will be supported for the
Clinical Center in Mostar.

35.       In case o f a declared influenza pandemic, this sub-component will finance emergency imports
identified as necessary under a well-defined preparedness and response program to be prepared as part o f
project implementation. These imports are likely to include: (i)pharmaceuticals and vaccines, (ii)
medical supplies and equipment, (iii)communication equipment, supplies and information campaigns,
(iv) food and water containers, and (v) protective clothing. Particular attention will be paid to the
definition o f measures towards the protection o f health care workers and to ensure that they will be
willing and can continue to be at work in a pandemic situation (including protection and compensation
measures for the risks involved).

36.       C2: Vaccination. This sub-component will help expand regular seasonal flu vaccination for
targeted priority groups' (as defined in the contingency plan). In view o f financial constraints as well as
the anticipated limited quantities o f seasonal flu vaccines available on the international market, the project
will more specifically focus on the immunization o f the most at risk populations (poultry farmers and
veterinarians) and o f health care workers. It would also finance the development o f a detailed logistical
(procurement and distribution) plan for mass vaccination should an HPAIvaccine become available.

37.       C3: Anti-Viral Drugs: Under this sub-component, the project will finance the stockpiling on
anti-viral drugs (Oseltamivir or others). It is plan to help increase buffer stocks o f Tamiflu up to 3000
treatments for the Federation and to 1000 treatments for RS.




7 Including poultry farmers, veterinarians, health staff and persons with chronic disorders of the pulmonary and
cardio-vascularsystems andor chronic metabolic and immunologic disorders. To all the extent possible, vaccines

38.      Early detection and reporting as well as rapid response depend critically on the incentives for
poultry owners to report very quickly any sick and dead poultry to their veterinarians. Without adequate
compensation arrangements in place, poultry owners have no incentive to do so, but must fear that their
animals will be destroyed and they lose this valuable capital.

39.      The June 2002 Veterinary Law in BiH confirms the right o f farmers to compensation for the
elimination o f contagious animals, and determines the procedures for culling and compensation. The value
o f culled animals is determined by Entity Veterinary Services, according to the damage appraisal list
prepared by the appraisal commission. In the case o f Avian Influenza, the commission also confirms the
number o f culled poultry. These procedures have been successfully employed for the recent outbreak o f
HPAI in Jajce and Jezero.

40.      In the event of further HPAI outbreaks in BiH, the Project will provide support for culling and
elimination o f infected and at-risk poultry, with compensation to farmers and commercial poultry producers
based on the existing legal framework and the AI contingency plan.              The order for culling and
compensation will determine in advance the compensation value by type o f poultry (rather than requiring a
commission to determine the value on a case-by-case basis). Accurate lists will be kept o f all poultry
culled, so that the culling committee can calculate the compensation that will go to each poultry owner.
Strict requirements will apply to recording, reporting and verification o f poultry culling, compensation
claims and payments.

41.      Bosnia-Herzegovina's current capacity to compensate farmers for culled animals will be
enhanced by the provision o f US $0.55 million from the Project. This will be split evenly between the
Entities, with each Entity provided matching funds o f US $0.1 million. Access to the Bank portion o f
these funds will be conditional on the modalities for operating the Fund being approved by IDA. Key
parameters guidingthis effort are provided in Appendix 2b.

42.      This sub-component would support costs associated with project management and coordination,
including costs associated with the Technical Support Group to be established to support project
coordination and management, and costs associated with the PIU/PCU for procurement and financial
management services. An inter-sectoral Crisis Committee was established in November 2005 under the
chairmanship o f the Minister o f Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (MoFTER) to oversee the HPAI
control and containment effort and to provide general policies and guidance for avian influenza control.
This Committee will operate as needed in the event of further AI outbreaks to ensure coordination and

linkages across relevant agencies and with international partners. Implementation arrangements are
discussed in Annex 2c below.

B.       Monitoring and Evaluation(M&E)

43.      B1: Training. This sub-component would support training in monitoring and evaluation at all
administrative levels, mid-term evaluation workshop, and development of an action plan for M&E and
replication of successful models. It would support the following activities:
         Training in M&E;
    0    Implementation of baseline studies;
    0    Mid-Term evaluation of the project;
         On-going part'icipatory monitoring and evaluation; and
    0    Final project evaluation.

44.      B2: ProjectMonitoring and Impact Evaluation.Support would be providedto develop project
monitoring and impact evaluation assessments. Two types of M&Eare envisaged:

45.      B2(i): Monitoring of project implementation. This is a function of the TSG, which would
collect relevant data from line ministries and other implementation agencies and then compile them into
quarterly progress reports focusing on status of physical implementation by component, use of project
funds (based on data provided by the PIUPCU) and monitoring indicators. Specific surveys can be
conducted to obtain data for this purpose. Annual expenditure reviews would be conducted to assess
government commitment to strengthen the public health functions as measured by budgetary allocations
and their distribution by activity.

46.      BZ(ii): Impact evaluation. The aim of evaluation is to find out whether the interventions are
effective or the program is having the desired impact. The evaluation will include both quantitative and
qualitative aspects and be conducted on a yearly basis. The quantitative aspects will rely on new
information systems and surveys implemented as part of the various components of the project, currently
existing data sources, and primary evaluative data collection efforts. The goal of the qualitative aspect of
the evaluation will be to document perceptions of program managers, staff, patients, and local and
national leaders. Qualitative information will be collected using site-visit interviews, focus groups, and
respondentsurveys.

PoultryCullingCompensationScheme

1.      Early detection and reporting, as well as rapid response, depend critically on the incentives for
poultry owners to report very quickly any sick or dead poultry to veterinarians. Without adequate
compensation arrangements in place, poultry owners have no incentiveto do this, and will fear that with
the destruction oftheir animals they will lose this valuable capital.

2.      The June 2002 Veterinary Law in BiH confirms the right of farmers to compensation for the
elimination of contagious animals, and determines the procedures for culling and compensation. The
value of culled animals is determined by Entity Veterinary Services, accordingto the damage appraisal
list prepared by the Appraisal Commission. In the case of Avian Influenza, the Commission also
confirms the number of culled poultry. These procedures have been successfully employed for the
February2006 outbreak of HPAI in Jajce andJezero.

3.      In the event of further HPAI outbreaks in BiH, the Project will provide support for culling and
elimination of infected and at-risk poultry, with compensation to farmers and commercial poultry
producers based on the existing legal framework and the AI contingency plan. The order for culling and
compensation will determine in advance the compensation value by type of poultry (rather than requiring
a commission to determine the value on a case-by-case basis). Accurate lists will be kept of all poultry
culled, so that the culling committee can calculate the compensation that will go to each poultry owner.
Strict requirements will apply to recording, reporting and verification of poultry culling, compensation
claims and payments.

4.      The Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme will be financed by an IDA credit of US$0.55
million, conditionalon IDA'Sapprovalof the modalities for operating the Fund.-In addition, each Entity
would contribute US $0.10 million, as part of the regular emergency fund allocation provided to the
animal health sector.

Village and BackyardPoultryCulling

5.      Compensation for AI-infected poultry in Jajce and Jezero followed the procedures provided by
the contingency plan. In future cases of AI, the same approach should be taken. After official
confirmation of an outbreak, the State Veterinary Office authorizes the local veterinary stations to
undertake necessary measuresfor control of the disease. First an inventory of all poultry is done within a
radius of 3 km. Then, the actual culling is undertaken. After the culling, the owner and assessor sign a



                                                       49

form defined in the Contingency Plan (Form 6 in Annex IV) in three copies. One copy is kept by the
owner, one copy is submitted to the Entity Ministry of Agriculture, and the third copy is submitted to the
Technical Support Group. Pre-numbered forms will be given to the Local Disease Crisis Coordination
Committees (LDCCCs)' based on the inventory of poultry in the at-risk region. The signed Form 6 will
be the basis for payment of farmers. The payments will be made with cash transfers through the
municipal treasury systems. After culling, owners to be compensated in each municipality and the
amounts to be paidwill be announcedina public place.

CommercialPoultry Culling

6.      At commercial poultry enterprises and other large producers the culling will be conducted in the
presence of the owner by a team designated by the LDCCC. All will sign a form (in 3 copies) listing the
culled birds. One copy of the form will be kept by the owner of the commercialenterprise; a secondcopy
will be kept at the entity Ministry of Agricultureand the third will be sent to the TSG. The compensation
paymentsto commercial poultry enterprises will be made through bank wire transfers. The forms will be
pre-numbered.

Database and Forms

7.      Forms will be printed, pre-numberedand kept with the Technical Support Group. The TSG will
keep the database ofthe forms sent to each municipality,owner and commercialproducers.

CompensationPayments

8.      The parametersfor payments will includethe following:


        0   Compensation to farmers will made be in cash through transfers to the respective
            municipalities;farmers will receive the compensation amounts from the municipality cashier.
            Appropriate procedures for supervising and verifying payments are specified by the
            Contingency Planfor AI and will be undertaken by the PIU/PCUat the direction of the TSG.
            Full details regardingthese procedureswill be addressedinthe ProjectOperationalManual.
            For small farmers, compensationper bird will be 100percent of the marketpriceofthe laying
            hens as reportedby the entity agriculture statistical directorate/orcompetent authority during
            the month preceding that in which the culling took place.
        0   For commercial producers, compensation will be provided by bank transfer. Compensation
            will be for reasonable replacement cost, Le., for birds less than 3 months old at the cost of
            one-day-old chicks, and for birds older than 3 months at the cost of 3-month-old birds, as
            reported by the entity agriculture statistical directorate/or competent authority during the
            month precedingthat in which the culling took place .

9.      Ifand when an HPAI outbreak occurs, the Entity Ministry of Agriculture will issue an ordinance
for the use of funds for compensationincludingthe parametersof compensationamounts. These amounts
will be posted in a public place in the municipality. I t is strongly recommendedthat the parameters
for compensation are coordinated by both entities.

Flow of Funds

10.     Procedureson flow o f funds should minimizedelay but ensure maximumtransparency. As stated
above, compensation payments will be made through: (i) wire transfers to municipalities which will pay
in cash for the compensationamounts to the farmers, and (ii) wire transfers to the accounts of commercial
poultryproducers.

11.     The State Veterinary Office, through the Technical Support Group, will verify that forms are
complete, and on the basis of Form6 andthe farmers payinglists, will direct the PIUPCUto prepare the
withdrawal application with the necessary supporting documents for submission by the Ministry of
Agriculture to the State MoF to the Association for reimbursement, with instructions in the withdrawal
applicationto transfer the payment directly to the Entity MOA.

12.     The Entity MOA then transfers the funds to the municipality treasury, which processes the
payments to the owners. On payment of the compensation, the owner signs a payment receipt form,
copies of which are forwardedby the municipality to the Entity MOA,Entity MoF and the PIU/PCU.
After the completionofthe payments, the municipalitywill submit payment lists to the TSG.

13.     The PIU and PCU providethe TSG with reports on the payments on a quarterly basis, as part of
the regular financial management reporting. A Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme database for each
Entity will be maintained by the respective PIU/PCU to facilitate record keeping, claim verification,
payment facilitation, monitoringand auditing.

14.     Further detail regarding flow of funds under the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme can be
found in Appendix 6 on FinancialManagement. These procedures will be fully elaborated in the Project
Operational Manual.

15.     Basedon the law, the payment should be completedwithin 30 days. However, it would be highly
desirable for compensation to be completed in a shorter time span, for example, no longer then seven
days. After the HPAI outbreak inJajce and Jezero, bothEntitieswere able to compensate farmers within
sevendays of culling.

16.     Table 2 below illustratesthe funds required to compensate farmers, both commercial and non-
commercial (Le,, backyard or village, for personal consumption) if x percent of all poultry in the state
were lost to AI culling, given a price of 10 KM per free range (backyard) chicken and 5 KM for
commercial poultry and assuming a compensation scheme of 100% reimbursement for non-commercial
farmers and 50% reimbursement for commercialfarmers.

TechnicalSupport Group

1.       Implementationofthe Projectwill be undertakenby a Technical Support Group (TSG) consisting
of technical advisors who are representatives o f the State Veterinary Office (SVO) in the Ministry of
ForeignTrade and EconomicRelations', Ministry of Civil Affairs, FBiH and RS Ministries of Agriculture
(VeterinarianServices), FBiHand RS Ministrieso f Health,a full-time consultantfor communications and
a part-timemonitoring and evaluationconsultant (see organizationalchart below). SVO has the mandate
to coordinate veterinary services on behalf o f the Entity Ministries of Agriculture, Water Management
and Forestry. The representative of SVO on the TSG will be a permanent civil servant and will serve as
ProjectCoordinator, reportingto the Minister of MoFTER. The Project Coordinator will be supported by
one full-time administrative assistant. The Administrative Assistant could be a civil servant, but would
more likely be a short-termcontracted position. The Terms of Reference (TOR) would include assistance
with office management, record-keeping,correspondence, drafting of minutes of meetings, translations
and interpretation, and general organizational matters. The TSG will report on project implementation
progress to the Council of Ministers through MoFTER. The TSG government representatives will be
responsible for coordinatingwith and reporting to their relevant government departments, to guide and
monitor implementationof activities in their respective areas. Except for the Project Coordinator and the
communications specialist, the TSG members will serve on a part-time basis, retainingtheir regular civil
service positionsandresponsibilitiesintheir home agencies.

2.       To facilitate the management and implementationof the Project, a Project Operational Manual
(POM) is to be prepared by the TSG as a Condition of Effectiveness. The TSG will operate as a virtual
office, with daily communications via telephone, fax and e-mail, and will meet regularly on a schedule
and in locations to be specified in the POM. The TSG will be responsible for preparationo f annual work
programs and budgets, preparationof TORSand specifications for goods and works bidding documents,
monitoringand evaluationof project activities, and preparing quarterly and annual progress reports to the
Association. The TSG shall take decisions on the basis of consensus. The detailed procedures governing
the functioningof the TSG will be described in the POM.

Local LevelImplementation

3.       At the cantonal and municipalities levels, implementationwould be the direct responsibility o f
each cantonal/municipalveterinary/healthauthority. Small coordination units should be established at the
local level comprising officials from healthheterinary services to work under the supervision and
guidance of the entity ministries.

PIUand PCU

4.       Procurement, financial management and financial reporting services for the project will be
providedby the PIU Forestry and Agriculture in Sarajevo, and by the Health Sector PCU in Banja Luka.
For procurement, the PIU and PCU will prepare bidding documents or requests for proposals based on
technical specificationsor TORSprovided by the TSG, conduct tenders, organize evaluation committees,
and processpayments to consultants and contractors after acceptance and approvalof the goods, works or
services by the TSG. TSG members or specialists identifiedby the TSG will be invited by the PIU and


9 It is notedthat when the plannedstate-levelMinistryfor Agricultureand RuralDevelopment(exact legal name
TBD) is created, the SVO will move from MoFTERto this new ministry.

PCU to participate in proposal and bid evaluations. Further details regarding project procurement
arrangements are found in Appendix 5 below.

5.       The PIU and PCU will be responsible for financial management under the Project. They will be
responsible for ensuring that each Entity establishes and maintains: (i)adequate accounting systems and
procedures; (ii)flow-of-funds mechanismsfacilitating timely disbursement of funds and timely payments
for goods, works and services; (iii)regular reporting on the use of funds; and (iv) appropriate
arrangements for regular financial audits. The PIU and PCU will prepare quarterly financial monitoring
reports to the TSG and the Association. These responsibilities are described further in Appendix 6
(Financial Management Arrangements) below, and will be described in detail inthe manuals of financial
procedures and summarized in the Financing Agreement. The PIU and PCU have experience with
financial management under Bank-financed projects and have established sound internal control
mechanisms on the application and use of funds.

Operatingcosts

6.       Most of the operating costs of the TSG, PIU and PCU will be provided by the Entities as part of
the counterpart contribution to project funding.        Operating costs may include (i)maintenance and
operation of equipment and vehicles procured or used for the management of the Project; (ii)staff
salaries; (iii)travel costs and per diems; (iv) consumable office supplies; (v) communication, printing and
publications; (vi) costs of translation and interpretation; (vii) bank charges; and other miscellaneous costs
as may be agreed.

Poultry Culling CompensationScheme

7.       Both the TSG and the PIU/PCU as well as government at the municipal, entity and State levels
will be involved in administration and reporting on payments under the Poultry Culling Compensation
Scheme that are financed from the Credit proceeds. Access to proceeds from the IDA credit for eligible
Compensationpayments will operate under the following procedures:

    (a) In the event of an AI outbreak and culling of poultry, local veterinary services officials provide
         compensation application forms and instructions to owners
    (b) Copies of the forms are provided by vet services to the owner, the Entity MOAand SVO
    (c) SVO through the TSG directs the PIU/PCU to prepare the withdrawal application with necessary
         supporting documents for submittal by the Entity MOAto the State MoF to the Association for
         reimbursement, with instructions inthe withdrawal application to transfer the payment directly to
         the Entity MOA.
    (d) The Entity MOAtransfers the funds to the municipality treasury, which processesthe paymentsto
         the owners
    (e) On payment of the compensation, the owner signs a payment receipt form, copies of which are
         forwarded by the municipality to the Entity MOA,Entity MoF and the PIU/PCU. The PIU and
         PCU provide the TSG with reports on the payments on a quarterly basis, as part of the regular
         financial management reporting.
    (f) A Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme database for each Entity will be maintained by the
         respective PIU/PCU to facilitate record keeping, claim verification, payment facilitation,
         monitoring and auditing.

                               Appendix 4: Procurement Arrangements
              BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: Avian Influenza PreparednessProject


1.      As described in OP 8.50 for Emergency Recovery Assistance (ERA), in addition to emergency
assistance, the Bank may support operations for preventionand mitigation in countries prone to specific
types of emergencies. Such operations could assist in: (a) developinga national strategy, (b) establishing
an adequate institutional and regulatory framework, (c) carrying out studies of vulnerability and risk
assessment, (d) reinforcingvulnerablestructures, and (e) acquiringhazard-reductiontechnology.

2.      Given the threat that HPAI may pose to the economic and social fabric o f the country, as well as
to the health of the population because o f the risk of an influenzapandemic, the proposed Project would
be financedthrough a Credit to be approved following ERA procedures.

A.      Procurement

3.      Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines:
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, and "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and with the provisions
stipulated in the Legal Agreement. Agreements covering procurement methods, thresholds, and other
conditionality will be consistent with ERA assistanceguidelines and determined for the Kyrgyz Republic
according to its capacity and experience with Bank procurement.

4.      The activities covered under the Projectwill be implementedon the basis of annual work plans to
allow for needed flexibility in adjusting activities to account for in-country experience and the lessons
from implementation by other countries participating in the multi-country GPAI. Accordingly, the
following approach to procurementwill be adopted.

5.      ImplementingAgency Assessment. The Bank has carriedout a procurement capacity assessment
of the PIU for the World Bank-fundedForest Development and ConservationProject (FBiH), and the
PCU for the World Bank-fundedHealth Sector Enhancement Project (RS) which will be responsible for
fiduciary tasks, including procurement, and found them satisfactory. Procurement staff in the PIU are
experienced with procurement following World Bank guideless, including with all the procurement
methods to be included under the Project. The same qualified staff will be responsible for procurement
under this Project. However, given the country conditions, the Project has been classified in category
"C", signifyinghigh risk (A low, B medium, and C high risk). The annual Procurement Plan (PP) would
define thresholds for prior review appropriate to the category; these thresholds would be determined so as
to minimizeprior review as appropriate to the level o f risk.

6.      Procurement Plan. A Procurement Plan (PP) covering the initial 12 month period of Project
implementation will be prepared by Negotiations. The updated PP for each subsequent year will be
submitted to the Bank for approval before the end of the previous year and would use a pre-defined
standard format which would list as a minimum: (i) goods and services to be procured during the
following calendar year, (ii) their value; (iii) the method of procurement; and (iv) the timetable for
carryingout the procurement. At the time o f approvingthe annual work program, the Bank would agree
on the consistency with the application of the Bank procurement guidelines to the specific procurement
lots expected duringthe year and their methods of procurement. Ifneeded, the plan could be revised and
re-submitted. A format for a typical PP would be agreedat Negotiations.




                                                   59

 7 .      Procurement Methods and Thresholds. The Credit Agreement would define the appropriate
 methods and thresholds for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), National Competitive Bidding
 (NCB), Limited International Bidding (LIB), or Shopping in accordance with ERA guidelines.
 Thresholds for project procurement methods and prior review requirements have been indicated on the
 basis o f the Bank's assessment o f the capacity o f the PIU which will be responsible for procurement, the
 estimated risks o f corruption in BiH, and the country's capacity o f construction and manufacturing
 industries.

 8.      Prior Review by the Bank. The Procurement Plan shall set forth those contracts which shall be
 subject to the Bank's prior review process. All other contract shall be subject to post review.

 9.      Advertisement. The General Procurement Notice (GPN) shall be published in the on-line edition
 o f Development Business following Project approval by the World Bank Board o f Directors. Special
 Procurement Notices (SPN) for all ICB goods contracts and Requests for Expression o f Interest for
 consulting assignments with firms exceeding the value o f US$lOO,OOO equivalent shall be published in
the Public Procurement Bulletin, a local newspaper o f a wide circulation and the on-line edition o f the
 UNDB and posted on the websites o f the State Veterinary Office, the Ministries o f Agriculture and o fthe
 Ministriesof Health.

 10.     These agencies will allocate a part o f their respective websites for posting information on contract
awards, including the name o f each bidder who submitted a bid, bid prices as read out at public bid
opening, name and evaluated prices o f each bid that was evaluated, name o f bidders who were rejected



                                                    60

and the reasons for rejection, the name o f the winning bidder and the price it offered. All contracts
awarded through direct contracting (irrespective o f the amount) shall be listed on the websites.
Information on the contracts awarded as a result o f an ICB and results o f selection o f consultant firms for
contracts exceeding US$lOO,OOO will also be posted on the World Bank web-site by submitting the
information to the World Bank Country Office in Sarajevo.

11.       The PIU would follow the World Bank anti-corruption measures and would not engage services
of firms and individuals debarred by the Bank. The listing o f debarred firms and individuals is located at:
littp://www.worldbank.ora/html/o~r/~rocure/debarr.html

12.      Procurement under Emergency Assistance Provisions. Following ERA procedures, the Project
i s likely to include financing for items included on a positive list o f imports identified as necessary under
a well-defined preparedness and response program to be prepared as part o f project implementation. In
case o f a declared global influenza pandemic, which will trigger disbursement conditions for critical
imports, support would be provided under the Project for the procurement o f a positive list o f critical
imports. These may be procured under Modified International Competitive Bidding (MICB), according
to paragraphs 2.66 and 2.67 o f the Procurement Guidelines. Also, commonly traded commodities may be
procured through organized international commodity markets or other channels o f competitive
procurement acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with the provision.

13.       The positive list o f critical inputs to be prepared by Bosnia-Herzegovinaor to be purchased by the
Borrower from the private sector, based on historical imports duringnational emergencies, would include:


      0   Pharmaceuticals and vaccines
      0   Medical and veterinary supplies and equipment
      0   Communication equipments, supplies, and public awareness campaigns
      0   Food and water containers
      0   Protective clothing and gear

14.       Disbursements for items procured under emergency assistance provisions can be made for up to
100 percent o f import costs. No more than 20 percent o f the Credit proceeds may be used for retroactive
financing o f expenditures, and the payments must have been made after the appraisal mission.

15.      Procurement Audits. Because the Project would have a strong decentralized implementation
element, and to help the Bank to carry out post-reviews o f procurement actions, consultants would be
contracted as a cost to the Project to carry out annual procurement audits of a sample o f contracts, under
Terms o f Reference acceptable to the Bank.

Country Issues

1.      A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for BiH was carried out in 2001. An
update o f the CFAA has recently been finalized. The CFAA identified systemic and structural weaknesses
inpublic sector budgeting,accounting, reporting, and auditing. However, there have been several positive
developments in the past four years, most notably, implementation of a fully automated treasury system
across all the Cantons in the Federation and all the regions in the RS. The introduction o f the on-line
treasury system has brought about a major improvement in the accounting and reporting o f budget
execution at the State, entity, and cantonal levels. The Bank's Country Financial Management Strategy
(CFMS) envisages mainstreaming o f project management into Ministries and Departments, and abstain
from creating new stand-alone Project Implementation Units (PIUs) outside the ministries for
implementation o f Bank-financed projects. This project accordingly will use the Federation PIU in the
Ministry of Agriculture and the RS PCU established in the Ministry o f Health for the purpose of
delivering fiduciary services to the project and securing the necessary reporting.

4.       Financialmanagement arrangements of the AIPP are generally adequate, but a number of actions
are required to ensure that arrangements are fully satisfactory for the project, with its specific FM needs,
especially with respect to the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme. The following action plan was
discussed with the Recipient during Negotiations. Satisfactory implementation of the action plan will
ensure the establishment of a financial management system that fully meets requirements of the Project
and o fthe Bank.

      the Bank for review and
      comments. This is only an action
      for capacity building and not a
      F M condition.

Implementing Entity

5.      The main implementation responsibility of the project is with the Technical Support Group
consisting of broad technical participation from all involved institutions dealing with the activities of this
project. However, all financial management responsibilities as well as procurement responsibilities will
be given to the Federation PIU in Ministry of Agriculture and the RS PCU established in the Ministry of
Health.

Budgeting

6.      The two PIU/PCUs will prepare annual plans based on the implementation program, includingthe
procurement plan. RS and FBiH will allocate budget funds to cater for the Poultry Culling Compensation
Schemes according to already establishedprocedures.

Accounting

7.      Both the PIUs have implemented computerized accounting systems using locally developed F M
software, which is used in several Bank-financed projects and have been found to be reliable and
responsiveto Bank-needs. The PIU/PCU will be using the same software for accounting for this project.

8.      Accounting procedures for the two PIU/PCUs are set out in their respective Financial
Management Manuals. The manual contains procedures for flow of accounting information, invoice                  ,
verification procedures, payment controls, and reporting formats. The manuals are satisfactory and the
risk associated with the accounting policies and procedures is negligible. The existing manuals will


                                                 65

require only minor updates to reflect the characteristics of this project.A separate manual on the Poultry
Culling Compensation Scheme will be finalized before disbursement starts for this part of the project, see
further details below.

9.       The staffing of the existing Federation PIU in Ministry of Agriculture and the RS PCU
established in the Ministry of Healthare considered adequate to implement this new project at the initial
phase, but additional staff might be needed to strengthen the existing capacity, to monitor the financial
managementof the Poultry Culling Compensation Schemes, and to allow for periodic visits to the village
level to review the Poultry Culling Compensation Schemes. The additional staff, if needed, would report
to the PIUPCU's financial managers and would be responsible for disbursement functions as well as
project accounting-maintaining      books of accounts, reporting day-to-day transactions and preparing
accountingreports and financial statements, as well as monitoringfinancial flows to project beneficiaries.
The financial manager will have primary responsibility for the quarterly financial reports (Interim un-
audited FinancialReports   - IFRs)and  will prepare the annual financial statements for audit.

Internal Control & Internal Auditing

10.      With the exception of the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme component, for which the AIPP
does not have previous experience, the PIU/PCUshave maintainedan effective internal control systemto
ensure that project expenditures are properly authorized, supportingdocuments are maintained; accounts
are reconciled periodically; project assets, includingcash, are safeguarded, and cash compensation grants
are properly accounted for.        Although project accounting will be on a cash basis, detailed
assetiinventories register will be maintainedas part of the project internal control procedures. The AIPP
will implement appropriate controls over inventories of drugs, vaccines, medical equipment, and other
sensitive and/or expensive assets will be especially importantfor the project.

11.      Since the Federation PIU and the RS PCU are part of the government set-up, they are subject to
an audit by the respective Supreme Audit Institutionof the entities. Currently, neither entity has enacted
law on internal audit in the public sector. However, establishment of internalaudit units within ministries
i s a longterm process and has not been factored into while assessing internal control environment for the
project.

12.      Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme. The Governments have established Poultry Culling
Compensation Schemes from which the owners of animals culled will be compensated (see Annex 2B).
The Veterinary Law provides the legal basis to do so, but the required implementationarrangements still
needto be refinedand put in place, andthe Projectwill providetechnical support to do so. The necessary
details will be developed and agreed upon during the first months of project implementationand will be
included inthe Operational Manual.

13.      As a condition of disbursement of funds under the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme
component, the PIUiPCUs will implement appropriate internal control procedures and flow-of-funds
arrangements acceptable to the Bank and documented in the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme
manual. The Project will provideUS $0.55 million to finance and operate these Funds.

14.      Internal ControlArrangementsfor the Poultry Culling CompensationScheme. Annex 2B sets
forth the procedures for recording poultry culled under government orders and for establishing and
recording poultry owner's claims for compensation payments. A number of minimum internal control
procedures and risk mitigation measures will be implemented with respect to recording and verifying
poultry culling and claims for compensation payment before any flow of funds is initiated.




                                                  66

15.      The financial and operational manuals will detail the mechanisms, as described in Annex 2B, for
identifying those eligible for compensation payments, ensuring that there will be no multiple claims. A
Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme database will be maintained by the Project to facilitate record
keeping, claim verification, payment facilitation, monitoring and auditing.

16.      In the event of government-ordered culling of poultry, the culling and the preparation and
processing of culling records and compensation claims will be done in accordance with the procedures
detailed in Annex 2B.

17.      All forms to be used to record poultry cullings and compensation claims will provided by the
Project. They will be pre-numbered and recorded in the database of the Poultry Culling Compensation
Scheme. All unusedforms, as well as any invalid or incorrectly completed forms, must be returned to the
Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme when the culling records are submitted.

18.      Compensation payment to poultry owners will be by cash, bank transfer or postal transmission.
There will be no vouchers or animal replacements. Payment will be made within four weeks from the
date of culling.

19.      The owners of village and backyard poultry will, at the time of culling, receive a Culling
Certificate noting the date and the type and number of birds culled. Each certificate will be signed by all
four members of the Community Culling Supervision Committee (CCSC) or assessor and countersigned
by the poultry owner. The certificate will be completed inthree copies: one for the poultry owner, one for
the local government administration, and one will be attached to the village summary culling record
compiled by the CCSC and sent by the local government administration to the Poultry Culling
Compensation Scheme through the TSG. Certificates not signed by all members of the CCSC and the
poultry owner are invalid.

20.      Based on the individual poultry owner certificates, the CCSC will compile a Village Summary
Poultry Culling Record. All four CCSC members will sign and the poultry owners will countersign this
list of birds culled and their owners. Forms not signed by all four members o f the CCSC are invalid, and
all claims included on an invalid Village Summary Poultry Culling Record are rendered invalid as well.
The village summary culling record is the official record that establishes the poultry owners' right to
compensation from the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme. It will be completed in eight identical
copies: one will be posted in a weather-protected public location in the village. Attached to the copies
that are sent by the local government administration to the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme and to
the PIU/PCUs must be copies of all individual owners' culling certificates that form the basis for the
compilation of the village summary culling record.

21.      The local government administration compiles a Summary Report on the basis of all village
summary poultry culling records, listing all villages and for each village the total number of different
poultry culled. This report is made out in five copies and signed by the mayor o f the local government.
Attached to the copies sent to the PIU/PCUs and to the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme are the
village summary poultry culling records and copies of all individual owners' culling certificates.

22.      For medium- and large-scale poultry operations with more than 200 birds, the owner or manager
will, at the time o f culling, receive an Enterprise Poultry Culling Record, signed by the veterinarian and
an official from the local government administration, and certified by an audit firm acceptable to the
Bank. The ownedmanager countersigns. There will be five identical copies. This document is the
official record that establishes the poultry owners' right to compensation. Actual compensation payments
will be based, however, on the lower of (a) the number of birds reported by the enterprise to the Poultry
Culling Compensation Scheme at the end of the quarter preceding the mandatory culling and for which


                                                    67

the required fee has been paid to the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme or (b) the number of birds
reported and certified on the Enterprise Poultry Culling Record. Ifall or part of the fee due to the Poultry
Culling Compensation Scheme is overdue by more than three months, no compensation will be paid.

23.      Flow-of Funds Arrangements for the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme. Flow-of-funds
arrangements for making compensation payments are designedto minimize the number of stages through
which funds will need to pass before reaching the intended beneficiaries, while ensuring maximum
transparency. Once authorized by the PIU/PCUs, compensation payments will be effected by the Poultry
Culling Compensation Scheme through the banking system or through the Postal Service.

24.      Payment to the poultry owners will be made by the local government administration and
supervised by the two community representatives on the CCSC, based on the village summary culling
record kept by the local government and cross-checked against that kept in the village. To receive
payment, each poultry owner will be required to present hidherculling certificate; the date and amount of
paymentwill be recorded on the certificate and countersignedby the poultry owner.

25.      All payments made to individual poultry owners are recorded on both copies of the village
summary poultry culling record kept by the local government administration, and each poultry owner
must sign for the payment received on both copies to confirm receipt of payment. These two copies of
the village summary poultry culling record thus become the "village culling-and-payment record". They
must be signed by the local government representative and the two community representatives on the
CCSC. The local government administration then completes the Summary Report by entering in the final
column for each village the amounts paid, by village and by type of poultry. The local government
administration keeps one copy of the completed Summary Report and submits the other to the Poultry
Culling Compensation Scheme, with a copy of each village's culling-and-payment record attached.

26.      For medium- and large-scale poultry enterprises the compensation payments will be made
through the banking system. The Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme will transfer the funds to the
credit of the account(s) of the eligible recipients. Banking fees associated with this service will be
financed by the Project. The Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme will inform the PIU/PCUs o f the
dates and amounts of payments made, with appropriate documentary evidence. For enterprises that have
no bank account or that failed to provide the necessary account details at the time of culling, the payments
will be made through the Postal Service. The Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme will provide the
necessary information and instructions to the Postal Service, with the name and address of the eligible
recipient, and the amount of payment. The Postal Service will obtain confirmation from the recipient that
the payment has been received and will submit this confirmation to the Poultry Culling Compensation
Scheme. The Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme in turn will inform the PIU/PCUs of the dates and
amounts of payments made, with appropriate documentary evidence.

27.      Funds Flow and Disbursement Arrangements. The Recipient will establish two Designated
Account (previously called Special Accounts), one for each Entity, in commercial banks, acceptable to
IDA. Disbursements from the IDA Credit will follow the transaction-based method, Le., traditional Bank
procedures: Advance documented with Statement of Expenditures and other records, Direct Payments,
and Special Commitments. For certain payments, above the Minimum Application Size as specified in
the Disbursement Letter, the AIPP would submit withdrawal applications to the Bank for payments to
suppliers and consultants directly from the Credit proceeds. Disbursement to the Poultry Culling
Compensation Schemes will be made on reimbursement basis. Withdrawal applications and
documentation will be checked by the PIU/PCUs before submission to the Bank.

28.      In case of declared emergency, following procedures agreed with IDA, additional funds
may be depositedto the Designated Accounts A and B, the ceiling to which may be increasedup


                                                 68

to EUR 500,000. The declarationof a nationalemergency would be a disbursement conditionfor this
element of the project. Upon declaration of an emergency, the Recipient would submit to the Bank an
initial recovery plan documenting the disaster declaration, the related budget appropriation and the
proposeduse of the funds. The PIUs will keep the Bank informed o f updates in the recovery plan as the
emergencyresponse operations unfold.

29.      Financial Reporting. For project monitoring purposes, quarterly interim un-audited financial
reports (IFRs) will be required. The AIPP will be responsible for designing appropriateIFRs to include:
(a) Project Sources and Uses of Funds, (b) Uses of Funds by Project Activity, (c) Special Account/Local
Bank Account Statements, (d) Physical progress report, and (e) Procurement report. These financial
reportswill be submitted to IDA within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The first quarterly IFR will be
submitted after the end of the first full quarter following the initial disbursement. Formats of the annual
financial statements and the IFRs are incorporatedin the FinancialManagement Manual. The accounting
software currently used by the PIU/PCUs will need to be upgradedto have the capacity to prepare IFRs
incorporatingall components, sub-componentsand expenditure categories, as may be appropriate.

30.      Financial Audits. There will be annual audits o f the project financial statements, covering all
aspects of the project, including specific requirements for the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme.
The audits will be performed by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (ISA), and the Bank's guidelines on auditing as stated in the
guidelines: Annual Financial Reporting and Auditing for World Bank-financed Activities (June 2003).
The auditors' TOR will be prepared by the PIU/PCUs and cleared by the Bank beforethe engagement of
the auditor. They will include both the audit of financial transactions, an assessment of the internal
control, funds flow mechanisms, and the reasonableness of the accounting, reportingand internalcontrols
in respect o f the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme, The annual audit reports will consist of a single
opinion on the financial statements o f the project, incorporating the project accounts, including
DesignatedAccount Reconciliation,and SR Withdrawal Schedule; as well as a Management Letter. The
audit reports will be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year to
which they relate. The cost of the audits will be eligible for financing from the Credit. The AIPP will
provide the auditor with full access to project-relateddocuments and records, includingthe compensation
claims database, and with the informationrequiredfor the purpose of the audit. Sample TORSfor project
audit will be includedinthe FinancialManual.

3 1.     The PIU/PCUwill carry out, or will arrange to have carried out, as part of the annual audit when
compensation claims have been paid out, additionalchecks to ensure that the eligible poultry owners, and
only they, are paid and are paid in full. This will include, but not be limited to, operational reviews to
confirm the validity and legitimacy of the compensation payments made. The reviewers would be
required to verify compensation claims and payments made in randomly selected samples of villages.



                                                   69

This verification will include: checking against the database maintained by the Poultry Culling
Compensation Scheme, collecting and verifying information available and obtained at the village level,
checking with individual poultry owners, checking forms and reports, etc. Any significant weaknesses
identified will be promptly rectified in close consultation with the Bank. In addition, the external
independent auditors would be asked to provide an opinion on the reasonableness o f the accounting,
reporting and internal controls in respect o f the operations o f the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme,
and the audit TORS(acceptable to IDA) would include these specific requirements. All ineligible claims
would be refunded to the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme and to IDA.

32.      SupervisionPlan. Duringproject implementation, the Bank will supervise the project's financial
management arrangements in two main ways: (i)review the project's quarterly interim un-audited
financial reports as well as the project's annual audited financial statements and auditor's management
letter; and (ii)during the Bank's supervision missions, review the project's financial management and
disbursement arrangements (including a review o f a sample o f Statement o f Expenditures and movements
on the Designated Account) to ensure compliance with the Bank's minimumrequirements. As required, a
Bank-accredited Financial Management Specialist will assist in the supervision process.

               BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: Avian InfluenzaPreparednessProject


1.       The Bosnia and Herzegovina Avian Influenza Preparedness Project has been assigned World
Bank environmental category B, since it involves moderate environmental impacts that can be mitigated
during implementation of the project. Although project activities supporting A I prevention, preparedness
and planning, response and containment are not expected to generate significant adverse environmental
effects, they do present a moderate environmental risk from inadvertent spread of the A I virus and waste
management. Overall the A I prevention and response-focused activities are expected to have a positive
environmental impact, as the investments in facilities, equipment, and training for veterinary and public
health service staff and laboratories will improve the effectiveness and safety over existing avian
influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting international standards established by OIE and
WHO. This would be reinforced by the mainstreaming of environmental safeguards into protocols and
procedures for the culling and disposal of animals during AI outbreaks.

2.       This environmental management plan (EMP) will address the moderate adverse environmental
effects of the Animal and Human HealthComponents. For the Animal component, the EMP will address
zoonotic disease containment and waste management as pertain to disposal of special waste, emissions
and materials at laboratories, and training for veterinary services workers, to include procedures for safe
handling of A I materials, safe culling of infected and at-risk poultry and disposal of carcasses. For the
Human Health component, the EMP will focus on equipment, refurbishing and training for laboratories
and medical facilities to include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and waste
management. The EMP will provide mitigation plans and monitoring plans to ensure appropriate
attention to environmental issues, and tracking progress or problems in their management. A delay in the
completion and disclosure of the Environmental Assessment from the normal appraisal stage has been
approved, instead making this a condition of disbursement for Component 2 - Animal Health, and
Component 3    - Human  Health.

3.       The main areas of environmental risk from project activities are the inadvertent spread of the AI
virus during culling, transport and disposal of carcasses, animal waste, litter, and used protective gear;
contamination of surface and groundwater from use of disinfectants; and laboratory bio-safety and waste
management. Inaddition, minor environmental disturbances may occur during renovation of laboratories.

4.       Strategic Communications: No environmental issues, but an important component for design
and delivery of communications tools for good hygiene, safe culling and disposal of animal carcasses,
animal waste management.

5.       Animal Health:       Equipment, refurbishing and training for regional laboratories and border
inspection to include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and waste management
as pertain to special waste, emissions and materials; training for veterinary services and poultry sector
workers to include procedures for safe handling of AI materials; safe culling of infected and at-risk
poultry and disposal of carcasses. Formal compensation for culled animals should target owners/primary
beneficiaries (e.g., specifically including women where they are the primary backyard producers).

6.       Human Health: Equipment, upgrading, refurbishing and training for national reference and
regional diagnostic laboratories to include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and
waste management

A.       Veterinary Care

Veterinary Services

1.       The veterinary service o f BiH, as it currently exists (see Figure, page 64), is the combination o f a
recently created system (incorporated in the country's administrative structure as o f 1995) and remnants
o f the former (Yugoslavian) legislative and institutionalframework. Veterinary services at the state level
in BiH fall primarily under the responsibility of the senior veterinary agency in the country, the State
Veterinary Office (SVO). SVO operates under the Ministry O f Foreign Trade and Economic Relations
(MoFTER) o f the national government (Council o f Ministers(COM) o f B&H).

2.       The state o f BiH consists o f two administrative units called entities, the Republika Srpska (RS)
and the Federation o f BiH (FBiH). Each entity has its own Minister o f agriculture, forestry and water
management (MAFW), under which the entity veterinary service operates. Both veterinary services are
directly subordinated to the SVO BiH.

3.       FBiH is composed of ten cantons, each with its own government, Ministry o f agriculture and
veterinary service.   Cantonal veterinary services are subordinated to the MAFW o f the FBiH. The
smallest administrative units are municipalities. At that operative level, veterinary service is established
through municipality veterinary practices.

4.       The ongoing evolution and development o f the BiH veterinary service is primarily motivated by
increased awareness o f the significance o f animal health and production issues for public heath and food
safety. It is also driven by concern for economic development and food security. Further,the country's
overall developmental direction is toward full accession to the EU, which will require updating o f
veterinary services and harmonization o f related legislation with current EUrequirements.

5.       Current issues related to the global spread o f HPAI have emphasized the need for strengthening
capacities and coordination within the veterinary service. Since institutional arrangements within this
sector are complicated and heterogeneous, placement o f the managing authority for veterinary services
(State Veterinary Office) at the national level (within MoFTER) clearly provides benefits towards a
coordinated national response to AI threats.

6.       At this point, the H5N1 strain has only been confirmed in two wild birds in BiH. The resources
that were required to address this discovery were, on an economic and human resources scale, relatively
small, and the country's veterinary services were able to provide a response that was adequate to prevent
further spread. However, veterinary services in BiH are inadequately equipped and experienced to cope
with a large scale HPAI outbreak. This is evident across the entire range o f critical capacities, including:
surveillance and diagnosis, implementation o f response and control measures and applied research
capability necessary to understand the etiology o f the disease.

7.       Further strengthening and capacity building will require assistance to the BiH SVO, as the
national competent authority, in developing animal health legislation related to avian influenza (further
addressed in separate section). This includes expanding human resources, developing competency, and
providing necessary equipment to support SVO staff.



                                                    73

8.      To ensure efficient implementation o f plans and programs developed and adopted at a national
level, regional (entity) and local (cantons/ municipalities) veterinary services must be strengthened as
well. This will require assistance in organizing training (possibly through SVO B&H) o f regional and
local staff and assistance inequipping them with PPE and other required equipment.

B.       Health Care System

9.       Organization, financing and provision o f health care in BiH are the responsibilities o f the two
Entities, and the ten autonomous Cantons in FBIH. Therefore, the health care system in BiHconsists of
13 heath sub-systems to cover approximately 3.9 million people. At the BiH level, the Ministry o f Civil
Affairs (MCA) is the only State body with responsibilities for coordinating the health sector. The legal
basis for M C A is provided by the BiH Law on Ministries (March 2003) authorizing M C A to represent
BiH at international level, to establish the basic principles for co-ordination and to co-ordinate plans of
entities and other governmental bodies.

Federationof Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH)

10.      FBiH occupies approximately 51% o f the total territory o f BiH and has a population of
approximately 2.3 million.     Administratively, it is divided into 10 cantons, each having its own
Government and Assembly. The cantons are sub-divided into 79 municipalities.




                                                  74

11.       The health care system in FBiH is decentralized with most competencies (functions and
responsibilities) allocated to the cantons. However, the Federation Ministry o f Health (FMOH) and the
Health Insurance and Reinsurance Fund (HIF) have the function to define the health care network with a
view to optimize its capacity for the provision o f medical services. While FMOH has the functions o f
formulating health policy and drafting laws, these functions are doubled by the cantons. Determination o f
health service needs and functions related to provision o f health care services (such as founding o f
institutions) are assigned to the cantons but, in principle, the co-ordination function lies within the
Government o f FBiH.

Organizationof the HealthSector in FBiH

12.       The structure o f the health sector in FBIH consists o f 11 ministries o f health (10 Cantonal and 1
Federal), 11 health insurance funds (10 Cantonal, and 1 Federal Health Insurance and Reinsurance Fund)
and 11 Public Health Institutions (10 cantonal PHI and 1 Federal). The Health care provider network
consist o f 280 public and 333 private institutions (including pharmacies) employing altogether about
23,800 persons, out o f which 3.270 are medical doctors, 5 10 dentists, 260 pharmacists, 11,180 nurses,
286 health consultants and 7,606 non medical staff.

Distributionof functions

13.       The FMoH is responsible for functions that cannot be executed at the Cantonal level:

     Borders' sanitary inspections;
     Developing legislation at federal level;
     Developing health policy for the FBIH
     Planningo f the health care facilities network;
     Capacity building;
     Health inspections;
     Developing and regulatingo f compulsory health insurance; and
     Monitoring and evaluating the health status o f the population.

14.       The Cantonal Insurance Funds are responsible for financing the health service at the cantonal
level. The Federal Health Insurance and Reinsurance Fund was established in January 2002 to address
some o f the problems associated with a highly decentralized system related to an unequal economic basis
and lack o f cross-canton health insurance coverage. The Federal Health Insurance and Reinsurance Fund
i s entitled to receive 8% o f all contributions collected by the cantonal HIFs.

15.       As noted earlier, the basic financial functions o f the health care system in FBIH is placed within
the cantons. Each of the cantons has its own Health Insurance Fundresponsible for the overall financing
o f the health care services. The bulk o f the income for the Cantonal HIF comes from health contributions.
Health insurance contributions are based on gross salary and amount to 17%. Cantons are authorized to
define their own contribution rates within the upper ceiling o f 17%.

16.       The FPHI is the leading research and educational institution in the field o f public health. Its
functions also include health promotion and monitoring o f the health status o f the population. In the area
o f monitoring and research, especially in the field o f health statistics and epidemiology research (also
with respect to data collection o f the 25 indicators needed for WHO reporting), there is collaboration
between the federal PHI and the Cantonal PHIS.




                                                      75

17.      Health ministries at the Cantonal level are in charge o f Cantonal health legislation, advising on
technical matters, implementing regulations, organizing health care services and health policy planning
mostly related to the Cantonal hospitals, the health centers ( Dom Zdravlja -DZ),         ambulantas (health
posts), pharmacies and other Cantonal health institutions.

18.      Import, procurement, distribution and control o f pharmaceutical products are under control o f the
Department for Drugs within the FMOH. This department is also responsible for drug registration,
control o f drugs and herbal products, the issuingof work permits for pharmacies, controlling and issuing
import permits for drugs and herbal products in FBiH.

Republika Srpska

19.      The Republika Srpska (RS) with approximately 1.4 million inhabitants occupies approximately
49% o f the total BiH territory. RS consists o f four regions: Banja Luka (630,000 citizens), Doboj-
Bijeljina (420,000 citizens), Sarajevo-Zvornik (230,000 citizens) and Trebinje/Foca/Srbinje (120,000
citizens) and 54 municipalities.

20.      The health care system in RS in centralized with the overall power concentrated within the
Ministry o f Health and Social Welfare (MOH), the Public Health Institute (PHI), and the Health
Insurance Fund (HIF). In addition, the Drug Agency o f RS, and the Agency for Accreditation and
Quality Improvement were established inthe past 2-3 years.

Organization of the Health Sector in RS

21.      Health care services are provided by a network consisting o f 63 Dom Zdravlja (DZ), (including
spas and emergency centers), 16 secondary level health institutions (including psychiatry hospitals and
rehabilitation centers) and 2 tertiary level clinical centers. Altogether, 11,2 10 people are employed in the
health care sector out o f which 7,177 are medical staff (1,783 medical doctors) and 4,034 are non-medical
staff.

Distribution of Functions

22.     The M O H is responsible for the health sector in RS and has the following functions: Policy
making, strategy development, health care facilities, network planning, sanitary inspections, health
inspections and co-coordinating health issues in RS.

23.     The PHI is responsible for functions such as research and education in the field o f public health,
health promotion and monitoring o f the health status o f the population. The PHI also collects data for the
25 indicators needed for WHO reporting.

24.     The Health Insurance Fund (HIF) has as main functions the collection o f health insurance
contribution (however this does not include contribution payment) and financing and contracting health
care services. The organizational structure consists o f eight regional offices and the head office o f the
HIF in Banja Luka with four departments: Economy, Legal, Medical and Information Technology (IT)
department. Health insurance contribution amounts to 15% o f the net salary.
