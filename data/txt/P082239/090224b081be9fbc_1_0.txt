                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main development objective of the project is to increase the accuracy of forecasts provided to the Russian people and economy by modernizing key elements of
                         RosHydromet's technical base and strengthening its institutional arrangements. This would enable enterprise and household adjustments to protect lives and support
                         economic growth.

                         This is the last ISR for the project which closes on May 31, 2013. The project supported the most critical modernization needs of Russia Hydrometeorological Service infrastructure,
                         ensuring interim fulfillments of Russia’s international obligations in weather and climate data sharing, testing and operationalizing modern technical and technological approaches and
                         solutions. Project results will be analyzed and reflected in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) which is under preparation. The implementation of the project remains

                         satisfactory. The project is on track to fully achieve its development objective by the closing date. PDO’s outcome and intermediate indicators (e.g., increasing forecast lead time for
                         national and regional weather forecasts; reaching higher resolution of operational forecasts; increasing percentage of stations reporting to global telecommunication network on time;
                         reducing average response time to users of national archive etc.) have been met or exceeded. Investments under Component A supported modernization of computing, archiving and
                         telecommunications facilities which significantly improved the timeliness and effectiveness of weather forecasts, data availability and data sharing nationally and globally. Specific

                         investment activities resulted in (a) establishing capacity to produce operational forecasts with higher spatial resolution; (b) addressing principal infrastructure bottlenecks for
                         information storage and transmission, resulting in increased daily volume of data sent and received in the Moscow Computing Center from a baseline of 50 Mbytes/240 Mbytes to 150
                         Mbytes/5000 Mbytes respectively; (c) timely reporting of about 96% of World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-data stations (against a baseline of 87%) to the Global
                         Telecommunication system; (d) ensuring infinite data survival of and improved response time for delivery of information from Roshydromet data archives from 14 days to several
                         hours (less than 24 hours) for an average request. As a result Russia’s Hydrometeorological Service (RHM) forecasting capacity is getting closer to that of the leading world
                         forecasting centers such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and the US National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Investments under
                         Component B supported upgrade of observation networks including: (a) modernization of the entire network for regional and local forecasting which includes surface meteorological
                         stations (1628 sites); (b) upgrading the aerological network as a result of which 62% of the upper air stations are in compliance with WMO requirements against initial 5%, supporting
                         global forecasting by providing the principal data inputs to global weather models; (c) upgradation of entire hydrological network in three high priority flood-prone river basins (Kuban,
                         Ussury and Oka), with automatic and semi-automatic stations, mobile laboratories, etc. providing more reliable and timely hydrological data complementing meteorological forecasts
                         to enable flood warnings and support water resources management (lead time and reliability of forecasts in the pilot river basins improved from 30 minutes to 4-6 hours for flash
                         floods. Component C supports institutional strengthening, improvement in information dissemination and emergency preparedness through formulating, developing and testing new
                         operational principles drawn from worldwide experience, improved emergency warnings and improved information to users and clients. The project served as the foundation for “The
                         Strategy of Activities on Hydrometeorology and Related Areas until 2030 (with consideration of climate change impacts)? approved by the Government of the Russian Federation
                         (GORF) in September 2010 which set directions for further modernization of Roshydromet.
                         Roshydromet’s main clients -- the regional and municipal authorities, the Ministries of Emergency, Transport, Energy, Water Resources Management, and Environmental Protection
                         marked noticeable improvement of Roshydromet information products and expressed strong support to further development of Roshydromet services. As the first project in Europe
                         and Central Asia region supporting hydrometeorological modernization, the project remains a model for preparation of similar investment projects in Europe and Central Asia (e.g.,
                         Central Asia, Moldova). The project remains relevant to Russia's economic development priorities. It serves as a platform for continuing Roshydromet's modernization. The GORF
                         requested a follow up investment support for the sector. The second Russia Hydromet Modernization Project is about to be negotiated in late May 2013.
