A. SUMMARY


The proposed changes include: (a) a reallocation of Loan proceeds, and (b) a third extension of the
Project’s Closing Date from August 31, 2012 to May 31, 2013. These changes are necessary to allow
savings from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Loan proceeds to be
utilized for the preparation of the proposed Second National Hydrometeorological System
(Roshydromet) Modernization Project. The restructuring does not involve any change in the Project
Development Objective (PDO) or associated outcome targets.



B. PROJECT STATUS


Currently, project implementation remains satisfactory. There are no major implementation risks
towards completion of all project activities. The PDO and development outcome indicators have been
met or exceeded. Indicators such as increased accuracy and lead time for national and regional
forecasts are achieved and as a result Russia’s Hydrometeorological Service (Roshydromet, RHM)
forecasting capacity is getting closer to that of leading world forecasting centers such as the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and the US National Center for Environmental Prediction.



Significant improvements of Roshydromet’s emergency planning and preparedness have been achieved
through the establishment of situational centers in Roshydromet Headquarters and the regions,
resulting in more effective coordination and cooperation among respective authorities during
emergency situations. The cumulative effect of the project resulted in improved lead time for warnings
of dangerous weather events delivered to local authorities, the Ministry of Emergencies and media. The
average timeliness increased from the baseline of 0.5 hour to 1 hour for flash floods, and from 1 hour to
1.7 hours for severe storms.



Activities for institutional strengthening, information dissemination and emergency preparedness
including development and implementation of automated management system in Roshydromet’s
Headquarters, its regional branches and centers, and research institutes; methodological support and
development of operational guidelines for modernization of observation networks, supporting finance
and planning; a program of staff training; upgrading the equipment of 6 regional training centers,
training and retraining of employees, have been fully completed.




                                                   6
Until end June 2012, 98.97 per cent of the loan proceeds (US$79.08 million) have been disbursed and 87
contracts have been fully implemented. There are 4 remaining activities under implementation with
total commitment of US$ 535,530. Active contracts include: (i) RHM/3/A.1.i – Delivery of additional
equipment to expand the data storage system of the computer complex of the Main Computer Center
of Roshydromet; (ii) RHM/1/B.2.a.ii – Additional supply and installation of the aerological computer
complexes; (iii) RHM/1/B.2.c – Supply of gas analyzers and control systems for gas generating plants;
and (iv) RHM/1/C.4 – Review of Roshydromet’s subsystems for environmental monitoring.



The preparation of the Second National Hydromet Modernization Project is ongoing however the
activities related to the preparation are behind schedule. Procurement of 11 consultancies of the
agreed Action Plan has been completed. Selection of consultants for the remaining two large
consultancies under component D (D5a and D5i) is completed pending contract signing. It is expected
that these consultancies will start in July 2012.



C. PROPOSED CHANGES


Reallocation: To date available estimated loan funds are in the amount of US$ 320,707. Loan
savings are the result of effective and competitive procurement and lower than anticipated
spending of the physical and price contingencies. Specifically, a reallocation of funds is
proposed to use the balance in category “Works? and category “Training? to category “Operating
costs?. All originally planned activities in these categories have been procured. The reallocation
of available loan savings in category “Operating Costs? will be used to finance the additional
operational cost which will be incurred by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to complete
project preparation including preparation of Terms of Reference and tender documents for at
least15 per cent of the loan amount for the Second National Roshydromet Modernization Project
and therefore to ensure timely implementation upon project effectiveness.


The reallocation of Loan proceeds between the different categories of expenditure shall be as follows:


        (i) Reallocate the amount of US$85,000 from category (2) “Works? to category (6)
        ?Operating costs?, and

        (ii) Reallocate the amount of US$50,000 from category (4) “Training? to category (6)
        “Operating Costs?

Extension of the Closing Date: A new closing date of the Project of May 31, 2013 is proposed. This is the
third extension that would represent a cumulative extension of thirty one months from the original
closing date. This new closing date has been requested by Roshydromet and MOF to allow for
completion of the remaining actions related to the ongoing preparation of the Second National
Hydromet Modernization Project. The requirements for an extension of the closing date are met: (i) The
project objective continues to be achievable; (ii) the performance of the Borrower continues to be
satisfactory; (iii) the Borrower continues to implement the agreed Action Plan for preparation of the

and (iv) there are no outstanding audit reports for the Project.
