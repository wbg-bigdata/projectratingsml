                         LEVEL TWO RESTRUCTURING

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
1.     This Restructuring Paper proposes an amendment to the Project description
involving the creation of a new category of expenditure against which Loan proceeds
may be disbursed, a reallocation of Loan proceeds and an extension of the Project’s
Closing Date from October 31, 2011 (the present Project Closing Date) to August 31,
2012. This is a level two restructuring which is necessary to allow savings of the IBRD
loan proceeds to be utilized for preparing the proposed Second National
Hydrometeorological (Hydromet) Modernization Project. It also reflects more accurate
funding needs by each category of expenditure based on the latest disbursements and
commitments. The proposed restructuring does not involve any change to the Project
development objectives or associated outcome targets. Since this restructuring involves
changing the Project description and adding a category of expenditure in the
disbursement table in addition to the reallocation and extension of the Project’s Closing
Date, an amendment to the Loan Agreement will be required. The restructuring is based
on a request from the Borrower via a letter dated April 11, 2011 from the Ministry of
Finance (MoF).



PROJECT STATUS
2.      Currently, implementation progress is maintained on all Project components. The
Project’s Implementation Progress and Development Objectives are rated satisfactory.
Most of the key outcome indicators were already met. So far, US$ 69.77 million or over
87% of the Loan proceeds have been disbursed. With commitments and payments against
contracts under implementation, 96% of the Loan will be utilized.

3.     The progress to date is being measured by the following: (a) supercomputer
complex is fully functioning, with research, testing and pilot activities underway to
introduce new forecasting models and techniques; (b) the quality of forecasting of the
main meteorological fields and spatial resolution of the models has significantly
improved; (c) several meso-scale models of atmospheric circulation (COSMO-RU, WRF
ARW) have been tested and used for operational needs in Moscow and in a few regions
(Novosibirsk, Khabarovsk, and Vladivostok); (d) a pilot testing of COSMO-RU and
WRF ARW models with spatial resolution of 2.8 km and 3 km, respectively, for the
European part of Russia is ongoing; and (e) RosHydromet (RHM) center is actively
developing global forecasting methods. All four supercomputer complexes in World

                                           3
Meteorological Center (MC) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in
Moscow, in the WMO Regional MCs in Novosibirsk and Khabarovsk, and in the Main
Geophysical Observatory (GGO) in St. Petersburg are operational.

4.      There are no issues with counterpart funds, financial management, monitoring and
reporting. There are no outstanding audit reports for the project. Discussions on the
Second Hydromet Modernization Project proposed for Bank financing started in
November 2010, and RosHydromet submitted a concept for review and endorsement by
the Government. RosHydromet proposes to use the proceeds of this ongoing National
Hydromet Modernization Project for project preparation of the Second National
Hydromet Modernization Project, which will increase the hydro meteorological security
and the effectiveness of protection from natural disasters and the effects of climate
change. The proposed Project will provide the population and the authorities with timely
and reliable hydrometeorological information. To that effect, the attached letter from the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) dated April 11, 2011 requests an amendment of the Loan
agreement and reallocation of the proceeds of the Loan as described in section C below.
During the recent Bank June 2011 mission, further agreements were reached with MoF
on the new closing date, the new category, and reallocation amounts.

5.     All originally-planned activities under the Project will be completed by the
current closing date of October 31, 2011, except one item (installation of automated
meteorological complexes and equipment), which is expected to be completed by
December 31, 2011.

6.      There have been two cancellations of US$ 19,943.48 dated June 21, 2010 and
US$ 75,066.84 dated November 18, 2009. These cancellations are related to one case of
misprocurement of consultancy services. The Bureau for Economic Analysis (BEA)
refunded in full the cancelled amount of US$ 95,010.32 before the agreed deadline of
May 30, 2011. BEA is assisting the RosHydromet to carry out the Project. All agreed
items in the procurement plan dated March 2011 have been procured. The main reason
for the loan savings is effectiveness of timely and competitive procurement, which has
resulted in the lower spending of the physical and price contingencies than anticipated.

7.      There are no changes to the Project safeguards category and no environmental or
social safeguards issues with regards to the proposed restructuring. Procurement will
continue to be carried out in accordance of the provisions of Schedule 4 of the Loan
Agreement dated August 11, 2005, i.e., in accordance with the Procurement and
Consultant Guidelines of 2004.

PROPOSED CHANGES
8.     The proposed changes are as follows: (a) amend the Project description to include
preparing the proposed Second National Hydromet Modernization Project as an activity
under Part D of the Project; (b) introduce a new category of expenditure “Preparation of
the proposed Hydromet-2 Modernization Project?; (c) reallocate funds for preparation of
the proposed Project; and (d) extend the Project’s Closing Date from October 31, 2011 to
August 31, 2012.


                                            4
9.     Revised Project Description: Part D of the Project will be amended to include
the preparation of the proposed Second National Hydromet Modernization Project as
follows:

       Part D: Project Management, Training, Monitoring Evaluation and Preparation of
       the Second National Hydromet Modernization Project

       Provision of goods, consultants services, training, and operating costs to RHM
       and BEA to support Project implementation management, Project audit, and
       preparation of the Second National Hydromet Modernization Project.

The following definition will be added:

“Second National Hydromet Modernization Project? means the Second National
Hydromet Modernization Project intended to be a follow-on to this Project with the
objective of further improving Russia’s national capacity to deliver weather, water and
climate information to its people and economy in a reliable and timely manner.?

The proposed restructuring does not involve any change to PDOs as the addition of the
new activity under Part D, i.e., preparation of the proposed Second National Hydromet
Modernization Project is consistent with PDOs.

10.     New Category of Expenditure: A new category of expenditure will be added to
the disbursement to allow disbursements for the new activity to be added to the Project
description, i.e., preparation of the proposed Second National Hydromet Modernization
Project.

11.    Reallocation: The reallocation of Loan proceeds between the different categories
of expenditure shall be as follows:

 (i) reallocate the amounts of US$624,650, US$8,540 and US$200,000 from the category
“Goods including inland transportation and related insurance and technical services? to
the category “Works?, the category “Consultants’ Services?, and the new category
“Preparation of the proposed Second National Hydromet Modernization Project?
respectively;

(ii) reallocate the amount of US$379,560 from category “Training? to the category
“Works?; and

(iii) reallocate US$257,790 from the category “Capacity Building? to the category
“Works?. A significant increase in the Works category can be justified as one relatively
large procurement item changed from “Goods? to “Works? to allow installation of the
equipment instead of just supplying the equipment.

12.    The following table shows the current and revised categories, allocation, and
financing percentage.

13.     Extension of Closing Date: A new closing date of August 31, 2012 is proposed.
This is the second extension of closing date for this Project. This new closing date was
agreed upon with both MoF and RosHydromet to allow sufficient time for preparation of
the proposed Second National Hydromet Modernization Project. The cumulative
extension of the closing date does not exceed two years. The requirements for an
extension of the Closing Date are being met: (i) the Project objectives continue to be
achievable; (ii) the performance of the Borrower continues to be satisfactory; (iii) the
Borrower has prepared an action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the Project in
time; and (iv) there are no outstanding audit reports for the Project.


14       Implementation schedule: The preparation of the proposed Second National
Hydromet Modernization Project includes mainly consultancy services and training.
Procurement for the new activities introduced as part of the Project description will be
carried out in accordance of the Procurement and Consultant Guidelines of 2004. The
proposed consultancy services include development of technical designs of various
hydro-meteorological systems and analysis of critical decision support systems such as
computer infrastructure. It is expected that procurement of these consultancy services will
start in July 2011.
