MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONS7RUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO ROMANIA
FOR AN EDUCATION REFORM PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to Romania for the equivalent of US$50.0 million to help finance an Education Reform
Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of twenty
years, including a five-year grace period.
2.        Country and Sector Context. Vital to Romania's transition is an education system that
prepares youth for a dynamic labor market and a more open and democratic society. As in other
post-socialist countries now several years into the reform proce:s, the transition in Romania is
proving more difficult than first thought. From 1989 through 1993, the country's economic output
fell by 30 percent, with industrial output down 50 percent. Unemployment has risen to 10 percent of
the labor force (January 1994). One factor in these difficulties is the inheritance of an education
system that cultivated skills, knowledge and values for functioning in a centrally planned economy
and under Ceausescu's totalitarian regime. Sustaining the delivery of education and other basic social
services during the transition-and within tight fiscal constrain's-is important but not sufficient. If
Romania is to restore economic growth and achieve competitiveness in international markets, it is
essential that its education system be strengthened to improve the relevance of what is learr-ed to what
is required in Romania's new market-oriented economy, and to introduce management of education
that reflects Romania's move to more democratic and decentralized governance.
3.        Reforming education to support the transition is a major task. With a population of 23
million, Romania is the second largest country in Central and Southern Europe. It is also the second
poorest, with a GDP per capita of US$1080 (World Bank Atlas Methodology, 1992). As elsewhere
in the region, Romania's once enviable education system was configured by several decades of central
planning to train most youth, beginning at age 14/15, in narrow technical areas and to "supply" labor
through scliools linked to local state-owned enterprises and farms. Chronic underinvestment further
eroded the education system. Low levels of spending, combined with extreme ideological rigidity and
isolation during the previous regime, have left Romania with: (i) a school system that is severely
lacking in up-to-date resource materials and equipment for teaching; (ii) teachers, researchers and
education policymakers who have long been out of contact with professional developments in OECD
countries; (iii) school infrastructure that is in many cases dysfunctional; and (iv) governance structures
from the past which constrain innovition, efficiency, and local and private initiatives in education.'
4.        Despite these problems, Romania has sustained a well-developed structure for delivering
education and shares positive characteristics of education in OECD countries (e.g., high participation
rates and low repetition rates in basic education, and strong teacher training in subject matter). Yet,
the system does not reflect major lessons and directions of education elsewhere. Experience has
shown that a strong general preparation of students is a far more cost-effective public investment than
I/ Anmal expenditure on education as a percet of GDP averanged 2.4% during 1985-1989. Expenditure n 1992 was 3.9%
which remains low by rost intertional conwarisom.



early vocational training. In OECD cour.tries, curriculum and teaching approaches aim increasingly
at developing a student's cognitive abilities and problem-solving, rather than rote mastery of factual
material, which remains central to schooling in Romania. National examinations are used almost
exclusively as a selection mechanism in Romania. In other countries, testing is regarded more
broadly as an important tool for assessing or certifying education and training outcomes, monitoring
school performance, ensuring accountability to the public, and supporting educational change.
Decision-making in Romania's education system is' highly centralized, whereas in other countries
school-based professionalism and flexibility in resource management have proven more conducive to
effective schools.
5.        Rationale for WYorld Bank Involvement. It is widely recognized in Romania that the
education system does not yet reflect the country's new social, political and economic environment.
Early last year, the Government released a White Paper on education which acknowledged that
reforms in the sector, especially at the basic and secondary levels, had been largely ad hoc and
marginal during the initial years of the transition.2 The paper focused the. medium- and long-term
reform effort on three objectives: restructuring, modernization, and measures to address critical
material shortages. Key elements include: (a) reorientation of education to "lifelong learning" and
provision of general education up to age 16; (b) updating of the content o-^ education (as reflected in
curriculum, textbooks and examinations); (c) reorganization of both pre- and in-service teacher
education; (d) restructuring of secondary te4hnical and vocational education that will consolidate
secondary schools under the Ministry rf Education (MOE), eliminate the specialized occupational
training from the secoidary level and provide a common core of general training in all secondarv
schools; (e) abolition of the state monopoly on textbooks and fostering of diversity of educational
materials in classrooms, with redirection of the textbook subsidy to the school level;
(i) decentralization of administration; (g) accreditation mechanisms for both public and private
educational institutions; and (h) an increase in the resource base for education in order to improve the
conditions of service for teachers and raise the level of investment and operating expenditures on
school buildings and educational materials. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is scheduled for
presentation to the Board on April 5, 199'., with the Romania Petroleum Sector Rehabilitation
Project. The proposed Education Reform Project is consistent with this strategy in addressing issues
of relevance of education to the needs of a new market-oriented economy, and improvements in
sectoral resource management. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is scheduled for presentation to
the Board on April 5, 1994, with the Romania Petroleum Sector Rehabilitation Project. The proposed
Education Reform Project is consistent with this strategy in addressing issues of the relevance of
education to the needs of a new market-oriented economy, and improvements in sectoral resource
management.
6.        The formulation of this strategy and its approval by the Council of Ministers represent
progress in building awareness, consensus and commitment to change. Formal policy decisions and
institutional reform to implement the strategy are just now advancing. New legislation on education
is being drafted. A Secretary of State for Reform was appointed in MOE to head a department that
will oversee education reform programs. Along with these initiatives, institutions and education
professionals in Rumania need external funding and technical support if the reforms they envisage-
ambitious by any standard-are to be implemented. External support has so far been piecemeal, and
at The Refom of Education in Romania: Conditions and Prospet", MiNriry of Education and Instite for Education
Sciences, Bucharce, 1993.



the levers of change in the school system are mainly in central, public institutions rather than
decentralized, autonomous institutions, as is the case in higher education. Further delay in the
updating, reorientation and investment in these lower levels of schooling, from which the majority of
Romanian youth enter directly into the labor market, could further constrain the improvement in labor
productivity that is essential for economic growth in Romania.
7.        The World Bank's relationship with Romania in education has been developing since 1990.
After an initial sector review and formal Govenment request, Projec: development began in late
1991.3 Bank involvement in the education sector has leveraged resources for technical preparation
from the Japan Grant Facility, U.K. Know-How Fund, British Council, EU/PHARE and the
Governments of the Netherlands, France and U.S. These donors also supported technical assistance
and training activities, organized by the Bank during Project preparation, to increase knowledge of
international experience and the capacity of Romanian institutions. The proposed Project will
continue to build the capacity of these institutions in the context of advancing reform implementation.
8.        Prject Objectives. The Project will support the Government's strategy for reform of pre-
university (basic and secondary) education. The specific Project objectives are to: (a) update and
improve the quality of basic and secondary education by strengthening curriculum and teacher
training, assessment and examinations, and textbook quality; and (b) develop and introduce measures
that will increase efficiency in management of public resources for education.
9.        Project Description.4 The Project is designed to help reform and strengthen the
professional capacity of central institutions and support implementation of curriculum reform.
Subsequent Bank operations could finance more district, local or school-based initiatives for quality
improvement. The Project will provide textbooks, resource materials and equipment for schools,
computer hardware and software, facilities rehabilitation, technical assistance, training, and
preparation of studies.
10.       Parallel Project in Secondar= Technical/Vocational Education. Development of the
proposed Bank-financed Project included technical preparation and appraisal of a component for
restructuring secondary vocational education. This component was designed to advance curriculum
development of secondary technical education programs and their implementation in pilot schools
throughout the country. At the time of loan negotiations in December 1993, the Commission of the
European Union and the Romanian Department of European Integration indicated that this component
would be financed by parallel EU/PHARE grant funding of approximately ECU 25 million.
11.       Component I: Raising Ouality of Basic and Secondary Education (US$55.7 million).
This component will assist reform of the major levers of educational change at the national level. It
will reorganize the mechanism for curriculum revision in general education so that teachers, subject

I Tis operstion has been developed in paallel with an Enploynent and Social Protectio Project, which will have closely
rlated componets in adult training and in career information and counseing. The Bank is also wodring with the Ministry
of Education and universities, Minisy of Science and Technology, and Academy of Sciences, to develop a strategy for
reform and invetment in higher education, which could be supported by furher World Bank financial assistance to the
sector.



-4 -
matter specialists and curriculum specialists can produce and validate new curricula more efficiently.
In teacler training, the component will provide technical assistance for the restructuring of pre-service
programs, and strengthen the capacity of in-service training institutions to support the introduction of
new curricula, teaching approaches and related reforms. An assessment and examinations
subcomponent will revise the two major exan. nations presently in use, develop a cadre of
professionals in learning assessment, and establish a National Assessment and Examinations Service.
To help ensure that technical and vocational training are well-founded on knowledge and skills used in
the workplace, promote labor mobility and are comparable to practices in OECD countries, this
component will establish a Council for Occupationaal Standards and Assessment that will adapt
standards and skills assessment tools from other countries. In conjunction with the approval of new
curricula, textho   will be produced through a mechanism that Frovides for competition among
publishers and school-based ehoice of textbook options.
12.       Component n: Improving Education Finanicing and Manaement (US$6.9 million). This
component will introduce mechanisms to increase efficiency in resource allocation, management and
mnoblization. Budget appropriation formulas for pre-university education will be revised, ard the
expenditure authority of inspectorates and schools will be increased. The inspectorate staff in each
judet will be trained and equipped to strengthen their financial analysis and management capacities.
Resource centers for education managers will be developed at the regional level in existing
institutions. A school monitoring system will be introduced to improve data collection and analysis
for feedback to schools and as an input to policy-niking. Feasibility studies will be carried out to
formulate new policies on resource mobilization ani cost recovery in education. This component will
also provide support to the MOE Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in developing its capacity for
reform coordination and project manaQemnA.
13.       Project Implementation. The Project will be implemented over five years by MOE in
close cooperation with its affiliated Institute for Education Sciences (YES) and the existing 41 district
school inspectorates. The coordination of Project activities will involve three distinct implementation
agents: (a) the PCU established in the MOE and responsible for the general administration ( f the
loan (mcluding loan accounting, coordination of procurement activities, and management of
disbursement procedures) and logistical support; (b) line departments within the MOE responsible for
detailed implementation of each subcomponent; and (c) a Sector Steering Committee (SSC),
comprised of representatives from the PCU, each line department and the YES. The SSC will be
chaired by the Project Director to help ensure coordination of activities among the various
components of the education system, as well as effective communication of information across Project
subcomponents.
14.       Project Sustainability. The main recurrent costs that will need to be sustained after
Project implementation are associated with operation of the ass2ssment institutions, and these are
expected to be partially offset by introduction of user fees. Overall, the recurrent costs associated
with the Project will be modest in relation to the existing total government budget for primary and
secondary education, with the average annual incremental recurrent cost during the Project equivalent
to less than 1% of the estimated total recurrent expenditures in education in 1993. Institutional
structures under the Project (boards, working groups and their secretariats) are initially rooted in
existing departnents and set up to rely on existing civil servants of national institutions or teachers
and local specialists who can be called upon for services as needed rather !han recruited permanently.
Reforms in education management and finance should result in incentives and autonomy for districts



-5 -
and schools to improve efficiency of their student:teacher ratios and help shift education expenditures
to non-salary items and investments.
15.       Program Objective Categories. The Project supports the Government's effort to reorient
education in support of economic and social transition, to shift away from subsidized state monopoly
producers (of textbooks) and thus encourage private sector activity, and to improve public sector
management. The following categories are therefore applied: ED (Education) - 60 percent; PV
(Private sector development) - 30 percent; and PB (Public sector institutions) - 20 percent.
16.       Environmental Considerations. The Project has been classified as C: "No appreciable
environmental impact". There wiil, however, be improved coverage of environmental matters in the
revised curricula for both general and vocational subjects, in development and review of new
textbooks, and in the selection of supplementary materials for teacher training institutions.
17.       Agrcements Reached. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that: (a) the
development of upgraded textbooks will not be contracted to any publishers which are beneficiaries of
budgetary subsidies; (b) MOE will prepare and furnish to the Bank every six months (i.e., by
March 31 and September 1 of each year) a report on the progress achieved in the carrying out of the
Project, according to performance indicators agreed with the Bank; and (c) a mid-term project review
will be conducted, according to terms of reference agreed with the Bank, in November 1996. As a
condition of effectiveness, the Government will confirm the establishment of a fully functInning PCU
with staff and other resources satisfactory to the Bank. A condition of disburserent for the
Occupational Standards subcomponent will be the establishment (through the signing of a protocol) of
the Counc:l on Occupational Standards and Assessment.
18.       Benefits. The Project is expected to yield the following major benefits: (a) zeformed
institutional structures and processes that can contribute to ongoing improvement and change in
education, specifically: (i) more reliable and valid school-leaving examinations, student selection
mechanisms, snd occupational certification delivered in a manner that offers a fair chance to all
candidates and increases public accountability in education; (ii) greater diversity, durability and higher
quality of textbooks in all schools throughout the country; (iii) open competition in the private sector
for publishing, printing and distribution of textbooks; and (b) more rational allocation and use of
scarce fiscal resources for education and greater transpar-,ncy, equity and incentves for efficiency in
budgeting mechanisms for schools.
19.       Risk. The major risks to project implementation and success are: (a) the weak
institutional capacity of MOE to implement highly interdependent reform components in an efficient
and well-integrated manner; (b) fiscal tightening beyond that contemplated in the Stand-By
Agreement/Systemic Transformation Facility now being finalized and/or unanticipated price increases
that could lead to frther deterioration in resources for education; and (c) resistance to change at the
national and local level if the rationale, programs and process of educational reform are not based on
broad participatory involvement, openly communicated and implemented in a transparent manner. To
help mitigate risks of institutional capacity, extensive long-term technical assistance will be provided
to assist the PCU and key im.plementing units. Technical assistance contracts will be packaged across
subcomponents wherever possible to help ensure coordination of effort. Actual and projected
counterpart funding expenditures under the Project will be carefully monitored and reviewed regularly



-6-
with the MOE and the Ministry of Finance. Governing institutions and decision-making processes for
the various reform initiatives are constituted so as to increase accountability to the public.
Dissemination of information throughout the school system and more publicly will feature in all
components.
Recmnmendation
20.      1 am satisfied that the proposed Loan will com?ly with the Atticles of Agreement of the
Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
