                   Procurement and Consultants' Services
Section I.  Procurement of Goods
Part A:   International Competitive Bidding
1.  Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods shall be procured under
contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set
forth in Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines).
    (a)   For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid referred to in
paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide that, when contract award is
delayed beyond the original bid validity period, the successful bidder's bid
price will be increased for each week of delay by two predisclosed
correction factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign
currency components and the other to the local currency component of the bid
price. Such an increase shall not be taken into account in the bid
evaluation.
    (b)   In the procurement of goods in accordance with this part A, the
Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the
Bank, with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be
necessary for the purposes of the Project. Where no relevant standard
bidding documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use
bidding documents based on other internationally recognized standard forms
agreed with the Bank.
2.  To the extent practicable, contracts for goods shall be grouped into bid
packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $250,000 or more.
Part B:   Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
    In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures described
in Part A. (1) hereof, goods manufactured in Romania may be granted a margin
of preference in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of
paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines and paragraphs 1 through 4 of
Appendix 2 thereto.
Part C:   Other Procurement Procedures
1.  Items or groups of items estimated  to cost the equivalent of $250,000
or less per contract up to an aggregate amount of the equivalent of
$23,000,000, may be procured under contracts awarded on  the basis of
competitive bidding, advertised locally, in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
2.  Items or groups of items estimated to cost the equivalent of $250,000
or less per contract, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to $700,000, may
be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of three
price quotations obtained from a list of qualified suppliers, acceptable to
the Bank from at least three eligible source countries as defined under the
Guidelines, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
3.  Items or groups of items estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or
Page  10
less per contract, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to $500,000, may be
procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of price
quotations obtained from at least three qualified suppliers eligible under
the Guidelines, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
4.  Contracts for goods which the Bank agrees are of proprietary nature, may
be awarded after direct negotiations with suppliers, in accordance with
procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Part D:   Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
1.  Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final contracts:
    (a)   With respect to each contract for goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of $250,000 or more awarded in accordance with Section I, C, 4
of this Schedule, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix
1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contracts are to
be made out of the Special Account, such procedures shall be modified to
ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished
to the Bank prior to the making of the first payment out of the Special
Account in respect of such contract.
    (b)   With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding
paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to
the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made
out of the Special Account, said procedures shall be modified to ensure that
the two conformed copies of the contract together with the other information
required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be
furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished pursuant to
paragraph 4 of Schedule 6 to this Agreement.
    (c)   The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall not apply
to contracts on account of which withdrawals are to be made on the basis of
statements of expenditure.
2.  The figure of 15% is hereby specified for purposes of paragraph 4 of
Appendix 1 to the Guidelines.
Section II.  Employment of Consultants
1.  Consultants' services shall be procured under contracts awarded to
consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be
selected in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the
Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published by the
Bank in August 1981 (the Consultants' Guidelines). For complex, time-based
assignments, the Borrower shall employ such consultants under contracts
using the standard form of contract for consultants' services issued by the
Bank, with such modifications as shall have been agreed by the Bank. Where
no relevant standard contract documents have been issued by the Bank, the
Borrower shall use other standard forms agreed with the Bank.
2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, the
provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank review or
approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of
invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts shall not apply to
contracts estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent each. However,
this exception to prior Bank review shall not apply to the terms of
reference for such contracts nor to the employment of individuals, to single
source selection of firms, to assignments of a critical nature as reasonably
determined by the Bank, to amendments of contracts raising the contract
value to $100,000 equivalent or above, and to 20 contracts for Part A (5)
of the Project, selected for review by the Bank.
                                SCHEDULE 5
                          Implementation Program
1.  Overall responsibility for the carrying out of the Project shall be
assigned by the Borrower to MOE. For this purpose, the Borrower shall ensure
that MOE: (a) shall carry out the project in accordance with the
Page  11
requirements and other details set forth or referred to in the Project
Operating Manual; (b) shall establish and maintain a Project Coordination
Unit, with staff and other resources and terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank, to supervise the carrying out of the Project and the procurement
of the goods and services therefor; and (c) shall maintain, under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank, an education sector Steering Committee,
comprising representatives of MOE's Technical Departments and reporting
directly to the Borrower's Minister of Education, to coordinate the
activities under the Project of MOE's Technical Departments and to provide
policy guidance in the carrying out of the Project.
2.  The Borrower shall: (a) employ or cause to be employed consultants, with
qualifications and terms of reference and in accordance with a time schedule
satisfactory to the Bank, to assist in the carrying out of the Project; (b)
ensure that all such qualified management and staff in adequate numbers as
agreed with the Bank shall be made available and thereafter maintained as
required for the efficient carrying out of the Project and thereafter for
sustaining the objectives thereof; and (c) ensure that the external and
local training under the Project shall be carried out in accordance with
programs and criteria for the selection of candidates thereunder
satisfactory to the Bank.
3.  In order to facilitate the achievement of the objectives of  Part A (6)
of the Project, the Borrower shall ensure that the development of upgraded
textbooks thereunder shall not be contracted to any publishers which are
beneficiaries of budgetary subsidies from the Borrower.
4.  In order to facilitate the efficient carrying out of the Project in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01 (a) of this Agreement and the
criteria and guidelines set forth in the Project Operating Manual, the
Borrower shall: (a) prepare and furnish to the Bank, by March 31 and
September 1 of each year, a report, in form and substance satisfactory to
the Bank, on the progress achieved in the carrying out of the Project during
the six-month period preceding the date of such report, as measured pursuant
to indicators agreed with the Bank, and the resources required and the
measures recommended to provide for the continued efficient carrying out of
the Project, and taking the Bank's views on the matter and based on the
conclusions and recommendations of such report, take all the measures,
including allocation of resources, required to ensure such efficient
carrying out of the Project; and (b) review with and prepare, pursuant to
terms of reference agreed with the Bank, and furnish to the Bank, in
November 1996, a report integrating available data on the progress in
achieving the objectives of the Project during the period preceding the date
of said report and setting out the measures recommended to ensure the
achievement of the objectives of the Project for the period following said
report, and, thereafter, take all measures which, in the opinion of the
Bank, are required to achieve said objectives.
                                SCHEDULE 6
                              Special Account
1.  For the purposes of this Schedule:
    (a)   the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1) through (3),
set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
    (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect of
the reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to
be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to
the eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement; and
    (c)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to
$2,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in the
Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.  Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for
eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.  After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special
Page  12
Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and
subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as
follows:
    (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall
furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
    (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower
                shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the
                Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall
                specify.
          (ii)  Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower
                shall furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence
                required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the
                payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is
                requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank
                shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
                Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount as
                the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been
                shown by said documents and other evidence to have been
                paid out of the Special Account for eligible expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under
the respective eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent
amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.  For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the
Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish
to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was
made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank
shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:
    (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account
in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and
paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
    (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment
entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions
with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn
amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the
Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making
payments for eligible expenditures.
6.  (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out
of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not
eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified
by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may
request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment
or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account
shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
    (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further
Page  13
payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
    (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all
or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
    (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c)
of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent
withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
