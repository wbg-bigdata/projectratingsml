1. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Introduction
1.01      The Government of Haiti has requested IDA assistance in financing a
water supply project for seven provincial towns. The estimated cost of the
project is US$8.0 million and an IDA credit of US$6.6 million is proposed to
finance 100% of its foreign exchange component. The project would benefit
about 155,300 inhabitants by the end of the construction period in 1982 and
would have adequate capacity to serve about 216,000 inhabitants - 90% of the
forecast population - by 1993. About 40% of the population to benefit from
the project is within the category of absolute poverty.
1.02      The project would be IDA's first water supply operation in Haiti;
however, a recently approved rural development project (Credit 675-HA) includes
a water supply component of US$0.2 million. Service National d'Eau Potable
(SNEP), a new decentralized agency under the Mlinistry of Public Works, would
carry out the project which was prepared by PAHO under a grant from UNDIP. Bank
staff helped in the preparation of the project and appraised it in May/June
1977.
Background
1.03      Haiti is the poorest country of the Americas.  Per capita GNP in 1975
was US$180. In constant terms, GDP grew by about 2.5% p.a. and gross domestic
income by about 3.8% p.a. between 1971 and 1975, thanks to favorable terms of
trade.
1.04      The income distribution pattern for 1970, obtained from a survey of
the Hlaitian Institute of Statistics, shows that about 85% of the total popula-
tion was earning an average income of less than US$60 p.a. which is not
considered enough to acquire the goods and services essential to life. The
situation was estimated to be somewhat less drastic, but still dramatic, in
the urban areas, where about 60% of the population fell within the category of
absolute poverty.
Population
2
1.05      The Republic of Haiti with an area of 27,700 km , had a total esti-
mated population in 1975--based on the 1971 census--of 4.6 million growing at
an average annual rate of 1.7%. About 19% or 0.9 million live in urban
areas--communities of 5,000 and more--growing at an average of 4.1'% per year,
while about 81% or 3.7 million inhabitants live in rural areas, growing at an
average annual rate of 1.1%. If this trend is maintained, as expected, the
percentage of urban population will increase to more than 30% by the turn of
the century.



-2-
1.06      About 70% of the urban population, or 620,000 inhabitants, is con-
centrated in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area 1/, the nation's capital,
wnich dominates the pattern of urban growth. It is forecast that, if
decentralization policies which are still in an early stage of development,
are not implemented, the capital's population will represent more than 90% of
the urban population and about 30% of the total population by the year 2000.
The heavy migration to urban areas and especially to Port-au-Prince is caused
by the search for better living conditions including job opportunities, health
care and availability of basic public services.
1.07      Apart from Port-au-Prince, there are only seven urban cernters with
more than 15,000 inhabitants each of which four are included in the project
(Table 4.1). The rural population is scattered and about 85% live in communi-
ties of less than 300 inhabitants.
Health Aspects
i.08      The health situation is precarious:  the infant mortality rate
reaches 150 to 200 per 1,000 and life expectancy is less than 50 years. There
are no meaningful statistics on waterborne or water related diseases, but all
indications are that their incidence on mortality rates is high. A survey
undertaken in 1975 indicated that waterborne diseases, diarrhea and typhoid
represented 15% of the registered cases of diseases in the country. According
to limited reports from hospital centers, 54% of reported deaths in 1973, were
caused by gastroenteric diseases, but since more than 90% of total deaths are
not reported, this reference must be considered in a limited context.
Service Levels
1 09      The level of water supply service in Haiti is the lowest in Latin
America2 Only 10.2% of the total population had access to piped water in 1975
39% of which was through house connections and the rest through public stand-
pipes. The following table indicates the levels of service throughout the
country .
1/   Includes Port-au-Prince, Petionville and Carrefour.

1.10     Water service levels in the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area are the
highest in the country with 22% of the population served by house connections
and an additional 23% by public standpipes. There are about 20,000 house con-
nections and 40 standpipes that provide service to about 45% of the population;
the remaining population obtains its water from illegal connections or from
private water vendors at relatively high prices (US$2.0 per cubic meter).
1.11     The situation in other urban areas is much worse; in 1975, only
14.4% of the population was served by house connections and an estimated
additional 11% by public standpipes. Although no reliable information is
available, the lack of investments and proper operation and maintenance
indicates that the situation has been steadily deteriorating during the past
two decades. Only 3% of the population in rural areas is served with safe
water, mostly by public standpipes.
1.12      The quality of service is poor.  In urban areas, piped water is often
provided for no more than two to four hours a day. Water is not chlorinated.
In general, water works are old and in poor condition.  Many of the standpipes
are not operative, and in cases where they do operate, the sanitary conditions
are so bad that they frequently constitute a health hazard.
1.13     There are no sanitary sewage systems in the country.  However,
Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien, the two largest cities, are served by limited
piped drainage systems to which illegal connections have been made.  These
systems are inadequate to meet the needs of the population. Many pipes
are obstructed, and since the low-lying areas of these cities are flooded



- 4 -
during heavy rains, these sewerage systems constitute a health hazard.
Septic tanks and latrines are in common use in urban and rural areas, and
are frequently a source of contamination to public and private water sources
due to lack of adequate control.
Institutional Framework
1.14      The Central Autonome Metropolitaine d'Eau Potable (CAMEP) is in
charge of supplying water to the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area. CAMEP's
financial situation is precarious and its organization structure needs to be
improved, despite the technical assistance it has received (para. 1.22).
Studies financed by IDB are being undertaken to improve its performance
and include: (a) management reorganization, (b) updating cadastral infor-
mation, (c) assessment of water resources in the metropolitan area.
1.15      The Services Hydrauliques (SH) was responsible for the planning,
execution and operation of water supply systems in all other urban communities.
In 1975, there were 14 communities with more than 5,000 inhabitants, in addi-
tion to the capital. Only nine of these 14 communities have public water
systems operated by SH. The other five communities have systems operated
locally or not serviced at all.
1.16      The Cooperative pour l'Alimentation d'Eau Potable (COALEP) was
the institution responsible for providing water to the rural communities.
COALEP was a cooperative society under the authority of the National Council
of Cooperatives. SH staff operated five of the six COALEP water systems, and
one is operated by a local community. Three other rural communities have
water systems operated by local bodies without COALEP's participation.
1.17      SH and CAI4EP have operated under the Ministry of Public Works,
Transportation and Communication, which also controls Electricite d'Haiti,
Telecommunications d'Haiti, and the Road Mtaintenance Authority. While
CAMEP is an autonomous agency with its own Board of Directors, SH was a
Division of the Ministry itself without any administrative or financial
autonomy.
1.18      There is no single agency responsible for providing sanitary systems
to both urban and rural areas. The Ministry of Health has a Sanitation
Division but the Ministry of Public Works has authority in the sector as well.
As stated (para 1.13), only two cities are served by limited drainage systems
to which illegal connections have been made. Septic tanks and latrines are
widely used in the country, but most of them have been built by private
individuals without institutional guidance or adequate safeguards to prevent
contamination. A clear definition of responsibilities within the sanitary
sector is needed so that effective programs can be developed and health
hazards mitigated. The Government with PAHO's assistance is considering the
necessary administrative arrangements to deal with this problem.
1.19      The Conseil National de Developpement et de Planification (CONADEP)
is responsible for preparing national investment plans and coordinates all
sector planning. However, water and sewerage sector planning developed by the
individual institutions has been weak in practice and has been hampered by
lack of funds.



1.20      The Government is conscious of the weakness of the present sector
organization, and especially of the need to strengthen its planning, financial
and executing capabilities.  To this end, the Government has enacted a law
creating the Service National d'Eau Potable (SNEP), which merges the functions
of SH and COALEP and gives SNEP the necessary autonomy in financial, administ-
rative and technical matters.  In addition all future investments in the water
supply sector, with the exception of Port-au-Prince, will be channeled thirough
SNEP.
Past Sector Investments and Financing
1.21      Capital expenditures have been very low over the past decade.  The
average annual public investment in the water sector (US$0.5 million equiv-
alent) represented only 1.6% of the total public investment during the
Government's FY period 1971-1975 and was mostly directed to Port-au-Prince.
1.22      Port-au-Prince (CAHEP) has benefited from two loans from IDB (US$2.4
million in 1964 and US$7.4 million 1/ in 1975). In addition, IDB has provided
technical assistance to CAMEP in engineering and financial matters. Since
1970, SH investments have totaled US$0.6 million for water works in the
cities of Croix-de-Bouquets, Mirabalais, Gonaives and Kenscoff. Investments
in the last decade by COALEP and by the Ministry of Health in the rural areas
have been negligible. IDA recently approved a rural development project
(Credit 675-HA) in the northern area of the country (Cap-Haitien and St.
Raphael) which includes a water supply component of US$0.20 million. This
will help finance the development of 400 hand-dug wells and six spring water
sources to provide safe water for approximately 20,500 persons. Water works
at Petit-Goave are being financed by CIDA. Other minor investments have been
made in the sector by bilateral agencies and religious groups with little
government coordination.
Planned Investments and Financing
1.23      The Government's FY 1977-1981 investment plan includes a total of
US$18.3 million (annual average of US$3.7 million) for the water sector
of which about 70% is allocated to Port-au-Prince. This plan represents more
than seven times (in current prices) the average annual investment of the past
five years, and if it is to be carried out, will undoubtedly require major
efforts in improving the implementation capabilities of the water institutions.
The Government's plan assumes that 50% of this investment program will be
financed through foreign credits and grants.
1.24      The United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) approved in May
1977 a grant of US$1.34 million to finance water supply systems in three
provincial towns--Les Cayes, Saint lMarc and Leogane. The development cf these
works will be undertaken in close liaison with IDA to assure coordination in
1/   I.e., rescheduling of a 1970 non-disbursed US$5.1 million loan plus an
additional loan of US$2.3 million.

technical, organizational and financial aspects with the proposed project.
Some other investments to be financed by bilateral agencies and other donors
w:ill be coordinated by SNEP as well., SNEP, with help from the technical
assistance program included in the proposed project, will develop sector
goals including the identification of water supply and sanitation programs
that eventually could be considered for financing by external sources.
1.25      The Ministry of Health has prepared a sanitation program for the
northern and southern departments of the country for the years 1977 to 1979.
This program which will be financed by the Ministry, the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) includes
the construction of hand-dug wells in communities with 1,500 inhabitants or
fewer and the construction of about 20,000 latrines.
Governmento       i
1.26      The Government is giving high priority to the development of the
water supply sector. A general objective of the five-year plan (1977-1981)
is to improve the living conditions of the urban and rural population of the
country by more and better water supply systems and sanitation, and to use
the sector as a means of encouraging industrial decentralization and inte-
grating the rural population into the economy.
1.27      Although the five-year plan includes specific programs for the water
supply sector, their actual imiplementation depends heavily on the availability
of financial resources and on a significant improvement in the implementation
capabilities of the sector institutions. Thus, administrative and institu-
tioral reforms are necessary in order to have a meaningful and realistic long
term development plan for the sector while, at the same time, effectively
coordinating specific programs on a year to year basis.
Banik Role and Sector Lending Strategy
1.28      The need to improve and expand both urban and rural water systems to
provide safe water to a greater proportion of the population and to strengthen
the sector agencies is in accordance with the Bank's policies of helping the
development of projects aimed at improving the living conditions of the
poor.
1.29      The proposed project supports the Government's objectives.  It
ainms primarily toward improving and expanding the supply of water to the poor
areas in. seven provincial towns, and controlling water wastage by thes use of
flow-limiting devices.  It also includes a technical assistance component to
help the planning process and to strengthen the organizational, managerial and
financial capabilities of SNEP. The participation of IDB in Port-au--Prince
has induced the Government to seek IDA financing and UNCDF funding to improve
water supply services in other large towns. As a second stage, the Government
expects to launch a comprehensive program to alleviate water supply and sani-
tation problems in other areas of the country.

II. THE BORROWER
Introduction
2.01      The Borrower would be the Government of Haiti and the executing
agency the new Service National d'Eau Potable (SNEP). SH and COALEP, the
previous sector agencies, have been merged to form SNEP, an autonomous agency
responsible for the planning, building and operation of all water supply
systems in the country, except in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area.
Organization
2.02      The law creating SNEP has been enacted.  The Board of Directcrs
has six members; the Secretary of State for Public Works, Transportation and
Communications, who is its chairman; representatives from the Banque National
de la Republique d'Haiti (BNRH), the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of
Finance, the M4inistry of Public Health and SNEP's general manager. Board
members are appointed for periods of four years. SNEP's general manager is
appointed by the President of the Republic for a renewable period of fLve
years, however, he has no voting rights.
2.03      The proposed organizational structure for SNEP is shown in Figure
2.1. It is divided into three major departments: Operations and Maintenance,
Projects and Finance and Administration. The Operations and Maintenance
Department will have the following functions: water quality control, manage-
ment of watersheds, installation of new house connections, operation oE water
systems and maintenance and execution of minor works. The Project Department
will be in charge of the planning, design, bidding and construction super-
vision of new projects and development of design and construction standards.
The Finance Administrative Department will have, in addition to accounting,
financial and administrative areas, such commercial activities as control of
house connections and billing, supervision of accounts receivable and tariffs.
A Community Participation Unit within the department will be responsible for
promoting and organizing the participation of consumers in the construction
of future water supply projects and operation of water systems and encouraging
potential users to connect to the water systems under construction. Ihe unit
would be created not later than January 1, 1979.
2.04      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that SNEP's internal
regulations will be prepared not later than nine months after credit signature
and IDA should be given the opportunity to comment on them. Assurances were
also be obtained, during negotiations, that major changes affecting SNIEP's
structure or the appointment of its General Manager or department heads would
not be made without obtaining prior approval from IDA.
Personnel Review
2.05      SH/COALEP has III employees, 23 of which are headquartered in
Port-au-Prince and the rest in regional offices. The ratio of employees
to population served is 1.6 per 1,000 persons served (17.3 employees per



- 8 -
thousand connections), which is over the accepted standard of about one
employee per 1,000 persons served, but acceptable in the particular case
because the systems under operation are small and require a minimum staff
to operate. It is expected that personnel action will be required to streng-
then SNEP's capability to carry out the project; this will call for the
reallocation of some personnel and mainly the appointment of capable depart-
mental heads. Management consultants (para. 2.09) will help establishing
procedures to define responsibilities and the number of employees required,
their qualifications and salary levels.
Billing and Collection
2.06      Water systems have no connection meters and tariffs are set accord-
ing to the connection diameter. SH does not have a billing system; customers
pay at the local offices but there is no reliable internal control of the
collections. There is no accurate way to establish the amount of accounts
receivable, and it is estimated that 15% of customers have accounts more than
a year overdue.
Accounting Practices and Procedures
2.07      SH's accounting system fails to serve as a tool for management
information and control. It is a cash basis system and should be changed
to an accrual system. The procedures followed are outdated. No proforma
financial statements are prepared.
Audit and Internal Control
2.08      SH is audited by the government comptroller's agency, the Cour
Superieure des Comptes. Some of the activities of SH are not subjected to
the usually accepted internal control principles. This occurs mainly in
the assignment of incompatible responsibilities to the same person and the
lack of control on accounts receivable.
Technical Assistance and Training Program
2.09      The proposed project aims toward strengthening the institutional
capability of SNEP, developing administrative and financial procedures with
respect to organization, maintenance operation and design and construction
standards. Two factors are required to accomplish this target: first, SNEP
should appoint competent heads for each of the three departments; and second,
SNEP should hire management and engineering consultants to assist with the
design and implementation of sound administrative, financial and engineering
practices and train SNEP's staff in these areas. To this end, the project
includes a US$400,000 component for technical assistance. The government has
signed an agreement with PAHO to coordinate their program.
2.10      A detailed implementation schedule for the Technical Assistance
Program, satisfactory to IDA, would be prepared by SNEP as a condition of
effectiveness. The program (summary terms of reference are shown in Annex 1)
would be carried out over a period of 30 months and will cover, the following
main areas:



-- 9 -t
(a)  Accounting - an accounting system would be desLgned and
implemented and, at a later stage, accounting manuals and
flow charts, would be prepared;
(b)  Financial Reporting - the accounting s-stem will be
designed to fulfill the reqairema-ats  : financial in-
formation with the level of detail and accuracy needed
for management control and decision-naaking, as well as
to serve as a basis for plannirng and budgeting;
'c)  Planning and Budgetig - for each area of the organization,
procedures would be developed to prepare plans and programs
that assure the accomplishment of the institutional targets.
In the financial area, a budget system that reflects insti-
tutional planning would be developed. SNEP's staff would be
trained in the preparation and utilization of tuiese tools;
(d)  Internal Control - procedures and systems woul'd f3a designed to
comply with requirements of modern irnternal control praotices;
(e)  Organizational Structure   responsibilities and main fun .os
for each of the three departments would be defined as well
as lines of coordination and supervision. This definition
would serve as the framework for the development of procedures
for each area;
(f) Personnel Administration - procedures would be established
and implemented for the different areas related to this
function (recruiting, remuneration, promloti-on, training);
(g) Commercial Procedures and Practices - administrative
procedures would be developed and implemented for the
different functions of this area: (i) insLalling house
connections; (ii) setting up a house connection control
system; (iii) billing; (iv) supervision of collections (but
not collecting); and (v) tariffs. The consultants would
also train SNEP's staff in these operations;
(h) Tariffs - a study would be carried out during the first year
of the project and presented for IDA review not later than
December 31, 1978. The study would include assessment of
appropriate financial policies and be based on what woulld
be feasible, equitable and economically sound; it would also
include an implementation program.  The study would aim at
the following objectives:
(i)  develop a tariff structure and level based on long-run
incremental costs charges consumers according to their
ability to pay, and takes into account cross subsidiza-
tion between consumer groups and the appropriateness of
applying different tariffs to different towns to reflect
differences in construction and operating costs;



- 10 -
(ii) study a practical system to establish a charge for
standpipe users;
(iii) assess the advisability of installing water meters
for large consumers and design and implement the
necessary administrative procedures for doing so.
(i)  Design and Construction Standards - design and construction
standards would be developed to reflect the living con-
ditions and ability to pay of the population to be served
in urban and rural areas as well as the availability of
equipment and materials and skilled labor. Bidding and
procurement procedures acceptable to the Government and IDA
would be developed.
(j)  Maintenance Procedures - simple maintenance and operational
procedures for the water systems would be developed, taking
into consideration their technical characteristics and the
availability of skilled labor;
(k)  Community Participation - the potential of community
participation in the construction and operation of future
SNEP projects would be tapped and potential users would be
encouraged to connect to the system. Consultants would help
in developing such an office within SNEP;
(1) Training in the following areas:
(i)  water quality control and laboratory procedures;
(ii) ground water management and operation of pumps and
chlorination facilities;
(iii) installation of house connections and construction
systems;
(m)  Sector Goals and Strategies - sector goals and strategies
would be developed in coordination with CONADEP, including
the identification of water supply and sanitation programs
that could eventually be considered for financing by external
sources.
2.11      The technical assistance and training program would be oriented
towards the design and implementation of practical procedures for each area,
and the training of SNEP's staff in its operation. Manuals would be prepared
only after the procedures are fully implemented to serve as a,future guide or
reference. Systems must be established to keep them updated as changes in
operations and procedures are introduced.



- 11 
2.12      The technical assistance program would be carried out by two
resident consultants, one sanitary engineer, and one finance and management
expert, all of whom would be in Haiti for a period of 30 months. In addition,
short-term consultants would be retained to help in specialized areas. The
total technical assistance program included in the project consists of
100 man-months.
2.13      The appointment of department heads and of resident consultants, to
carry out the technical assistance program, should be satisfactory tc IDA and
would be a condition of effectiveness.

III. PROJECT COMPONENTS, COST AND FINANCING
Introduction
3.01      In late 1975, UNDP granted US$155,000 to the Government to finance
the feasibility studies for water supply systems in ten towns. This grant was
increased to US$227,000 in FY1977. The activities financed by the UNDP grant
(with PAHO as the executing agency) covered the preparation of feasibilil:y
studies for the ten towns, an analysis of SH's financial and administrative
situation and a study of the socioeconomic conditions of the population in
these towns. Three towns have been selected by the Government for financing
under a UNCDF grant; the project proposed for IDA financing will cover th,le
remaining seven towns (para 3.04).
Scope and Design Objectives
3.02      The project involves improvements and extensions of the water
supply systems of Cap-Haitien, Gonaives, Jeremie, Port-de-Paix, Jacmel,
Miragoane and Aquin. It is intended to eliminate deficiencies in the existing
systems and to extend service to a large segment of the population that does
not have adequate and safe water supply. The project would also contribute to
improve the institutional and operational capabilities of the sector agency
SNEP, to develop long-range pblicies for the sector, and to assess the needs
and define priorities for future programs. At the end of the construct:ion
period, the project would (a) provide potable water to about 155,300 people by
1982 by rehabilitating and extending the distribution system; the systems
would have adequate production capacity to serve 215,500 people by 1993;
(b) control water wastage by the use of flow-limiting devices (restricted
orifice) in all house connections and public standpipes; (c) improve the
efficiency of SNEP's management and operations; and (d) develop a long-range
plan to improve the service levels in both the urban (except for the metro-
politan area of Port-au-Prince) and rural areas.
3.03      The physical components of the project are designed to substantially
improve the reliability of existing systems, and would have adequate capacity
to service about 90% of the population in these towns (50% from house connec-
tions and 40% from public standpipes) until about 1993, and permit phased
expansion in capacity as demand increases.  The 10% of the population not
served is located in sparsely populated areas, where it would be very costly
to provide service. The project would satisfy the basic water requiremnents of
most of the population and reduce considerably the incidence of disease from
unsafe water.
3.04      Parallel to this project, UNCDF has given a grant of US$1.34 million
with UNDP/OPE as executing agency, for the construction and improvement of
water supply systems in Saint Marc, Les Cayes and Leogane. Close coordination
between UNCDF and IDA will assure that the same design and construction
standards will be applied to the two projects and that both organizations will



- 14 -
act in parallel to improve SNZEP's administration and finances.  The UNCDF
project will provide safe water to a population of about 54,400 by 1982
and will have adequate capacity to meet demand up to 1993 in these three
project towns.
Existing Facilities
Cap-Haitien
3.05      Located in the northern part of Haiti, it is the country's second
largest city with a population of 53,800 growing at a rate of 3.1% per year.
The existing water system provides service 12 hours a day for three to
four days per week to about 23% of the population.  Because of the inadequate
service provided, the number of active house connections has decreased in the
past five years from 1,800 to about 1,000. There are 8 public standpipes
serving an estimated 4,000 people. Water from wells and springs 10 km away is
pumped to hhe city.  There are three storage reservoirs with a total capacity
of 4,200 m , all of them out of service; two built in 1896 cannot be repaired,
but: a steel tank that leaks badly can be restored to service after repair.
The distribution system, with 27 km of pipes, was built in 1922 and extended
in 1952, and is in very poor condition. Cap-Haitien and Port-au-Prince are
the only two cities in the country with limited drainage systems.
Gonaives
3.06      Located 180 km to the north of Port-au-Prince, it has a population
of 35,000 growing at a rate of 3.7% per year. The existing water system
provides limited service eight hours a day to about 17% of the population
through 490 house connections and six public standpipes. Water from one well
is pumped directly into the distribution system since there is no storage
reservoir. The distribution system has 33 km of pipes, most of them in good
condition,
Jeremie
3.07      Located in the southwestern part of the country, 240 km from Port-
au-Prince, it has a population of 19,700 with a growth rate of 2.2% per year.
Access roads are in bad condition and transportation from the capital is
mainly by sea. The existing water system provides good-quality water through
a limited gravity service from two spring sources. There are 590 house
connections and seven public standpipes that provide service to about 37% of the
population.  One of the transmission lines Ias built more than 50 years ago
and needs to be replaced. There is a 940 m storage tank that must be repaired
The distribution system has about 15 km of pipes, most of them in gooci condition.
Port-de-Paix
3.08      Located in the northern part of the country, 230 km from Port-au-
Prince, it has a population of 17,800 growing at a rate of 3.4% per year.
There are 510 house connections and seven public standpipes that provide



- 15 -
service to about 35% of the population. Gravity water, from a spring scurce
12 km away, provides limited service. The existing system, built in 1938, is
in bad condition; it includes 7.6 km of distribution pipes and a 430 m3 capacity
storage reservoir which is out of service because of extensive leakage.
Jacmel
3.09      Located 48 km south of the capital, it has a population of 12,200
and is growing at a rate of 1.3% per year. There are 620 house connectLons
and 3 public standpipes that provide service to about 43% of the population.
Two spring sources feed by gravity directly into 11 km of distribution net-
work; there are no storage tanks. The water system is in fair condition.
Miragoane
3.10      Located 93 km southwest of Port-au-Prince, it has a population of
3,900 growing at a rate of 1.7% per year. There are 160 house connections and
three public standpipes that provide service to about 38% of the population.
The water system, built in 1927, is in bad condition and includes (a) one
spring source that provides water by gravity to the city; (b) one 115 m3
capacity storage reservoir in bad condition; and (c) 10.4 km of transmission
and distribution pipes.
Aguin
3.11      Located 61 km northwest of the capital, it has a population of
2,300 growing at a rate of 0.7% per year. There are 110 house connections and
two public standpipes that serve about 43% of the population. Water from a
nearby river is supplied by gravity and without treatment; the intake is in
bad condition. There is no storage tank and water is fed directly to 1.8 km
of distribution pipes.
Project Description
3.12      The project includes the construction of 10,500 house connections
and 109 public standpipes, water storage tanks, chlorination facilities, and
installation of 111.6 km of transmission mains and distribution network. All
house connections and public standpipes will be equipped with flow limiting
devices (restricted orifice) to prevent wastage. In spite of the generally
extensive deforestation in the country, all spring sources are located in well
preserved forest areas. All production sources will be metered to allow
better control of the systems and to develop more reliable information for
future projects. The proposed works correspond to the least-cost solution
among the technically feasible alternatives. The location of the project
cities is shown on the attached map. The major project components are as

IX.   Technical assistance Program.  Management and engineering
consultant services and staff training for SNEP, including
technical assistance in organization, long-range planning,
accounting, tariff study, community participation, engi-
neering design and construction standards, and assessment of
future sector investment needs and project identification
(para 2.09).
X.   Engineering services for detailed design and supervision of
construction.
Cost Estimates
3.13.         The estimated cost of the project is US$8.0 million equivalent
and includes:
(i)  16% of construction costs for engineering and administration;
(ii)  15% of base costs for physical contingencies;
(iii)  26% of base costs plus physical contingencies for price
escalation.
3.14      Costs were verified by direct inquiries to manufacturers and
contractors and are based on price levels of January 1977. Physical contin-
gencies were based on 10% for the technical assistance program; 15% for
construction of the water systems, equipment and materials, and engineering;
and 20% for the construction of the office building. Price contingencies were
based on disbursement profile of three years starting in 1978; on estimates on
worldwide inflation trends, on equipment and materials of 7.5% p.a. for 1977 to
1979 and 7% p.a. thereafter, and a local construction inflation of 12% p.a. for
1977 to 1979 and 10% p.a. thereafter for all local costs and indirect foreign

IV. DEMAND AND MiARKET ASPECTS
Population Forecast
4.C1      The last two population census counts of 1963 and 1971 are considered
reliable and have been used to calculate population growth rates for the
project towns. The average urban population growth in the country is 4.1%
per year and is highly affected by a 6% annual growth rate for Port-au-Prince,
which accounts for 70% of the u2rban population. The project towns with a total
population of 144,800 in 1976 have an average growth rate of 3.0% per year;
it varies from a high of 3.7% per year for Gonaives to a low of 0.7% per year
for Aquin. This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future
since limited employment opportunities exist in these towns.  In the longer
run, a more pronounced growth in these towns is anticipated as the Govern-
ment's declared decentralization policy starts to show its effects. Population
ser-vice levels and water demand forecasts are shown in Table 4.1.
Production and Consumption
4.02      The quality of service is poor, as detailed in the preceding chapter.
Water is supplied for no more than two to four hours a day. In most towns,
waterworks are very old and in bad condition and water losses are believed to
be substantial because of the lack of proper operation and maintenance. Water
production and consumption statistics are unreliable as a result of meters at
production sources and house connections.  Production estimates have been
based on limited flow measurements or pump production based on electricity
consumption and pump characteristics.  Average production ranges form a low of
67 lpcd 1/ in Port-de-Paix to a high of 235 lpcd in Gonaives. Because of high
water losses, intermittent service, low pressures in the distribution systems
and limited number of houses with waterborne waste disposal facilities, per
capita consuoption i-s low.
Consujmption Forecasts
4.03      Production estimates have been based on comparable water use in
similar projects in Latin America and take into consideration the proposed use
of flow limiting devices in all house connections and public standpipes.
Average production figures have been based on an allocation of between 100 and
150 lpcd for house connections, depending on each town's population and its
industry and tourism potential, and 30 lpcd for public standpipes.  There are
no malor industries in the project towns that would create a heavy demand on
the water supply systems and there is a limited tourism water demand in all
towns since they are located by the sea. Water production allowances would
satisfy the bas2ic human requirements for cooking and personal use.  Demand
during thle pea1operiod days is estimated at 130% of average daily flow.
1/   lpcd - liters per capita per day.



- 21 -
4.04      The number of house connections in all towns has decreased or
remained stationary since dissatisfied consumers have withdrawn from the
systems because of the poor service provided. This trend is expected to
change once the new systems enter in operation. The number of house connec-
tions and the average population served were estimated on the basis of a
survey in each town. The location and number of public standpipes were
calculated by a similar survey and their numbers were based upon average
service densities of 400 to 600 persons per standpipe.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Investments
5.01      The project will be carried out by SNEP during 1978-79-80.  The
estimated annual investments by category are given in Table 5.1, and a bar
chart of the work program is shown in Figure 5.1.

5.02      SNEP would, as a condition of effectiveness:
(a) Hire engineering consultants, acceptable to IDA, who would
carry out the detailed engineering studies and supervision of
construction.
(b) Hire engineering and management-financial consultants, accept-
able to IDA under the technical assistance program (see
para 2.09 and 2.12) and develop a detailed implementation
schedule for this program acceptable to IDA, to strengthen
the institutional capability of SNEP.
(c)  Appoint the necessary engineering, management and service
staff to act as counterparts to the consultants. The heads of
the Operation and Maintenance, Projects and Administration-
Financial Departments satisfactory to IDA should be appointed
before the advisors from the technical assistance program
start their work (para 2.13).

5.03      ICDA staff would review (a) terms of reference for contracting
engineerrlng consultants and the technical assistance program advisors;
(b) annual investment programs; (c) criteria for selection of future invest-
ments, definrition of priorities and long-range sector planning.  IDA super-
vision would focus on engineering and management assistance and on training
programs. Four supervision missions a year (20 man-weeks per year) are
planned in the first two years of the program and three in the third year.
5.C4      The project includes an estimated 170 man-months of consulting ser-
vices to assist in the preparation of final designs and project supervision and
100 man-months of technical assistance. The estimated cost of these services,
not including physical or price contingencies is US$1.09 million, or an average
cost per man-month of US$4,000
Procureme"t
5.05      All procurement woulcl be made in accordance with the Bank Group
Procurement Guidelirnes.  Contracts in excess of US$50,000 for civil works or
US$20,000 for purchase of equipment would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. Contracts of less than US$50,000 but over
US$10,000 for civil works, or of less than US$20,000 but over US$10,000
for purchase of equipment would be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding3 subject to an aggregate maximum of US$500,000. Contracts of less
than US$10,000 would be procured directly on the basis of a minimum of three
quotations and subject to a maximum aggregate of US$200,000.  Since SNEP does
not ha-ve procurement guidelines, it would develop such procedures, with help
from consultants from the technical assistance program.  Contracts would be
grouped to make them attractive for international competitive bidding.
5306      Foreig-n suppliers are expected to win all equipment and pipe supply
contracts and foreign contractors, probably in association with local firms,
are exoecLed to win all major civil work contracts, although local firms are
in a faio position to be contractors and subcontractors on civil works. None
of the -required equipment and pipes for the project are manufactured in Haiti,
howexver basic materials for civil works can be obtained locally. Practically
all requlred labor. with the exception of some specialized skills, are avail-
able local'lc Goods manufactured locally and procured under International
Gompetiti-e Bidding (ICB) would be allowed a preference of 15% (or the level
of appllcable import duty, whichever is lower) over foreign goods.  For civil
work cortracts, procured under ICB, domestic contractors would be granted a
7.5% preference over foreign contractors, for which prequalification would
be requirp i

IDA. The percentages to be disbursed in all categories cover all direct and
indirect foreign costs.
5.09      Consultants have been appointed to undertake the technical assist-
ance program. IDA should consider retroactive financing for expenses incurred

Environmental Aspects
5.11      The project is intended to eliminate the deficiencies of the existing
water supply systems and to extend water services to large numbers of people
who do not have adequate and safe water available from the existing systems.
The need for much of the population to satisfy all water requirements from
unsafe water sources would be substantially reduced as well as the incidence
and risks of waterborne diseases. As a result of the project and the expansion
of the water supply systems, the additional volume of waste water would not
impose a serious problem since most houses with connections have latrine or
septic tank facilities. The volume of water used by people served through
public standpipes would be modest and allow them to satisfy basic human
requirements for cooking and personal use and would not impose any serious
disposal problem.

VI.  FIANCIAL  ,NALYSIS
Introduction
6.01      SNEP, the new sector entLity thatf replaced Sii and COALEP is an
autonomous agency that will plan, build anid operate all the urban and rural
water supply systems in Haiti, with the exception of Parz-au-Prince ard .cs
metropolitan area.  Most of the towns covered by SNEP are small (from 23,0C0
to 54,000 inhabitants) and are scattered around the country..
6.02      SH/COALEP management practlces have been very weak. and have contri-
buted to their poor financial performance.  olotivation is iow, there is a lack
of internal control, and planning and programming have been almost nonexistent
in the past.  Accounting systems are inadequate, and information about cpera-
tions is poor.
Past Finances
6.03      Water rates have not been increased since 1-959.  S-E andL
revenues have never covered their operating costs.  Cash deficits ha>e
covered partly with loans from the National Pension Fund and partly wLn
government grants wjhich represented about US$80,000 a year during the
three years.  These operating deficits result from the small number of h, I
connections, people being reluctant to connect because of poor quality of
service. About half of the population is served through standpipes wit'aoutc
charge. The rate of collection is low as a result of poor management. There
is no billing system and users are supposed to pay at local SEL offices.
Operating costs are high since each town requires an administrative strucrure
for a small number of house connections.
WJater Tariffs
6.04      Water tariffs are monthly flat rates and are the same for all towns.
There are no meters and consumers are classified by the diameter of the
connection and differentiated by the type of service (residential, comumercial
and industrial). Considering the delivery capacity of each tariff group
(connection diameter) the tariff structure tended to favor connections with
larger diameter.  The lowest tariff rate prevailing up to September 1977 was
G7.50 (US$1.50) per month for a 1/2" residential connection with one faucet
and G 25 (US$5.00) for an industrial connection. The highest was G125.00
(US$25.00) for a 1-1/2" commercial/industrial connection.
6.05      As a result of low consumption and present administrati-ve constraints,
it is not advisable to install water meters. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that as an alternative flow limiting devices will be installed on
all connections and a study would be undertaken on (a) a more rational tariff
structure to be completed within the first year of the project; (b) a systemn
to charge for water standpipe use; and (c) the advisability of installing
meters for large consumers.  The recommendations oL this study will be taken



- 30 -
into account in the formulation of appropriate measures and its implementation
szhedule.  The outcome of this study and its implementation schedule should be
satisfactory to IDA.
6.06      In the interim, a new tariff that partia ''y corrects the present
problems and generates larger revenues (see 7'able 6.4) has been enacted with
the law creating SNEP and its implementation started in October 1977. These
tariffs have a minimum charge of G14.50 (US$2.90) per month for 1/2" residen-
tial connections.  The highest will be G500.00 (US$100.00) for 2" commercial/
inidustrial connections. For the financial projections it was assumed that the
new tariff would be fully implemented by Decermber 31, 1977. The average
revenue level per connection per month is estimated to be G18 (US$3.60) which
compares with average tariff for 1976/77 of G9.00 (US$1.80) or a 100% increase.
6.07      An understanding was reached during negotiations - reflected in the
monitoring indicators (para 5.10) - that during the cornstruction period
tariffs will be kept at least at the same level in real terms with periodical
adjustments according to the consumer price index of Haiti. Upon completion
of the project and once the communities have better service an increase of 20%
in real terms is required in October 1980, to meet the financial covenant
(para 6.16).
Revolving Fund
6.08      It is the objective of the Gover-rmer- to strengthen the water supply
sector both financially and institution all-y .Repayments of the loarns con-
tracted by SNEP (including the proceeds of the  proposed IDA credit), as well
as other funds allocated to finance SNEP's investments would be credited to a
Revolving Fund in the Banque Nationale de la Republique d'Haiti (BU\4RR) to be
used to finance future high priority developmuent projects.
Financing Plan
6.09      Total financial requirements during th-.e j:oject period (FY78-80)
are estimated at G52.6 million (US$10.5 ml1lion)s v   ncluding working capital
requirements of G1.9 million (US$0.4 milllnorn   The financing plan is shown
in Table 6.1.

6.10      In addition to the US$6.6 million IDA credit, the financing plan
assumes lending by the Government to cover the local costs of the project
(US$1.4 million) and interest during construction (US$685,000). The proceeds
of the proposed IDA credit will be made available to SNEP under a subsidiary
loan agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, including repay-
ment of principal in 30 years (including three years of grace) with an
interest of 6% per annum, Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between
the Government and SNEP would be a condition of effectiveness. It is the
Government's intention to make funds available to SNEP as a loan on the same
terns and conditions as those used to onlend the proceeds of the IDA credit.
Interest during construction will be capitalized. Repayment of principal and
payment of interest will be credited to the Revolving Fund. Debt service to
IDA and the foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government.  Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the Government will provide all neces-
sary funds for the project including cost overruns and to cover all cash
deficits during the construction period of the project. The UNCDF project
of US$1.34 million to be built from 1978-1980 was included as a grant to be
received in FY80,

External Auditig
6,11      In order to improve the reliability of the financial information
and the soundness of the accounting practices of SNEP, agreements were reached
during negotiations that its financial statement would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Audited reports would be sent to IDA
no later than four months after the end of SNEP's fiscal year.
Evaluation of Financial Performance
6.1.2     Consolidated financial projections (income statements, sources and
uses of funds, balance statements) are given in Tables 6.4 and 6.5. SNEP's
opening balance will be derived from SH's and COALEP's total assets and
liabilities at the date SKEP begins its operations.
6.13      On the basis of the assumptions outlined in paragraph 6.21, during
the first 5 years lollowing project completion (1981-85) SNEP financial
performance will be satisfactory. While total assets will increase by 34% its
equity will double from G27.3 to 54.1 million. By the same token, the debt to
total capitalization ratio will vary from 61%/o in 1981 to 42% in 1985. Liquid-
ity ratio (current assets to current liabilities) remains good throughout the
period, being above 3 to 1. Summary balance sheet projections are shown in
Table 6.2.

6.14      SNEP's revenue base will be increased through the average tariff
increase of 100% plus a house connection program which will increase the
total number of connection by 250%, from 7,100 in 1978 to 17,800 in 1981. As
shown in Table 6.3, this is estimated to cause revenues to increase almost six
times, from G1.1 million in 1978 to G6.5 million in 1981.

Financial Covenant
6.15      The criterion used to measure SNEP's financial performance should
fulfill the following objectives:



- 34 -
(a)  it must be easy to understand in all its financial implications
by SNEP's administration;
(b)  it has to take into consideration that SNEP's future investment
will go to projects with-increasing social content; and
(c)  it should help to improve SNEP's financial management practices.
6,16      It is considered that a cash flow covenant would adequately serve
the foregoing objectives. The proposed cash covenant would require that each
f:Lscal year, starting not later than October 1, 1980 SNEP's tariffs be set at
such levels as to enable revenues to cover (a) all its operating and mainte-
nance expenses and working capital requirements, (b) the higher of either the
arnnual interest and debt repayment on all its loans or the annual depreciation
charges on revalued fixed assets. In addition, the Government has agreed to
make contributions during the project's construction period which would be
adlequate to cover SNEP's cash deficits.
6.17      To protect SNEP's financial position, assurances were obtained
during negotiations that SNEP would not undertake capital investments outside
the project in excess of US$500,000 per year during the construction period
without prior consultation with IDA. Moreover, SNEP would not undertake any
borrowing other than that required for the project without IDA's agreement if
as a result its internal cash generation, excluding debt service, were to
cover its maximum projected annual debt service less than 1.4 times.
6.18      SNEP would revalue its fixed assets every year in proportion equal
to the consumer price index of Haiti.
6.19      SNEP agreed to prepare quarterly reports on the progress made in
aclhieving the financial covenant and monitoring indicators shown in Table 5.3,
and to take appropriate remedial actions as IDA might reasonably request.
Financial Rate of Return
6.20      The financial rate of return on revalued assets is negative during
the project construction period and increases to 1.0% in 1981 and 2.8%
in 1985. This is reasonable taking into consideration the high social com-
ponent of the project. In the future the financial rate of return would
depend, inter alia, on the feasibility of charging low income groups served by
standpipes and on SNEP's ability to enlist community participation in the
construction and operation of new water supply systems.

Assumptions for Financial Projections
6.21      Revenues
(a) Water Sales. According to the connection program for the project,
the average number of connections per year was used. It was assumed that the
new tariff would be fully implemented by December 31, 1977. Yearly increases
to compensate for inflation were used as follows: for 1978 and 1979 12 p-
*          year; from 1980 on 10% per year.  For 1981 it was assumed that an addi:lonQl
20% increase in real terms would be implemented.  Projections have been ma_
on an accrual basis.
(b) Connection Fees. It was assumed that connection fees would average
1/4 of the annual water tariff. Revenues are estimated according to the
number of new connections per year, on an accrual basis, assuming payment in
24 months.
(c) Contribution from Users. The recuperation of house connection costs
is included in the investment program. It is estimated that each house connec-
tion has a cost of G150 (US$30). The projection base is the same as that used
for connection fees.
6.22      Operat ng Expenses
(a) Labor - Central Office. Preliminary projections were made consider-
ing the inflation rate plus an annual growth of 5% in personnel and/or wages.
Detailed personnel requirements would be assessed by consultants.
(b) Labor - Local Offices. It was estimated that the present payroll
would have to be increased by 30% in FY78 to comply with operating needs.
Projections were made under the same assumptions as those used for the Central
Office.
(c) Administrative Expenses. These include rental of local offices,
communication costs, office supplies, per diem expenses, mail, insurance, etc.
They have been adjusted yearly to the inflation rate together with a 5%
increase due to , larger volume of operations.
(d) Power and Chemicals. Detailed calculations were made for each
town, in accordance with the volume characteristics of water produced.
(e) Maintenance. A minimum base for each system was assumed for
1978-79-80. In subsequent years, it was estimated that the maintenance costs
would increase by 10% per year.
(f) Depreciation. An average economic life of 30 years was assumed.
Depreciation was computed, using the straight line method, on revalued fixed
assets.



- 36 -
6.23      \okn  Capital Requirements
(a) Cash reserve. Estimated as one month of cash expenses.
(b)  Accounts Receivable from Water Sales.  Estimated as equivalent to
five months' sales for FY78 and FY79, four months' sales for FY80 and three
mionths' sales for FY81 and thereafter.
(c) Accounts receivable from connection fees and recuperation of
connection costs. It was estimated that half of these costs would be
recovered in the first year that the connection is made and the balance the
following year.
(d) Inventories0 A minimiium stock was estimated for the project- period
and 10% adjustments were made t:hereafter.
(e) Accounts_ayabl3e. Estimated as one month expenditures for power,
chemicals and maintenance.
6.24      Taxes.  SNEP's income and property are tax exempt.

VII. ECON1OMIC ANALYSIS
Introduction
7.01      The project objectives are twofold, namely to improve the sanitary
living conditions of the inhabitants of seven provincial towns, especially
the poverty target group that at present does not have access to safe water,
and to strengthen the administrative, financial and technical capabilities of
the institution responsible for providing safe water to urban and rural
communities, enabling it to expand its activities.
Population Benefited
7.02      The proposed project through the rehabilitation and expansion of the
water systems in the seven provincial towns will benefit 155,300 inhabitants
or 90% of the towns' population by the year 1982. At present, the population
actually served is estimated at 40,900 inhabitants or 28% of the current popula-
tion of 144,800.
7.03      Although no complete statistics on income distribution are available,
it is estimated 1/ that some 50% of the inhabitants of the project towns do not
earn enough income to have access to basic nutrition and sanitation. The
project would provide safe water to about 70,000 persons by the year 1982
through public standpipes. This corresponds to about 80% of the population
defined in the category of absolute poverty. In addition, some 85,000 inhab-
itants would have access to a reliable system of water supply, through house
connections, by the year 1982.
Project Justification
7.04      The low percentage of the population with access to safe water
supplies in Haiti and the lack of chlorination facilities have undoubtedly
contributed to high infant mortality (150-200 per 1,000) and low life expec-
tancy (less than 50 years). Although no meaningful statistics are available
on waterborne or water related diseases in the country, all indications are
that their incidence on mortality rates is high, particularly with regard
to the infant population.
7.05      The project would more than triple the number of house connections
and would provide safe water to the poorest sector of the population through
public standpipes. At present, service is erratic and deficient and most of
the population is not connected. 2/ Correspondingly, there is no historic
1/   Based on a survey prepared by the Institut Haitien de Statistique.
2/   The steady deterioration of quality of service has resulted in a decrease
in the number of active house connections during the past years.

evidence of "willingness to pay".  Besides, people to be served by public
:.andDipes lack both the income and the knowledge of water related health
benefits necessary to be willing to pay for safe water. Thus, project
benefits are not meaningfully quantifiable and are related largely to improve-
ments in health, labor productivity and the overall living conditions. The
3~mprovement in the sector agency's technical, financial and managerial capa-
bilities would permit, in curn to expand its activities in the near future so
as to increase its coverage in rural communities.
7.06       The sytems to be constructed under the proposed project, correspond
to the least-cost solution amiong the technically feasible alternatives.
Incremental Rate of Return
7.07       The increm.ental rate of return (IRR) has been calculated as a proxy
for the internal economic rate of return considering revenues based on
tariffs as a minimum measure of project benefits and as shown in Table 7.1
corresponds to 8%.  The IRR was estimated excluding costs and benefits of
public standpipesg if these costs were considered, the IRR would be 5%.

7.08      Since the opportunity cost of capital is estimated at 8% in Haiti,
an IRR of 8% is a rough indication of the adequacy of the pricing policy, i.e.
it indicates that prices are expected to reflect the incremental costs of' the
project's output.
Risk Considerations and Sensitivity Analysis
7.09      The successful implementation of the proposed project carries higher
than average risks.  SNEP, which will be entrusted with overall responsibility
for project execution, is a new and untried institution which the project aims
at strengthening. To counter the institutional risks, SNEP would be provided
4        with substantial technical assistance to help train its staff and pursue care-
fully planned expansion in the water supply sector and maintenance programs.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that adequate tariffs will be
maintained to provide SNEP with a sound financial base. In the final analysis,
the success of the project will depend on the Government's continuing suipport
of SNEP and on the dedication of its staff in implementing the project.
7.10      As indicated earlier, revenues to be obtained from tariffs have
been used as a proxy for project benefits. In these circumstances, the IRR is
highly sensitive to a change in tariffs or to a change in the number of house
connections. If tariffs were not increased by 20% by October 1980 as assumed
(or if the number of connections were 20% less than forecast), the IRR would
decrease to 4%. Thus, special care should be taken for the implementation of
the proposed tariffs (para 6.06). A lower number of house connections than
forecast is unlikely since this is a conservative estimate based on a socio-
economic study undertaken in 1976.
7.11      If operating costs were 15% higher than those projected, the IRR
would be 7%, which is considered acceptable, since health benefits are not
quantified. Capital costs are not likely to increase (in real terms) cver the
15% physical contingencies in view of the relative simplicity of the construc-
tion works involved in the proposed project.

VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
The following actions to be taken by the Government or SNEP were
discussed and agreed upon during negotiations.
Conditions for Credit Effectiveness
8.01      Preparation by SNEP of a detailed implementation schedule for the
technical assistance program, satisfactory to IDA (para. 2.10).
8.02      Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and
SNEP (para 6,10), Proceeds of the IDA credit will be made available to SNEP
at an interest rate of 6% per annum for a period of 30 years including a grace
period of 3 years. Repayments of principal and payment of interest under the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement and any other funds allocated to investments by SNEP
wiLl be credited to the Revolving Fund in BNRH (para 6.08).
8.03      Qualified engineering consultants who will undertake final designs
andl supervision of construction should have been appointed before the credit
becomes effective. Terms of reference and consultants should be satisfactory
to IDA (para 5.02).
8.04      Employment of SNEP's department heads (para 5.02).
8.05      Hire the resident consultants for the technical assistance program
(paragraph 5.02).
Conditions for Disbursements
8.06      All engineering designs, specifications and procurement documents
for the construction of the water systems and SNEP office building should have
been approved by IDA. In addition, disbursement for the construction of
SNEP's office building would be be made after the Government has given clear
title of the land to SNEP (para 5.08).
Other Covenants
Project Execution
8.07      Tariff Study - No later than December 31, 1978, SNEP, with the
assistance from the Technical Assistance Program, will carry out a detailed
tariff study and propose a tariff structure that will differentiate between
consumer groups and their ability to pay and will consider the possibility
of charging standpipe users. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the
terms of reference for this study which will also analyze the advantages of
installing flow meters, at least, on all industrial and large commercial and
residential users. The new tariff structure and its implementation sched-
ule should be satisfactory to IDA (paras. 2.10 (h) and 6.05).



- 43 -
8.08      Water Consumption - All connections will have flow limiting devices
to discourage wastage (para 6.05).
8.09      Bidding Procedures - All procurement will be done according to'
Bank/IDA guidelines. Bidding and procurement procedures were agreed upon.
during negotiations including the following limits:
(a) International competitive bidding - All civil works
above US$50,000 equivalent and equipment contracts above
US$20,000 equivalent;
(b) Local competitive bidding - All civil works contracts above
US$10,000 and below US$50,000, and equipment contracts above
US$10,000 and below US$20,000 and up to an aggregate maximum
of US$500,000;
(c) Price quotation (minimum of three) for works and equipment less
than US$10,000 and up to an aggregate maximum of US$200,000.
Goods manufactured locally and procured under ICB will be allowed a preference
of 15% or the level of applicable import duties, whichever is lower over
foreign goods. For civil work contracts procured under ICB, domestic contrac-
tors would be granted a 7.5% preference over foreign contractors, for which
prequalification would be required.
8.10      Community Participation - The Technical Assistance Program will help
create in SNEP, not later than January 1, 1979, an office that will be in
charge of promoting and organizing community participation toward construction
of future water supply systems and operation of water supply projects (paras
2.03 and 2.10(k)).
8.11      Progress Reports - Quarterly reports on the progress of the project
and monitoring indicators will be prepared by SNEP and submitted to IDA. SNEP
will take such remedial actions as IDA may reasonably request (para 6.19).
8.12      SNEP financial statements would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA. Audited reports should be sent to IDA no later
than 4 months after end of SNEP's fiscal year (para 6.11).
8.13      The appointment of SNEP's general manager or department heads would
not be made without obtaining prior approval from IDA (para 2.04).
8.14      SNEP's internal regulations would be prepared not later than nine
months after credit signature. IDA would be given an opportunity to comment
on them (para 2.04).
8.15      SNEP will have the exclusive responsibility for all future invest-
ments in the water supply sector (other than those in the Port-au-Prince
metropolitan area, para. 1.20).



- 44 -
8.i6      Financial Covenants
(a)  A cash covenant included in the credit documents (para 6.15)
would require SNEP to set up tariffs that would cover each
fiscal year, starting on October 1, 1980:
(1) All its operating and maintenance expenses and
working capital requirements.
(2) The higher of either annual interest and debt
repayment on all its loans or the annual depre-
ciation charge on revalued fixed assets
(b) During construction oiE the project the Government would
provide the required funds to cover the cash deficit (para 6.10).
(c)  SNEP will not undertake new capital investments in any one year
during the construction period in excess of US$500,000, without
prior consultation with IDA (para 6.17). Moreover, SNEP would
not undertake any borrowing other than that required for the project
without IDA's agreement if as a result its internal cash generation,
excluding debt service, were to cover maximum projected annual debt
service less than 1.4 times (para 6.17).
Retroactive Financing
8.i7      It is recommended that IDA provides retroactive financing after
October 1977 and up to US$200,000, to help expedite the hiring of engineering
consultants and to launch the technical assistance program (para 5.09).
8.18      Provided that the foregoing conditions are met, the proposed project
would be suitable for an IDA Credit of US$6.6 million equivalent on standard
IDA terms.
