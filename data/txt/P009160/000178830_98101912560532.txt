APPRAISAL OF
A SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
SIMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The transport system of Yugoslavia comprises roads, railways, in-
land and coastal waterways, ports and airports. The country's topography
largely determines the nature of the system with major routes avoiding the
crossing of the rugged coastal and southern mountains and flowing in a north-
west-southeast direction. The railways, which prior to 1965 held a dominant
position compared to highways, now account for only 42% of total freight traf-
fic and 18% of total passenger traffic.
ii.       The highway network now comprises 96,000 km of roads of which some
29,900 km or 31% are paved. Many of these roads, including the paved sections,
are substandard and lack the capacity to handle present traffic at reasonable
costs. Improvement of the network is essential if present and future trans-
port requirements are to be met as the economy continues to grow.
iii.      The Government has asked the Bank to help finance the construction
of six highway sections which are in the highways' Middle-Term Plan (1971-
1975). The feasibility studies for these sections were prepared by the Road
Fund in Bosnia-Herzegovina with technical assistance from the consulting firm
of Dorsch-Berger (Federal Republic of Germany-USA) provided under the Fifth
Highway Project (Loan 751-YU). The project was appraised in August 1973.
Construction of these road sections would benefit long distance as well as
local traffic and would help reduce the transport costs of raw and processed
agricultural goods, fuels, chemicals, wood and wood products and construc-
tion materials.
iv.       The project consists of:  (a) construction and supervision of six
road sections in Bosnia-Herzegovina, totalling about 150 km; (b) training of
transportation economists and road engineers; and (c) purchase of engineering
and laboratory equipment.
v.        The Road Fund of Bosnia-Herzegovina will be the Borrower with the
Federal Government as Guarantor. The project cost, including contingency
allowances, taxes and duties is estimated at US$60.0 million. The Bank would
finance US$30.0 million, comprising the foreign exchange component of US$22.5
million and US$7i5 million in local costs (20% of the total local costs).
The balance of the local costs (US$30.0 million of which about US$6.5 million
would be for taxes and duties) would be borne mostly by the Road Fund of
Bosnia-Herzegovina. About US$0.4 million of local costs, relating
to staff training and to equipment procurement, would be borne by the



- ii -
concerned Road OrganIzations of the Republics and Provinces. The proceeds
allocated for staff training and purchase of engineering and laboratory equip-
ment would be relent to the participating Road Organizations of the Republics
and Provinces through a. single Relanding Agreement.
vi.       The Road Fund of Bosnia-Herzegovina would be executing agent for
the construction works and the Council of Republic and Provincial Road Or-
.ganizations would coordinate:the:staff training program and the procurement
:of engineering and laboratory-equipment. Road construction works would be
undertaken on the basis of unit price contracts, awarded after international
competitive bidding according to Bank Guidelines.  Construction contracts
are expected to be awarded by mid-1974 and a12. sections would be completed
by.early 1977.  Construction supervision would be-done by the-Road Fund of
.Bosnia-Herzegovina. The staff training program would start in the fall of
1974 and be completed by mid-1977. The ;engineering and laboratory equipment
would be procured through international competitive bidding, to-the extent
'practical. The equipment is not manufacturede locally. Equipment deliveries
:would be completed in the second half of 1975.
vii.      Vehicle operating costs on present roads are high and the expected
,-unit savings in these costs after completion of construction-would range up
to 34% for passenger cars-and-up to 55% for buses and trucks. t-Because the
truckers are highly competitive, ^generally -well-managed-and operate for a
-profit, it can reasonably-besassumed that transport costl-~saviugs from the
ptoposed project improvements'would-- be passed on to farmers, manufacturers,
tonsumers and passengers.  For each road section included in the project the
'most economical solution has been-selected and the individual projects would
yield economic returns-varying from 14% to 31%.  Sensitivity tests show that
a 15% construction cost increase on the individual sections-would yield. eco-
nomic returns varying from 11% to 26% and a 25% increase in benefits would
result in economic returns varying from 17% to 37%.
viii.     With the assurances obtained during loan *negotiations- as indicated
in para. 6.01, the project is suitable-for a-Bank loan of US$30.0 million to
the Road Fund of Bosnia-Herzegovina for a 23-year term, including 3-1/2 years
of grace.



APPRAISAL OF
A SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has asked the Bank
to help finance a project comprising the construction of about 150 km of
highway sections in the Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, staff
training and purchase of engineering and laboratory equipment. The high-
way sections are included in the highways' Middle-Term Plan (1971-1975) and
are part of links in the national roads system whose remaining lengths are
either under construction or completed. The feasibility studies for these
highway sections were prepared by the Road Fund (para. 2.03) in Bosnia-
Herzegovina with technical assistance from the consulting firm of Dorsch-
Berger (Federal Republic of Germany-USA) provided under the Fifth Highway
Project (Loan 751-YU).  Detailed engineering was prepared by Yugoslav con-
sulting firms for the Road Fund. The total project cost is estimated at
US$60.0 million, toward which a Bank loan of US$30.0 million is proposed.
1.02      The project would be the tenth for the transport sector as a whole
and the sixth for highways. So far the Bank has lent US$364.4 million to
the transport sector, including US$150 million for five highway projects,
US$155 million for three railway projects, and US$59.4 million for the
Naftagas Pipeline Project. Details of these projects are in Annex 1.
1.03      This report was prepared on the basis of information provided by
the Yugoslav authorities and the consultants (Dorsch-Berger), and on the
findings of an appraisal mission composed of Messrs. R.H. Snel (Engineer)
and R.E. Rafloski (Economist) which visited Yugoslavia in August 1973.
II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. General
2.01      Yugoslavia, with a population of about 21 million, that is increas-
ing at 1% p.a., has a diversified economy which has grown rapidly since World
War II. During the past decade, per capita income has grown about 5% p.a.
to reach its present level of about US$780. Rising economic activity and
personal incomes have led to a rapid growth in transport requirements. Be-
tween 1958 and 1971, total freight traffic grew at about 8% p.a. (Table 1),
and total passenger traffic by 12% p.a. (Table 2).



-2-
2.02      Yugoslavia is a socialist federal republic consisting of six Re-
publics 1/ and two Autonomous Provinces 2/. During the past decade, govern-
mental authority and administration, previously concentrated in the Federal
center, has been decentralized to the Republics and Provinces, which have
gained considerable autonomy over their affairs, including the power to
make decisions on transport infrastructure investments.
2.03      A distinguishing feature of Yugoslavia is the "seif-managementt
principle of economic organization.  This means that transport enterprises,
including railways and ports, have become autonomous entities managed by
"worker's councils", as are all other enterprises. In place of the highway
administration or public works departments found in other countries, the
Republics and Provinces have set up Road Funds and Road Councils. These
are managed by a Board consisting in some instances of as many as 21 people
representing trading and business enterprises, consulting firms, individual
experts, and the Republic and local governments. Their degree of autonomy
varies, but all major investment decisions made by them must be approved
by the Republic and Provincial governments.
B. The Transport Sector
2.04      Yugoslavia which has an area of 244,800 km2 had, in the beginning
of 1973, a transportation system comprised of 96,000 km of roads; 10,330 km
of standard and narrow gauge railways; a sizeable network of inland and coastal
waterways; 5 major ports on the Adriatic 3/; and 15 airports, 10 of which
handle international flights. Pipelines are insignificant as a means of
transport. The country's topography largely determines the nature of the
system with major routes avoiding the crossing of the rugged coastal and
southern mountains and flowing in a northwest-southeast direction, mainly
from Ljubljana via Zagreb and Belgrade to Skopje. For historical reasons,
the system is more developed in the north and, prior to World War II, the
railroads dominated a primitive road network. Construction and maintenance
costs of the transport infrastructure are high due to the mountainous terrain
and the severe continental climate.
2.05      Railways and roads carry some 90% of the freight and 95% of the
passenger traffic. During the past decade railroads have lost their dominant
role in internal transport to the roads. While railroads accounted for 69%
of total freight traffic and 62% of total passenger traffic in 1962, they
now account for 42% and 18%, respectively. Inland water transport is still
significant, carrying about 11% of the total freight. The ports have almost
doubled their cargo handling since 1962 and currently handle about 17 million
m tons p.a. (Table 3).
1/   Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia.
2/   Kosovo and Vojvodina.
3/   Koper, Rijeka, Split, Ploce and Bar.



-3-
2.06      Physical improvements to the transport infrastructure have progressed
rapidly over the past decade, yet much remains to be done. The railways need
further modernization, and the capacity of some ports needs to be increased.
Many roads are still below standard for the traffic they carry and need im-
provements to handle expected traffic increases efficiently. The highways'
Middle-Term Plan (1971-1975) addresses itself to these needs, but lacks a
realistic financial plan and an economic ordering of the improvements.
Measures to overcome these deficiencies were discussed during negotiations
(para. 3.08).
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
2.07      Yugoslavia has no clearly announced and defined transport policy,
but its thrust is implicit in the country's overall economic policies. The
main tenets of these policies are: freedom of choice by users in selecting
transport facilities; free entry into the sector and competition in a market
economy among autonomous transport enterprises; and equal pricing treatment
by Government to require all modes to cover their infrastructure requirements.
In line with other major changes in overall economic policies, transport pol-
icy has encouraged greater decentralization of the policy-making machinery and
liberalization of the transport industry.
2.08      Introduction of these liberalizing policies during the past decade
has greatly contributed to the dynamic growth of road transport and related
economic activities, while railway transport has shown only a modest growth
in traffic. The railways have also been adversely affected by relocation
of industries and other changes in the structure of the economy and Govern-
ment controls over tariffs which were not sufficiently flexible in a period
of significant inflation. The situation of the railways is changing, however;
their comprehensive Five-Year Plan has been approved and supported by the
Federation, the Republics and Autonomous Provinces, and comprehensive sup-
port measures for the Plan's successful implementation are being considered
by the railways, the Federal Chamber of Economy and the Office for the Market
and Prices. This Plan and support measures will lay down the basic economic
framework within which the railways can become an economically viable system.
2.09      Decentralization has caused some deficiencies in transport admin-
istration, coordination and planning. As suggested by the Bank, a Federal
Secretariat for Transport and Communications has been established with cor-
responding secretariats in the Republics and Provinces and all levels of
Government have given considerable attention to the transport sector. How-
ever, the limited authority of the Federal Secretariat for Transport and
Communications and the lack of staff at both the Federal and Republ'c and
Provincial levels constitute serious deficiencies in transport coordination
and planning. The highways' Middle-Term Plan (1971-75), presented in 1973
by the Council of Republic and Provincial Road Organizations (C.R.O.) (para
3.06), lacks a rational financial plan and lists road projects by Republics
and Provinces without providing a priority ranking based on uniform economic



-4-
criteria. Furthermore, the effort expended on the railway plan (para. 2.08)
and that which should be expended on the plans for other modes of transport
can be maximized only if an explicit transport policy for coordination of
investments among the modes, and planning within the modes, is formulated,
implemented and supported by the Republics and Provinces.
2.10      The need for improved transport coordination and planning is recog-
nized by the Yugoslav authorities. During negotiations, the Bank obtained an
assurance from the Government of Yugoslavia that it will take appropriate steps
to coordinate (i) the preparation of the next five-year program of major high-
ways among the Republics and Provinces, and (ii) the planning and investments
among transport modes. The arrangements under which these objectives are to
be attained will be examined by the Republics and Provinces and the Federal
Government.
III. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Highway Network
3.01      In the late fifties, only 6% of Yugoslavia's 82,000 km highway
network was paved. By the beginning of 1973, the total. network had increased
to 96,000 km and the paved network to 29,900 km or 31% of the total (Tables
4 and 5 and Map "Highway Systemr"). However, the quality of the paved network
varies since many paved roads evolved from existing gravel roads by merely
asphalting the wearing course without strengthening the road foundation.
These paved roads will need strengthening in the future by overlays or com-
plete reconstruction, whereas other two-lane paved roads of adequate strength
are becoming congested and are in need of upgrading to a higher capacity.
The remaining gravel roads have mostly a macadam (crushed stone) wearing
course which is becoming inadequate for the fast motor traffic they are re-
quired to carry and many of them will ultimately need to be paved.
3.02      The highway network is administratively divided into four classes:
Class I roads connecting the Republics, Provinces or important economic cen-
ters; Class II roads interconnecting regions within Republics or Provinces;
Class III roads serving communes within the regions; and Class IV roads
which are local roads. The Federation determines the Class I roads, which
include the European network roads ("E" roads); the Republics and Provinces
determine the Class II and III roads; and the communes the Class IV roads.
B. Road Transport
3.03      Between 1967 and 1972 both the number of vehicles and traffic on
the network (in vehicles miles) doubled. Most of the vehicle fleet increase
was taken up by domestic production. In 1967, domestic production of cars
was about equal to imports, but in 1972 domestic production was triple the



-5-
number of imports whereas exports remained about the same (Tables 6 and 7).
Motorization in the regions varies greatly according to their state of de-
velopment (Slovenia, the most developed: 11 inhabitants per car; Kosovo,
the least developed: 110 inhabitants per car).
C. Highway Administration
3.04      Because of the decentralized nature of Government, highway admin-
istration is concentrated in the Republics acnd Provinces (para. 2.03). The
Federal Government regulates road usage (vehicle dimensions, axle loading,
traffic regulations, etc.) and the geometric standards of Class I roads.
It also deals with the international aspects of highway administration.
3.05      At the Republic and Provincial level, responsibility for highway
administration lies with Road Funds and Road Councils or with Road Enterprises
(Serbia, Kosovo). The Board members of the Funds and Councils, who represent
political, professional and economic interests, receive their mandate from the
Republic or Provincial governments. The Funds and Councils are responsible for
the planning, design, construction and maintenance of all Class I-III roads.
However, their degree of autonomy, staffing and responsibilities differ.
Road Funds normally have a large staff and are directly involved in highway
planning, project preparation and construction supervision. Road Councils are
normally subordinated to the Secretariats for Economy and have a limited staff;
while they do some planning, their main function is supervision of road mainte-
nance, which is carried out by specialized road maintenance enterprises (para.
3.12).
3.06      Coordination among the Road Organizations is provided through the
C.R.O. which was founded in 1971 with representatives from each of the Re-
public and Provincial Road Organizations. It provides a centralized orga-
nization which discusses problems of mutual interest and coordinates technical
and economic efforts for the road system. Although it has limited authority
in formulating policy or establishing plans for road transport, since these
must be approved within each Republic and Province, it does consolidate the
development of road programs for the Republics and Provinces and recently
published the highway Middle-Term Plan 1971-1975. The C.R.O. has also pro-
visionally accepted guidelines for preparing road feasibility studies for-
mulated with technical assistance provided under the Fifth Highway Project.
These guidelines will provide a uniform method for the planning of road proj-
ects based on economic criteria.
3.07      The C.R.O. is also active in standardizing of engineering design
and other matters of common interest. As a result of the Council's activi-
ties, data collection on traffic densities and vehicle axle loading will be
carried out uniformly within the country with standardized engineering equip-
ment, purchased under the Fifth Highway Project.



-6-
D. Highway Planning and Pinancing
3.08      Highway plans are made by the Republics and Autonomous Provinces
and can only be consolidated into a national program, with their consent,
through the C.R.0. Planning has been based on five-year periods; the pres-
ent 1971-1975 Middle-Term Plan will be followed by a 1976-1980 Highway Plan
now being prepared.  Because little authority has been delegated to the C.R.0.,
present planning methods do not lead to an overall highway program based on
uniform-economic criteria and reasonably firm financial resources. Internal
allocation of resources must be improved and a sound basis should be provided
for future highway investments.  Daring loan negotiations, the Bank obtained
assurances from the Government that uniform guidelines will be used for the
preparation of future road projects.for the major highway network and that the
studies for future road projects for the major highway network will be
screened by a competent institution in accordance with the guidelines. This,
together with coordinated planning by the Republics and Provinces (para. 2.10),
should improve the preparation of future highway projects.
3.09      Highway expenditures have increased steadily over the last decade
(Table 8).  The Federal Government' s role in highway financing has been phas-
ing out since 1970 when it was decided that the Federation should cease its
participation and only carry out obligations under previous commitments. The
main-source earmarked,for highway1financing is revenue.from-road taxes on
fuel amounting to about 20% of the sale price for gasoline and diesel oil
in 1972.  Road taxes on fuel, together with license fees and taxes paid by
foreign motorists.on entering Yu1goslavia, amounted to about 45%-of total high-
way expendltures:in 1972.  The balance was made.up of IBRD and domestic loans,
the Federal Fund for Less Developed -Regions, and contributions by the Republics,
Provinces and Communes (Table 10).
3.10      Expenditures for highway,maintenance in 1972 were about 23% of
total highway expenditures (Table 9), or about US$1,300 per km for the high-
way network maintained by the Republics and Provinces.  This amount should
suffice if the present paving program of macadam roads.is continued.
3.11      Road user charges from fuel taxes in.excess of 18%, which is the
normal turnover tax, were about Din 3.5 billion in 1972. Vehicle license
fees were about Din 0.5 billion, raising the total road user charges for
1972 to about Din 4 billion. This covered the highway expenditures for that
year. Whereas part of the fuel taxes is already earmarked for financing of
road construction and maintenance, the C.R.0. advocates that all revenues
from:fuel taxes be earmarked for highway expenditures to provide a sound
financial basis for highway planning. The level of road user revenues which
should be allocated to highway investment is under review by the Republics
and Provinces.



-7-
E. Highway Design, Construction and Maintenance
3.12      Preinvestment studies and detailed engineering are normally awarded
to domestic consulting firms and economic institutes. International competi-
tive bidding for Bank projects is practised, however, domestically financed
construction is normally awarded to construction enterprises on the basis of
competitive bidding on unit price contracts and road maintenance is carried
out by enterprises under negotiated contracts with the Road Funds or Road
Councils.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      The project consists of:

Total               150.8 km
4.03      All sections are included in the 1971-1975 Middle-Term Plan (para.
3.06). They consist at present of 4-5 m wide water-bound macadam (crushed
stone) roads with generally poor geometric characteristics, except for the
Rogatica-Ustipraca section where there is no existing road over a length of



12 km. The base and the macadam..surface course of these roads have become
.inadequate for the present .heavy..and fast.motor-traffic and maintenance is
.difficult:because of the-relatively high.traffic densities-during the.sumaer.
XThe new:roads would, therefore, Dbe provided with .an. asphaltic-concrete sur-
face course. For some roads:stage construction would be applied by strength-
ening the asphalt surface course in 1985 with additional asphalt overlays.
The paving would favorably affect the environment of built-up areas along
the roads by providing a dust-free:riding surface. Further details of the
road sections are given::in Annexes-.2 and 3.
C. Design Standards and Engineering
4.04      The design ..characteristics of the project roads (Table 11) reflect
their classification (all Class I, except Gornji Vakuf-Prozor, which is
Class II) and the terrain traversed by them. The engineering&was carried
out by competent Yugoslav engineeri,ngconsulting.firms (Traser,.Ipsa and
Project, all- from Sarajevo) and the Road Institute from Belgrade, under
:,supervision of the Road Fund of Bosnia-.Herzegovina. The engineering has
-been entirely completed except for the detailed engineering of structures
(bridges,.and tunnels) on the Rogatica-Ustipraca section.  Bids' for this
.section will be invited on the basis of unit prices for quantities deter-
mined from.the preliminary design of structures or on the basis of a lump
sum for the structures with the detailed design to be undertaken by the
successful bidders.
D. Staff.Training
4.05      Under the Fifth Highway Project, training has been provided abroad
for selected staff of the Road Organizations and associated institutes (mainly
from universities and consulting firms). The training program provides for
the updating of engineers in highly specialized fields and provides economists
with training in transportation-and in the preparation of feasibility studies.
This program started late due to Government administrative delays (Annex 1)
but,is now progressingivell. The program is supervised by the C.R.O. and
will be completed in September 1976. During appraisal, the C.R.O. requested
that this program be continued under the proposed Sixth Highway Project,
mostly for economists and possibly for a few engineers, mainly to obtain ex-
pertise in highway planning and in carrying out highway feasibilility studies.
Also, at the C.R.O.'s request, about 12 man-months of professional services
in transportation planning and economics will be provided by expatriate ex-
perts in Yugoslavia. About 9 man-months will be used for on the job-training
through reviewing feasibility studies and about 3 man-months for seminars and
briefing.
4.o6.    During negotiations, a program, setting out the number of candidates,
their training period and the estimated costs was discussed and agreed with
the Government.

E. Engineering Equipment
4.07      Further to engineering equipment already supplied under the Fifth
Highway Project, the Republics and Autonomous Provinces need additional en-
gineering equipment for the preparation and supervision of highway projects,
particularly for soils laboratories and for photogrammetric mapping. During
negotiations, a list of engineering equipment was discussed and agreed with
the Government.
F. Cost Estimates
4.08      The cost of the project is estimated as follows:

4.09      The cost estimate for construction is based on quantities resulting
from the consultants' final design, except for the quantities for structures
for the Rogatica-Ustipraca section which are based on the consultants' prelim-
inary design (para. 4.04) and on unit rates at the time of bidding (April
1974). The cost estimates for staff training and for engineering equipment
were discussed and agreed with the Government during negotiations.
4.10      A 10% quantity contingency for construction is for unforeseen works
such as extra earth work quantities that may be required to clear up or pre-
vent landslides, construction of extra drainage facilities where the need be-
comes apparent during construction, and accommodation of minor modifications
in the pavement design if warranted by the results of soil tests during cons-
truction. The 10% quantity contingency for staff training covers a possible
increase in the training periods or the number of trainees if this would be
found justified during execution of the training program. The price contin-
gency for construction of 25% on local and foreign costs is based on projected
price increases of 18% for 1974, 15% for 1975 and 12% for 1976 and thereafter,
and a construction period of about 2.5 years. The price contingency for
staff training reflects a projected increase on local and foreign costs of
12% for 1974 and thereafter and an execution period from the fall of 1974 to
mid-1977. There is no quantity contingency for the engineering equipment;
its price contingency of 14% is based on a delivery in the second half of 1975.
4.11      The foreign exchange component of the project is estimated at
US$22.5 million, i.e. 37% of the total project cost. The foreign exchange
component of the construction cost, including contingencies is about 36%
if construction contracts are won by local firms as is expected. All con-
struction contracts under the previous five Bank-financed highway projects
were won by local firms, except for a contract comprising a long tunnel
under the Fifth Highway Project which is being carried out by a joint venture
of a Yugoslav and an Italian firm. The local cost of staff training relates
mainly to the training provided in Yugoslavia. The engineering equipment
would be purchased abroad, its local cost represents import duties and handling
charges.
G. Project Financing
4.12      The proposed loan of US$30.0 million would finance 49% of construc-
tion costs, which includes US$7.5 million of the local costs of construction
(20% of the total local costs) and contingencies; and the foreign costs of
staff training and engineering equipment and their contingencies. The
balance of the local costs (US$30.0 million of which about US$6.5 million
for taxes and duties) would be borne mostly by the Road Fund of Bosnia-
Herzegovina. About US$0.4 million of local costs, relating to staff training
and to the equipment procurement, would be borne by the concerned Road
Organizations of the Republics and Provinces. The Republic of Bosnia-
Rerzegovina has indicated that the investment law authorizing constru.ction



- 12 -
of the project road sections has been enacted. This was confirmed during
negotiations.  A condition of loan effectiveness will be that the Government
of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina shall have passed a guarantee to
cover the financing of the project road sections, including any cost
overruns.
4.13      The loan would be made to the Republic Road Fund of Bosnia-Herzegovina
(the Road Fund) with tne Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as guarantor.
As an agency of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina the Road Fund is
responsible for all public roads in the Republic, except for communal roads.
The Road Fund operates within a five-year highway program and financing plan.
which needs the approval of the Republic Assembly. Annual work programs are
made on the basis of the available financial resources which consist of ear-
marked fuel taxes, budgetary support from the Republic, contributions from
the Federal Fund for Less Developed Regions, loans and contributions from
communes and industrial or commercial enterprises. The Road Fund is managed
by a Managing Board of 18 members and a director who is assisted by 140 staff
members (see Annex 4 "Organization Chart"). The Road Fund has participated
in Bank Loans 485-YU and 678-YU. Except for some delay in expropriation
procedures under Loan 678-YU, the Road Fund has performed satisfactorily and
its management is competent.
4.14      The proceeds allocated from staff training and purchase of engineer-
ing and laboratory equipment will be relent to the participating Road Organiza-
tions of the Republics and Provinces through a single Relending Agreement.
The execution of a satisfactory Relending Agreement by the Road Fund will be
a condition of loan effectiveness. The Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia had agreed to guarantee the loan.
H. Execution
4.15      During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Road Fund of
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be the executing agent for the project, and that the
C.R.O. will be designated as coordinator for the staff training program and
for procurement of engineering equipment as a continuation of its role under
the Fifth Highway Project.
4.16      Road construction contracts are based on unit prices and will be
awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines. Subject to being prequalified, bidders were allowed to bid for
one or more highway sections and contracts will be awarded on the basis of
the lowest evaluated bid for any possible combinations of sections. The Bank
has approved the prequalification procedures and the recommendations of the
Road Fund of Bosnia-Herzegovina for prequalification of contractors. Con-
struction contracts are scheduled to be awarded in June 1974 and all sections
should be completed by early 1977. Construction supervision will be carried
out by the Road Fund of Bosnia-Herzegovina, assisted by personnel from uni-
versities and consulting firms for the testing of materials. This arrangement
has proven satisfactory under previous Bank-financed highway projects.



- 13 -
4.17      The staff training program should start in the fall of 1974 and
be completed by mid-1977. The engineering and laboratory equipment will be
procured through international competitive bidding, to the extent practical.
The equipment is not manufactured locally. The detailed procurement proce-
dures were discussed and agreed with the Borrower at negotiations. There are
no preferential trade treaties in force in Yugoslavia.
I. Disbursements
4.18      The proceeds of the proposed Bank Loan would finance:
(i) 49% of all civil works contracts;
(ii) the foreign exchange costs of staff training; and
(iii)  the cif cost of imported engineering equipment.
Any surplus funds remaining in the loan account at completion of the project
will be used for the purchase of additional engineering equipment oi staff
training as agreed between the Borrower and the Bank.
4.19      A schedule of cumulative quarterly disbursements is shown in Annex
5, assuming that the loan would be effective by November 1974.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. The Highway Sections
5.01      All project roads are located in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is one
of the lesser developed regions of Yugoslavia with a per capita income of
about US$470 and a population of 3.7 million. The roads are part of inter-
regional transport routes and serve areas of high industrial and agricultural
activity and population density. Because of their inter-regional character
the roads will benefit long distance as well as local traffic. The important
commodities that would be affected by the improved roads are raw and processed
agricultural goods, fuels, chemicals, wood and wood products and construction
materials. Because the transport enterprises are highly competitive, generally
well-managed and operated for profit, the transport cost savings from the
proposed project improvements will be passed on to farmers, manufacturers,
consumers, and passengers. The conditions and characteristics of the existing
road sections are described in Annexes 2 and 3.
5.02      Present and forecasted traffic on each of the six project sections
is indicated in Table 12. Traffic forecasts for cars and buses are based on
past traffic trends; origin and destination studies; expected population and
income growth; and for trucks also on growth of total commodity production
in the influence area of the project highways (Annex 6). The project roads
are sections of major routes of which the remaining lengths are currently



- 14 -
being improved by the Government (para. 1.01). The estimated opening year
traffic on the project sections includes traffic resulting from the adjacent
improvements as well as traffic diverted from alternative routes because of
their low standard and limited capacity. Estimated traffic growth on the
various project sections ranges from 5% to 7Z p.a. including generated traf-
fic. These growth rates are conservative when compared with the trends for
the same roads from 1963 to 1972, which range from 7% to 27% with a median
of 15% p.a. These earlier high growth rates reflect the rapid development
of road transport caused by a more liberal transport policy during the 1960's
(paras. 2.07-2.08). However, road transport is expected to grov more slowly
in the future since it appears a leveling of freight and passenger transport
among the competing modes will be achieved in the next few years (pira. 2.08).
The traffic growth rates for the project sections reflect this situation.
5.03      The Road Fund of Bosnia-Herzegovina evaluated alternative solutions
for the improvement of the project sections such as reconstructing the existing
road, constructing a new one, stage construction (including pavement thickness)
and the use of tunnels where applicable. For each section the most economical
solution was selected. New construction was, in some cases, found to be more
economical than rehabilitation of existing roads, mainly because of poor hori-
zontal and vertical alignment, inadequate road foundation and/or the high cost
of widening in heavily settled areas.
5.04      With the exception of the road sections Dalina Kosa-Kupres and Gorni
Vakuf-Prozor, the project sections are either parallel to railroads or provide
transport service to the same termini as the railroads. Improvement of these
road sections is not expected to significantly divert traffic from the rail-
ways which specialize in bulk cargo and long distance passenger traffic.
5.05      The economic benefits attributed to the project road improvements
only take into account savings in vehicle operating costs, road maintenance
costs of macadam versus asphaltic concrete, and occupants' time for passenger
cars on work trips.  Time saved by drivers and passengers in cars on non-work
trips and by all passengers in buses, possible reduction in accident rates,
and the greater comfort of travelling on the new roads have not been considered.
The expected unit savings in vehicle operating costs (Table 13), ranging from
4% to 34% for passenger cars and from 16% to 552 for buses and trucks, repre-
sent the difference between the costs on new roads and on the existing ones
without any improvement. The unit savings would be achieved in the year when
the new roads are opened for traffic. Higher unit savings in later years, as
congestion on the existing roads increases, have not been taken into account.
5.06      Based on the most probable estimates of construction costs, vehicle
operating costs, base year traffic and traffic growth, the proposed improve-
ments of the project road sections would produce economic returns (ER's)
ranging from 14% to 31%. Exclusion of time savings for drivers and passengers
of private cars would have no significant effect on the ER's. First year
returns would be 10% or higher for all sections except two, Doboj-Gracanica
and Gracanica-Lukavac, each of which would produce 9% returns. In view of
the conservative estimate of benefits and the national significance of these
sections in the road system, their immediate construction is justified.



- 15 -
5.07      To check the effect of unfavorable circumstances, a sensitivity test
was made on the assumption that construction costs would increase by 15%. Under
these conditions, the ER's would range from 11% to 26%. Since the benefits
were basically conservatively estimated, no sensitivity test was made for a
reduction in benefits. The above ER's indicate the proposed improvements of
the project road sections would be well justified. The ER's and first year
returns for each section are in Table 14 and the basic data and assumptions
used in the economic evaluation are in Annex 6.
5.08      Consideration has been given to the effect of the energy crisis on
the project roads. Reductions in vehicle operating costs due to the proposed
improvements indicate that the overall vehicle fuel consumption would be re-
duced by some 10,000 m tons in the first year of the roads' opening. Further,
each 10% increase in fuel price since mid-1973 would increase vehicle operat-
ing cost savings by about 3% but increase road construction costs by only 1.2%,
thereby increasing the ER for the section.
B. Other Project Elements
5.09      Benefits were not quantified for the training of transportation
economists and road engineers or the purchase of engineering and laboratory
equipment. They are considered justified since they will permit increased
efficiency in highway planning and administration and in the necessary im-
provement, expansion, and maintenance of the highway network.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, the Bank obtained a number of assurances from
the Government of Yugoslavia the most important of which are:
(a)  that it will take appropriate steps to coordinate:  (i) the
preparation of the next five-year program of major highways
among the Republics and Provinces (para. 2.10), and (ii) the
planning and investments among transport modes (para. 2.10);
(b) that arrangements satisfactory to the Bank will be made for:
(i) the use of uniform guidelines for the preparation of
future road projects for the major highway network
(para. 3.08); and
(ii) the screening of studies for future road projects for
the major highway network by a competent institution
in accordance with the guidelines in (i) above (para. 3.08).



- 16 -
6.02      Conditions of loan effectiveness are that:
(a)  the Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina shall
have passed the guarantee to cover the financing of the
project road sections (para. 4.12); and
(b) the Borrower shall have executed a Relending Agreement satis-
factory to the Bank (para. 4.14).
6.03      With the assurances indicated above, the project is a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$30.0 million to the Road Fund of the Socialist Republic
of Bosnia-Herzegovina for a 23-year term, including 3-1/2 years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF
A SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
Transportation Projects Previously Financed by the Bank
1.        The Bank has lent US$364.4 million to the transport sector, includ-
ing US$150 million for five highway projects, US$155 million for three rail-
way projects, and US$59.4 million for the Naftagas project.
2.        Each Republic and Province has received Bank loan funds for high-
way development. The first highway project (Loan 344-YU, US$35 million) was
approved in 1963 and the second (Loan 485-YU US$10 million) in 1967, they
were completed within the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules.
The third project (Loan 608-YU, US$30 million) was approved in 1969 and the
road sections are now open for traffic, although the closing date had to be
postponed until August 1974 to complete minor remaining road works. The
fourth (Loan 678-YU, US$40 million), approved in 1970, is being implemented
satisfactorily, although with some delays and cost increases due to infla-
tion and foreign exchange rate adjustments. The fifth highway project
(Loan 751-YU, US$35 million), approved in 1971, became effective one year
late due to Government administrative delays. Implementation has been
satisfactory, despite some cost increases due to inflation. The cost
overruns are being covered by additional domestic financing.
3.        The first railway project (Loan 361-YU, US$35 million), approved
in 1963, was substantially completed and operating by 1970.
4.        The second railway project was the 1964 Modernization Program
(Loan 395-YU, US$70 million). This project, originally scheduled for com-
pletion in 1968, has been seriously delayed for several reasons, mainly a
shortage of local funds. The shortage has been caused mainly by depressed
revenues, partly as a result of increased competition from road transport
generated by liberal economic reforms and partly as a result of Federal
Government control of tariffs; and by delays in Government financial sup-
port. In 1971, the Bank commissioned the consulting firm Transmark (GB)
to review the railway situation in depth and to recommend measures for
sound development. The Yugoslav Government agreed to the major recommenda-
tions and the railways have prepared realistic five-year investment and fi-
nancing plans for 1973-77 and detailed action plans for improving their
organization and operations. The Bank ia now appraising a fourth railway
project, which will include the completion of the Modernization Program by
the end of 1976. The railways are expected to become financially and eco-
nomically viable by the end of the plan period.

5.        The third railway loan, approved in 1968 (Loan 531-YU, US$50 mil-
lion), was due for completion in 1973, but construction difficulties in
mountainous terrain are expected to delay operation until the end of 1975.
The cost estimate has increased, resulting in a financing gap of US$40 mil-
lion.  The Yugoslav authorities have the necessary finances in hand for
1974 and part of 1975, and the balanee will be secured in 1974.
6.        The Naftagas pipeline projE.ct (Loan 916-YU, US$59.4 million) was
approved in June 1973 and has become effective on YNrch 22, 1974.

Description of Project Roads
Bosanski Novi - Prijedor (31.1 km)
1.        rhis section is part of the Bosanski Novi-Banja Luka-Doboj-Tuzla-
Zvornik road which runs parallel with and about 50 km south of the Zagreb-
Belgrade expressway. The existing road was constructed at the end of the
last century and its horizontal and vertical alignment reflect the military
requirements of that period, since the region was in the border area of the
then prevailing Austro-Hungarian Government. Near Bosanski Novi the road
is flooded almost every year during high river levels forcing traffic de-
tours of about 50 km. The new road would be raised in low-lying areas, and
by realigning about 10 km, its horizontal alignment would, for the greater
part run parallel to an existing railroad. The numerous crossings between
the old road and the railroad would be avoided by locating the new road on
only one side of the railroad. The design of the 7 m wide pavement was
based on stage construction whereby an overlay of 4 cm asphaltic conierete
would be required by 1985. The section would provide a much needed all-
weather road for the inhabitants (approximately 620,000) in its zone of
influence. The road system of which this project section is a part also
links the Republics of Croatia and Serbia with Bosnia-Herzegovina and is
the main longitudinal traffic road in the northern part of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Traffic estimates for this project section in 1972 were 380 vehicles per day.
Traffic has increased at some 17% p.a, since 1963. Savings in vehicle op-
erating costs will yield a 16% rate of return on the proposed investment.
Doboj-Tuzla (56.0 km)
2.        This section is also part of the major Bosanski Novi-Banja Luka-
Doboj-Tuzla-Zvornik link. The existing road has been asphalted over a length
of 14 km near Tuzla; the rest has a macadam surface course. The new 7 m wide
road would generally follow the existing road, but the horizontal curves and
the vertical alignment would be improved and 4 km would be completedly re-
aligned. The riding surface of the new road would consist of 3 cm asphaltic
concrete, which would be reinforced with an overlay over 14 km near Tuzla
by 1985. The existing road over this 14 km subsection would continue to be
used to accommodate the heavy traffic.
3.        Traffic counts taken in 1972 at various stations ranged from 470
to 6,300 ADT, and this traffic is expected to grow approximately 7% p.a.
Because of this range of traffic, the road was divided into four sections
for analysis:  Doboj-Gracanica (18.0 km); Gracanica-Lukavac (28,0 km)-
Lukavac-Sicki Brod (5.0 km); and Sicki Brod-Tuzla (5.0 km).  Savings in



ANNEX 3
Page: 2
vehicle operating costs only would yield the following rates of return:
Doboj-Gracanica section 14%; Gracanica-Lukavac section 13%; Lukavac-Sicki
Brod section 23%; and the Sicki Brod-Tuzla section 17%. The weighted
average economic return for all sections is 15%.
4.        Modernization of this road would reduce vehicle operating costs
and road maintenance costs and would benefit truck farming and tourismp as
well as such industries as logging, construction, beverage, chemical, wood
and metal products.
Dalina Kosa-Kupres (12.6 km)
5.        This section is the only part of the road leading from Bugojno
to Split which has not yet been asphalted. The new road, which would partly
follow the existing road, would improve and shorten by 3.7 km the passage
over a mountain saddle at 1,350 m above sea level by a 300 m tunnel, thus
avoiding the very curvy alignment of the old road at the mountain crossing.
The existing mountain crossing is often closed for several days in winter
by snow drifts. A much more reliable crossing would therefore be secured
through the tunnel section. The new road would have a 6 m paved width and
a 3 cm asphaltic concrete surface course designed to require an overlay
after about 10 years of service,
6,        This section is linked by asphalt roads in the east, north and
west to the cities of Sarajevo, Banja Luka (Beograd and Zagreb) and Bihac,
and to Split in the south. Its improvement would reduce transport costs
for agricultural products originating in its zone of influence as well as
those for tourism and local industries. The traffic in 1972 was estimated
at 657 vehicles per day; benefits from savings in vehicle operating costs
would yield a rate of return of 20%.
GorjVakuf-Prozor (20.8 kmn)
7.        This section is the final, unasphalted part of the Bugojno-
Jablanica road. Because of a new alignment, the new road would shorten
the distance from Gornji Vakuf to Prozor from 26.3 km to 20.8 km and its
highest point would be 850 m above sea level instead of 1,100 m for the
existing road. The new road's lower elevation and a 310 m tunnel passage
at the highest point would reduce the amount of snow clearing required,
and closures would be for shorter durations. The new road, which would
be Class II (para. 3.02), would have a 6 m paved width. A 3 cm asphaltic
concrete overlay is scheduled for 1985.
8.        When complete, the section would handle an important volume of
through traffic from the Central Highway in the north to Mostar, a major
agricultural center in the southwest, and other areas in the south. Traf-
fic estimates for 1972 were 1,640 vehicles per day and the growth rate has
been some 27% p.a. since 1963. Because of the poor terrain on the existing
alignment and the distance (26.3 km), an alternative to its reconstruction
was also considered. A comparison of the two alternatives shows a rate of



ANNEX 3
Page 3
return on the proposed investment of 33% for reconstruction of the existing
alignment, and 31% for new construction. The difference between the two
rates is small and an analysis of incremental costs and benefits required
for new construction gives a 27% rate of return, Construction of the new
road on a new alignment would also reduce present roadside friction caused
by animal-drawn vehicles which would mostly continue to use the old road;
add considerably to the safety on the road; and avoid congestion in peak
periods. Given the dominance of transit traffic over the proposed project
section, new construction is recommended, The existing road would continue
to service the local villages and would carry about 300 motor and animal-
drawn vehicles per day.
Vranduk-Zenica (12.2 km)
9.        The Vranduk-Zenica section of the D)boj-Zenica road (75.2 km) is
still to be asphalted; of the remainder, 21 kin is complete, 30 km nearly
complete and 12 km under construction, all financed by Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The present length of 20.4 km would be shortened to 12.2 km through the
building of two tunnels, with lengths of 1,044 m and 419 m. The road
would follow a new alignment along the Bosna River, whereas the existing
road would remain on the other riverbank to ierve local traffic. At the
entrance to the urban area of Zenica, the new road would connect directly
with the beginning of the Zenica-Sarajevo road, being constructed under the
Bank's fourth highway project. The 7 m wide paved new road has been designed
to require a 3 cm asphaltic concrete overlay by 1985.
10.       This section is also a part of the road system which, when com-
pleted, will link the Central and Adriatic Highways. Zenica, aside from
being a crossroad for transit traffic, is the most important industrial
center of the region. Traffic on this section in 1972 was estimated at
1,071 vehicles per day. Improving the road from macadam to asphaltic con-
crete would reduce vehicle operating costs and provide a rate of return of
21% on the proposed investment,
Rogatica-Ustipraca (18.1 km)
11.       This section is part of the road link leading eastwards from
Sarajevo to the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro. The road from Sarajevo
to Rogatica (73 km) will be reconstructed over 58 km by early 1974. From
Rogatica the new road would follow for the first 6 km an existing macadam
road along a river valley and then follow a new alignment parallel to an
existing narrow gauge railway from Sarajevo to Ustipraca. The railway is
located in the canyon of the Praca River where, because of instability
of the side slopes, frequent changeovers are required from one riverbank
to the other. An alternative alignment avoids the river canyon and leads
over a mountain plateau at 700 m above sea level. This alternative align-
ment would lead through large areas of unstable slopes and would involve
gradients between 5% and 6% over 11.2 km, whereas the unstable side slopes
in the river alignment are more narrowly defined and gradients between 5%
and 6% occur only over 0.8 km, Construction costs of the alternatives are
approximately the same. The canyon alternative has been selected because



ANNEX 3
Page 4
slope instability occurs over a shorter length and because the canyon sec-
tion will in future be part of a more direct road link from Sarajevo, via
Pale, to Ustipraca.  This road, which has a macadam surface from Pale on-
wards, leads to Ustipraca via a detour over a passroad to Gorazde. The
detour can be avoided by connecting the improved Sarajevo-Pale-Ustipraca
road with the canyon section. The Government has given priority to the
improvement of the Sarajevo-Rogatica-Ustipraca road over the Sarajevo-Pale-
Ustipraca road because the former services agricultural regions with good
development potential and because of the high construction costs of the
latter road. It is expected that funds for the road via Pale will not be
available before the late seventies and until then the Sarajevo-Rogatica-
Ustipraca road will serve as the main connection between Sarajevo End Ustipraca.
12.       The region served by the proposed road section has achieved a rela-
tively high rate of economic growth, but its potential is hampered by an
underdeveloped transport infrastructure. The area is largely devoted to
agriculture and some small-scale industry and is served by an antiquated
road and railway system. The poor condition and terrain features of the
existing road system combine to create very high vehicle operating costs.
Construction of a new road would not only benefit local traffic but would
also open up the area for through traffic to important markets in the east,
including Nis and Belgrade. The estimated economic return is 16%.

Basic Data and Assumptions Used in
Economic Evaluation
Economic Costs of Road Works
1.        These costs cover right-of-way, construction, including the costs
of additional asphalt overlays for some roads in 1985 (net of taxes), and
supervision.
Traffic Growth Rates (1976-1995)

/1   Traffic diversions from this section to competing roads being proposed
for construction depress total projected traffic, giving an overall
growth rate of 5% for all traffic.
Travel Time Savings
3.        For trucks and buses, these savings are based on average wages of
professional drivers and their assistants. A 60% efficiency factor for
trucks and 70% for buses has been applied to the average wages to reflect
the estimated utilization of these vehicles in the economy. For passenger
cars, time savings have been calculated only for work trips. It was assumed
that 15% of passenger cars were on work trips and that each car averaged
1.5 occupants. The countrywide average hourly wage (18 DIN) was assumed to
reflect this cost to the economy and to estimate time saving benefits re-
sulting from increased average speeds.
Vehicle Operating Cost Savings
4.        These savings are based on:  running costs (net of taxes) for such
items as fuel, lubrication, and tires; the cost of maintenance and repairs;
and vehicle depreciation, before and after improvement of project roads.
