I.INTRODUCTION


1.       This Project Paper seeks the approval o fthe Executive Directors to provide an additional
grant in the amount o f US$50 million equivalent to the Democratic Republic o f Congo (DRC)
for the Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project (EDRP) (H-089; P078658,
P105729).

2.        The proposed additional grant would help finance costs associated with the completion
o f EDRP demobilization and reintegration activities in the face o f cost overruns (see paragraph
14 below). There are no changes to the Project, other than the replacement o f the Government
implementing agency, Commission Nationale de DCsarmement, De'mobilisation et Re'inte'gration
(CONADER), with new implementation arrangements inorder to address past management and
capacity issues.

3.        Given the DRC's pivotal role in recent internecine conflicts in the region, failure to
complete the EDRP's objectives could result in significant deterioration o f the security situation
inthe DRC andthe region, with allthe attendant negativeeconomic andhumanimpacts. Forthis
reason, the Government has requested additional financing to complete the Project's objectives.

4.        The African Development Bank has approved parallel fimding in the amount o f US$22
million equivalent.     This financing has cross-conditions with the International Development
Association (IDA) Project requiring that a Project implementation entity acceptable to the
Association i s established.


11.BACKGROUND RATIONALEFORADDITIONAL FINANCING
                    AND

5.        Country context. The DRC was caught in a vicious cycle o f poor governance, poverty,
and violent conflict throughout the 1990s. Since 2000, considerable progress has beenmade to
restore peace and security, but the situation remains very volatile inNorth and South %vu. On
the 23'd o f January2008, 13 fighting groups signedan agreement to disarm andjoin the army or
demobilize following a peace conference held in Goma with the support o f the international
community. Steps are being taken for the implementation o f this agreement; however, the
situation in the two Kivu provinces remains extremely volatile, foreign armed forces are still
active in DRC, and new pockets are emerging in the Bas Congo. Fears o f violence continue to
result in the displacement o f thousands o f people, further underscoring concerns about the
fragility o fnational security.

6.        Economic growth i s at about six percent a year and there is a relatively stable, if fragile,
macroeconomic situation, but government resources are still too limited to meet the urgentneeds
o f its citizens - about 75 percent o f the Congolese population live on less than US$1 per day and
social indicators are among the worst in Sub-Saharan Africa, creating a potentially explosive
social situation. The 2006 democratic elections o f the President, Parliament, and provincial
authorities now present a unique window o f opportunity for the World Bank to support the DRC
in consolidating and expanding peace and development gains while attenuating the risk of
renewed conflict.



                                                   6

7.      Project description. The objectives o f the EDRP are to help consolidate peace and
promote economic stability and sustainable development inthe DRC and the regionthrough:

        0  Demobilization o f up to an estimated 150,000 ex-combatants and provision o f
           reintegration support duringtheir transition to civilian life; and
        0  To promote the reallocation o f Government expenditure from military to social and
           economic sectors.

8.      The Government's National Program on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reinsertion
(PNDDR) originally implemented disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR)
activities through its agency, CONADER, which has now been replaced by a new
implementation unit. EDRP activities have been funded by an IDA grant o f approximately
US$lOO million (SDR68.1 million) (H-089), approved by the Board on May 25, 2004, which
became effective on November 9, 2004. A parallel Multi-country Demobilization and
Reintegration Program (MDRP) Trust Fund grant (TF054242) for US$lOO million became
effective at the same time as the IDA grant. The EDRP grant closing date has been extended
from March31,2008 to September 30,2008.

9.      Project performance. Despite some implementation issues, the EDRP has performed
strongly, successfully completing most activities and fulfilling the majority o f key performance
indicators presented in the original Memorandum and Recommendation o f the President (see
Annex 2).      This i s a remarkable achievement, given the significant obstacles faced by the
Project. The DRC i s a large country, and characterized by poor and inadequate transportation
andcommunications infrastructure. Insecurity and anuncertainpolitical atmosphere added to the
challenges o f implementinga Project o f such magnitude in one o f the most complex transitional
political environments inAfrica.

10.     Inspite ofthedifficult implementationenvironment, CONADER, withthe support ofthe
international community, succeeded inestablishing 18 demobilization sites and 26 provincial and
community offices. Since Project inception, more than 102,000 adult ex-combatants have been
demobilized and almost 30,000 child soldiers released from armed groups. By the end o f 2005,
CONADER had put in place the national strategic framework for the provision o f socio-
economic opportunities for ex-combatants.      By September 2006, CONADER had signed 45
contracts with UN agencies and NGOs to provide reintegration assistance to 69,000 ex-
combatants.     The Project thus continues to make a major contribution to the region's security
environment, facilitating longer term development andpeacebuildingefforts.

11.     The Project i s achieving its development objectives in terms o f demobilization and the
provision o f socio-economic support, but its Implementation Performance Ratings for
Procurement, Special Groups and Program Management are currently rated `Unsatisfactory' due
to substantial management problems experienced within CONADER, mostly related to
procurement. In 2006, IDA undertook a statement o f expenditure review (SOE), a post-
procurement review and an independent procurement review. In addition, a number o f cases
were also investigated by the World Bank Department o f Institutional Integrity (INT). Following
the finalization o f the independent procurement review and SOE, IDA determined that



                                                7

CONADER was responsible for US$6.4 million in either misprocured or ineligible expenses.
The Task Team i s also exercising due diligence for other cases that have emerged from the INT
Report. The risk mitigation measures described elsewhere in this Project Paper incorporate the
lessons o f experience with these matters and will help to ensure that the additional financing
operation implementswithout similar obstacles.

12.      InMay 2007, IDA formally requested the repayment of this amount and established a
schedule o f reimbursement with the Government. As o f March 2008, all amounts have been
repaid.

13.      Mitigation measures aimed at strengthening fiduciary arrangements including: (i)       the
maximum balances permitted in the Project's four Designated Accounts were significantly
reduced (all o f them are now below $500,000); (ii)    Task Team members carry out prior review
o f all requests for Designated Account replenishment; and (iii)    the terms o f reference o f the
international accounting and management firm were expanded to include all procurement and
financial management duties.

14.      InFebruary2007, IDAandtheMDRPdonorsfurthermore agreedthatCONADERwould
be replaced by a new Project management unit within the Ministryo f Defense. The Ministry o f
Defense i s mandated to implement demobilization and army reform and, therefore, to place the
Project under the direct management of this ministry would help to enhance ownership and
eliminate any bureaucratic obstacles. As demobilization and reintegration i s contingent on the
armyreformprocess, previous experience has shownthat bothprocesses require the full backing
andsupport from the Ministry o fDefense.

15.      The Project, as part o f the overall MDRP effort inthe Great Lakes Region, has developed
and is using a comprehensive set o f monitoring and evaluation (M & E) indicators. Those
indicators, applicable to the overall MDRP program, are updated quarterly and made available
on the MDRP website. Other, Project-specific indicators are part o f the regular IDA supervision
and monitoring. The well-trained M & E team from CONADER has been carried over to the
newimplementationunit, ensuring that the same standards o fM& Ewill continue.

16.      Rationale for additionalfinancing. The government i s requesting US$50 million from
IDA in additional financing and US$22 million from the African Development Bank to cover
unexpected cost overruns in the EDRP's demobilization and Project management components
(see Annex 1). As illustrated in Annex 1, air transport costs for demobilized ex-combatants, which
eventually amounted to US$36 million, were originally to be financed by the Government.
However, the Government could not provide these funds and therefore requested them to be
included in the grant financing provided by IDA and the MDRP Trust Fund. This unexpected
cost, together with the prolonged operation o f the demobilization camps led to the Project's
largest cost overruns. In part as a result o f attempting to correct the aforementioned issues,
CONADER's operating costs were also higher than originally budgeted, further contributing to
the overruns.

17.      The Project has committed all available funds and will run out o f money by March 31
2008, the Closing Date o f the Original Grant. The closing date o f the Grant has been extended



                                                  8

untilSeptember 30, 2008 with the expectation that the additional financing will be effective by
that time.

18.     The proceeds o f the additional financing will be used to support the following activities
which were included as part o f the Original Project:

           Demobilization o f combatants;
        0  Reinsertion support to newly demobilised ex combatants;
        0  Reintegration support for demobilized ex-combatants;
        0  Release o f children from armed forces; and
            Specialized support for disabled ex-combatants.

19.     There are substantial security risks to the country and substantial reputational risks for
IDA, if additional financing is not provided. An interruption in funding would halt the DDR
process and leave thousands o f ex-combatants with no viable alternative. Inthe eastern part o f
the DRC this could result involuntary or involuntary participation in armed groups. IDA, AfDB
andother donors couldriskblamefor any resultant instability.

20.     Inorder to addressthe urgencyofthe maintainingpeace inthe country's easternregions,
the Government has asked the Association to provide for the possibility o f retroactive financing
in the amount of US$2.2 million, an amount that corresponds to its counterpart requirement
under the African Development Bank parallel project. The Government has also requested a
US$4.0 million Project Preparation Facility which is being processed (as permitted under OP
8.OO, Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies) for start-up activities relatedto demobilization
efforts in the east under the January 2008 Goma Peace Accord and for the procurement of
essential technical services which will permit the Government to begin implementation o f the
additional financing operation.


111.PROPOSED   CHANGES

21.     N o changes in development objectives are proposed and the Closing Date would be
extended by 21 months, from September 30,2008 to June 30,2010.

22.     The Project's implementation arrangements have been changed to address the
management issues with CONADER. After discussions with IDA, the Government abolished
CONADER in July 2007 and replaced it with a new implementing entity called the Unite'
d'Exe'cution du Programme National de De'sarmernent,De'mobilisation et Reinsertion (UEPN)
under the Ministry o f Defense. A small Project team financed by IDA through the Project, will
be established within the UEPN and defined inthe Financing Agreement. All Project financial
and procurement matters will be handled by an independent international accounting and
management firm, under terms acceptable to IDA, which will also serve as a co-signatory on the
BankDesignated Accounts for the Project.

proposed additional financing i s presented inAnnex 1.

 Iv.CONSISTENCYWITH       THE COUNTRYASSISTANCE         STRATEGY (CAS) OR COUNTRY
 PARTNERSHIPSTRATEGY(CPS)

 24.     The proposed additional financing is consistent with the recently approved CAS (Report
 No. 41474-ZR). This Project helps support the "Promotion o f good governance and
 consolidation o fpeace" pillar inthe government's Poverty Reduction Strategy and this Project i s
 shown inthe CAS list o fproposed IDA operations for FY08.

 v. ECONOMICANALYSISOF         COST OVERRUNOR FINANCING        GAP

 25.     To date, the mean cost per ex-combatant o f the demobilization andreintegration program
 inDRC is approximatelyUS$1,500. This is comparable to other MDRPcountries (e.g., Burundi
 at about US$1,700 and Rwanda at about US$1,400),              especially when considering the
 geographical size o f DRC.      The mean Project cost per ex-combatant under the additional
 financing i s projected to be about US$1,700, which i s higher than under the existing Project
 because: (i) the provisiono f specialized assistanceto handicapped ex combatants (ii) increase

 VI. EXPECTED    OUTCOMES

 26.     The main expected outcomes from the additional financing are as follows:

         0   Demobilize an additional 23,000 combatants andprovide them with Transitional
             Safety Allowances (TSAs)
         0   Provide limitedreintegration support to an estimated 19,000 militia armed group
             membersinthe East o fthe country
         0   Complete socio-economic reintegration support for 40,000 demobilized ex-
             combatants (old case load) and23,000 newly demobilized ex-combatants
         0   Provide reintegrationsupport to 9,000 children from armed forces
         0   Provide specialized support for disabled ex-combatants

  27.    M&E indicators wouldbeas follows:

28.     Inadditionto the M& Eindicators described above, the additional financingwouldhave
the following performance indicators:

        10,000 ex-combatants are demobilized within three months o fthe Effective Date;
    0   By the Closing Date, demobilized disabled ex-combatants are provided with support
        appropriate to their condition;
    0   Sixty percent o f demobilized ex-combatants are engaged in productive economic
        activities (or schooling) within three months o ftheir demobilization; and
    0   Bythe ClosingDate, 80% ofthe children associated with armed forces andarmedgroups
        are successfwlly reintegrated.

29.     Under the additional financing, the Government will also undertake the following:

    0   No later than three months after the Date o f Effectiveness, the Recipient shall have
        entered into a contract satisfactory to the Association for the provision o f care, family
        reunification and reintegration o f about 8,000 children from the Armed Forces and
        Armed Groups.


    0   No later than three months after the Date of Effectiveness, a program for female Ex-
        Combatants, satisfactory to the Association, shall have become effective.

VII. BENEFITSAND RISKS


30.     Benefits for the additional financing remain the same as those stated in the Original
Project documents. First, the Project allows the Government to consolidate the peace process
and its social and economic recovery efforts. The Project is designed to facilitate the process of
returning about 150,000 ex-combatants to productive social and economic life. It has already
helpedto provide an enabling environment for national elections inthe last quarter o f2006.

31.     The Project continues to have significant risks; among the most important o fthese are:

    0   Delays in providing demobilization and reintegration assistance to ex-combatants. This
        may delay the effective implementation o fthe Goma Peace Accord.
    0   Interference o f vested interests to maintain current instability that enables them to
        continue to benefit from exploitation ofnatural resources.
    0   Multiple armed groups continue to destabilize parts o f the DRC, particularly in the
        country's eastern regions, hampering development and raising the possibility o f a return
        to civil or even regional conflict; and
    0   Foreign combatants using the DRC as a base o f operations could create escalating
        politicaVdiplomatic conflicts with neighboring countries.




                                                 11

        The Government's coalition may not allow for the sufficient level o f collective political
        will needed to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to address security and
        development issues inthe DRC.

32.     All theserisks are beingmitigatedbythe support givenbythe international community to
the implementation o f the Goma Peace Accord and the reform o f the security forces. The
additional financing contains funds to address the reintegration o f approximately 19,000 armed
militias in the eastern part o f the DRC. With the new Government anxious to solidify its
mandate, there is a renewed effort to not only finalize the army integratioddemobilization
process but to disarm and reintegrate these new armed groups. IDA i s working closely on this
effort with the Government and other partners, including the UnitedNations OTN). The January
2008 signing o f a peace agreement inthe East, with the full support o f international community,
i s a positive indication that the situation o fthese high-risk groups can be quickly addressed.


VIII. FINANCIAL     MANAGEMENT,       PROCUREMENT,AUDIT AND DISBURSEMENT            ARRANGEMENTS

33.     Summary Risk Analysis (see annex 3). An effective financial management system is vital
for the Project because o f the need to rapidly deliver services to a wide variety o f stakeholders.
The objectives o f the Project's financial management system are to: (i)    ensure that funds are used
only for their intendedpurposes in an efficient and economical way while implementing agreed
activities; (ii)enable the preparation o f accurate and timely financial reports; (iii)   ensure that
funds are properly managed and flow smoothly, rapidly, adequately, regularly and predictably to
implementing agencies; (iv) enable Project management to monitor the efficient implementation
o f the Project; andto (v) safeguard the Project's assets and resources.

34.     To ensure a strong financial management system, the implementing agencies should have
an adequate number and mix o f skilled and experienced staff, the internal control system should
ensure the conduct o f an orderly and efficient payment and procurement process, and proper
recording and safeguarding o f assets and resources. The accounting system should support the
Project's requests for hnding and meet its reporting obligations to fundproviders including IDA
and other donors. The system should also be capable o f providing financial data to measure
performance when linkedto the outputs o f the Project. Lastly, an independent, qualified auditor
shouldbe appointed to reviewthe Project's financial statements andinternal controls.

35.     The risks o f lack o f transparency, corruption and misuse o f funds are high in DRC and
ensuring fiduciary compliance in DRC remains a major concern. Like all other investment
Projects, the Project will be implemented with relatively stringent financial management and
audit arrangements. Moreover, the supervision by the Bankwill be carried out with a mixedteam
o f FM, Procurement, Disbursement and M & E colleagues to verify the use o f resources
(materiality o f expenditures). The fiduciary arrangements are agreed upon with the Borrower and
among them are: (i)     an appropriate financial management system; (ii)      delegating the fiduciary
aspects and procurement responsibilities o f the Project to an international auditing firm (FMA);
(iii) enforcement o f double signature on all payments and withdrawals by the FMA and the
Project Manager; (iv) internal auditing department; (v) prior review by the Bank Task Team of
anyWithdrawal Applications; (vi) bi-annual financial audits covering all expenditures incurred.




                                                    12

36.    Financial management o f the additional financing will follow the improved financial
management and procurement implementation arrangements for the ongoing Project in place
following the implementation o f the action plan. These are considered appropriate by IDA,
having been improved through the implementation o f the action plans prepared by the
Government following the midterm review and the SOE review.               The Interim un-audited
Financial Reports (IFR) is submittedto the Bank regularlyina form and substance that complies
with current IDA Financial Management (FM) requirements.           The last SOE review mission
carried out in September/October 2006 revealed some FM weaknesses and some ineligible
expenditures and misprocurement leading to a Moderately Unsatisfactory FMrating. An action
plan to improve the weaknesses o f the FM system o f the Project has been put in place and
implemented by the Project team. Most o f the issues identified during the mission have been
addressedor are currently being addressed through the new FMand institutional arrangements o f
this additional financing. Inaddition the FMA will provide skilled and experienced staff in the
key FM fbnctions (e.g. financial reporting, treasureddisbursement, financial control and
budgeting).

37.    The Project i s currently recruiting an external auditor, acceptable to IDA, who will carry
out the audit o f the Project. Financial statements o f the Project have been audited every six
months since Effectiveness. The last audit report, for the period endingDecember 31,2006, was
unqualified (clean) but the auditor issued a qualified opinion (except for) on the SOE due to
ineligible expenditures. The audit report for the period endingJune 30, 2007, and which was due
on October 31, 2007, is overdue because o f delays linked to the abolition o f CONADER and the
creation o f the new implementing entity. However, the contracting o f the auditor i s now
underway and the auditor i s expected to commence work inApril 2008. A temporary waiver o f
the audit compliance requirement for additional financing has been given by the Vice Presidents
o f OPCS and CTRVP. Submission to IDA o f the audit (acceptable to the Association) o f the
Financial Statements, for the period ended June 30,2007, is a condition o f Effectiveness.

38.     Disbursements under the Project will be made through two Designated Accounts
denominated inU S dollars and opened in local commercial banks acceptable to the association.
Designated Account A, with an authorized allocation o f U S $ 300,000 equivalent, will be
dedicated to cash payments to ex-combatants, and Designated Account B, with an authorized
allocation o f US $ 500,000 equivalent, will finance eligible expenditures for all other activities
carried out by the Project team. The designated accounts will be audited bi-annually by external
auditors acceptable to IDA as part o f the overall Project audit. An initial advance up to their
respective authorized allocations will be made into each designated account. Subsequent
disbursements from the IDA grant will be Transaction-Based (replenishment, reimbursement)
based on submission o f withdrawal applications and Statement o f Expenditures (SOE). The
Transaction Based disbursement method will be used for the duration o f the Project
implementation period due to the high associated fiduciary risks. The options to use the Direct
Payment and Special Commitment methods are also available to the Borrower. The cash
payments to ex-combatants (TSA) will be handledby a private firm (CELPAY). The contractual
arrangements between the Project team and CELPAY (bank guarantee, payment triggers and
audits etc.) will be specified in the CELPAY contract, in accordance with the Financing
Agreement.




                                                13

39.     Under OP 8.0, inexceptional circumstances, when the borrower's capacity to implement
the needed emergency response activities i s insufficient, the Bank may, at the request o f the
borrower, agree to alternative implementation arrangements for such activities.            These
arrangements may include any public or private entity operating inthe affected territory as well
as UNagencies or programs or other international or national agencies (including NGOs) active
in the country. For this additional financing operation, the Government will use reintegration
services provided by both UN agencies NGOs and a public entity that are already active in the
country (referred to as Strategic Partners).

40.     The Strategic Partners: (i) experts intheir respective fields; (ii) already established
                                   are                                     are
in specific geographical locations; (iii) successfully carried out these activities under the
                                          have
Original Project; and (iv) are the only entities that can accommodate the expected number o f ex-
combatants in specific geographical areas and for specific reintegration activities. Therefore, it
i s expected that the Government will request that they be contracted on a single source selection
basis.

41.     The UN agencies expected to be contracted are: FAO, UNHABITAT and ILO (BIT).
FA0 to provide Agriculture/Animal Husbandry/Fishingreintegration activities in Bas Congo,
Bandundu, Equateur, North Katanga, South Katanga and Kinshasa provinces. UNHABITAT to
provide skill training in Oriental province. I L O (BIT) to provide skills training and income
generating activities in Equateur and Bandundu. Inall instances the Government will submit a
formal request with the rationale for single source contracting.

42.     The NGOs expected to be contracted are: CARITAS, Institut National de PrCparation
Professionnelle (INPP), Association DCveloppement du Kasai Oriental (ADEKOR),                 and
International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH).            CARITAS will provide
Agriculture/Animal Husbandry/Fishing reintegration activities in Kassai Occidental, Kassai
Oriental and Oriental Provinces, Skill Training in Kassai Occidental Province and Income
Generating activities in Kassai Occidental and Oriental Provinces. INPP will provide Skill
Training and Income Generating Activities in Bas Congo and South Katanga Province.
ADEKOR will provide Skill Training and Income Generating Activities in Kassai Oriental
Province. IFESH will provide Skill Training and Income Generating Activities inNorthKatanga
Province.     The public entity Strategic Partner i s Deutsche Gessellschaft fur Technishe
Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), which will provide Skill Training and Income Generating Activities in
Kinshasa province. In all instances the Government will submit a formal request with the
rationale for single source contracting.

43.     All goods and services (other than consultants' services) shall be procured inaccordance
with the provisions o f Section Io f the "Guidelines: Procurement under BRD Loans and IDA
Credits" dated May 2004, revised in October 2006 (the Procurement Guidelines). All
consultants' services shall be procured in accordance with Sections Iand IV o f the "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, revised
inOctober 2006 (the Consultant Guidelines).

44.     Goods, works and transport services required for the project and to be financed out o f
Proceeds o f the Financing shall be procured on the basis o f Shopping. The aggregate estimated



                                                  14

contract amounts under each category are: Goods: US$23,000, Works: US$23,000 andTransport
Services: US$2,000,000 (All Transportation Services contracts below US$100,000 will be post-
reviewed by the Bank every three (3) months). Other methods such as Limited International
BiddingandDirect Contractingmay also beused.

45.     All consultants' services required for the Project may be procured using i)Quality and
Cost Based Selection ii)Selection Based on Consultants' Qualifications iii)Single source
selection iv) Selection o f Individual Consultants or iv) Least Cost Selection. The Approved
Procurement Plan will specify the methods to be used. The aggregate estimated contract amount
under Consultants Services i s US$32,770,000.

46.     As mentioned above (paragraph 36) all procurement under the additional financing
operation will be done by the FMA. IDA will perform post procurement reviews every three
months.

47.     Under the additional financing operation, there will be no amendments or extensions of
existing contracts now in force under the Original Project. All contracts under the additional
financing operation will be new contracts, and the October 2006 version o f "Guidelines:
Procurement under IBRDLoans andIDA Credits" will apply.


IX.SAFEGUARDS

48.     The additional financing operation has been rated Environmental Category C.        The
Project may include small civil works, in which case an Environmental Impact Assessment
would be required to be completed and disclosed to the public before any construction would
start.

49.     An Environmental and Social Management Framework was required under the Original
Project, but was not carried out. Therefore, as agreed with the Africa Regional Environmental
Coordinator, an environmental audit was initiated in February 2008 and will be completed by
April 15th 2008, to document any environmental impact resulting from the Project's past
activities. However, no environmental impact is expected, given that the Original Project works
included only temporary camps that are now dismantled.

x. FINANCIALTERMSAND         CONDITIONS FOR THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING

50.     The IDA additional financing o fUS$50 millionwill be provided as a grant.

51.     The Board condition for the additional financing is:

        0   Fullrepayment o fallmisprocuredor ineligible expenditures (last installment)

52.     The additional financing has the following Effectiveness conditions:
        (a)    The Project team has been established and is operational - including the
               recruitment o fthe project administrator andthe international experts.

                Issuance o fMinisterial Implementing Decree to the ordinance creating the Project
                team satisfactory to IDA.

                A contract with the FMAhasbeen established.

                The Manual o f Financial and Accounting Procedures (MFAP) and the Project
                Implementation Manuel (PIM) have been updated in a manner satisfactory to
                IDA, andadopted bythe Recipient.

                The audit o f Financial Statements, for the period ending June 30,2007, acceptable
                to the Association, has been completed and submittedto IDA.

                The Recipient has employed the independent external auditors referred to in
                Section 4.09 (b) o f the General Conditions, in accordance with the provisions of
                Section I11o f Schedule 2 to this Agreement.

                The Co-financing Agreement with the African Development Bank has been
                executed and delivered and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness or to the
                right o fthe Recipient to makewithdrawals under ithavebeen fulfilled.

53.     Implementation o f these conditions i s underway and they are expected be completed by
end o fMay 2008.

54.     Exception from Bunk policy. The Original Project's current Implementation Progress
rating i s `Unsatisfactory', which would normally not permit the use o f additional financing
procedures. However, with the proposed changes in the Project's implementation arrangements
described above, the Task Team believes that the Project's rating will quickly recover to
`Satisfactory'. The Task Team also believes that to halt demobilization and reintegration
activities before all eligible ex-combatants and armed groups are addressed would present a
substantial security risk to DRC and the entire Great Lakes region o fAfrica.

55.     The Managing Director agreed with the Africa Region's assessment o f the proposed
changes in Project implementation under the additional financing, and also agreed with the
Region's assessment o f the significant risks associated with the discontinuation demobilization
and reintegration efforts. The Managing Director, therefore, granted a waiver on June 18, 2007
for the use o f additional financing procedures for this Project.

                                             2003), o f which about 540,000 are recent returnees, and 500,000 are IDPs
                                             registered during the first quarter o f 2006. This represents a reduction inIDPs
