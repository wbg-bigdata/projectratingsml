1. General information
1.1 Task source and signicance ofthe engineering
The curent population of Qingdao City is over 6.9 million which accounts for 5.8% of
the nation's total population. Its cultivated land area is 484,600ha and the aveage water
resources possession per capita is 355m3 which is only 14% of the whole nation's
average. Because of the uneven distribution of the limited water resouces both m space
and in time (much in summer and autnun and little in wnter and spring), the problem of
seasonal and regional drought is conspicuous.
On one hand, there is a serious water resources shortage, on the other hand, the waste of
water used for agriculture is serious. According to the investigation to Qingdao Project
Area, the following problems exists universally in the current imgation system canals
and canal buildings being out of rpir for quite a long time and the canal water-use
efficiency being very low which is only about 0.4 whereas in the advanced couties, it
can reach 0.8-0.9. At the same time, since the fmners are not accessible to the advanced,
coret and prompt technical guidance, the imgafion patten is still mainly the old flood
inigation, the irngation can not be applied at suitable time and with suitable amount
according to the water requiranent dunng the growing peniod of the crops, thus the water
utilization and crops' yield is affected. The lack of water resources has become the main
factor which restncts the agicultual development of Qingdao City.
According to the "Ninth Five-Year Plan of National Economy and Social Development
and the Guidelines of the Long-range Objectives for the Year 2010", during the Ninth
Five-year Plan Penod, the main objectives of our country's agnicultural development is to
newly increase 20 billion kgs' grain production capacity. The key to fuffil this objective is
to assure the fund for developing agricult water-saving irngation. So our state plans to
use the $100 miRlion loan from the World Bank to develop water-saving imgation
engineering in cities lie Qingdao. The loan for Qingdao City is $10 million, and
constructon of other agicultWral renovating and counter-part projects will be carried out
simultaneously. Through the development of water-saving inigation, the water fight
between industry and agriculture will be solved, the comprehensive production capacity
of agriculture and the faimers' income will be raised, and the sustainable development of
agriculture and the sustainable utilization of water resources will be promoted.
Entsted by the Agricultual Synthetic Development Office of the MWR, China Water
Conservancy & Hydraulic Power Scientific Research Institute is responsible for
implementing evaluaton on environmental effects for Qingdao Project Area The



Istitute will put forwaid suggestions on: the possible effects on utilization of local water
resoures, pollution to water environment and soil environment and the ecological
enviromnent; on mediang the adverse effects on the enviromnent caused by the project,
on environmental protection, monitoring and management plans.

1.3 CsfcaIn of eauang work and the evaaing scope
The working scope of the evaluation area is the scope of the Project Area which includes
14 sub project areas in the 6 areas of Jiaonan, Pingdu, Jimo, Jiaozhou, Chengyang and
Laii of Qingdao City. Total land area in the ProjectArea is 3051a2, cilfvatend area
is 21,331ba There are 27 towns, 253 administrative villages involved with total
population of 228,000, of which, the agrcultrWal population is 220,000.
This project is an agricultual Comprehensive development Project It raises the water
utilizaton rate, inproves the iIgatng equipment in the present rngation area and
renovates medium and low yield finnland mainly through saving water resources for
agricultural imgation. This project belongs to non-polluting project, the enviromnental
effects evaluation is Classification B. Stress will be laid on the evaluation of effects on
groundwater level and quality by the project implementation
1.4 ewuaLionprincples
The project and sub project abides by the environmental protection reglations and
relevant citeri of our state. Under the precondition that it conforms with the relevant
regulations on environmental effects evaluation of our state for the project financed by
intemational financial orgaizations, it will meet the recuirement of evaluating content
and degree in the 'Working Guide on Environmental Effects Evaluation of the World
Bank (OP4.01)".
Based on the feasibility study reports of each project area, engineerng analysis will be
made to analyze the possible effects on environment by the project Evaluation will be
made with the methods of typical investigation, analogy, inference and induction to check
the feasibility of the construction project and the rationality of the planned environmental
protection measures from the point of environmental protection
Since the project areas cover a wide area, their locations are dispersed, the key issues for
evaluation should be the regional environmentl effects, sensitive environmental
problems will be stressed
1.5 Project objectives
The main objectives of this project are: to raise water use efficiency, to increase
agricultural comprehensive production capacity, to mise firmers' income, to fulfil

A soil improvemnent
Total cultivated land area in the project area is 21,331ha Certain differences exist in the
soil indexes in different project areas. But the following problems uiversally exist to
different etent: drought, water shortage, lacing of organic matter, and meven land, etc..
The following obstacle factors exst in some regions: shallow tlled layer, water leakage,
fertlizer leakage, sticky & heavy sol, soil concretion, etc. which restict the development
of agricultural production and constuction of ecological agriculture. Following
agricultural technical measres are suggested in consideration ofthe above problems:
a Land leveling:
Land leveling is helpful to scientific irigation and fmland operation. It is the key
measure to raise cultivation quality, to preserve water, fertlizer and soil. Since most of the
faimland in the project area is not smooth and the cultivating patter is extensive,
emphasis should be laid on land leveling to make the farmlands which are adjacent to be
roughly smooth. There should be certain slope (about 0.001-0.004) of the ground of each
block horizontally or along certain direction
The land which is planned to level to different extent is 12,966.8ha with investment of
RMB3,890,040. Land leveling shoud be made on the basis of full planning of ditch,
10



district road and forest The requirements for land leveling concerning sprinkler irigation
and nicro irrigation could be less stict When leveling the land, the actve soil layer
should be not disturbed For the areas where the earth layer is relatively thin, prevention
should be given made from destroying the soil fertlity.
b. extending balanced ferlizer application, raising soil ferblity
At present the area of mid-yield field in the project area is 15,2llha, accounting for
71.3% of the cultivated land in the project area The soil nutrients are laclkng plus that
the ratio of fertilz  appliedi isrmtional, soil nutients are unbalanced, so the techniques
of balnced fertiz  application need to be greatly extended Scientific fetiizer
application should be implemented accordig to the specific crops and soil to make the
ratio of N, P and K applied reach 1:0.65:0.3, at the same time, suitable amount of trace
elements fertlizs should be applied The use of 4VE, R should be greatly
extnded in the project area and the technology of straws rtung to the fields should be
developed to inaease organic matter content of the soil and to improve particular
.sructure of the soil. Certain amount of soil fertility testng equipment should be
purchased, and soil fertility monitoring should be implemented The scientific IZ;
fertlizer application Plan for staple crops should be fonulated and guidance should be
given to frmers to implement scientfic fertlizer application. It is planned to develop:
straws retuning to the fields, 7,567ha, balanced fertilizer applicaion (K), 2,538ha;
membrane coverage area, 2,846ha; use of chemical water-preseing agent, 22.5t
B. construcion of agricultural production service systm
a. improved vanieties breeding After the project area is built, number of the inproved
varieties breeding organizations will be increased to 14 with technical personnel of 82.
Area of seed base is 468ha, seed production quantity is 225.3t, seed supplying quantiy is
10,317t It can direefly provide the fields in the project area with improved varieties of
high-yield, high-quality, and high-purity. It will serve for the production
Through the construction of improved vanreties breeding & extending system, the
improved varieties coverage of grain crops in the project area reaches above 90%,
purity of the improved varieties reaches 95-98%, supply of crossing seeds reach over
90% of the seeds demand. Uniform seeds supply of staple crops such as wheat and maize
will be basically realized Conceming vegetable seeds and fniit tree seedlings, vaneties of
high-quality, high-yield and pests & diseases resisting will be greatly extended Farmers'
requifement will be satisfied and seeds coatng techniques will be basically popularized.
11



b. agriculture mechanization sernice system. Building of agriculture mechanization
service systm and organization in the project area will be strengthened in order to meet
the requirement of agniculture mechanization service. 153 tactors and 213 other corollay
fairm appliances will be purchased with total investnent in agcultual machinery of
RMB6,125,400.
c. Farning techniques exteion service system. The farming techniques extension
service system of the project rea should be constantly miproved in order to develop
water-saving irrigation, to enhance merchandisation of fam products and to promote
popularization of science and technology in the nrual areas. To fulfil the above objectives,
the building of fanning technique extension stations of county, town and vfllage levels
should be stengthened, the quality of technical personnel should be reinforced and
advanced production technology should be promotedc Then farmhouses with certain
foundation will be selected to act as demonsators of science & technology to help the
swmounding farmers and to quicken the extension and use of new technology and new
crafts.
There are at prsent 27 famning techniques extension service orgaizations in Qingdao
Project Area with technical personnel of 1,545, including township technical personnel of
231 and village technical personnel of 1,314. After this project is completed, technical
personnel will be increased to 2,712 and village technical personnel will be increased to
2,369. The constuction area of fiming technique extension station will be incsed
from 6,615m2 to 6,680m2. Demonstration Base is 930.7ha It is planned to cany out
fanning techniques extension service training of 7,769 personimonths; at county level,
267 personmonths; at township level, 6,338 personimonths; at vilage level, 1,233
person.months;

C. water resources balance
From the water balance analysis, the present water suppliable in the project area is
90,313,000m3 which can not meet the present water requirement of 112,396,800m3 in the
project area With water-saving ingation engineerng in the project area, 45,177,000m3
water used for agncultural irngation can be saved, wtich make the water requirement
reduced to 70,147,100m3 when P=50/o, this figure is smaller than the wate  suppliable
quantity of 79,373,000m3. It is esimated that the effects of project constnction on water
resources balance is positive and the water supply-demand conflicts in agnculture can be
mediated  Please read table 2-11  for water resouites supply-demand balance in the

Takdng into consideration the effects on and rectification of suppliable water quantity by
irrigation water saving and newly built water supply engineering.
1.3.3   Changes of irigation patterns
To replace the old flood irmgation with new irngation pattem of high scientific &
technological content and to raise water use efficiency from 0.4 to 0.8 will help save the
water resources. Besides, owing to the adopting of new irrigation patems such as
sprinkler nirigation, micro im-igaton and drip imgation, the water used for irrigation and
the iunigation caused leakage wili decrease, and the ifluence of irrigation on soil
environment and water quality xwiii be rducedt
1.3.4  adjustment of crops' planting stutre
Upon project implementation, sutable adjustment wiil be made on the planting stue
of each project area with the improvement of the iugating conditions. Naural
advantages will be fully exerted, crops rotation will be rationally arranged, the planting
stucture in the project area will be improved and multiple crop index will be raised.
Please read table 2-12 for the planting area of crops in Qingdao Project Area before and
after the planting siucture is adjustd There is an increase of 174.7ha in planting area of
wheat, a dase of 101.9ha in the planting area of maize, an increase of 255.8ha in the
planting area of oil-bearing crops and an increase of 167ha of fruit tes. The multiple
crop index rises 2%. Because of the adjustnent of the crops' plantng stture and the
rise of multiple crop index, the application of pesticide and chemical fertilizer will
increase which is possible to affect the quality of water and soil environment.

1.3.5  use of pesticide and chemical fertlizer
Upon project completon and with the rise of crops' multiple crop index and the
adjustment of planting area, the use of chemical fertilizer will increase. The pipose of
using chemical fertlizer and pesticide is to increase crops' yield The reasonable use of
chemical fertilizer and pesticide will help mise soil fertlity and prevent ocemnce of
pests and diseases. But the effects of pesticide and chemical fertlizer on environment are
somehing concerned by the public. This pmrject will adopt water-saving imigation
techniques with basically no irrigation water drawback, the inrigation replenishment and
seePage decreases, so the influence on groundwater environment should decrease but
there is stil part of the water entering the groundwater. The stress of this evaluation is
whether the use of chemical fertlwill cause groundwater pollution and the effects on
soil environment by increased pesticide and chemical feriizer application. Please read
table 2-13 and 2-14 for application of pesticide and chemical ferilizer in the project area

1.1.7  analysis of project implementaton's effects on social economy
Project implementation will raise water utilization efficiency, improve soil fertlity,
improve  crops' planting  scture, raise  crops' yield  and  faimers' income.
Implemenrtaion of MIS and SIDD will enhance the management level of cultivation anLd
promote social economic development of the project area
1.1.8  factor analysis of project implementation's effects on environment and main
environment factors
Since 6 project areas are involved in the evaluation, effects from the followng multiple
factors exist: regional naural geographical conditons, imgating water source and
irnigation pattern, etc.. Through the analysis of project content propertes, scale, location
and costuction chaacterisncs, by adopting secondary matrix, we judge and determine
environmental affectng factors. Then we will make analysis on these factors to
determine the environmental affecting factors and screen main evaluating factors which
are relevant to this engineering (refer to table 2-17), then we will decide the emphasis and
scope of the evaluation.

3. Reional natural eviromnent and condions of social economy
3.1 regional natural emvironment
1.1.1  natural geographical environment
A geographical location
Qjngdao City is located on west coast of the Pacific Ocean and in the southwest of
Shandong Peninsula and faces Yellow Sea to its southeast It lies between
119°30'120°0' East Longitutude and 35°15'-379' North Latitude. It neighbors Yantai
City to its north and borde with Rizhao City and Weifang City to its southwest It fices
Korea and Japan across the sea Its land area is 10,654km2, including cultivated land area
of 484,600ha The length of coastal line is 730.6km.
This project involves five county level cities of Qingdao which are respectively Jiaozhou,
Jiaonan, Laixi, Pingdu and Juno, and one district (Chengyang District). There are totally
14 sub project areas. Please refer to table 2-1 for details.
B. climate
Qingdao lies in oceanic monsoon climate region with the charcteriscs of distinguished
four seasons, mild climate, plenty of suniight, rich heat and simultaneous rainy and hot
season. Agricuural cultivation period with daily average tenpeature over OC is 284
days, > OC annual average dymic accunulated    te is 4532.41C; > 10'C
annual average dynamic accumulated empeature is 4132.4-C; days with daily average
accumulated temperture of A I OC are 203 days. The sunlight resources are relatively
nch with yearly average sunlight of 2607h and sumlight mte of 59%; annual total solar
radiation iS 121.4kcal/cm2. It is suitable for many cereals and economic crops such as
wheat and maize to grow, it can be 2 ops inl year or 3 crps in 2 years. Variation of
precipitation from year to year is distinct and there are constantly dry or nch rainll
periods. Serious flood or extremely senous drought will happen during rich rainfill year /
dry year or dung rich rafall penod / diy period. Drought and flood are the main natural
calamities which tireat agicuural production. Please refer to attached table 2 for
meteorological data
Perennial average minfalI in the project area is 685.7mm with big variaton from year to
year. Affected by factors such as climate, the distribution of precipitation differs a lot both
in space and in time. 70-80% of the precipitation within a year is concentated in June-
September. Perennial average temperature is 12.5 C, pmennial average evaporation is
26



1121mm, frost free period is 290 days, and maximum frozen earth depth is 38cm.
C. topography and landform
The geological stuure of Qingdao City is New Huaxia No. 2 bumping belt secondary
stuctual unit - northeast rim of Jiaonan Bumpting Region and mid-south of Jiaolai
Sinmkng region. There is intensive allocation of granite wihin the region and fuiily
developed fite structure. The land is high in the east and low in the west, bumps in
the north and south and sinks in the middle. The southeastem part is Laoshan Mountain
Range with steep slope, it extends towards the southwest until the city poper and
towards north untl the northeast of Jino City. The southwestern part is Jiaonan Mountain
Groups composed of Dazhusb   Xiaozhushan and Tiejuesha. The northern part is
Dazesban Mountain Range which extends towards east until Laixi City. The middle part
is Puzhen Tableland, Jiaolai Sinkig Plain, Jino Basin and Jiaolai Basin with elevation
normally not exceeding 50m. The geological charcteistics within the region determines
the coast form as long stetching, curing and ahenative occurrence of capes and bays.
Mountain area accounts for about 15.5% of whole city, hilly land area accounts for
25.1%/o, plain accounts for 37.8% and low-lying land accounts for 21.7%. All the project
areas are located in low hilly land area
D. soil
Soil in the whole city can be divided ito 6 categories of brown soil, lime concretion
black soil, tidal soil, drab soil and salt soil. It can be further divided into 13 sub categories
and 24 soil groups. In the 6 categories, peentage of brown soil is the most which is
about 58.5% of the usable land in the whole city. Soil in the project area is mainly brown
soil and lime concaretion black soil. Brown soil covers the most area which are mainly
hilly land area and gentle declining flat land before the hill. The development of its soil
body is rather complete in weak acid, its ant-drought propertes are poor, it is the main
soil for planting cereals and economic crops in the project area; lime concretion black sofl
is mainly in the shallow and flat low-lying land in the southeast of Laixi City, the
southwest of Pingdu City, the Southwest of Jimo City and the north Jiaozhou City. Its
parental matter is alluvium and deposits in shallow lake swamp. It is weak alkali and is
suitable for crops' cultivation.
E. water system and water resouces
Development of the nvers within Qingdao terntoiy is mostly controlled by the
topography and landform. Riverbed runoff belongs to the type of monsoon rainfall
27



source with strong seasonal charactistics. The nvers are short and rapid and mosdy
enter the sea independently. There are 5 nivers with drainage area of over 500km2, they
are Daguhe, North Jiaolalhe, south Jiaolaihe, Xiaguhe and Zehe.
Water reosurces of Qingdao include two parts of local water resources and foreign water
resources. Source of local water resources is mainly precipition which exis in the
forns of surfa  runoff and groundwater. Perennial average total water resources are 2.47
billion m3, including surface water resources of 2.018m3 and groundwater resources of
1.068m3. The double calculated quantity is 616 million in3. Main foreign water sources
are the water diverted from the Yellow River which is 110 million m3 per year (P=95%).
It is mainly for the use of Qingdao city proper and for mdustrial and agnculual use
along the way. It includes surface water resources in the project ara of 174,134,000m3,
total groundwater replenishment of 74,852pOOm3. Please refer to table 2-9 for details.
1.1.2  agricultual ecological envirnment
The agricultual ecologcal system in the project area is relatively fiale with low
capability to fight natural calamities. With the continuous developmnent of national
economy in the recent yeas, governments at different levels start to lay emphasis on the
constuction of ecological agriculture and certain planning is made. In some regions, a
water, forest, farmland and roads comprehensive treatnent engineering has been
implemented with water conseration as the pilot and forestry as the foundation. But
since it has just been started, the operation is extensive and most ofthe cultivated land in
the region is mid-yield land, the tasks of constrng ecological agriculture is still hrd
1.2 social econony

4,610,000, including agricultual population of 4,508,000. Total rual labors are
2,377,000 (1,526,000 are agricultual labors). Of the employees in the towns, 8.35% are
with educational background of college or polytechnic school. Employees with
educational level of junior rniddle school consist the main-body of the townsuip
employees. The educational level in the vast villages is universally low.
1.2.2  Communication
Communication and tansportation in Qingdao City is fairly developed, a comprehensive
28



communication and tnsportation network has been formed which is composed of
railway, road, water and air with harbor as the pivotal. The roads which are open to traffic
in the whole city is 2,794.2km, among which 98% are open no matter there is sunshine
or mrin Roads density is 26.2kg/lOOkm2. Qingdao Harbor is an important complex
harbor of our country, it has established navigation and trade links with over 400 harbors
in more than 120 countries and regions worldwide. Its handling capacity now ranks No. 4
in China The nportant traffic lines of Shandong Peninsula - Jiaoji Railroad and Lanyan
Railroad run across the city. In 1997, its volume of passengers traffic is 7.801 billion
passengerJan, among which, 4.211 billion passengerkm is by railroad, 3.54 billion
passengerlkm by road and 50 nillion passengerlcm by water. Volume of feight rnsport
is 29 billion t.km, and harbor handling capacity is 69.43 million tons. Qingdao Aiiport
has opened 3 international airlines, 17 airlines to major cities all over China Roads are
available in all sub project areas that go to places nationwide.

3.2.6 agricultural production
There is a profound foumdation in agnculture in Qingdao with the yield of many
agrcultual products numbering top nationwide. Agricture is one of the most important
industial sectors in Qingdao and is the main income source for the peasants. n the year
1997 in the whole city, the seeded area of crops is 750,400 ha, the multiple crop index is
155%. Basically the fai produce is two crops a year or three crops in two years.The
production of crops mainly includes three parts:
a cereal crops: occupying an important position in the agiicultural production with its
seeded area accounting for 70% of the total seeded areas. Among the cereal crops, wheat
Ls the crop wfit the lagest grown ae   and the highest total yield, reeetavely accoimting
for 49% and 37% of that of the cereal crops. Besides, a few amount of millet, Chinese
sorghum, sweet potatoes, etc. are also grow
b. industial acops: mainly peanuts with grown area accounting for 14% of the total
seeded area
c. other crops: mainly vegetables. The growing of vegetables has a long history  ith its
grown area accounting for 10% ofthe seeded area ofthe firm produce.
3.2.7 agricultural catastrophes
Agricultural catarophes in the project area are mainly drought and flood. Please refer to

3.2.8 present situation of water conservation facilities
Qingdao City has now formed the fiames of water conservancy service system covering
flood-control, water-logging dainage, agricultual imgation, water-supply for urban and
rual area, retaining water and earth, etc. A considerable set of water-consency
infiustructural facilities has been built There are totaUlly 24 large and medium scale
reservoirs, 424 small-scale reservoirs, 3403 dkice dam, the total storage capacity is 1.4
billion n3; totally 76,900 mechanical and electrical wells are built, among them, the
number of wells working as necessary accessories is 67,500; the developed jingation
area is 340,000 ha with 54 irgafion zones of 10,000 mu (1 mu=666 m2) each, including
41inigation zones of 100,000 mu each, a water & soil washing-away area of 295,000
ha has been tackled, accountng for 58% of the total wa  & soil washing-away area; a
saline-alkali soil of 16,800 ha has been unproved, accounting for 97% of the total area of
saline-alkali cultivated land; the difficulty for having water for 1.55 million people has
been solved, accounting for 90% of the populaton who need to solve this problem, the
engineenng for drawing water from Yellow River to supply Qingdao is completed which
solved the problem of water-supply to Qingdao Urban Area
At present, the main problems existing in Qingdao concerning the water-consancy
ficilities are: the ifistuctur is weak; the ability to fight natual calamity is not strong. It
is extraordinarily shown in: the original river bed is deposited causing the ability to
prevent flood become weaker, for many irigation zones, the key engineenng is ready, but
because of insufficient input to water conservancy, the necessary accessonies are not
completed according to the design; the surface water retaining engineering is generally
insufficient, large amount of precious water resources rns off; there is no efficient water-
saving measures, the utilization coefficient is low, the waste is serious; sometimes hams
will be brought when there is drought or flood.
4  present status of emironmal quality
4.1polluig source
Project area is far away from the city, there is no large-scale industial polluting source in
the sLuounding area, the economy in the project area is mainly agriculture. The main
polluting source in the project area is suiface polluting source - water for domestic use by
human being and poultry.

5. evaluion of enronmental effes and mitgation measures
5.1 effects on soif emironment by project implemenaon
Effects on soil by project implementation is listed in table 5-1. Project implementation
can effectively improve soil structue and enhance soil fertlity, e.g. implementation of
water conservancy engineering can improve soil's water supply conditions; agricultral
measures such as land leveling, deep tillage, deep loosening, straws retrning to the field,
use of farmyard manure, etc., can improve soil feiilhty and Iaise soil water preserving
capability; forestry projects can improve famland micro environment and prevent water
loss & soil erosio¢L The application of pesticide is esstal in er to reduce harms from
pests & diseases on crops and to raise grin yields. But the increase of pesticide use will
have certain effects on soil environment quahity and the diversity of orgaisms. This
report will make evaluation especially of the effects of pesticide on environment

5.2 effiects on surface watr environment by project iplaneion
35



5.2.1 effects on surface water quantity
Since there is no increase in iigated area, after adopdng water-saving inigation
techniques, total wate demand in the year 2010 with P-50% will be 44,066,200m3 less
tha the present owing to the dease of water used on imgation. Water resources
shortage in the projec area will get mitigated and the water resources supply-demad in
most sub project areas will change from water deficiency to water surplus.
5.2.2 effects on water quality
This project is to extend water-saving irigalion. Upon project implementation, water
used on irngation will decse, thus irgation water depletion will decrease
corespondingly, the effects on surface water quality will surely be lowered-
But to raise crops' yield, soil fertlity and crops' multiple crop index, the applicafion of
pesticide and chemical fertlizerwill increase, so leaching loss of chemical fertilizer is one
of the main reasons which affect surface water quality Chemical ferlir applied on
farmland will partly be absorbed by the crops, pardy be fixed by the soil and pardy be
lost into surfce water or groundwat. Let's take the example of N fertlier, relevant
studies showthat 40-60%ofthe Nfertilizeris absorbed, 20-30% be fixedbythe soil, and
5-20% lost After this project is nnplemented, through deep tillage, soil loosening and
pretsaipve fertlier application, the soil sticture and ratio ofN, P and K content in the
soil will be improved, the absorption of chemical fertilizer by the crops is increased, and
losses of chemical ferTlizer gets lowered. So after this project is implemented, the effects
of imgation on surface water quality will not be big.
5.3 effects on groundwater enwironment by project implentation
5.3.1 hydraulic and hydrogeological conditions in the project area
According to the topography, landform and type of groundwater, Qingdao City can be
divided into 2 hydrogeological regions of hilly land area bedck crevice water and plain
area Quatmary fiiable Iock pore water For bedrock crevice water, precipitaton is its
main replenishment source, and sometimes the only source. It is mainly discharged into
the Quamary aquifer or flow to the surface in the forms of subsuce flow or gravity
spnng. Single well water yield is small.
Quatemary pore water mainly exists in valley alluvial plain or piedmont plain Its aquifer
is mainly gravel coarse medium sand, which are mosty double-layer stucture with the
upper layer of clay and lower layer of sand and gravel of vaious granular shape, the
thickness is normally between 5-20cm.
36



Groundwater is mainly replenished by precipitation seepage, river chanel seepage and
bedrock mountain region lateral seepage, etc., and runs in a vault way followng the
topogaphy. It is discharged mainly through subsurface water evaporation, diect rLmning
into the sea and ardficial exploitation, etc. Main characteristics of Quaterary pore water
aquifer in Qingdao are: extensively allocated, shallow buried, easy to receive
replenishment from precipitation and surface nmoff. Owing to the massive existence of
single-stratIn strtal belt developed by 'atch", nver water and groundwater tends to
be integrated into one in modem riverbed region, the conversion of 'tre-watef' is
distnct with the properties of easy to exploit and easy to replenish.
5.3 2 effects on groundwater quality by project implementation
Please refer to table 5-2 for present groundwater utilizaion stuaton in the project area
From this table, we can see that Pingdu and Chengyang belong to groundwater overdraft
area; groundwater extraction rate of Jiaonan and Laixi is resectively 66% and 690/; tiat
of Jiaozhou and Jimo is less ta 30%, there is great potential for extraction.

5.3.4 effects on groundwater quality by project implementation
From the present groundwater quality in the project area, quity of the subsuface water
can meet the quality reqrments for agnicultural imgation. For some regions, the
relatively high Fand gross hardness degree is caused by geological reasons, not by
artificial polluton. Main pollutant is nitrate. evaluation on effects of nitate on
groundwater wll be made sepaely in this evaluation.
5.4 effect of chemicalfew andpeide on uwand soil envirnme
5.4.1 effects of nitrate on water and soil environment
A affecting principles
The migration and converion process of N in the crop-soil-groundwater system is very
complicated which includes a series of physical and chemical processes, such as crops'
absorption, soil's adsorption, nitrification, counter-nitrification, hydrodynamic dispersion
convection role, etc.. The above directly affect the effects of N application during
iTngation on gromdwater. Crops' absorption of N vanes a lot, under suitable conditions,
crops can recover over 80% of the N feralizer, but in most cases, the utilization rate of N
is below 50%. So application of N is the potential pollutant of groundwater. Niftate is the
most common pollutant in groundwater In some famlands, eluviation of nitrate causes
massive pollution to the groundwater.
B. evaluating methods
Water cunent is the canTyg body of nitrate from the roots to groundwater. Studies show
that under certain soil quality conditions, eluvation loss ofNO3-N is clearly positive to the
leakage of soil moisture. Water-saving irigation raises utilization efficiency of water
resources and reduces leakage, writ the other conditions the same, effects of N fertlizer
application on N03-N pollution to groundwater are anticipated to be lessened But since
the naaturl conditions and use of N fertilizer in different project areas vary a lot,
considaion must be given to the effects of these factrs on groundwater N03-N
pollution when making the evaluation.
There are many methods for the study of N fertilizer's pollution to groundwater, for
example, N balance calculation, Mathematics Model Method, making charter with GIS,
etc.. But since this project covers a large area, these methods are not applicable. There is
40



no comprehensive method which we can learn from domestically as to how to evaluate
effects of chemical fertlizer application on groundwater N03-N pollution from regional
point of view. So on the basis of making full use of existng baic data, we will take
reference from nitrate pollution index Method put foiward by Mr. Ramolino from
Amenca for this evaluation.
Nitrate pollution index means iat on the basis of analyzing 22 different famland
plantng conditions, including climate, soil type, planting struue, chemical fertilizer
tPe, applied qUantity, applied time and groUndwater N03-N, the Amenica scholar
concludes to 8 potential affecting factors (mainly chemical ferizer strength, scope of
irigation, soil type, buied depth of groundwater, type of crop, well depth, confined water
or subsurfice water, and environmental conditions of aqwfer, etc.. Upon further
synthesiing, it comes to the four basic affecting risk factors which are: N fertler
strengtl, soil structurem net replenishment from precipitation and irnigation,
and groundwater level buried depth. Then calculating method of nite pollution
index is concluded. This method was checked with 269 groundwater spots in the
farland, and analysis of the relation between armland groundwater nitre polluton
and the pollution index was made. This method is simple to use and it is good for
evaluating the possibility of potential pollution. It is suitable for making evaluation for
dispersed spots.
a. determination of weight of affecting factors
The degree of effects of the above four syntietic factors on groundwate are not
completely the same, so corresponding weight should be allocated to each fictor so as to
make more precise evaluation of their effects. Weight should be determined according to
the documents and professional knowledge, risk scoring is made on the potential effects
of the above four factors on groundwater pollution Please read table 5-5 for the scormng
Table 5-5 risk degrees scoring of the affecting factors' effects on groundwater pollution
Risk     -High       High-      medium    Medium-  low           Extremely

Synthesizing the potential effects of each fictor on the groundwater pollution, please read
table 5-6 for the risks analysis of their effects. The total score reflects the relative
importance of each factor's effects on fariland groundwater pollution

The fractionation method and foundation is based on massive studies, e.g. the effects of
net replenishment is based on American DRSTIC metiod.
b. paraneter equation
According to the above parameter, we can get nitrate pollution index as:
43



ATI = Ef,+ &, + Rr + D,
F, R, S, D are respectively N fertilizer application weight, net replenishment weight, soil
snicte  weight and gronmdwater buried depth weight. Fi, ri, si, di are respectively the
fractionation factor of the above four affecting fctors.
The above model can detemme the potental possibility of groundwater N03-N pollution
under different geogrphical conditions. The bigger the figure, the bigger possibility of
nitrate pollution.
C. effects analysis

the evaluation, that is, under the conditon of excessive application and balance

the potential effects of excessive application on possible groundwater pollution.

From table 5-13, we can see that N03-N pollution index obviously dropped because of
the distnct decrease of iigaton quota in the field no matter in pumping ingation area or
surfice water inigation area and the distnct decrease of irigation water's replenishment
coefficient to groundwater wnder water-savng irngation conditions. So we can say that
the quantity of N03-N which seeps with the water will decrease to certain extent, and the
effects on groundwater qualty will be lightened.
5.42 pesticides' effects on water and soil envirnment
To ligbhen the hanns to the crops by pests and diseases and to raise grain yield, pesticide
has to be used which will exert cetin effects on water & soil environment According to
the investigation made by the American Envimnmental Protection Bureau on pesticide,
pesticides and their degraded denvatives will reach over 100 kinds. Study on this aspect
by our country is quite lacking, there is no detailed statistical data
Concm g pesticides' behavior in the envimnnmen, mnny aspects are still unlmown
fields in science. Under the ciunstances of incomplete theory and investigation resuls
it is very difficult to determine the effects of pesticide on environment, so during
evaluation, we will take reference mainly from the theoretical study resuls of America
and EU and will make macro evaluation on the behavior and effects of pesticide in the
environment
There are many fictors which affect the migrtion and transformaton of pesticide in soil,
tis is not only related to pesticides' own physical & chemical prperties, btt to the
properties of the soil. Generally speakng, with low soil moistre content, the adsorption
ability of pesticides will be enhanced and mobility is weakened; when temperature ises,
adsorption is weakened, and mobility is strengthened; when content of clay and orgic
matter in soil is high, adsorption is strengthened- PH changes also have big efcts on
pesticides' mobility, especially for organic P pesticide whose mobility in high PH soil
gets strengthened quite distnctly. High content of organic matter in the soil will help
degradation of pesticides. These properties affect the degrading speed and degraded
matter of the pesticides in the soil and affect pesticides' behavior (for example, leaching,
volatilization, and biological utilization, etc..) in the water & soil system,
One key factor in evaluatng pesticides' potential migration in soil is to evaluate its
45



distrbution between solid and liquid in soil solution, one of the property parameters is
adsorption coefficient Kd (ratio between density of pesticide adsorbed in soil and the
density of pesticide in soil solution). Mssive studies show that Kd is well related to the
content of organic mater in the soil. So Kd value is shown with unit organic matter
content (Kom) or unit organic carbon content (Koc):
Kom = lOOKd (% orgaic matter content) (cm3g')
Koc = lOOKd (% organic carbon content) (cm3g')
It is mosty shown with Koc value (called organic carbon adsorption coefficient) in
ordinay documents. Studies show that when pesticide <50, it is regarded as holding
strong migration properties; 150-500 as medium migration properties; >2000 as mico
migration properties.
Another index is field half-life penod (TO.5) expresing parameter of degradation of
pesticides m soil This synthetic index contains all the degradation process, for example,
biological and non-biological degradation, volatilization, leaching, plants' absorption, etc..
it is a parameter related to soi, climate and activities of soil microorganism at a specific
spot.
Migration coefficient
Gusifson stuhdies 22 pesticides and put forward GUS (Gromd Ubiquity Score) index on
the basis of pesticides' field half-life period and Koc.
GUS= lg(TO5X4-1IgKJ
It is used to differntiate the possibility of pestcide leaching. When GUS>2.8, easy
leaching pesticide; 1.8<GUS<2.8, medium leaching pesticide; GUS<1.8 uneasily
leached pesticide.
Carbendazim (GUS=3.24>2.8) and long-acting P (GUS=5.9>2.8) which are quite
commonly used m the project area both belong to pesticides that are easy to be leached.
They are easy to degrade in the soil and their pollution possibility to gromdwater is
small.
The insecticides used in our county can be basically divided into orgaic chlomide,
organic P The degScng speed of organic Cl in  the soiis very slow and it has been
basically forbidden to use. Mostly used at present is organic P, such as dimethoate, etc..
This kdnd of pesticides have short half-life period in soil and are easy to be degradeci
Their time of detention in the soil is relatively short and the possibility to pollute
groundwater is small.
The ag icultwal measures such as straws retuming to field adopted in this project will
also help degradation of pesticide. One important effects of straws on faumland is the
46



increase of soil's organic matter content As we have mentioned above, high content of
organic matter is helpful to adsorption and degradation of pesticide. The possibility of
pesticides' migration to groundwater will be further lessened.
Since the study on the parameters of pesticide in the environment made by our country is
very litde, there is no final conclusion in theory conceniing the study of pesticides'
behavior in the soil. So for his evaluation, we will lay the stress on puttng forward
preventive measures of pesticides' pollution to soil and groundwater upon project
implementation on the basis of taking reference from overeas studies.
5.5 prenidw measures on soil & wat emvironnx polluion
a. to reasonably use pesticide
Cnteria for the safe use of pesticide of our country will be strictly carried out Under the
guidance of plant's protection experts, we can take reference from EU's study results as
shown in table 5-14 (pesticides' physicochemical properies) to select pesticides with
high-effects, low-poison, low-residual and easy-degradationm

period
Field decomposition half-life period   >2-3 weeks
Depth of leaching in field dissipation  >75-90cm
b. scientifically and rationally use chemical fertilizer
Application of organic ferdlizer is suggested. To ufilize poultry excrement and urine night
soil and straws returning to field as organic fertilizer to raise soil nutrients, accumulation
of organic natter and to raise crops' yield; at the same time, we will adopt scientific &
rational applying pattn and select the optimnumn applying tirne to reduce use and loss of
chemnical fertlizer.
5.6 effects ofproject inplementaton on social economy
Project implementation will mitigate the conflicts between agricultural development and
47



water resources shortage, ensure constant development and national economy, promote
development of high-quality, high-efficiency agnculture in the project area, raise farmers'
income, raise crops' yield. At the same time, aglicultual development will imProve
social environment improve  rual communication and power supply conditions;
promote development of related industries such as farm products' processing indusry
and raising industry, etc.; increase employment strengthen social security and enhance
overall econoric level in the project area
5. 7 effecls ofconsitctwn on the surrounding evronmet
During construction period, water conservancy projects and aguicultual projects will
exert effects on the environment The main activities include: canal excavation and
dredging, repairing and malkng of motor-driven wells, construction of bridge culverts of
water conservncy projects and land leveling of agricultural projec These projects will
cause partial pollution in certain period of time, such as scrap, spoil, noise and soil &
water losses, etc. which are adverse to the environment
5.7.1 land utilization and water & soil loss
During project conslructon, canal excavation and buildings construction will destroy
vegetation partially, and occupy land. Canstruction in rainy season will cause water &
soil loss. Partially spealkng, the affected scope is small, losses will be lowered to the
bottom through preventive measures.
Land occupation for project construction is inevitable, but through taking preventive
measures to protect farmland during construction, land occupation to the minimum
degree can be achieved During constuction, we should try our best not to move soil
during flood season, when necessary, we will use coverage to protect soil that is fWagile
and easy to be eroded; we will promptly clean the channel and remove the smudge to
keep smooth drainage; we will try our best to prevert big changes of srfce rmoff so as
not to cause water & soil loss. We will strengthen vegetation recovery along both sides of
the canal to prevent water & soil loss. There will be strict management and safe
construction, the building mateials will be pfled rationally to prevent damages to the
vegetation and faimland beyond the ahleady acquired land.
5.7.2 effects of solid wastes on the environment
Solid wastes that are possibly produced during construction period are sand, stone, brick
and earth, etc.. But owing to the small quantity of partial engineering, there will be no
48



large quantity of solid wastes through reasonable charge-ir The excavated earth from
field corollary engineering is normally used for refilling, so spoil and scrap produced is
very little. The little amount of spoil and scrap produced durng construction should be
duly cleaned and trsported to the appointed piling place.
5.7.3 effects of noise and dust on the environment
a. noise:
Mechanical excavation, aggregates processing and concrete mixng during constructon
are the stable noise sources. Mobile noise sources include passing of vehicles, etc.. The
region affected by mechanical noise (exceeding 45dB(A)) will nornally not exceed
200m. The construction sites in the project area are mostdy far away from the densely
populated residential area, the stable site noise will not affect the surrounding residentil
area Running vehicles will produce little amount of noise when entering residential area
at night.
b. dust
Qingdao belongs to oceanic monsoon climate zone. It is dry in winter and spring, the
surface layer soil is chy and loose. Earthwork excavation during construction is the main
reason of dust

females.
Water conservancy projects: raising water resources utilintion efficiency; enhancing
engineering's irigation & drainage standard; mitiganng treats from drought, flood and
alkaline catastrophes and conresponding social problems.
Foresty projects: establishing complete farmland shelter-belt forest system. The
development of shelter-belt forest and fruit tees can obviously improve rural ecological
enviromnent, regulate the climate, strengthen the ability to fight wind, sand, drought and
flood catastrophes and protect crops.
In geneal, implementation of the project can mitigate the conflicts between agricultural
development and water resources shortage, ensure constant development of national
economy, help develop high-quality and high-efficiency agriculture in the project area At
the same time, agricultural development can improve rural communication and power
supply conditions, promote development of relevant industries such as farm products
processing industry and raising industry, raise employment rate and enhance overall
economic level in the project area
6.3 ecological benefit
Af,er the project is implemented, forest coverage will be raised 2% with the construction
of farmland shelter-belt forest system. It can conserve moisture, enlarge moiture passage
in the air, inprove familand nicro climate and agricultual ecological environment with
grdually decreasing annual amplitude and daily amplitude of temprature and lower
han-ns from wind, drought and flood.
Becauise of the extension of flourishing agnculture with science and technology, such as
cropping pattern changes, scientific fertlimer application, scientific application of high-
efficient and low-poison pesticides, water-saving imgation, scientific raising and SIDD
pilot, etc., the loss of water and fertilizer is lowered, the utilization efficiency of water and
chemical fertlizer by soil and crops is enhanced, and the pollution to water body and
environment is decreased. During project implementation, application of orgnic
fertilizer is increased in combination with chemical fertilizer, straws are retued to fields,
so use of chenical fertlizer is reduced and pollution to human being and environment is
lowered.
In summary, the economic, social and ecological benefits exerted by project construction
and implementation are quite obvious.

According to the questionnaires, we get the following results:
a. 2,122 persons show that they know well the present engineering situation, it is
96.28% of all the persons investgated 82 persons are not clear about it, which is
3.72% of all the persons investgated;
b. 1,953 persons are clear about the construction content of this project and support this
project, accounting for 88.61% of all the persons investigated; 180 persons are not
clear about the construction content of this project and take a wait-and-see atttude,
accounting for 8.17% of the persons investigated; 71 are against this project,
accounting for 3.22%. The reasons of opposition are mainly: having no fiud to invest
in; being not willing to bea risks; and thinlang that this project has noting to do with
themselves.
c. It is universally thought that the old irrigation engineering is aged and out of repair for
many years, renovaton is required. 1,991 persons agree on the water-saving irgation
techniques (including pipeline imgation techniques and canal anti-leakage irrigation)
hat are possible to be adopted in the project design, accounting for 86.71% of the
persons investigated They prefer canal anti-leakage irgation tem Iiques.
d. It is univerally thought that the quality of present imgation is low, which wastes time
and resources. The farmers hope ihat through the project implementation, the
imgation quality could be improved- At the same bme, they hope lhat relevant
departnents can offer prompt service and gLidance so that they can implement
irrigation according to scientific irrigation system.
7.4 ana4sts of ihvnlgalIon remss
Public participation of this time is successful. The investigation covers a wide range, the
investigated persons rpresent different levels, and the feedback is authentic. From the
investigation results, we can see that over 95% of the persons in the project area are for
the project construction, that the higher their eucational level, the higher their approval
of this project and the stronger the environmental protection consciousness. Farmers in
project area have already accumulated crtain expenences on irigation, their
rqurements for raising irnigation quality and strengthening guidance on farming
techniques are urgent, their consciousness of scientific cropping is high. But through the
investigation, we also found that the consciousness of environmental protection and
water protection of the masses in the project area is weak, their knowledge of sustinable
development is insufficient, and their knowledge of environmental monitoring is lile. It
is suggested that stress be laid on strengthening education of environmental
53



consciousness dinng project constri=on to form  the thinlkng of sustainable
development While promoting economic construction, this project should also lay
emphasis on contolling its negative effects on environment to the minimum degree.

9. conczsions and stuions
9.1 posWwe effects ofproject unplemeron
a. water savng irigation engneenng is to solve water resources shortage and low &
unstable agricultWal output problems in Qingdao City. The economic, ecological and
social benefits upon project implementation are distinct and people's living quality can
get obvious improvement;
b. water tilization efficiency could be raised from 0.4 to 0.8 after project is implemented.
It lays the foundation for agricultral synthetic development Plating structure is
imnproved on this foundation to develop synthetic agricultre. The abflity to figbt
catsftW hes and risks are strengthened.
c. Water resources shortage could be mitigted after project is implemented and supply
and demand of water resources can get balanced. Water-saving will exert potenial and
susainable benefits. The reducton of seeped water will lighten the pollution to
groundwater and soil by surfce water, which lays the foundation for improving soil
stucture;
d. Implementation of agricultual measures such as land leveling and prescrbed fxl1izer
applicaton can mise soil fertlity and improve soil's particle structure;
e. Agricultual mechanization level is mised after project is implemented, coverage of
improved varieties will reach over 900, the efficiency of agricultural production will
get great improvement;
f Construcon of farmland forest network will lower the degree of soil erosion, improve
farmland micro environment and reduce regional water & soil loss;
57



g. Implementation of environmental protection measures and environmental monitoring
and management plan will unprove environmental quality in the project area and raise
the ability to monitor and control the environment.
9.2 negaive effe  of project ipleinenAtion
Engmeenng construction will bring about land and vegetation damages temporarily,
especally in rainy season when it is easy to cause water & soil loss. But the negative
effects could be eliminated or mitigated by adopting protective measu.
The increase of pesticide and chemical fertilizer application is helpful to raise soil fertlity
and to mduce the threats from pests and diseases from present point of view, but in the
long nm, the inigation replenishment will deease, the density of pesticide and chemical
fertilizer in the soil will increase, once there is torrential rain, the pollution to the water
body will be more senous.
9.3 public's opinion
This project will exert positve effects on both natwal envirornment and social
environment, the public give much support on the construction of this project They don't
ffink new environmental problems will occur and they are eager to start the construction.
9.4 conclusions
According to the environmental effects analysis and evaluation, positive effects of the
project are the main effects. It can distnctly improve the agricultual niigation conditions
in the project area, raise soil fertility, raise water resources' utilization efficiency, raise
vegetation coverge, improve farmland micro climate and increase farmers' income. It
gets the support firom the public and it can play a positve role in promotng overall
economic development in the project area Generally spealdng, there are more posive
effects than negative effects on the environment, this project is feasible from
environmental point of view.
9.5 suggesions
a. to fMilly exert farmers' participation consciousness and supervision role in the
environmental protection work,
b. to make designs of water & soil conseirtion, ecological treatment and environmental
protection simnultaneously with the initial design of the engineering. To check and
58



accept enviromental protecon engineering when the engineening is completed
c. concenmg use of chemical fertlizer and pesticide, Pesicide Safe Use Citeria should
be followed stictly when applying pesticide. It is suggested that monitoring be
stengthened in the area where tiere is possible pesticide and chemical fertilizer
pollution.
