General
1.1 Background
1.1.1 Project sense
China is an agricultural country with more populations and less cultivated lands which
are always restricted factors for the whole national development. With the economic
development and the increase of populations, solving the issue of feeding more than one
billion population is always a matter of prime importance for the social and economic
development of China. China is also a country with frequent flood and drought disasters
and short water resources, even though the total water resources volume takes the sixth
place of the world, its average per capita is only one fourth of that of the world level,
making up the 110th place and was designated by the United Nations as one of the
thirteen water short countries. The limited water resources is distributed unevenly at
space and time, which are more in the south and less in the north, more in the east and
less in the west, more in summer and autumn and less in winter and spring. The
composition of water and land resources is non-proportional, the water resources in
North China where the land area constitutes 60% of the whole country can't makes up
20% of that of the whole country and its seasonal and regional water shortage is very
prominent.
On the one hand, the water resources are very short, and on the other hand, they are
wasted seriously in agriculture. At present, the utilization factor of irrigation water in
China is only 0.4, however, it can reach 0.8-0.9 in advanced countries, therefore, there
are great potentials for water saving in agriculture in China. If the utilization factor of
irrigation water in the constructed irrigated areas of China can be increased by 0.1-0.2,
the annual water saving volume will reach 40-80 billion cubic meters calculated as 400
billion cubic meters water consumption in agriculture and this will play an important role
in alleviating the contradictions between water resources supply and demand. At present,
the water use efficiency of irrigation water in China is very low, the cereal production per
cubic meter water can't reach 1.0 kilogram which is less than 50% of that in developed
countries.
On the basis of the "Ninth Five Year Plan of the National Economy and Social
Development and the National Program for Long Term Objective in 2010", the main
objective in agricultural development in China is to newly increase 20 billion kilograms
cereal production in the ninth five years. Irrigation is one of the key factors to realize the
above objective. Developing water saving irrigation is an important way for increasing
the utilization efficiency of irrigation water, the comprehensive agricultural productivity
and fanner's income and promoting the sustainable utilization of water resources and the
sustainable development of agriculture, it is of great significance in water short districts.



In order to raise enough funds, the state planed to borrow loan from the World Bank to
develop water saving irrigation projects in Hebei, Beijing, Shenyang and Qingdao four
provinces and municipalities, meanwhile, undertake the construction of agricultural
modification and corollary projects.
1.1.2 Environmental impact assessment
According to the "Notice for Strengthening the Management of Environmental Impact
Assessment in International Financial Organization Loan Project" and the "Guideline for
Environmental Impact Assessment of the World Bank (OP4.01)", China Institute for
Water Resources and Hydropower Research (IWHR) accepted the entrustment from the
Comprehensive Agricultural Development Office (CADO) to undertake the
environmental impact assessment of the project in July 1999, finished the compilation of
the environmental impact assessment outline at the end of August 1999 and passed the
review by the departments in chief of the State's Environmental Protection Bureau. It
carried out project investigation immediately after that, collected data from all sides and
made the environmental impact assessment.
T-his project is a modification for irrigation technologies, perfect the irrigation
installations on the basis of the former irrigated area and won't exploit new water
sources. Its aim is to increase the utilization factor of water resources, promote the
virtuous circle of agricultural ecological environment and realize the sustainable
development of agricultural production. Therefore, water conservation project is an
environmental improvement project to a great extent.
The project areas are located in the northern districts of China with frequent flood and
drought disasters and weak agricultural ecological environment. Since the foundation of
the People's Republic of China, large-scale water conservancy and agricultural
constructions had been carried out and the agricultural ecological environment had been
improved to a certain extent, however, some issues also occurred with that. The
excessive extraction of water resources in some districts had resulted in the shriveling of
river channels and the descent of groundwater level and the large quantity application of
fertilizer and pesticide had led to the soil and water environment pollution. Resolving
these issues is a new task and a higher requirement to water conservancy provided for the
sustainable development of agriculture.
Because these project areas are located in the extensive rural areas of China and their
distribution is wide and scattered, their basis for environmental monitoring research is
very weak, especially they are short of available data of groundwater environment, which
is the focal and difficult point of the assessment. Moreover, the theoretical research on
the impact of fertilizer on soil and water environment is still in the preliminary stage and
it's more difficult in practical use. Therefore, we consulted a lot of data in research,
broadly used the domestic and external relevant theories and methods for reference and
focused on more detailed discussion and analysis on the impact of water saving irrigation
on groundwater level, the activities of pesticide and fertilizer in soil and groundwater and
2



the impact of water saving irrigation on groundwater environment. We made a detailed
assessment to Hebei, Qingdao, Beijing and Shenyang project areas.
1.2 Compilation accordance and assessment standard

1.3 Assessment component, assessment focal point and environmental protection
goal
1.3.1 Assessment component
*Analysis on the impact of the project implementation on environmental protection
-Present status of environmental quality
*Impact of water resources utilization on water environment
-Analysis on the impact of pesticide and fertilizer on soil and water environment
*Environmental impact assessment in construction period
-Impact of the project implementation on social economic development
*The public's evaluation to the project
* Countermeasures on environmental protection
*Investment for environmental protection and profit analysis
*Program for environmental management and monitoring
1.3.2 Assessment scope and period
T-he construction scope of the project is the assessment scope, the assessment period is
mainly the operation period of the project and brief assessment was made in the
construction period of the project.
1.3.3 Assessment focal point
The project mainly involves water body environment. It will have no atmosphere and
solid waste influence basically except there are some partial and periodic light machinery
noises and dust. Therefore, the main impact that the project involves is water
environment.
There are no sensitive environmental protection objectives in these project areas
according to the regional environmental function division and environmental protection
planing of each province and municipality. These project areas are located in the water-
deficient areas of the North of China, groundwater has shown a tendency of overdraft,
the continuous descent of groundwater level and the continuous expansion of funnel area
are the main regional environmental problems. If the implementation of the project will
aggravate the shortage of water resources, especially in areas where groundwater is the
main irrigation water sources, if the implementation of the project will lead to or
aggravate the continuous descent of groundwater level is the focal point of the
assessment.
In order to increase the yield of agricultural production, it's anticipated that the applied
amnount of pesticide and fertilizer will increase for the regulation of planting structures, if
pesticide and fertilizer will pollute the soil and water environment is another assessment
focal point.
4



Because the project focuses on increasing the utilization factor of water resources, the
implementation of the project will exert positive impact on the rational use of water
resources and the socio-economic development in the beneficiary areas. We will focally
analyze the positive impact of the implementation of the project on resources,
environment, society and economy.
1.3.4 Objectives of environmental protection
Because most of the project areas are irrigated with groundwater, the essential objective
to be protected is concentrated mainly on groundwater environment.
The implementation of water saving irrigation should balance water resources supply and
demand and needn't result in the continuous descent of groundwater level and the
continuous expansion of funnel area.
Adopting effective measures to apply pesticide and fertilizer rationally and ensuring not
to aggravate groundwater and other environmental pollution.
1.4 Assessment level
The construction of the project focuses on the utilization of water resources, the desired
effect for the construction of the project is that it can increase the utilization factor of
water resources and reduce the waste of irrigation water looking from the overall and
long-term point of views. It's an environment improvement project with respect to the
impact of agricultural production on water resources. The adverse impacted scope and
degree of the project on enviromnent is limited according to the principles for level
division from the Environmental Monitoring Document No. [1993] 324 and the World
Bank (OP4.01). So the environmental assessment level of the project is B, however, the
continuous descent of groundwater level and the continuous expansion of funnel area in
some regions are the focus of the project. Therefore, assessment on the implementation
of the project on the impact of the descent of groundwater level and groundwater quality
will be strengthened both in depth and breadth.
1.5 Assessment principles
The environmental impact assessment of the project will enforce the laws, regulations
and some relevant standards for enviromnental protection of the state, meet the
stipulations and demands on environmental impact assessment in International Financial
Organization Loan Project and the demand for depth and assessment component in the
"Guideline for Environmental Impact Assessment of the World Bank (OP4.01)".
Analyzing the project's possible environment impact according to the feasibility study
report from each project area, carrying out assessment through typical investigation,
analogy, reasoning and conclusion etc. methods and demonstrating the feasibility of the
project and the rationality of the drafted environmental protection measures in view of
5



environmental protection.
Because these project areas are broad and scattered and the impact of the adoption of
sprinkler irrigation, micro irrigation, drip irrigation, pipe irrigation and canal lining etc.
measures, the change of crops and water duty and the application of pesticide and
fertilizer etc. many factors, the assessment objective is regional environmental impact
and realize the integration from point to surface and focal analysis in methods.
1.6Assessment procedures and planing
The assessment planing and working procedures of the project is shown in chart 1.
1.7 Assessment work and introduction of the assessment department
The environmental impact assessment of the water conservation project can be made by
two gradations, i.e. compiling and completing each provincial and municipal
environmental impact assessment report and then completing the general report of the
environmental impact assessment. The environmental impact assessment report of each
province and municipality was completed directed by China Institute for Water
Resources and Hydropower Research (IWHR) and assisted by each provincial and
municipal relevant department and the general report of the environmental impact
assessment was completed by IWHR.
China Institute for Water Resources and Hydropower Research (IWHR) has the first
level environmental impact assessment certificate issued by the State's Environmental
Protection Bureau. She is a multi-purpose institute engaging in the assessment of water
conservation and electric power etc. resources, environmental protection and engineering
construction, she has directed and participated in many environmental impact
assessments of water conservation, electric power, agriculture and regional development.

2.1.3 Project objective
The overall objectives of the project are 1) to increase the utilization factor of irrigation
water; 2) to increase the capability of comprehensive production of agriculture and
farmers' income, and 3) to promote the sustainable utilization of water resources and
sustainable development of agriculture.
According to "Technical Standard of Water Conservation Irrigation"(SL207-98) and
combining with the characteristics of the project and specific technical requirements of
the World Bank, the following main technical indexes for the water saving project have
been decided:
-The utilization factor of irrigation water should be more than 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7
respectively based on the size of irrigation works from large, medium and small. The
8



utilization factor of water by different irrigation patterns should be more than 0.80-0.85
for well irrigation, 0.85 for sprinkling irrigation and 0.9 for drip irrigation.
*The productivity of water should be increased at least by 20% and the cereal
productivity per unit ET is more than 1.5-1.8 kg/m3.
*The water saving volume in diversion is more than 20%.
-The target of production increase of cereal and cotton: The production increase of grain
and cotton is more than 15%.
*The target of revenue increase of farmers: The net revenue increase per farmer is more
than 200 Yuan.
-Economic and financial indexes: The financial IRR is more than 12% and the rate of
benefits and cost is more than 2:1 considering the risk analysis.
2.1.4 Project selection criteria
According to the strategic layout of the national development plan of water saving
irrigation, part of project counties located in the northern, northeast and northwest of
China where the water resources is insufficient have been selected. Project areas are
selected among the best according to the local financial capability, the initiative of local
governments and farmers, the amount of loan from the WB and the overall planning. The
basic principles for project selection are as follows:
*The region should be lack of water resources, Water saving irrigation is badly needed for
agriculture sustainable development; local government and farmers have high initiative
for the technology of water saving irrigation development. The contradiction regional
water resources supply and demand could be alleviated through the development of water
saving irrigation.
-The selected project area should have a certain foundation of irrigation works and

Technology of moisture retaining
Deep ploughing or non-tillage technology is planed to be adopted timely according
to the characteristics of crops and soil,. Non-tillage in dry season can reduce the
evaporation of soil and infiltration loss of irrigation water. Deep ploughing in rainy
season can increase the infiltration of precipitation and the capability of soil moisture
retaining. It should plough deeply once every 3-5 years and the depth of plough
should be 25-30 cm.
Temperature increasing and moisture retaining technology such as wheat stalk
shredding and plastic film covering
The covering of stalk or plastic film can not only increase the ground temperature,
but also greatly reduce the evaporation loss of soil and increase the utilization factor
of water. The stalk covering can be completed together with field stalk shredding
machine and harvester.

* Comprehensive management technology of water and fertilizer
According to water and fertilizer demand, it will adopt the method of applying
fertilizer through soil measuring and formula for balance fertilizer application. The
method of deep applying and increasing the utilization ratio of fertilizer are
recommended.
* Rationally regulating the planting structure of crops
According to the requirements of industrialized agriculture and in order to meet
social demands and achieve the optimum economic and ecological benefits, planing
structure of crops should be regulated rationally and the multiple crop index should
be increased. In the regions where advanced irrigation technologies have adopted
and the assurance coefficient of irrigation is higher should enlarge the planting
proportion of cash crops for increasing economic benefits and farmers income.
* Seed selection and cultivation technology of drought-resistance crops
Seed base will be established to select and cultivate fine varieties of drought-
resistance and high yield and realize the ratio of fine varieties in the project areas
reaching at least 95%. Advanced cultivation technology and in association with
moisture retaining technology to realize biological water conservation.

station at village, township and county level and popularizes and extends science and
technology of agriculture and water saving technology. The contents of service include
demonstration, consultant, technical instruction, technology contract and supervision and
monitoring of agricultural production conditions.
* Scientific research and technical assistance
The World Bank Loan Water Conservation Project includes many aspects of water
conservancy, agriculture, environment and management, of which, many technologies
are more advanced both at home and abroad. In order to solve the technical issues that
might come out or exist during the implementation of the project, it is necessary to
entrust related scientific research institutes or universities to undertake special studies of
applied technology and provide relative technical service to ensure the project achieve
the anticipated objectives. The planned applied study includes three aspects of irrigation
technology, agriculture and environment and management and monitoring, out of which,
12 items for irrigation technology research, 5 items for agricultural and environmental
research and 12 items for management study.
2.2.5Management water saving measures
The main management measures include establishing SIDD pilot and MIS.
In order to change the management mode that the state construct water conservancy
works and the masses can use water without payment under the planing economic
system, the project planed to establish SIDD mode, including WUA and WSP, which
manage by itself and assume sole responsibilities for its loss -and profit to maintain and
manage the operation of the irrigation system. Aiming to carry out management system

reform, improve the management of water resources, increase irrigation costs recovery,
the autonomous management capacity and increase the irrigation efficiency of the whole
project.
MIS is mainly used in computer system for design, construction, management,
supervision and assessment of the project, produces various diagram report for analysis
and decision making.
2.3 Project analysis
Water saving irrigation is the center of the project and agricultural, forest and
management measures are also given consideration in order to achieve the goal of saving
water, promoting the agricultural development, the sustainable utilization of water
resources and increase the farmers' revenue. It had been demonstrated from theories and
practices that advanced water saving irrigation technologies and the corresponding
agricultural measures will exert an important impact on agricultural production in
economic, social and environmental benefit. As to the water saving project itself, it won't
produce any waste gas, water and residue during construction and belongs to non-
pollution project. But water resources reallocating process dose exist in water saving
irrigation and may exert a certain impact on the environment. Moreover, the
improvement irrigation conditions, regulation of planting structures of crops, increase of
multiple crop index and pesticide and fertilizer application to a certain extent and the
construction process in order to increase the yield will also exert certain impact on the
environment.
2.3.lAnalysis on the impact of water conservancy project on environment
Water conservancy project includes water diversion and allocation works and field works
etc. many parts, its main impacts on environment are as follows:

-Impact of water resources utilization on environment
Water saving irrigation is a water resources utilization project, the change of irrigation
pattems will influence the utilization efficiency of water resources and the works will
influence the transformation of different water resources (surface water and groundwater,
shallow water and confined water). The difference of irrigation water sources, irrigation
patterns, irnigation volume, and local natural geography and water resources utilization
will also exert different degrees of impact on the environment. The project area of Hebei
Province is located in the north of China where water resources are short, groundwater is
the main water sources for industrial and agricultural development and domestic water
use, with the development of social economy, water demand will increase year by year.
The continuous descent of groundwater level has occurred in some regions, if the
construction of the project will aggravate or alleviate the descent of groundwater level is
the key point of the environmental impact assessment. Table 9 provides the water supply
limit under present status with the project and in the planed year without the project with
50% assurance factor in various project counties, table 2.10.1-2.10.5 provides water
demand after the implementation of the project.

The utilization factor of irrigation water will increase from 0.4-0.65 to 0.7-0.85 under
water saving irrigation conditions, the utilization factor of agricultural water resources
will increase remarkably and irrigation water demand will reduce more than the present.
So it's predicted that the contradiction between regional water resources demand and
supply will be alleviated after the implementation of the project.

The detailed data such as that of the above four provinces and municipalities was not
collected in each county of Shaanxi province, the statistical results of irrigation water
demand is provided in table 2.11.5.
-Impact of water saving irrigation on soil and groundwater quality
According to the water environment zonation and the initial investigation on irrigation
water quality, the irrigation water quality is up to the standard basically. And after the
implementation of the project, the volume of water seeping down will reduce, so the
anticipated impact of irrigation water quality on soil environment and the quality of
water body will be less.

2.3.2 Analysis on the impact of agriculture on environment
Planting structures will be regulated and the multiple crop indexes will be changed in
order to increase the yield of cereals, table 11 shows the regulation of planting structures.
This project does not finance any pesticides. It's 'anticipated that the applied quantity of
fertilizer will be increased to a certain extent, the application of fertilizer is shown in
table 12 and table 13. Fertilizer may pollute groundwater after being leached by
irrigation water. Moreover, other agricultural measures will also exert certain impact on
water environment, soil and ecology.

The regulation of planting structures will be beneficial to developing high efficient
agriculture and utilizing lands effectively, meanwhile, selecting less water consumption
crops is also an agricultural measure. The use of fertilizer is an important method to
increase the soil fertility and crops yield, however, the impact of fertilizer on water
environment is also a widespread concerned issue. The loss of Nitrogen and Phosphorous
in field is the main factor in water environment pollution and it will result in the pollution
of rivers, lakes and reservoirs, particularly result in the rich nutrition of lakes and
reservoirs and N03-N pollution of groundwater. Because the project is a water saving
irrigation project, no irrigation recession will be produced, and the adoption of
appropriate fertilizing measure will be beneficial to increasing the utilization factor of
fertilizer, it's anticipated that the project will not aggravate the surface water pollution
around. However, even though the recharge of irrigation recession to groundwater will be
reduced, there is still some infiltrated into groundwater, if the application of fertilizer will
result in N03-N pollution of groundwater or not is the main concerned issue after the
implementation of the project.

Because this project does not finance any pesticides, which is beneficial to alleviate the
potential impact of pesticide on enviromnent. However, the impact of the current use of
pesticide have been always concerned by experts and the masses, it's also an
environmental issue that the projects concern.

A lot of agricultural water saving, soil improvement and seed production measures will
be included during the implementation of the project. These measures will be beneficial
to increasing the utilization of water resources, improving the soil fertility and increasing
yield, but they can also exert certain impact on the environment, e.g. the left over film.
2.3.3Environment impact of construction process
Water delivery works, construction of bridges, culverts and roads and land leveling etc.
earthworks are included in the construction period. These field works, agricultural
earthwork and mechanical construction will result in partial and periodic pollution, such
as waste residue, noise and the loss of water and soil, and will be harmful to the
environment.
2.3.4Project impact on water resources utilization, social and economic development
The project anticipates to increase the utilization efficiency of water resources, reduce
agricultural water waste, promote the regulation of planting structures for the
improvement of irrigation conditions, increase the farmers' revenue and accelerate the
regional social economic development. It's anticipated that the construction of SIDD will
change the management patterns of water resources and raise the farmers' management
level.
2.4Identification and preparation of environmental impact factors
Because the involved regions of the assessing scope is scattered, the impact of regional
natural geographic conditions, irrigation water sources and irrigation patterns and
according to the project component, character, scale, regional location and construction
etc. character, two series matrixes should be arranged in tables for differentiating and
determining the environment impact factors. Then analyze these factors, prepare the
main assessing factors relevant with the project and detennine the assessing key points
and scope.
The purpose of the water saving irrigation project is to reduce the waste of water
resources, it won't discharge any pollutant and won't give rise to any social issues. The
project has huge social, economic and environmental benefits from a long-term point of
28



view, however, it will exert some adverse impacts on the environment for the utilization
of water resources, application of fertilizer and pesticide and the construction of the
project.
On the basis of integrating the character and component of the project and consulting
some experts of water conservancy, agriculture and environment, we selected some
environmental impact factors from its positive and adverse impact on the environment
and society, impact degree, impact time and impact scale during the construction and
operation of the project. The project's main adverse impacts were primarily determined
as follows:
-Partial discarded soil, soil and water loss and noises of machines etc. environmental
issues during the construction period of the project.
-If the water intake of the project will aggravate the continuous descent of groundwater
level in the northern water short districts or not.
*If the application of fertilizer and pesticide will give rise to or aggravate soil and water
pollution or not.
-Impact of other agricultural measures on the environment.

3.Project area
3.1Geography
3.1.1 Topography
Most of the pilot projects are distributed in plains and rolling basins while the others
are in valley plains. The terrain is flat and open- wide mostly. Among them, the
Beijing project area is located in the north part of North- China plain with the terrain
changing from mountain, hilly land and rolling area to alluvial- diluvial upland and
plain gradually from west to east, north to south. The surface relief in plain area is
wide and open. The sub-projects of Beijing project are located mainly in the
pediments areas of Yongding River, Chaobai River, Jiyun River and Daqing River
with flat and open terrain and 55%-65% cultivated lands. The projects in Hebei
Province are mainly located in the rolling areas to the east of Taihang Mountain and
west and middle part of Haihe plain. The terrain slopes from west to east. Among of
them, Shexian and Jingsing, Yuanshi and Yehe projects are distributed in the
transition belt of rolling areas and plains when the projects in Linzhang, Feixiang,
Guantao and Chengan are in the upper and middle streams of Zhangweihe plain with
flat and open- wide terrain. The areas of cultivated land account for nearly 65% to
75% of the total areas. The projects in Qingdao city are located in rolling basin and
valley plain. The areas of cultivated land account for nearly 60% to 70% of the total
areas. The landscape in Shenyang City varies from hilly rolling areas in north and
east part to broad plain in west part. The terrain slopes from east to west. The project
areas are distributed mainly in alluvial plains of Liao River and Hun River when
some of them are in roling areas or in the transition belt of rolling area and plain. The
average altitude above sea level varies from 30 to 50 meters. The area of cultivated
lands is make up of nearly 60% to 70% of the total areas.
3.1.2 Climate
The whole project covers three climatic zones. The Qingdao project areas are located
in marine and monsoon climate zone when the climate of Hebei, Beijing and
Shenyang projects are semi-arid and semi- humid continental monsoon climate of
temperate zone. The common characters of the three climatic zones are distinctive
seasons, windy spring, hot and rainy summer and cold and dry winter. Nearly 70% of
rainfall is concentrated in June, July, August and September with great varieties
annually. The rain comes together with hot weather, which is beneficial for the
growth of crops. But the cold and drought winter and windy spring is unfavorable for
the growth of winter wheat and the seeding, budding and growing of crops seeding in
spring. Owing to the shortage and uneven distribution of rainfall in time and space,
the efficient amount of rainfall is less than the normal demand of crops during the
each growth period of main crops. The water shortage is the reason that irrigation is
the basic measures to guarantee the high- yield of crops in these areas. The
precipitation in most of the counties (cities and districts) in project areas is only
500mm to 650 mm when the rainfall in a few areas is 650mm to 700 mm or less than
500 mm. It indicates that these areas are the ones lack of water resources, either
31



surface water or groundwater or both of them. High efficient water saving measures
should be the guarantee of sustainable utilization of water resources.
3.1.3 Soil and plant
The type of soil has influence not only on the growth of crops but also on the seepage
and recharge of groundwater, storage of water and soil moisture in agricultural lands
and water-saving irrigation. The geographic distribution of soil is very complex. The
soil type in the whole project areas can be divided into three catagories mainly, when
the soil in projects in Qingdao city and Shenyang City is of brown soil (yellowish-
brown earth) of Jiaodong- Liaodong rolling areas , deposit soil in Liaohe plain and
small part of sandy yellow and black soil. The soil of Beijing project areas and 8
counties of Hebei projects are yellow wet soil, Lou soil, brown soil when the one in
Beijing and Hebei is of wet- yellow soil of Haihe plain with middle soil quality.
All types of soil mentioned above are suitable for the growth of many kinds of crops
such as wheat, corn, bean, cotton, vegetable and fruits. The major crops planted in the
project areas now are winter wheat, spring wheat, spring corn, summer corn, rice,
bean, peanut, cotton, patato, watermelon, vegetables, apple, pear, peach, apricot and
grape, etc.
3.1.4 River system
The 62 project counties (cities and districts) are distributed in the mid-downstream
or mid-upperstream areas of 34 large rivers. Both the surface water and groundwater
are the main sources of the project areas. There are main stems or major tributaries
of 5 large rivers flowing through the project areas in Beijng, which are Yongding
River, Chaobai River, Wenyu River, Jiyuan River and Dashi River. Because these
rivers have plentiful water resources with midium or coarse sand or sandy cobble as
the river beds, all the rivers recharge the surface and ground water in the project
areas. In Hebei areas, there are main stems or major tributary of 4 large rivers
passing by which are Zhanghe River, Weihe River, Fuyang River and Futuo River.
The conditions of water resources are similar to that of in Beijing. The main stems
or major tributary of rivers passing by Qingdao city are Dagu River, Xiaogu River,
Jiaolai River, Zehe River, Taoyuan River and Ziyang River. The conditions here are
similar, too. The 8 project counties in Shenyang city are located in middle streams
of Liaohe River and Hunhe River when all the 12 major tributaries and main stems
are passing by the project areas. As the quantity of water resources passing by is
abundant and the seepage capability of river bed are strong, the surface water and
groundwater in these areas are recharged substantially.
3.1.5 Hodrogeography
According to the geological structure, landform, topography and the storage
conditions of groundwater, the whole project areas are divided into 2 major hydro-
geological units which are mountainous areas and plain areas. The mountainous areas
are divided into intermontane basin, valley plain and terrace area of loess plateau
whereas the plain area are divided into alluvial- diluvial plain in the front of
mountains and diluvial- lake plain in the middle section with regard to the landscape,
32



lithological feature and hydrogeologic conditions.
The Beijing projects are located between the middle section of North- China upland
and west section of Yanshan Mountain deposit belt. The mountainous regions are
formed by Archacozoic ear gneiss, Upper and Middle Proterozoic erathem clastic
rocks, Lower Paleozoic erathem dolomite and limestone, etc. The Quatemary system
is well- developed. Groundwater is stored in Quatemary system pore while the
aquiferous strata of Quaternary system are distributed in alluvial- diluvial plain
regions. The potential yield of groundwater in the front of mountains is not high
(single well capacity generally within 1500m3/d to 3000 m3/d). In the top sections of
alluvial - diluvial fan, the potential yield is quite good with single well capacity
within 3000- 5000 m3/d. Following is the middle section of alluvial - alluvial fan
with single well capacity within 1500-3000 m3/d. This area is the main exploited
area with the depth to water varying from 4 to 1Om or even more higher than that. For
the plain areas in the middle and lower part of alluvial - alluvial fan, the aquifers
strata is composed of multiple layers of sand and some gravels with several layer and
fine articles , of which the single well capacity is over 1OOOm3/d, less than 500 m3/d
in some parts and the confined depth to water is 4- 1 Om or over 20m seldom. The
projects of Beijing are mainly distributed in the upper, middle and lower part of
alluvial - alluvial fan.
The Hebei projects are mainly located in the east section of Haihe plain and the
rolling areas in the front of Taihang Mountain, whereas the Shexian project area and
Jingxing project area is in rolling areas irrigated by surface water and Yuanshi and
Yehe project area are irrigated by surface water and groundwater combined with
surface water as the main source. The other project areas exist in the middle region of
Zhanghe river and Weihe river while groundwater is the main source of irrigation.
The aquifer systems in Jingxing, Yuanshi and Yehe project areas belong to the type
of bedrock pore- fissure water with carbonate- karst water in some cases while
among them there is alluvial- diluvial aquiferous system in valley plain areas and
rolling basin. Situated in the upper stream of Zhanghe river, the project areas in
Shexian belongs to mountainous hydorgeologic unit with well developed carbonate
karst auriferous system and alluvial- alluvial aquifer in valley basin areas. The project
areas in Feixiang, Chengan, Linzhang and Guantao county exist in the alluvial-lake
plain areas in the south of Hebei province with 3 main aquifers in vertical which are:
the first aquifer is belt- like developed along the direction of east- north to east. Its
lithological feature is fine sand and clayey sand with the thickness within 10 to 30m
and the coefficient of hydraulic conductivity varies within 100- 300 m2/d, and 300-
500 m2/d in old riverbed areas. Saline-water is well developed in this area with fresh
water containing mineral concentration within 3 to 5g/L. The depth to water is less
than 1Om. The water is of fresh- saline or saline type. The second aquifers strata is
mainly composed of medium fine sand and fine sand formed by the alluvial and lake
action of rivers from Taihang Mountain, stretching from north to east like a belt.
There is a thicker layer of clay soil or sub-clay soil between the first and second
aquifer usually. So the recharge condition in vertical direction is poor due to the well
confined layers. Influenced by ancient climate, saline layer is well developed in these
areas especially in the upper part of this strata with the fresh and salt- water
33



distributing inter layers and the amount of mineral concentration is less than 2 g/L.
The thickness of saline layer is increasing along the direction of west to east and the
mineral concentration is within 2 to 5g/L. The third aquifer situated in the middle
plain is composed of medium and fine sand. The aquifer is developed along the
direction of east-north and east to east-north as a line. The mineral concentration is
0.5-0.7g/L while single well capacity varying within 10 to 50m3/(h.m) and the depth
to water is 10 to 30m. There is usually a sub-clay layer more than I Om thick existing
between this aquifer and the second aquifer which leads to a bad recharge condition
among aquifers. The fourth aquifer is composed mainly of medium and fine sand and
fined sand with the thickness within 20 to 50m. It is formed by the action of thick
clay, sub-clay and aquatic sand layer with bad seepage capability and weak quantity
yield. The depth to water is in the order of 8 to 20m with the mineral concentration
amount less than 1.Og/L and the single well capacity generally within 5 to 20 m3
/(h.m).
All the projects in Qingdao City are located in lower rolling areas with different
geological layers. In north and east part of Jiaodong area, it is composed of
Archaeozoic ear and Proterozoic erathem metamorphosed granite with well
developed Mesozoic ear intruded granite in the north - east of Pingdu City, north part
of Laixi county and south-east part of Jiaonan area. In these areas Cenozoic erathem
Quatemary system layers are well distributed over the rocks directly which are
mainly in lower rolling areas and plain areas. According to the storage condition of
groundwater, the lithological feature and characteristic of hydrology, the aquiferous
strata was divided into 4 types, including loose rocks pore- fissure water as the first
aquifer which mainly exists besides the intermontane valleys. It is formed by alluvial-
alluvial layer, which is usually in double structure. The upper part of it is of clayey
sand soil or sandy soil while the lower part of it is of sand and gravel with the
thickness within 1 to 20m. The depth to water is less than 15m. The thickness of sand
layer of water in Jiaolai plain varies within 3- 10 m with the depth to water from 2 to
5 m. In the middle and upper part of Dagu River, the thickness of sand layer of water
is of 5 - lOm with the single well capacity within 1000-3000m3/d and 500-l000m3/d
or less than that in the frontier of valley areas. Most of the projects in Qingdao are
located in this hydrogeologic unit. The second type is clastic rocks fissure water
distributed mainly in Laizhou, Jimo, west part of Laoshan mountain, north and west
part of Pingdu and south and east part of Laixi, etc. The single well capacity is less
than 100 m3/d. The karst regions are developed near fracture zone with increased
surge capacity. The third type is carbonate fissure water. The karst regions are
developed in the rolling area of Laixi and Pingdu. The regions with slope structure
has good potential yield with the single well capacity within 500- I000m3/d and over
I000m3/d in some part of Pingdu, less than 100m3/d in karst regions in rolling areas
of Jiaonan. The fourth type is metamorphose rock and karst water with small single
well capacity.
The Shenyang projects are mainly located in the intersection of Liaodong
mountainous regions and Liaohe plain. The landfonn changes from denudation lower
mountainous rolling areas, denudation terrace upland to alluvial-diluvial fan and
plains between fan and alluvial-diluviai plain. The geographic layer of Quartenary
34



system has been developed well with alluvial- diluvial fan formed by middle and
lower Pleistocene series glacial drift layer and cobble of alluvial-diluvia, upland-
alluvial action in upper Pleistocene series and cobble of alluvial-alluvia action in
Holocene series, sand and gravel layer formed by alluvial action in upper and middle
Pleistocene series. There is abundant pore phreatic water and confined pore water
with the single well capacity within 1000-5000m3/d. This aquifer is the main source
of Shenyan city fed by seepage of rainfall, river and groundwater. Most areas here
have small slope and shallow depth to water so the velocity of flow is low. But in the
back and middle part of alluvial-alluvial fan and the sides of valley areas, the
groundwater is well recharged with strong water cycle owing to the exploitation by
city. The groundwater flows from east to west naturally. It is found that an artificial
exploited flow field has been formed in the city area with the aggregation of
groundwater from each direction. At the same time, artificial withdrawal, phreatic
evaporation and channel drainage are the processes of groundwater discharge. The
natural water quality is good which is fresh water with low concentration of dissolved
solid. The distribution of high concentration fluoride water in north part of Xinmin
city and high concentration of Fe and Mn in groundwater in the most part of alluvial
plain areas has been found.

Yield of crops and potentials for increase
The yield of crops differs much in each project area for difference of natural
conditions, irrigation conditions and management level. For instance, the yield of
wheat in Qingdao, Beijing and Hebei is 5925 kg/ha, 5628kg/ha and 4180 kg/ha
respectively due to good natural conditions and high management level, however, it's
only 2499 kg/ha in Shenyang due to poor natural conditions and low management
level.
3.3Generals for the construction of water conservancy works
3.3.1Generals of constructed water conservancy works
The four provinces and municipalities had all invested many manpower and material .
resources to construct water conservancy works and irrigation and drainage works
since 1950's, these works had played an important role in resisting natural disasters
and ensuring the high and stable yield of agriculture. The present status of water
conservancy works in the four provinces and municipalities is provided in table 3.4.

3.3.2Main existing problems during construction of water conservancy works
*The degree of corollary is very low. Most of the present large and medium reservoirs
were built in 1950's and 1960's, their construction standards were very low and
corollaries were very poor, most of the works aged seriously, decreased in benefit
and short of funds for modification after many decades of operation. At present,
approximately 43% of the cultivated lands have no irrigation conditions and the
utilization factor of irrigation water is very low in the cultivated lands where there
are irrigation conditions, its average is only 0.4. All of these result in that the
assurance coefficient of irrigation water on most of the farmlands is low and can't
ensure harvest in drought and flood years.
*Backward in irrigation techniques and installations. At present, the traditional
surface irrigation is usually adopted in most of the project areas, the irrigation
efficiency is low and increase water demand and lead to the non-beneficial loss
and percolation of irrigation water for unreasonable size of border checks
(furrows) and poor land leveling.
*The corollary rate of some electromechanical equipment in well irrigated areas is
low. Irrigation facilities damaged seriously for poor management and can't bring
the efficiency of motor-pumped wells into full play.
3.3.3Role of irrigation in agricultural production
Agriculture depends on irrigation to a great extent in the project area for the uneven
distribution of precipitation and it has become the biggest water demander and water
consumer. At present, its water consumption is approximately 72% of the total
amount.
37



The main problems confronted during the development of irrigation are as follows:
-Irrigation water resources are scarce. With the development of industrialization and
urbanization, more and more irrigation water has been occupied by industrial and
urban use and it's difficult to reverse the tendency of changing agricultural water
resources use to non-agricultural water resources use.
*Water storage and allocation works are inadequate. Most of the water sources for
irrigation in the project area are not single one, they are not only surface water, but
also groundwater and the surface water include the water in reservoirs, rivers,
ponds and the sewage water drained from cities. Because the scarcity of water
storage and allocation works, many separate water sources can't be utilized. The
utilization factor of irrigation water is low. The corollary of irrigation works is very
poor, the irrigation technique is backward and the development of water saving
irrigation can't catch up with the development of agriculture.
-The management level is low. They are lack of perfect management system for water
resources and irrigation and some relevant policies, laws and regulations are not
perfect.
4 Present status of environmental quality and water resources assessment
4.lPollution source
Even though industrial and domestic pollution sources exist in some counties in view
of administrative regions, most of the sub project areas are distributed in the extensive
rural areas, the impact of the industrial and domestic pollution on these areas is very
low. Moreover, pollution had also been controlled well with the state's closing down,
stopping, transforming and merging the "fifteen small industries", therefore, there
will be no large industrial pollution source in the project areas, the industrial pollution
sources in some project counties can't exert any impact on the construction of the
project area. The main impact on soil and water environment is agricultural pollution
sources.
4.2Soil environment quality
4.2.1 Soil fertility
The conditions of soil fertility is the basis for the improvement of low yield field, it's
an important component during the construction of the project and relates with the
application of fertilizer, therefore, we assessed the soil fertility in various districts
according to the reference index provided in table 4.1.

The conditions of soil fertility in each project area are provided in table 4.2.
Hebei project area
There are 7864 ha low yield field in the project area amounting to 26% of the total
cultivated area, the content of organic matter is usually about 0.8%, Nitrogen is
0.05-0.06%, high effective Phosphorous is 5.2-6.5ppm, effective Potassium is
64-83ppm, Phosphorous and Potassium are very short. The area of middle yield field
is 20765.7 ha, the content of organic matter is about 0.92-1.31, Nitrogen is
0.07-0.09%, high  effective  Phosphorous  is  6.8-14ppm, effective  Potassium   is
7910130ppm. There are totally 817 ha high yield field, the content of nutrient is
1.1-1.7%, Nitrogen is 0.13-0.16%, high effective Phosphorous is 10.3-13.9ppm  and
effective Potassium is about 95ppm.
The average content of Nitrogen in the high yield field of the project area is 0.13%,
effective Phosphorous is 12.10 PPm, effective Potassium  is 96.5OPPm, organic
matter is 1.39%. The average content of Nitrogen in the middle yield field of the
project area is 0.07%, effective Phosphorous is 8.86 PPm, effective Potassium  is
108 . 15 P Pm, organic matter is 1.16%. The average content of Nitrogen in the low
yield field of the project area is 0.06%, effective Phosphorous is 6.0 PPm, effective
Potassium is 8 1PPm, organic matter is 0.88% and the soil fertility is the third level.
Shenyang project area
Most of the content of organic matter is between 0.1% and 2.5% and its average is
1.63%; of which, the area where the content of organic matter is more than 2.0%
amounts to 74% and mainly distributes in Xinmin, Sujiatun, Xinchengzi and Yuhong;
the area where the content of organic matter is between 1.0% and 2.0% amounts to
2.7% and mainly distributes in Xinchengzi and Yuhong; the area where the content of
organic matter is less than 1.0%  amounts to 23.1%  and mainly distributes in Xinmin
and Faku.
The average nitrogen content in the project area is 0.094%, phosphorous is 5.5ppm
39



and potassium is 103ppm and the soil fertility is on the third grade in line with some
relevant classification indexes of soil fertility.
It can be seen from the tested results of soil nutrient that the content of nitrogen and
organic matter is the medium, phosphorous is lack and the overall soil fertility of low
yield field is poorer. It's planed that the annual applied quantity of nitrogenous
fertilizer, phosphate fertilizer, potash fertilizer and compound fertilizer will increase
by 2% and mainly used for the improvement of low yield field.
Beijing project area
According to the monitoring results of soil in Beijing, the organic matter content of
soil is between 0.70% and 1.35% and its weighted average is 1.15%; the content of
full nitrogen is between 0.06% and 0.8% and its weighted average is 0.073%; the
content of high effective phosphorous is between 10 ppm and 20 ppm and its
weighted average is 18 ppm, the content of full potassium is between 2.0% and 2.8%,
the content of effective potassium is between 80 ppm and 160 ppm and its weighted
average is 106 ppm.
More cereals, vegetable and other agricultural products should be produced in the per
unit area cultivated land due to the reduction of cultivated land, increase of
populations and improvement of people's living standard. The farmers in some
districts have transferred their vitality from farm cultivation to the second and third
industries in recent years, invest less to lands and make the soil nutrient content can't
meet the demand for production. According to the statistics, 60.9% vegetable field is
lack of organic matter, 50.33% vegetable is lack of full nitrogen, 48.1% vegetable
field is lack of full phosphorous and 74% vegetable field is lack of effective
potassium. The soil nutrient content of cereal areas in plain is usually less than that of
vegetable field, its content of organic matter will be less by 1.28%, full nitrogen will
be less by 0.021%, effective phosphorous will be less by46 ppm and effective
potassium will be less by 30 ppm. Soil fertility monitoring in nine locations had been
undertaken in Changping county and concluded that the content of effective
phosphorous had decreased by 1-35.8 ppm and the content of effective potassium had
decreased by 23.9 ppm and influenced the soil quality seriously.
4.2.2Soil heavy metal
We are lack of the monitoring data of the soil heavy metal in the project area except
that Guantao County had collected the data of soil heavy metal distribution. The
measured contents of heavy metals 20 cm under the sampling surface are shown in
the   following   table,   Pb:12-15mg/kg,Cr:0.4-0.5mg/kg,Hg:0.18-
0.2mg/kg,As:4.9-5mg/kg.

Thus it can be seen that the contents of Pb, Cr, Hg, As in the soil are not
exceeded the soil quality standard type I of the state and they belong to the natural
background.
The content of soil heavy metal in Shenyang municipality project area is provided in
table 4. According to the practically tested data by districts and counties in the project
area, the content of some heavy metals tested 20 centimeters beneath the sampling
surface in each county and district is that: Pb is 9.01-39.43mg/kg, Cd is 0.076-
0.2989mg/kg, Cr is 32.35-73.75mg/kg, Hg is 0.0227-0.1139mg/kg and As is 4.88-

Comparing with the state soil environment quality, the content of Cr, Hg and As in
the tested soil has not exceeded the first grade according to the state soil environment
quality standard and involved in the natural background scope. The content of Pb and
Cd in many sampling places also involved in the first grade scope. However, the
content of Pb and Cd in Yuhong district has exceeded the natural background value,
of which, the pollution index of Cd based on the natural background value is 1.5 and
the pollution index of Pb based on the natural background value is 1.13 and exceeded
the background value, they are in the second grade. it can also be seen from the table
that the monitoring value of the five heavy metal elements is the maximum in Yuhong
district.
The content of heavy metal in some sampling places in Qingdao municipality project
area (detailed in table 4.5) is conformed with the stipulation of "standard for soil
environment quality" (GB15618-95), we will adopt singe factor pollution index
method during assessment on soil heavy metal content. It can be seen from the
monitoring results that all of the heavy metal index didn't reach the natural
background value (the first classification) except that the soil heavy metal index in
41



Pingdu and Pingxi samping places is more than 0.3, this shows that the soil quality is
fine and hasn't been polluted by heavy metal.

4.3 Present Situation of Quality of Surface Water Environment
4.3.1 Water Quality of Irrigation Water Sources
In Hebei Project Region, the surface water used here belongs to the middle and upper
reaches of Zhangwei and Ziya river system. The main rivers and reservoirs used as
irrigation water source are Qingzhanghe river (Shexian project area), Bayi reservoir
(Yuanshi project area), Mianhe river (Jingjing project area) and Gangnan reservoir
(Yehe project area). Because these project areas are located in the backward
countryside where without key objectives for environmental protection, the
environmental monitoring work is not perfected. The monitoring results of surface
water quality in the project area are shown in table 20. According to the Standard for
Quality of Surface Water Environment(GB3838-88), the water quality is type V in
Mianhe river channel and the primary pollutant is CODCr, while other indexes are up
to the standard. The water quality is type III measured in Liujiazhuang section of
Qingzhanghe River, the main pollutant is dissolved oxygen. The water quality in Bayi
reservoir is fine and belongs to type I, Yehe irrigated area mainly deliver the water.
from Gangnan reservoir and we have no detailed data currently, the water quality is
type II viewed from the water body zonation. Therefore, the water quality of each
water body can meet the demand for irrigation water quality.

There are total 8 large or medium-sized rivers and dozen small rivers in Shenyang
Project Region. The quality of these river water is polluted to some scale because
inflow of industrial and domestic sewage coming from Kangping County, Faku
County, Liaozhong County, Xinchengzi and Xinmin city in territory of Shenyang.
According to the monitoring results of water quality of large or midium-sized rivers
in Shenyang conducted by Shenyang Environmental Monitoring General Station,
organic pollution is predominant for rivers in project region. Based on Standard of
Quality of Surface Water Environment(GB3838-88), the water quality of most river
sections exceeds Class IV standard, and that of sections passing city area exceeds
Class V standard and pollution in low-water period is serious. There are six indexes
whose annual average value exceeding Class IV standard for Huanhe River, i.e. COD,
BOD, Petroleum, volatile phenol, NH3-N and permanganate index. The water quality
of Liaohe River is better than that of Hunhe River, there are three items whose annual
average value exceeding Class IV standard, i.e. COD, pernanganate index and NH3-
N. In other six rivers, the pollution of Jieximu River is most serious, followed by Liu
River and Shahe River, with COD exceeding Class V for many years and Dissolved
Oxygen nearing zero. Xiushui River and Raoyang River are with light pollution.
Except for COD and permanganate index nearing Class V standard, other indexes of
Puhe River are relatively low.
The recent monitoring results of samples of Hunhe River and Liaohe River are shown
in Table 4-8. According to Standard of Surface Water Quality, BOD5 is over Class V
standard and some CODcr reached Class V standard. According to Standard of
Quality of Farmland Irrigation Water, all tested items are complied with requirements
of Class I, II and III.

According to requirements on functional zonation of Shenyang surface water
environment approved by Shenyang Government in 1997, the water quality of Hunhe
River and Liaohe River in project region still could not reach the goal of functional
zone programming, but it could meet agricultural irrigation demand if serving as
farmland irrigation water sources.
The monitoring result of surface water quality in Qingdao project region indicated
that various water bodies could meet quality requirement of agricultural irrigation
water. The quality of Xiaogu River, Chanzhi Reservoir, Dazashan Reservoir and
Shanzhou Reservoir meet Class I-III standard of Surface Water Environment Quality
Criteria" (GB3838-88) and being better than Standard of Farmland Irrigation Water
Qualtiy. The water quality of Jilihe Reservoir and Daguhe Reservoir is Class IV or
Class V meeting requirement of farmland irrigation water quality.

In Beijing project region, Miyun County and Chaoyang District are irrigated with
surface water. The area developed with surface water is in secondary water source
reserve north of Miyun Reservoir. The Beichengzi Reservoir(middle-sized) and
Yaoqiaoyu Reservoir(middle-sized) in northern mountain area are belong to Mangniu
River and Andamu River respectively. There is no industry polluting water source
within two river basins and local agriculture is prohibited for using poisonous
pesticide. While water quality is comply with Class II of National Surface Water
Enviromnent Quality and reaching quality standard of potable water source. Irrigation
with such clean water source will not cause pollution to surface water and
groundwater.
Southern project area of Miyun County is located in side of Jingmi Canal and
downstream of Shachang Reservoir(middle-sized) where water quality reaching Class
11-III standard of National Surface Water Environment Quality, and irrigation water
there will not cause pollution to water environment.
The Changyang area using with surface water is located in Laiguangying where
surface water coming from Yangfang Reservoir, downstream of Qinghe River, and
Beixiaohe, tributary of Bahe River. Upstream of Qinghe River has more heavy
pollution caused by living sewage, after flowing with distance of 30km, the pollution
index are greatly reduced. Although water quality is between Class IV to V, main
pollutants are organic ones of NH3-N, CODcr and BOD5. Beixiaohe River is less
45



polluted than Qinghe River with primary pollutants of organism, and meeting quality
standard for irrigation.
4.3.2 Irrigation Backwater Situation in Project Region
According to the information and programming of PMOs, there is no large
quantity of backwater in present irrigating farmland of project region, so water
quality information as to present farmland backwater were not gathered. Moreover,
according to the project program, the implementation of water saving irrigation works
won't produce backwater on the whole, the drain discharge of irrigation water will be
further reduced. Therefore, it's not necessary to make assessment on the impact of
water saving irrigation on the surface water quality. The focal point of this assessment
is the impact on groundwater quality.
4.4 Present Situation of Groundwater Environment Quality
Within Hebei Project Region, the regional groundwater environment here is fine,
four project areas of Feixiang, Cheng'an, Linzhang and Guantao are irrigated mainly
with groundwater, some of the monitoring results of groundwater quality are shown
in Table4-1O. According to the Standard for Groundwater Quality GB/T  14848-
93, Single Factor Assessing Method will be used for assessment. The groundwater
quality in Feixiang, Cheng'an and Linzhang is Class III with main influencing factors
of hardness and S042- . The quality of water body in Linzhang is ClassII. The content
of NO3-N in the groundwater of the agricultural regions is very low, this shows that
field fertilizer has not exerted any evident impact on groundwater.
According to monitoring data, the degree of mineralization of groundwater in Hebei
project area is less than 2g/1 except part of Guantao project area is more than
2g/1.

Within Shenyang Project Region, the monitoring result of groundwater quality is
shown in Table4-1 1, which indicated that N03-N, N1H3-N and Fe reaching level of
Class IV-V among 10 assessed indexes. They have become important factors
influencing local water quality reduction. In view of largest application of N among
all fertilizers and nitrate ion not easily absorbing by soil while easily entering
groundwater, so the analysis about impact tendency of nitrate on groundwater will be
made in next section.

Within Qingdao Project Region, the groundwater mineralization degree is all less
than 2g/l (the highest is 0.8g/1), pH value is between 7.2-8.5, the groundwater is
weak acid. The water used for irrigation in the project area is mainly shallow
groundwater. According to the requirements in Groundwater Quality Criteria
(GB/T14848-93), the evaluation results of present groundwater quality in project area
are shown in Table 4-11. Class of water quality is all III or IV, which meet the
requirements for agricultural irrigation. High content of F-in some region is caused by
local geological conditions and is irrelevant to artificial pollution.

Beijing Project Region The groundwater quality in Beijing suburb is featured with
47



obvious polarization. The sound water quality is accounting for 52.69% of total
monitoring well and with worse quality of 47.31%. Analyzing in general, most
municipal groundwater resources belong to cleaning water resources. For not
qualified water, major parameters exceeding standard are mineralization, total
hardness, chloride, N nitrate and fluoride.
The mineralization degree of groundwater in project region exceeds 1OOOmg/l, only
2.7% scattered in Banjie River, Tongzhou. The groundwater quality in remote suburb
is better than that in nearby suburb because of light groundwater pollution in former
area. In view of general groundwater quality in remote suburb, Tongzhou, Daxing and
Changping are influenced mainly by industrial pollution, while lighter pollution in
Miyun and Pinggu. The project areas using groundwater are scattered in 7
districts/counties. The municipal groundwater quality is better than surface water
quality, the quality is basically comply with standard for irrgation water quality
except small area in south-eastern part of Tongzhou not meeting standard for
agricultural irrigation water quality.
4.5 Analysis of Present Situation of Water Shortage in Project Region
Generally there are two sorts of water shortage in project region, "resource-type
shortage" and "engineering-type shortage". The water shortage in well irrigation area
belongs to resource-type and that in reservoir irrigated area belongs to engineering-
type, while partial area there is resource-type.
4.5.1 Analysis of Water Shortage in Well Irrigation Area
Different well irrigation area has different situation on water shortage. Some well
irrigation areas lacking water seriously and will getting more serious in the case of
without water saving measures, while some other well irrigation areas are not lacking
water obviously now, even being plenty of it, but will encounter shortage situation
along with the development of industry and agriculture.
At present, well irrigation area of Daxing, Fangshan, Pinggu, Chaoyang, Changping
and Tongzhou basically belong to resource-type water shortage, and the situation will
become more serious in the case of without water saving engineering. Although water
supplied by reservoir dominantly, the most well irrigation area in Miyun project
region belongs to resource-type shortage. In Guantao of Hebei province, Linzhang,
Chengan and Feixiang are not only lacking water now and in future in case of without
water saving engineering, but water quality is unsatisfied. Although there is much
reserves of shallow and deep groundwater resources, they have worse condition for
utilization. Reservoir irrigation is predominant in Yuanshi and Yehe, partial well
irrigation area is resource-type water shortage.
The well irrigation area of Pingdu, Jimo, Laixi and Chengyang of Qingdao are all
belong to resource-type water shortage, and will need more water if no water saving
engineering. The aquifer of Qingdao well irrigation area is relatively shallow with
small amount of reserves. The municipal reserve approaches to natural resources, it is
two times than exploritation amount, this reflect that aquifer has not adjusting
capability. Except Miaolan funnel area of Pingdu, other well irrigation areas could
not, although lacking water, reflect situation of shortage subject to variation of buried
48



depth of groundwater level.
The well irrigation areas of Shenyang generally realized balance of exploitation and
recharging or possessed potential for development. The exploitation degree of
groundwater within municipal scope is about 97%, while 65%-70% for Xinmin and
Liaozhong. Along with development of industry and agriculture, no matter municipal
area, Xinmin or Liaozhong, all will encounter problem of resource-type water
shortage in future without water saving engineering.
The situation about water shortage in provinces/municipalities is shown in Table 4-
12.

in 2010
4.5.2 Situation Analysis about Water Shortage in Reservoir Irrigation Area
All provinces/municipalities have some project areas supplied with reservoir water,
the total area is 27609ha accounting for 13.7% of total project area. The project areas
supplied with reservoir water mainly belong to engineering-type shortage, which is
caused by discounterpart works, aging and without repairing, and serious canal
seepage. Along with development of industry and agriculture, some such project
areas will encounter contradiction of resource-type shortage gradually in the case of
increased net water consumption. However, engineering-type water shortage is
predominant in such project areas supplied with reservoir water as Miyun of Beijing,
Jiaonan and Dazeshan of Qingdao, Yuanshi, She County and Jingjing of Hebei. The
major problems in these project areas are heavy loss of canal seepage and low
utilization efficiency of irrigation water, water supply demand could be satisfied as
long as enhancing utilization efficiency.

The groundwater is main industrial, agricultural and living water sources in project
areas. The following tables (5-2-1-5-5-4) are statistics on groundwater utilization and
variation of groundwater table in Hebei, Shenyang, Qingdao and Beijing. The general
situation on groundwater exploitation and recharge in project.regions is described
below. Except Miyun and Chaoyang reservoir irrigation area, the exploitation volume
of groundwater in Beijing seven counties/districts all exceed recharging volume, the
years average descent rate of groundwater table is 0.20-O.5Om/y(O.5m/y for well
irrigation area in Beijing Plain of Haihe system). The eight project counties in Hebei,
except reservoir supplied area of She County and Jingjing, all located in region of
over draft, the years average descent rate of groundwater table is 0.5-I.Om/year. To
pure well irrigation area in Qingdao, the years average descent rate of groundwater
table may be 0.6-1.Om/y in the case of without water saving and surface water
recharging. The present overdraft funnel area of groundwater is mainly located in
Pingdu and Chengyang, while groundwater table in other areas, because of easily
recharged, is less variated. The overdraft areas of Shenyang are located in municipal
area, the periphery finnel areas of overdrafting include Xinchengzi, Sujiatun, Yuhong
and Dongling, which is located in middle and lower section of flood alluvial area in
front of eastern mountain. Presently, most area is in balance situation on exploitation
and recharge, only small part area is being overdraft. In future case of without water
saving, the eight districts/counties in Shenyang will be found overdraft issue along
with development of industry and agriculture.

the process of nourishment of precipitation, field evaportransporation, runoff and
drainage will be considered mainly, they can be summarized as the following chart.

aP- recharge volume of groundwater from the infiltration of precipitation (of
which, a is the recharge coefficient from the infiltration of precipitation), mm;

(1)Water balance in the project area and calculating method of groundwater
level
Total water balance equation Total inflow - total outflow = total storage change volume  (1)
The storage change volume in aeration zone -*O0, the total storage volume =Ahep (ji
is the specific yield of aquifer), then equation (1) can be resolved to equation (2):
(P+WR+RSi+RGi)-(ETf+ ETfnf +WL+RS0+RG0)= AhOXi                        (2)
Fl Groundwater balance equation
total water recharge - total water discharge = total storage change volume (3)
Equation (3) can be resolved to equation (4):
(aP+,IR+GRS+RGj)-(WIR+WL+EG+RGO)= AhOp              (4)
Equation (4) can be changed to equation (5)
Ah=((aP+f3IR+GRS+RG1)-(WIR+WL+EG+RG0))/ p. (5)
It can also be shown as equation (6)

Thus, it can be concluded that the groundwater table gradient has positive correlation
with precipitation P, water supply from reservoir WR, the difference of inflow and
outflow of surface water and the inflow and outflow from groundwater runoff. While
it has negative correlation with pumped groundwater for industry and life use WL,
evaportransporation in cultivated land ETf and evaportransporation in non-cultivated
land ETfn.
>0    the mean annual groundwater level is showing a tendency to ascend
Ah   =0    the mean annual groundwater level is in balance
{<0    the mean annual groundwater level is showing a tendency to descend
The numerator in equation (5): aP is the mean annual recharge volume of
groundwater from the infiltration of precipitation. Of which, a is the recharge
coefficient of precipitation seepage, P is precipitation not related to the project
existence. CRS is the mean annual recharge from the infiltration of surface runoff that
has no relations with if there is the project. WL is the mean annual pumped
groundwater for industry and life and has close relations with if there is the project.
PIR is the seepage recharge of irrigation water and has close relations with WIR. So
with or without the project mainly affect WIR and 3Ir, the change of Ah mainly
depends on WIR and ,lr.
The numerator in equation (6): P is the mean annual precipitation, is the difference of
the mean annual inflow from surface water runoff and outflow from surface water
runoff and WL is the mean annual pumped groundwater for industry and life, they
can be determined by investigation. ETffif is evaportransporation in non-cultivated
area and mainly has relations with precipitation, evaporation capacity and infiltration
capacity, it can be shown as the following equation:
ETfnf=(P-RSf,.-aPfn) 0 (1 -f)      (8)
In which: P is the mean annual precipitation, RSf, is the mean annual non-field
surface water runoff; f is the ratio of cultivated land to the total land area; aPnf is the
recharge from precipitation seepage in the mean annual cultivated land. The two
items are accounting for 10-30% of the mean annual precipitation in semi-drought
and semi-humid area, respectively, and has no relations with if there is the project.
ETf is the evaportransporation in cultivated land and has close relations with crop
type, yield, irrigation practice, climate and with or without the project. The change of
Ah mainly depends on ETf after the implementation of the project.
(2) Main water saving amount after the implementation of water saving irrigation.
Increasing the utilization efficiency of water resources is the main objective of the
project, it can be shown in table 13 that the utilization efficiency of water resources
increased remarkably for the increase of the utilization coefficient of irrigation water.
Table 25 shows the anticipated water saving volume after the implementation of
water saving irrigation project.

The primary water saving measures adopted in this project are: (1) water saving and
high efficient use to reduce net consumption of water resources to maximum extent;
(2) utilize local or passing runoff as much as possible; and (3) adjusting planting
structure or industrial structure. The former two measures are mainly adopted by said
project, and some project areas adopt the third measure.
The different design of water saving measure is applied to project areas with various
water source type and water shortage situation. Somewhat serious resource-type
shortage areas include Daxing and Fangshan well irrigation project area of Beijing,
Feixiang, Guantao and Cheng'an well irrigation project area of Hebei, Pingdu well
irrigation project area of Qingdao, Yuhong and Xinchengzi well irrigation area of
Shenyang. The project design adopted comprehensive water saving measures with
high efficiency, focused on improvement of irrigation system and combined with
counterparts of irrigation works/technology, agricultural cultivation mode,
agricultural water saving technique, harvesting of rainfall and damming river. It aims
at reducing non-efficiency ET and loss of local surface runoff to maximum extent
subject to ensuring high-yield of crops, and damming and using passing runoff as
much as possible. Strengthening management and moblizing WUA to play its role in
organization and management of household for water saving. Irrigating with moisture
observation and fertilizer application with earth measuring will be two basic
managing means to ensure scientific and high efficient water saving implemented
according to project design. To those well irrigation area lacking much water, it is
planned to adopt special water saving management measures for guaranteeing design
goal. To common project area of engineering-type shortage, besides general water
saving measures on irrigation works, corresponding agricultural measures and
managing measures are also considered in water saving design, so as to obtain the
effect of efficiency-type real water saving.
According to Study Report on Real Water Saving Amount of this project, with up-
mentioned comprehensive and high efficient water saving measures, about 20% real
water saving amount of resource-type could be realized in well irrigation area.
Calculated basing on land area in project region, it could reduce non-efficiency ET by
60-100mm. Besides predicted pumping water saving amount, more than 5%-10% real
water saving of resource-type will also be obtained in project area where predominant
with reservoir water supply. In pure well irrigation area of north China, generally,
10%-20% " resource-type" real water saving amount will be realized.

(3)Balance Analysis of Water Supply and Demand of Water Resources after Project
Implemented
a) Water Demand in Project Region
Water demand includes irrigation demand, industry demand, living demand and other
demand. According to special topic report of Study on Water Balance Analysis and
Long-term Water Distribution, present total water demand in project region is
1.20billion cubic meters, in which irrigation water demand is 915.81million, industry
and living demand are 96.01million respectively and other demand is 8.18million
cubic meters.
In the case of with project and design of water saving irrigation, the total water
demand in 2005 and 2010 is 757.22million and 783.76million cubic meters,
respectively. Of which irrigation demand is 628.69million and 627.08million
respectively, industry and living demand is 119.67million and  147.12million
respectively, while other water demand is 8.86million and 9.55million cubic meters.
Comparing with project case and without project case, the total reduction of water
demand in 2005 and 2010 is 354.24million and 343.01million respectively, of which
reduction of irrigation demand in 2005 and 2010 is 354.01million and 342.6million
respectively.
- 2) Water Available in Project Region
The available water supply in project region includes available surface water and
available groundwater. The amount of surface water available is calculated basing on
50% of guarantee rate. The amount of groundwater available is calculated on the
basis of mean annual exploitation of groundwater. The available surface water
includes local surface water, water in reservoir distributed area, crossing-boundary
surface water, water transferring over basins and other water available. The available
surface water in project area is related to demand process, coming process and supply
works. The gathering result shows that present water available is 416.28million cubic
meters, while 414.33million in 2005 and 426.54million in 2010.

Note: the impact of water saving in irrigation and the newly added water saving engineering had also been
considered.
The available groundwater amount depends on total recharge of groundwater in
project region and its exploitable coefficient. The total recharge of groundwater
includes recharge from local precipitation seepage, recharge from irrigation seepage,
net recharge of river seepage, net recharge from outside of project area and other
recharges. In the case of without project, present exploitable amount is 595.5million
cubic meter, while in 2005 and 2010 is 590.26million respectively. In the case of with
project, the exploitable amount for present, 2005 and 2010 is 595.50million,
504.63million and 504.63million, respectively.
The total available water supply is the sum of available surface water and available
groundwater. The gathering result shows that the available water, in case of without
project, for present, 2005 and 2010 is 927.42million, 952.75million and
965.09million cubic meter. That amount in case of with this project is 927.42million,
898.68million and 911.03million cubic meter, respectively.

5.2.2 Impact of water saving irrigation on groundwater level
The continuous descent of groundwater level is one primary issue for groundwater
environment in some project areas, such as Beijing and Hebei. Although most project
areas are not located in the center of the regional drawdown funnel, the descent of
groundwater level is very evident. The embedded depth of groundwater in the
beginning of 1980's was three to five meters, at present, it is about ten to thirty
meters. Table5-5-1 shows that the exploitation of groundwater will be reduced
remarkably after implementation of the project, it won't only further aggravate the
63



descent of groundwater level, but will ascend the groundwater level to a certain
extent.

In case of without project, the groundwater table in pure well irrigation project area,
Hebei province, tends to be descent at present and in 2005 and 2010 with rate of
0.043-0.94m/year. The average rate of descent in provincial project area is 0.32-
0.40m per year. It is steady for groundwater table in canal irrigation area and canal-
well combined irrigation area. With the project, the mean annual groundwater table in
all project areas will keep steady level.
In case of without project, the descent rate of mean annual groundwater table in well
irrigation project area, Qingdao, is 0-0.38m per year for present, 2005 and 2010. It is
basically steady for groundewater table in canal irrigation area and canal-well
combined irrigation area. With the project, the mean annual groundwater table in all
project areas will keep steady level.

P: with project WP: without project
In case of without project, the variation of mean annual groundwater table in all
project areas, Shenyang, is above zero except for obvious descent of mean annual
groundwater table in six project counties at rate of 0.03-0.26m per year. With the
project, the mean annual groundwater table in all project areas will keep steady level.
According to local hydrogeological condition, the amount of irrigation water will
directly influence dynamic process of groundwater. Unreasonable irrigation and
drainage way resulted in descent of groundwater table in water source area, while
groundwater table rose sharply because of flush irrigation in irrigation area, which
had exceeded critical depth of groundwater and caused secondary salinization of soil.
At present, the utilization coefficient of irrigation water in Shenyang irrigation area is
only 0.45-0.5, the waste of water resources is serious. The buried depth of
groundwater in Shenyang and nearing area is lOm that caused regional descent
funnel. The buried depth of groundwater in few areas is only 1-2m, less than critical
depth of 1.8m, which resulted in partial returning saline. After adoption of water
saving irrigation measures, the water use will be saved by 30%, and overdraft of
water resources will be controlled. Meantime, a series of water saving measures, such
as sprinkler, drip irrigation, low-pressure pipeline irrigation and groove irrigation,
reduced water loss, made irrigation even in time-space and easily absorbed by crops,
decreased water seepage and promoted dynamic variation of groundwater.
5.3 Impact of fertilizer application on the soil and water environment
There is little irrigation backwater after adopting water saving measures, the project
impact on surface water environment is relatively little, and the main impact is
fertilizer on soil and groundwater.
5.3.1 Fertilizer application situations
In provincial project areas, the per unit area applied quantity of fertilizer of different
crops is shown in table 5-6. It can be shown that the applied quantity of fertilizer will
increase to a certain extent after the implementation of the project, and there is a
notable difference of applied quantity among crops, for example, in Qingdao, the
applied quantity of nitrogenous fertilizer is greatest when greenstuff planted than
others.
66



Generally speaking, phosphorous is easy sedimenting in soil and not easy moving,
and the groundwater pollution of phosphorous is very little. The main pollution of
fertilizer to groundwater is nitrate; therefore, the assessment will focus on the impact
of nitrogenous fertilizer on groundwater.

5.3.2 Main influencing factors to the formation of N03-N in field groundwater
The moving and transforming process of nitrogen is very complicated in crop-soil-
groundwater system, involving a series of physical and chemical process, such as
crop absorption, soil adsorption, nitration, anti-nitration, troposphere and spread
action etc. These also act on the pollution of the applied nitrogenous fertilizer to the
groundwater. The crop's nitrogen absorbing and utilizing degree changes much and it
can absorbs more than 80% nitrogen under appropriate conditions, but the utilizing
rate of nitrogen is usually less than 50%, therefore, the application of nitrogenous
fertilizer is the potential pollutant of groundwater. Of which, Nitrate is the most
popular pollutant in groundwater.
There are many factors that influence the moving and transforming of nitrogen in soil
and groundwater, of which, the main influencing factors are:
Climate            precipitation and its distribution
Evaportransporation
Irrigation (time and times)
Soil               topography (flat land, sloping land)
Soil quality and layer of soil quality
Mineralization of organic nitrogen in soil
Land use    crop
Crop's absorption to moisture and nitrogen
Crop's covering time and season on land
Soil cultivating intensity
Nitrogen     type of fertilizer
Applying time
Applied quantity and times
The formation of groundwater pollution in field environment is comprehensively
acted by these factors.
5.3.3 Impact of nitrogenous fertilizer on groundwater pollution under water
saving irrigation
Assessing theory and method Stream is the carrier for the nitrate in crop root zone
moving to groundwater. It has been demonstrated from some researches that the
leached loss of N03-N has evident positive correlation with the quantity of seepage
under certain soil quality. Water saving irrigation will increase the utilization factor of
water resources and reduce the quantity of seepage. It's predicted that the impact of
the applied nitrogenous fertilizer on groundwater N03-N pollution will be reduced
during water saving irrigation. However, the natural condition and nitrogen applied
condition differ much in different project area, the impact of these factors on
groundwater N03-N pollution must be taken into account during assessment.
70



There are many methods to assess the impact of nitrogenous fertilizer on groundwater
N03-N pollution, such as balance calculation, mathematic model, drawing with GIS,
and etc. At present, there is no comprehensive assessing method at home that can be
referred on how to assess the impact of the application of fertilizer on groundwater
N03-N pollution in view of region zones and analyze these factors' action on the
moving and transforming of nitrate in groundwater. Therefore, we will refer to the
nitrate pollution index assessing method put forward by American expert Ramolino
on the basis of fully utilizing the present data. Nitrate pollution index was put forward
by American expert on the basis of analyzing 22 different cropping conditions
(including climate, soil type, planting structure, applied fertilizer type, applied
quantity and time and the conditions of N03-N in groundwater) and dividing into
eight potential influencing factors, which are the applied intensity of fertilizer,
volume of irrigation water, soil type, embedded depth of groundwater, crop type,
depth of well, confined water or shallow water and the aquifer environment etc. Four
essential influencing factors was concluded after further synthesis, i.e. the applied
intensity of nitrogenous fertilizer, soil structure, net recharging quantity from
precipitation and irrigation water and the embedded depth of groundwater level. The
nitrate pollution index was put forward finally. It had been carried out test to 269 field
groundwater pilots, analyzed and demonstrated the relations between the groundwater
nitrate pollution in field environment and pollution index and achieved good results in
application. This method is easy, useful for assessing the possibility of potential
pollution in field environment and suit for scattered pilot assessment.
Weight determination of influencing factors The influencing degree of the above-
mentioned four comprehensive factors to groundwater is not all the same, so the
weight of each factor should be determined so as to assess its impact correctly. The
weight is determined according to document data and profession and is giving risk
mark to the potential impacts of the four factors on groundwater pollution, the given
values are shown in table 5-8.

synthesized in table 5-9. The total mark indicates the relative importance of the
impact of each factor on groundwater pollution in field environment.

The grading method and accordance are mainly refereed to a large quantity of
documents, e.g. the influence of net recharging quantity is according to the American
DRSTIC method['].
Nitrate pollution index According to the above-mentioned method, the nitrate
pollution index (NPI) is:
NPI = Ffi + Ss, + Rr, + Ddi
73



Where F, R, S, D is the weight of applied nitrogenous fertilizer, net recharging
quantity, soil structure and embedded depth of groundwater respectively, and f,, ri, si
,di is the grading index of the above-mentioned four influencing factors respectively.
The above-mentioned model can be used to determine the potential possibilities of
groundwater N03-N pollution under different geographical conditions, the more of
the indexes, the more of the N03-N polluting possibilities.
Even though we can't get the one-by-one corresponding value between pollution
index and N03-N density through the above-mentioned relations, we can get the
influencing scope of the applied fertilizer to groundwater pollution.
Analysis on the impact of the implementation of the water saving irrigation project on
groundwater N03-N pollution The applied quantity of nitrogenous fertilizer will be
increased after the implementation of the project, however, the moving and
transforming of nitrogenous fertilizer in soil-water-crop system depends on many
factors. The change of soil moisture condition and crop planting structure and the
appropriate fertilizer have great relations with the utilization factor of nitrogenous
fertilizer, the above-mentioned measures can all increase crop absorption to nitrogen.
It's difficult to determine the utilized quantity of nitrogenous fertilizer, the
possibilities of the application of nitrogenous fertilizer to groundwater potential
pollution are also considered in assessment under the disadvantageous conditions (i.e.
excessive fertilizer) and adopting appropriate fertilizer applying measures and
applying fertilizer according to the measurement of soil fertility.
As an example, in Shenyang project area, the influencing characteristic factors and
the seeping and recharging groundwater conditions of precipitation and irrigation
backwater are shown in table 5-15, and the influencing factors in Hebei,Qingdao and
Beijing project area are shown from table 5-16-1 to table 5-16-3.

It shows among table 5-17-1 to table 5-17-4 that after the implementation of the
project, because the evident reduce of field water duty, the seeping and recharging
quantity of irrigation water to groundwater also reduce with water saving both in
surface water and groundwater irrigated area. As a result, the possibility of N03-N
infiltrating with water body will also reduce to a certain extent. The nitrate pollution
index reduced remarkably after adopting water saving irrigation and appropriately
applying fertilizer in comparing with before and after the implementation of the
project, i.e. the possibility of groundwater pollution caused by fertilizer will be less
than that of the present situation after the implementation of the project.
77



Even though we can't get the one-by-one corresponding value between the
application of fertilizer and the groundwater N03-N pollution, it's clear that the
implementation of the project will reduce the impact the application of fertilizer to
groundwater potential pollution. Appropriately applying fertilizer, applying fertilizer
according to the measurement of soil fertility and the increase of the rational
coordinating technology of water and fertilizer will all be beneficial to reduce the
leached quantity of N03-N.
5.4 Impacts of Pesticide on Soil and Groundwater
The project does not finance any pesticides. However, farmers have been increasing
the applied amounts of pesticides, for various types of pesticide, to alleviate impacts
and hazards of plant diseases and insect pests on crops and increase grain yields, and
this trend is likely to continue regardless of the project. Detailed studies on pesticide
use in China are not adequate for projection of environmental impacts, and there are
no detailed statistics available in China.
Study on pesticide behavior in the environment is still in the theoretical stage at
present due to the various types of pesticides and their complicated chemical
compositions. Many aspects are still unknown. It is very difficult to accurately
determine the impact of pesticide on environment when the results of theoretical
study and survey are not perfect, and emphasis is on the prevention in the actual
application. Therefore, macro-assessment of impacts of pesticides on environment is
done with reference to theoretical study results of United States and European Union,
and measures of current pesticide control have been proposed in view of control of
groundwater pollution.
5.4.1 Current application of pesticides in project areas
Table 5-18 shows the current application of pesticides in project areas. There are
quite differences of pesticide application for different crops. As regard to application
of pesticide, China has issued "Standard for Safety Application of
Pesticide"(GB4245-89).

5.4.2 Behavior of pesticide in soil and groundwater
There are many factors affecting pesticide movement and inversion in soil, which is
related not only to physical-chemical characteristics but also to soil characteristics.
Generally speaking, the lower the soil moisture content, the stronger the adsorptive
capacity, and the less the mobility; when temperature rises, the absorbability will
decrease and the mobility will increase; the higher the clay soil content and organic
content, the higher the adsorptive capacity. The change of pH value has big impact on
mobility of pesticides, especially of organic phosphorus pesticide, whose mobility
will remarkably increase in the soil with high pH value. High organic content in soil
is helpful to the degradation of pesticides. All these features will affect velocity and
residues of degradation, and behavior of pesticide in water and soil such as leaching,
volatilizing and utilization of organisms. The key factor for assessing potential
mobility of pesticide in soil is to assess the solid-liquid allocation in soil solution.
Adsorptive coefficient, Kd, one of remarkable parameters, is the ratio of pesticide
content adsorbed in soil to pesticide concentration in soil solution. Studies indicate
that Kd is well correlated to organic content in soil, therefore Kd is the fanction of
organic content (Kom) or organic carbon content (Koc):
Koml=OOKd/(% organic content)(cm3g-1)
K.C=lOOKd/(% organic carbon content) (cm3g 1)
It is usually expressed as KOc in references, known as adsorptive coefficient of organic
carbon. Studies indicate that it is regarded as strong mobility if the Ko, is lower than
50Lilmedium mobility if K0, among 150-500,mini-mobility if K,c higher than 2000.
79



Another parameter for pesticide degradation in soil is on-farm half-lift period (To.5),
which is a comprehensive, index and includes all processes of degradation such as
degradation of organisms and non-organisms, volatizing, leaching and plant
adsorption. It is also related to soil, climate, activities of 'microbes in soil.
Gustafson studied 22 pesticides and proposed mobility index GUS (Ground
Ubiquity Score) based on T0.5 and Ko,
GUS = lg(To.5)(4-lgK0c)
GUS can be used for classification of leaching probability. When GUS is higher than
2.8, this pesticide is leaching-prone; when 1.8<GUS<2.8, medium leaching pesticide;
when GUS<1.8, low leaching pesticide. No adequate study on pesticide behavior in
soil has been done in China and no conclusions have been drawn theoretically. The
assessment will focus on prevention measures for controlling pesticide pollution to
soil and groundwater after project, with reference to available studies abroad.
5.4.3 Impact of the current use of pesticide on groundwater and its control
It can be known from above theoretical analysis that mobility of pesticide to
groundwater relies on its physicochemical characteristics, soil and water flow.
Pesticides used in China include weedicide and insecticide. Insecticide can be
classified as four types of organic chlorine, organic phosphorus, carbamic acid ester
and pyrethrin. Most of organic chlorine has been forbidden due to its very slow
degradation in soil, for example DDT. Organic phosphorus is the most popular
pesticide in Hebei project areas, such as methamidophos, rogor, methyl-1056, 1065
etc. T0.5 of this kind of pesticides is short, and it is degradation-prone. So it is
generally regarded as short detention period in soil and less probability of pollution to
groundwater. Table 5-19 shows the chemical characteristics and mobility of some
pesticides.

It can be seen that GUS of methamidophos and rogor are lower than 1.8, so they are
difficult leaching pesticides. GUS of trichlorfon is 3.71 and that of Long-effect
phosphorus is 5.9>2.8, which belongs to easy leaching pesticide. Trichlorfon has
strong leaching feature and easy immigrating feature in soil, and its higher solubility
which increased risk for groundwater polluted. However, the semi-decay time of
trichlorfon and Long-effect phosphorous is short, on the basis of strictly obey of
Safety Standard of State Pesticide Application and irrigated water, it is possible to
avoid or reduce pollution to groundwater through their own decay.
GUS of methyl- 1065 and 1065 are not known because of inadequate data, but studies
show that half-life period of 1065 is 7.8 days in neutral to slight-alkalinity soil. It
dissolves rather quickly in soil and will not be accumulated in soil. The content and
To.5 of methyl-1065 in soil relies on pH of soil. In acid soil, methyl-1065 may remain
more than five months in soil, while in alkalinity soil, it is unstable and will be
degraded by 95% with the role of microbes within 7 days. Soil in northern regions of
China is slightly alkalinity. It is expected that the use of above pesticides has small
impacts to soil and groundwater. However, it is found in some studies that pesticide
residue is high in irrigated cotton field. Therefore, residue of pesticide in soil is
affected by many factors, and accurate conclusion is difficult to draw at present.
Pyrethrin(??) has been used in some project areas. Theoretically speaking, it has
characteristics of more effectiveness, lower-poison and lower residue comparing to
organic phosphorus. Impact of pyrethrin to environment is lower than that of organic
phosphorus. It is difficult to assess the impact of Shennongdan pesticide used in the
project areas since there are no reference materials available. The application of
pesticides in the project areas will follow the principle of high efficiency, low poison
and low residue. Efforts will be made to reduce the threat of pesticide to soil and
groundwater.
Adopting water-saving irrigation will reduce irrigation water volume, and
groundwater recharge by irrigation returning water will also be reduced at the same
time. In particular when drip and micro irrigation is used, water will not penetrate into
groundwater and basically no impact will be resulted in. Water leaching is the cause
of pesticide mobility. Probability of pesticide movement into groundwater for
sprinkler and improved surface irrigation is much smaller than that of traditional
irrigation, but possibility still exists, especially in sandy soil.
Measures such as straw returning to field in the project areas are good for pesticide
degradation. The impact of straw returning to field is the increase of organic content
in soil. As discussed above, high organic content is good for adsorption and
degradation of pesticides.
From the point view of water saving and agricultural measures, the project will
reduce the potential pollution possibility to groundwater comparing to the traditional
agricultural conditions without project, but behavior of pesticide to environment is
still unknown in many aspects. The efforts in many countries are focusing on the
prevention of pesticide pollution. Although the project does not finance the
pesticides, the whole process monitoring should be carried out under the project to
51



monitor amount, methodology of application and residue of pesticide, strictly
following the principles of high efficiency, low toxicity and low residue.
5.5 Environmental Impact during Construction Period
The construction quantities of the project are mainly shown among table 2-4 to table
2-7. Some environmental impact in temporary and in local will be raised during
construction period. The main impacts are followings.
(1) Spoiled materials
Spoiled materials are from civil works of water delivery canals, bridges and culverts,
land leveling, rural roads, etc and concrete of canal lining. Average earth excavation
per project area is relative small due to extensive distribution of project scopes. Many
works, such as pipe laying, are excavated immediately followed by back filling,
which produce less spoiled materials. Land leveling, water and soil conservation, and
improvement of medium and low yield land are belonging to optimized use of land.
(2) Dust
Theoretically speaking, construction of the civil works may cause dust in local areas,
especially in windy dry period of Spring. But the construction areas are located in
rare populated land, which has less impact on people. Construction in strong wind
climate should be avoided.
(3)Water and soil losses
Most lining is implemented in the existing canals, and only small part of canal
excavation will damage local vegetation. Construction in rainy season may cause
some water and soil losses.
Construction of rural roads may result in severe water and soil losses if in rainy
season or improper construction method used. In rainy season, if drainage is not good,
roads are prone to damage, which will have adverse impacts on nearby land in flood
season.
(4) Noise
Machine excavation, aggregate processing and concrete mixing is the constant source
of noise and vehicle causes temporary noises. Constant noise will not affect people's
life since the construction sites are far from density-populated residential areas.
Vehicles at night may produce small noises to residential areas.
5.6 Social Impact Assessment
5.6.1 The project alleviates the regional conflicts of water supply and demand
The project is located in serious water shortage regions, water saving irrigation will
not only improve the agricultural water efficiency but also alleviate the conflicts of
agriculture use and industrial and domestic uses for waters to some extend.
82



5.6.2 Impact on rural production method after project
There are following impacts on rural production method after project:
(l)Water saving irrigation promotes the adjustment of crop patterns.Construction of
water conservancy works and improvement of medium and low yield farm land,
turning flooding irrigation into advanced irrigation such as sprinkler and drip
irrigation, are of advantages to the adjustment of crop patterns and farming system.
The adjustment with the combination of local characteristics will make the crop
patterns more reasonable, increasing crops with low water consumption and high
economic returns.
(2)Bases construction and extension of high quality seed The project areas have
established high quality seed bases and seed companies of main crops, such as wheat,
paddy, corn, cotton, soybean and rape, with the consideration of their own crop
structures. Seed service systems at all levels will promote the use of high quality
seeds. The coverage of high quality seeds of grain, cotton and rapeseed will increase
after project, and unified seed supply of main crops will reach 85% from present
60%. Seed companies will guarantee the quality of seeds. All these have optimized
crop patterns in the project areas and protected benefits of farmers.
(3) Agricultural mechanization enhanced
Agricultural machinery will be procured in the component of agricultural technology
and machinery service systems in the project areas. These include large combine
harvester, paddy planter, seed planter, thresher, tractor, fertilizer deeper and machine
of returning straw into field, etc. Using of these machines will enhance agricultural
mechanization, increase the productivity, reduce labor strength of farmers and shorten
working time in the project area. In particular, using of machinery of returning straw
into field and fertilizer deeper has changed farming method.
(4) Improve scientific farming and on-farm management
The extension of agriculture technologies, with project, will improve scientific
farming, which is of advantages to proper use of fertilizer, pesticide and agriculture
film.In general, the project will improve the agricultural production conditions and
enhance farming method, turning the individual contract economy to larger scale
agricultural mechanization and improving from extensive on-farm management to
scientific management. Yield and income increase is expected and project areas will
become the production bases of grain, cotton and oil.
5.6.3 Impact on agricultural economy
Output of grain, oil crops, vegetable, cotton and fruit is expected to increase due to
improvement of irrigation facilities and adjustment of crop patterns with project,
which   will  promote  the   development   of   agricultural   economy.

5.6.4 Women's role in project
At present, most of rural. women in the project areas receive low education and
possess little agricultural techniques. Most of them engage in agricultural planting,
some of small portions of surplus labors are household wives, some go outside
looking for causal work. Most of rural women engage in strength labor work with low
income.
The project will not only improve the rural social environment but also enable women
play more important role in agricultural economy. First, the project will provide more
employment opportunities to women. For instance, women after training from local
agricultural technology centers can engage in extension, seed service and plant
protection as well as rural project management. Second, the project enhances
agricultural mechanization and thus reduces the work strength of women, shortening
working time. Third, some women attend agricultural machinery and technology
training programs and they will learn some skills of modem technology and
management, which also provide technical basis for development of diversified side
business.In a word, the project will raise women's scientific and cultural knowledge
and their incomes. With women's increase portion in household income, they
positions will be raised and family life will also be improved.
5.6.5 SIDD's impact on social environment
(1) Features of management and operation of present water works
a. The central or/and local governments mainly finance present water works, and
farmers contribute their labors.
b. Operation and management of water projects are the responsibilities of various
water authorities including provincial, prefectural (city) and county water bureaus and
water users. Provincial water authority is in charge of inter-prefecture (city) water
source projects; prefectural water department is responsible for inter-county irrigation
schemes; county and township water agencies takes responsibility of works of local
and below-branch canals; and maintenance of lateral and sub-lateral canals is done by
water users.
c. Water use is managed according to plan and supplied by different levels.
d. Water charge is measured to township and collected by township or by mu in area.
(2) The main problems of present management and operation
a. Lack of completion of field works after key water works being built due to short of
funds;
b. Most projects were built in 1960's and have been operated for more than thirty
years. They are now in ill-operation because of maintenance fund shortage;
c. Construction, maintenance and normal operation of water project need subsidies
from central or/and local governments, which is a burden of governments.
(3) SIDD impact
85



SIDD, breaking through the original management system and operation method, will
establish legal economic entities. It will break off administrative and financial
relations with the government and its agencies, realizing self-management, self-
operation, self-financing, and self-development. The main feature is privately
operated, and water users directly participate in its management. Water is used as
commodity, and water charge is based on cost and demand. SIDD impacts are as
follows:
a. Implementation of SIDD, supplying water as commodity, will enhance users'
awareness of water saving and thus promote the implementation of water saving
techniques. First, from the view of water user association and users, they will
strengthen the maintenance and management of on-farm facilities and reduce the
waste of water in irrigation in order to reduce water charges. In the mean while, they
will adopt scientific irrigation method, properly arrange irrigation frequency and
timing, thus reduce waste of water. Second, from the view of water supply company
(WSC), it will adopt all kind of measures to raise its benefits in the long run, given
the certain amount of water supply available.
b. Water price is sensitive issue. SIDD requires the determination of water price based
on cost of water supply. No conflicts are expected in sufficient water supply areas. In
water shortage areas in China, water balance will be reached basically in 50%
frequency year. In dry years, water quota for water supply companies will decrease,
and water price will certainly rise. There are two reasons. First, water price of water
supply companies is determined by supply cost. The decrease of water supply can
only reduce the electric cost of water lifting, while the cost of system maintenance,
depreciation and labor is the same as the normal year. That is to say that in dry years
water supply cost will increase and thus water price rises. Second, water price also
relies on water demand. Demand in dry years will certainly increase. Driven by
economic benefit, WSC may raise the water price, which means production cost of
users will increase. In dry years, if users can get enough irrigation water that does not
result in a yield decrease, slightly higher cost would be easily accepted. But if users
fail to get enough irrigation water that results in a decrease of output, rise of water
price may not be accepted since grain market will not be fluctuate just because of
grain output decrease in some local areas. Therefore, dry years make the users even
worse. It is expected to resolve this problem in the pilot SIDD program.
c. The cost of depreciation, operation and maintenance for large key water works is
high, and water charge may be higher than that of small projects. Water users may
feel their burdens high, which may affect the full use of existent water works and
conversely affect the maintenance of these facilities.
d. SIDD renovates the present water resource management model based on
administrative boundaries, and it will play some govemmental water management
function. When inter-basin or inter-department conflicts occur, it remains an unsolved
problem for SIDD to coordinate regional water resource allocation, i.e. how to obtain
necessary water volume and ensure users demand as well as realize its own economic
target in the mean while. Implementation of SIDD may promote the government's
reform on water pricing and water management.

5.7 Measures to Alleviate Pollution of Pesticide and Fertilizer to Water
Environment
5.7.1 Measures to alleviate pollution of pesticide and fertilizer to water
environment
(1) For the application of nitrogenous fertilizer, such measures as balancing, soil
monitoring, and timing should be taken, which is good for alleviation of leaching.
(2) Although the project does not finance the pesticides, use and application of
pesticides should strictly follow the national standard "Standard for safety use of
pesticide", including the use only of approved pesticides.
(3) Application of pesticides should be under the guidance of experts, to ensure the
application of safety, high efficient, low poison and low residue pesticides.
(4) Control of pesticide pollution of groundwater should focus on the prevention of
pollution, which may refer to the referenced study by the EU. Careful attention
should be paid to understanding of the basic features of pesticides.
(5) Typical areas should be selected to monitor the name, amount, timing and
residue in soil of pesticide application. Table 5-21 shows the indicators to be
monitored for pesticides.

project areas. The counterpart standard of on farm irrigation and drainage works is
enhanced after project implementation, irrigation guarantee degree can be improved
which will alleviate the impact of drought and flood disasters on agricultural
production. In conjunction with agriculture measures the extension of anti-drought,
anti-wind and high quality species will enhance anti-disaster and prevention ability of
crops. Implementation of forestry components, such as farm protection forest and tree
planting around farm land, will reduce the damages of wind and sand to agricultural
production and preserve water and soil.
6.3.2 Mitigation of water right conflicts
The project will reduce water losses and enhance the effective use of water resources,
which will easy up the conflicts among industrial, agricultural and domestic water
91



uses and among different administrative boundaries, promoting social stability.
6.3.3 Accelerate regional economic development
World Bank loan is used to develop water saving irrigation projects and improve the
agricultural production, which not only brings great development for agriculture but
also promotes development of forestry, animal husbandry, side industry and fishery.
Development of these sectors offers large amount of raw materials for processing
industry and inspires development of transportation and township enterprises. By
value added processing and subsiding agriculture, all round economic development
will realize in the project areas. Economic development in project areas will
contribute a lot to the realization of strategic targets of two cities.
6.3.4 Promote social stability
As the development of regional economy and decrease of water conflicts, the
relationship between people, their living conditions, infrastructure facilities, and
cultural and recreation facilities will be improved. Employment opportunities will rise
and people will enhance their cultural understanding, which promote social stability.
Establishment of SIDD, WSC and WUA will change the management mechanism
and improve water resources management. It will be responsible for project
construction, operation and management. It will supply water according to cost and
recover project cost, which preserves and increases the value of fixed assets and
promote sustainable development.
6.4 Environmental Benefit Analysis
6.4.1 Environmental benefit of forestry
Development of farm protection forestry and fruit trees can achieve bio-
environmental benefit of wind prevention, sand consolidation and climate
improvement. The project will increase farm protection forestry of 132,500 ha.
According to data from Changli Agriculture Zoning Office, wind velocity with fruit
trees is 25 0 D 35 [ lower than that without fruit trees, and temperature decreases in
summer and increases in winter 1-2 [ 1 evaporation decrease by about 20 0. Farm
protection forestry is the major component of bio-agriculture construction. Natural
environment will be improved after completion of forestry components.
6.4.2 Environmental benefit of agriculture
Development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side industry and fishery will
enrich farmers choice for commodities, which can make full use of energy and
resources, and make the recycle of energy and commodities more reasonable.
6.4.3 Environmental benefit of water conservancy projects
Water projects will make the development and utilization of water resources
reasonable, mitigating disasters of drought, flood and alkalinity and bringing many
92



environment benefits.
Development of water saving irrigation projects can increase regional water resources
efficiency and reduce volume of groundwater drafting. It will ease up water conflicts
of various departments and realize good recycling of bio-environment, achieving
maximum benefits of water resources.
Implementation and extension of water saving irrigation turns the every household
land irrigation into large-scale land irrigation, which makes the scientific and in time
watering possible and is of advantages to scientific regulation of surface and ground
water, and to effectively control of water table, degradation of soil and fertilizer
losses. All these are not only saving water but also preserve good bio-environment of
farmland.
7. Environment Monitoring Plan and Protection and Management
Plan
7.1 Environment Monitoring Plan
7.1.10bjective
Erivironment monitoring is the basic work of pollution control and management After
water saving projects implemented, the change of irrigation method, crop patterns and
environment elements around will result in change of regional environment system.
In order to reflect the present quality and future trend of environment in time and
accurately, and to provide scientific data for environment management and pollution
control, it is necessary to strengthen environment monitoring and evaluation. The
purposes of monitoring are as follows:
(1) Impact on water table after project;
(2) Impact of irrigation water quality on groundwater quality and soil in project
areas;
(3) Application of pesticide and fertilizer, their impact on and residue in soil and
groundwater.
7.1.2 Monitoring plan
(1) Principle of monitoring points selection
a. Ground water table: subproject area is as basic unit. Based on hydrogeological
conditions, typical monitoring point is selected, making use of existing normal
monitoring point.
b. Water environment (quality) monitoring: try to use normal sampling points as
possible and add some points according to pollution status.
c. Soil monitoring: new points should be added on the basis of the existing county
level agricultural environmental sampling points.
93



(2) Water enviromnental monitoring plan Water environment monitoring plan
includes monitor of volume and quality of surface water and ground water and
groundwater table.
a. Surface water monitoring
Monitoring points should be located in main rivers and intake of irrigation water in
project areas. Monitor should be done once in wet and dry period of the year. Monitor
of water quality should follow "Quality standard for surface water" (GB3838-88) and
"Irrigation water quality standard" (GB5084-92).
b. Ground water monitoring
Monitor points: one monitoring point should be established at wells of irrigation
system or every 20 km2.
Monitor should be done once in wet and dry period of the year.
Monitor of groundwater table and quality should follow "Quality standard for
groundwater" (GB/T14848-93) and "Irrigation water quality standard" (GB5084-92).
c. Soil monitoring:
Monitor points: One every IOkm2. Monitoring of 0-20cm surface soil is the focus.
Timing of sampling: according to requirement
Monitor elements: pesticide, heavy metal, pH of soil, nitrogen concentration, total
phosphorus and organic content, etc. It is suggested that detailed monitoring content
could reference table 7-1. The items in table7-1 could be added or decreased by
provinces/municipalities based on their own situation. The application of pesticides
(NBF) and fertilizer should be performed according to crops, and the monitoring of
pesticide in soil groundwater should select pesticides which are likely to be harmful.
(3) Adopting environmental monitoring method, sampling method and monitoring
analysis method according to standard issued by State Environmental Protection
Agency.
(4) Monitoring task should be undertaken by special qualified units, such as specific
environmental departments in water sectors.

7.2 Environment protection management plan
During the construction and operation of water saving irrigation works, special unit of
environment protection management should be set up and operates under the
guidance of provincial Water Resources Bureau. It will work out environment
protection implementation regulations and establish project management information
system to monitor key environment elements of project prefectures and counties. It
will collect and compile data, reporting to the management, finding and solving
problems in time, and achieving the project's social, economical and environmental
benefits.
7.2.1 Environment management during construction
Attention should paid to the management of production and living environment in
construction site, promoting civilized construction and clean production. Construction
companies involved should appoint full-time environment protection staff responsible
for pollution control. All project counties should establish report system, environment
management system and monitoring system. Propagation and education should be
strengthened to increase the environment awareness of construction people.
7.2.2 Environment management during operation
Water supply agencies in project areas should ensure the quality of source water
being in line with quality standards of relative functions of water. It is not allowed to
discharge waster water to irrigation and drainage systems. When irrigation water is
found polluted, it should be reported to environment management department
immediately and dealt with in time.
7.2.3 Establishment of special environment management organization
Environment management should be put into the agenda of project management. It is
suggested that provincial, prefecture and county project management offices set up
special environment management unit, compose of staff of bureaus of environment,
water resources and agriculture, to manage the project's environment.
7.2.4 Establishment of environment monitoring and reporting system
95



Environment monitoring and reporting system is an effective measure of environment
management.
(1) Monitoring stations at all levels will draft environment-monitoring report
according to the monitoring plan.
(2) All subproject areas will report monitoring results to county project management
offices (PMOs), thus report to provincial PMO by county PMOs.
(3) Project city environment protection bureau will summarize the county
environment monitoring reports. It will present environment monitoring and
management proposals following the national and local environment laws or
regulations and dispatch to lower level environment departments.
(4) The above monitoring report and proposal of city environment protection bureaus
will be reported to CPMO. PMOs at all levels should adjust and implement
monitoring plan under the guidance of CPMO.
8. Public Involvement
Water saving irrigation will play a positive role in local rural social and economic
development and the improvement of farmer's living standard. The public
participation is very necessary, we should give the public participation and
supervision into fill play, eliminate and alleviate the adverse impact during the
construction and operation of the project, realize the coordinated development of
economic construction and environmental protection and guarantee the numerous
mass's benefits.
8.1 Survey objects and method
Survey objects: include farmers in the project area, local governmental officials,
administrative personnel of the project and water conservancy, agricultural,
environmental and forest experts, etc. Sex, age, educational level, occupation and
revenue were all taken into account.
Survey method: granting "questionnaire for the public participation" to the numerous
farmers and carrying out sampling survey are the majority, and concurrently holding
symposium and experts' consultation.

It shows from the survey to experts that all of them think that water saving irrigation
is the most important way to solve the water shortage in the Hebei Plain of China.
They also stressed that the state should devote great efforts to water saving irrigation
and control the irrigation project that will exploit new water sources. As to
environmental pollution issue, they think that the water environmental pollution will
be alleviated after the implementation of the project, the pollutant entering into water
body will be reduced than the present situation under water saving irrigation
conditions. They recommend that appropriate fertilizer application, applying fertilizer
according to the measurement of soil fertility and at proper time should be
implemented in fertilizer use. High effective, low noxious and low left over pesticide
type should be extended in use and meanwhile their manufacture should be
supervised.
Take example of Shenyang, in investigation, we selected representative people to
hold seminars and sent questionnaires for comments on this project construction.
There are 97 papers returned, the professions of participants are divided into: 66
farmers of 68.1%, 7 worker of 7,2%, 12 managers of 12.4% and 4 others of 4.1%.
The results of investigation is shown in Table8-1:
Up-mentioned investigation indicated that public supported project construction,
however, there is some doubt and comments:
97



(1) There is 87.6% of people know about this project and all thought that important
or very important to agricultural development. Who agreed this project accounting for
95.8% and 77% of people thought this project has benefits to themselves.
(2) As to lack of local water resources, there is 49.5% of people thought local water
resource is general, 46.5% thought it is lacking water. There is 99.5% people agree
that this project will bring benefits on utilization of water resources, soil
improvement, incremental production and adding employment.
(3) As to water saving irrigation way, 57.4% are agree sprinkler, and 20% and 22%
agree drip irrigation and canal lining, respectively
(4) As to impact of the project on environment, there is a scattered result, 29.1%
thought it was no impact, and 10-26% thought it would bring impact on surface
water, groundwater, soil and crops. Furthermore, farmers had some doubt on
engineering quality and guarantee rate of water supply, and also proposed some
comments on water rate, power charges.
The farmers have very higher understanding to the project, they think that it can solve
the local water shortage, increase the yield of crops and the farmers' revenue and
promote the local social economic development, they recommend the project be
implemented soon. However, they have not clear understanding to environmental
issue and most of them think that the project won't exert any environment impact,
and in another issue, they put forward its potential impact on groundwater, surface
water, soil and agriculture. This indicates that the masses' environmental
consciousness in the project area is very weak and they have not any knowledge in
environmental pollution and environmental monitoring. Therefore, the farmer's
environmental education should be strengthened during the construction of the project
and their consciousness in environmental protection should also be improved so as to
control the disadvantageous environmental impact to the minimum extent.
9. Conclusion and Suggestion
9.1 Environmental Impact Assessment Conclusions
-The content of soil nutrient in the project area is at the third level under the present
applied quantity of fertilizer and cropping pattern. Content of heavy metal in soil
belongs to Class I natural background value scope, but Cd index in Yuhong of
Shenyang reached Class II level exceeding original polluting concentration. There
is no basic monitoring data as to pesticide pollution in project area.
-The present quality of surface water environment in project area is polluted by
organic one and N fertilizer basically. The farmland irrigation water can meet
quality requirement for farmland irrigation water. There is no large quantity of
backwater in farmland irrigation in project area, so information on quality of
farmland drainage has not been collected.
-According to classifying standard for groundwater quality, the groundwater body
can meet water quality standard, major influencing factors are hardness and N03-.
98



Generally groundwater in project area is fresh water, only some saline water existed
in Guantao of Hebei. The degree of groundwater mineralization is less than 2g/l that
meet quality requirement for farmland irrigation water.
-The shortage of water resources exist both in the cases of present condition and
without project condition.
9.2 Primary Beneficial and Adverse Impact and Prevention Measures
Primary beneficial impact
A. The adopted water saving irrigation technology, such as sprinkler, mini- irrigation,
pipeline irrigation, groove irrigation and canal lining, in project areas will increase
utilization coefficient of water resources in traditional flush irrigation from 0.4-0.65
to 0.70-0.85, reduce irrigation quota of crops and enhance utilization rate of water
resources.
B. With water saving irrigation technology, the water is irrigated according to
demand by crops in different time section of their growing period. These reasonable
and scientific irrigation technology could reduce infiltration and loss of evaporation.
Water saving irrigation is beneficial for alleviation of tense status of water resources
in project areas, it will not aggravate continuous decline of groundwater table in
project area, and will make table going up to some extent.
The scientific irrigation way, combined with agricultural measures of balanced
application of fertilizer, increasing temperature and keeping moisture and straw
returning field, will be helpful for timely delivery of water and nutrient to soil around
crop root, as well as improvement of soil structure and increasing utilization rate of
fertilizer. With water saving irrigation, the cultivated land is leveled and forest and
vegetation are developed. Meantime, it will reduce loss of water and soil, facilitate
mechanization, save labor force and promote sound development of ecological
environment.
After implementation of the project, the popularization and extension of science and
technology would be accelerated, which enable farrners to grasp modern knowledge
on scientific production and management. It will not only enhance cultural capability
of farmers, but change social environment in village.
The implementation of the project, along with utilization of water saving irrigation
technology, will promote the extension of agricultural technology, enhancing of unit
yield and promoted economic development of project areas.
SIDD improved managing mode, increased farmers capability on water utilization
and management, which is beneficial for increasing utilization rate of water resources
and maintenance of irrigation facilities.
Primary Adverse Impact
99



A. After implementation of this project, although the potential impact of fertilizer and
pesticides (pesticides are not financed under the project) on soil and groundwater
pollution is lower than that under traditional farming condition, with measures of
water saving, agriculture and management, its impact does still exist. To potential
impact of fertilizer and pesticides, prevention is predominant. The management
should be strengthened in application process, the concrete measures are shown as
below:
a. As to utilization of nitrogen, balanced application, measuring application, timely
application and separated application of nitrogen should be strengthened, which will
be helpful for reduction of nitrogen solution.
b. In application of pesticides (NBF), the regulation in Standard of Pesticide Safety
Use should be carried out strictly.
c. As to use of pesticide (NBF), the one featured with safe, high-efficiency, low
toxicity and low residue should be used under direction of plant protection expert.
d. Prevention should be conducted for treatment of groundwater pollution by
pesticide, the study results of European Union could be referenced. In application, the
characteristic of pesticide should be considered cautiously.
e. Making key monitoring on quantity, time and residue in soil of pesticide
application in selected typical area.
B. Noise, dust and loss of water and soil may be caused in partial area and time
section by earth excavation and mechanical construction, but they could be alleviated
through strengthened environmental management. Related measures are shown as
below:
a. Clearing up the waste earth and residue produced in construction and delivering
them to designated site for piling up.
b. Canal excavation and road building should avoid conducting in rainy season,
rehabilitating vegetation beside canal so as to prevent loss of water and soil.
c. Constructing vehicle should possibly avoid passing through dwelling area at night,
if need to enter then, it should run with low speed and not tooting.
C. Other aspects should, such as recovering residential film and managing spilled oil
from agricultural machine, be strengthened.
9.3 Assessing Conclusion and Suggestions
In general, this project is the one that will improve irrigation facilities, increase
utilization rate of water resources, promote local social and economic development in
village and improve environment. After the project implemented, it will obtain great
social, economic and environmental benefits.
It is suggested that, during implementation of the project, enabling balance of supply
100



and demand of water resources, especially to groundwater, the exploitation amount
should not be larger than mean annual recharge, which is safeguard to keep steady
groundwater level continuously. The policy of high-efficiency, low poison and low
residue should be carried out in application of pesticides (NBF).
It is suggested that World Bank providing special fund to make study on pesticide
behavior in soil and groundwater, this issue should be emphasized in future project
construction.
