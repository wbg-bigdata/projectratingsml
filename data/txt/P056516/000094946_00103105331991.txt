I General Description
1.1 Preface
Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China, an ancient cultural city with a
population of more than 10 million. It is an open-up intemational city, and the environment in the
city should be comfortable to match its important status. Beijing is located in the semi-arid and
semi-humid region. The average annual precipitation is 595 mm. The water resources per capita is
less than 300 m3, which is 1/8 of the national average and 1/30 of the intemational average.
Beijing is one of the largest cities with the year and among years, flood and drought frequently
occur. Especially, the drought occurs during several consecutive years, which intensifies the water
shortage problem. According to the prediction from "Water Resources Sustainable Utilization
Planning in the Capital in the early parts of 21-st Century", the amount of water shortage in 2005
will be 0.794 billion rn3 and the amount of water shortage in 2010 will be 1.182 billion m3. The
*water resource demand and supply conflict has been a restricting factor for the economic
development and environment improvement in the capital.
There are 330 thousand ha. of arable land in Beijing suburb, which is the important
production base. Agriculture is the largest user of water, which consumes over 50% of the total
water consumption. Though 230 thousand ha. of water-saving irrigation land had been constructed
by the end of 1998, the water usage efficiency is still relatively low due to poor management.
W^Jhich the rapid development of the municipal construction and the rapid economic development
and population growth, more and more water is needed to satisfy the industrial and domestic
consumption. Agricultural water consumption has to depend on the over-exploitation of
groundwater. In some areas, the deep depressions have been formed with the towns as the centres.
Hence, developing water-saving irrigation, enhancing the water consumption management level,
improving the soil structure, increasing the water utilization efficiency are the good approaches to
optimize water resources allocation, alleviate the water supply an demand conflict and improve
the local ecological environment.
According to the Beijing reality and the principles of project regions selection, 36 towns in 7
counties ( that is, Chao Yang, Tong Zhou, Da Xing, Fang Shan, Chang Ping, Mi Yun and Ping Gu )
have been chosen as the project regions. They are selected to develop water-saving irrigation
technologies, including low-pressure pipeline irrigation, spray irrigation, micro irrigation and
canal lining, etc.
This project is an irrigation technology renovation project. The main purpose is to enhance
the water utilization efficiency by renovating the existing facilities in the arable lands, to promote
the sound circulation of agricultural ecological environment, and to realize the sustainable
development of agricultural production. Hence, this project is an environment improvement
project to a large extent.
According to the "work Guidelines (OP4.0 1) for Environment Influence Evaluation of World
Bank" and the national "Notice of Intensifying the Environment Evaluation Management for the
Projects sponsored by International financial Institutions", Enviromnent Evaluation and Research
Center of China Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric-Power Research Institute has authorized
Beijing Water Environrment Monitoring Center and Beijing Water Conservancy Scientific
Research Institute to compile the Beijing part of "World Bank Financed Water-Saving Irrigation
Project Report on Environmental Influence Evaluation".

2 Basic situation in the project region and the evaluation of the current
environmental quality
2.1 Basic situation in the project region
2.1.1 Name and nature of the project
Name of the project: Beijing World Bank-Funded Water-Saving Irrigation Project
'Nature of the project: Renovated project



2.1.2 Nature geographical features
(1) Location of the project region
Beijing is located in the north part of North China Plain, form 115' 25 ' E to 117° 30 ' E
and from 39' 28 ' N to 41' 05 ' N.
The project region is located in the suburbs of Beijing, which consists of Chaoyang,
Tongzhou, Daxing, Fangshan, Changping, Miyun and Pinggu with a total area of 464.84 km2. The
area of mountain areas is 104.86 km2 (22.6% of the total area), which is mainly located in Miyun
and Pinggu. The area of the plain is 359.98 km2 (77.4% of the total area).
(2) Terrains and landforms
In the project region, the landforms go through medium-height mountain, low-height
mountain, hills to plain from west to east and from north to south. There are mountain ranges in
the mountain areas, and the plain is very spacious. The elevation in mountain areas is 460-100 m.
The elevation of the plain from northwest to southeast is 100-10 m. There are some island
mountains, dunes and hillocks at the tableland before the mountains and at the plain before the
mountains.
(3) Characteristics of climate
The climate in the project region is the temperate semi-arid and semi-humid monsoon
climate. Winter is the longest season, Summer is the second longest season, Summer is hot and
rainy, Autumn is sunny and winter is cold and dry. The average wind velocity is 2-3 m/s. The
velocity in Summer and Autumn is the smallest. The average annual temperature is 12.1 C. The
maximum average monthly temperature is 25.8 C (July), the minimum average monthly
temperature is -3.8C (Jan.). The average relative humidity is 58.2%. The average annual sunlight
period is 2499.6 h. There are 211 days of frost-free. The maximum depth of frozen soil is 56 cm.
The evaporation amount from water surface is 1878.5 mm.
The average annual precipitation is 605.7 mm. Because of the geographical location and the
terrain, the precipitation distribution within the year is uneven. The precipitation amount during
the rainy season (June to Sep.) accounts for more than 80% of the total annual precipitation. The
precipitation varies greatly among different years. In 1959, the precipitation is 1406 mm, but the
precipitation in 1980 is only 250 mm. The precipitation is gradually from north to south.
(4) Soil
In the mountain area of the project region, the soil type is mainly the light loam, and there are
some other soil types, such as sandy loam and medium loam. The soil in the plain area is mainly
the alluvial substance. The east part and southeast part of the project region is the area of
salinization. After many years of soil amelioration, the area has been changed to fertil soil.
(5) Hvdro-geological condition
A. Hydro-geological condition in the mountain areas
The groundwater distribution in the mountain areas are governed by rock properties and rock
structure. There are 3 rock groups containing water: carbonate rock, clastic rock, magmatic rock
and metamorphic rock.
B. Hydro-geological condition in the plain areas
The surface of the plain area is covered by the sediments of Quatemary Period. The plain is 
formed by the force of rivers and is mainly the alluvial sediments. The sediment layer depth is
from 10 m to several hundreds of meters. Generally speaking, the sediment is getting thicker and
thicker from northwest to southeast. The rock property is arranged by the sequence: cobble, gravel,
S



sand, clay sand and sandy clay. According to the aquifer rock property and structure, there are 4
kinds of regions:
Region in front of the mountains: the region connecting the north and west mountain areas
and the plain areas, the slope is relatively big and the yield per well is less than 500 m3/d.
Upper region of the alluvial sector: it is the good region to subside the shallow groundwater.
The yield per well is usually greater than 3000 m3/d. There is more than 5m of water table change
within the year.
Middle region of the alluvial sector: It is the transient belt between shallow groundwater and
confined water. The yield per well is usually greater than 1500 m3/d.
Lower region of the alluvial sector: It is usually the connecting belt of the bottom of several
alluvial sector. The water table is relatively low. The yield per well is usually less than 1500 m3/d.
(6) Water resources situation
A. Water resources amount
The project region belongs to the Hai He watershed. Form east to west, there are 5 river
systems, namely, Ji Yun He, ChaoBai He, Bei Yun He, Yong Ding He and Da Qing He. Bei Yun
He originates form Beijing, Ji Yun He, Chao Bai He and Da Qing He orginate form Hebei
province, Yong Ding He orginates from Shanxi province and Inner Mogolia Autonomous Region.
All of the 5 rivers are flowing into Hai He River which flows into the sea from Tianjin City.
The average annual precipitation in the project region is 605.7 mm, which mainly comes
from local precipitation. The precipitation distribution within the years is uneven. The
precipitation amount during the rainy season (June to Sep.) accounts for more than 80% of the
total annual precipitation. The precipitation varies greatly among different years. The maximum
value is 4.5 times as the minimum value. The precipitation is gradually decreasing from north to
south. The average annual surface water amount is 78987 thousand m3. The precipitation is
decreasing from mountain areas to the plain. The exploitable groundwater amount is 121676
thousand m3. Refer to table 2-1 and table 2-2 for details about the surface water amount and
groundwater amount in the project region.

B. Surface water and groundwater utilization situation
(). Surface water
The surface water is mainly located in the mountain areas of Miyun county and Pinggu
County and in the plain area where the soil is relatively heavy-clay. The surface water mainly
comes from the surface runoff during the rainy season, but the crops need no irrigation during the
corresponding period. Hence, dams or gates are required to be constructed to store the water and
recharge the groundwater, but the efficiency is relatively low. According to the calculating, the
exploitable amount is only 35496 thousand m3. The surface water in the mountain areas consists
of reservoir supply water, river base-flow and local runoff. Refer to table 2-3 for details about the
utilization situation.

(2). Groundwater
Since 80's, the city construction is developing rapidly and the water consumption is
increasing greatly. In order to guarantee the municipal water consumption, the surface water
consumption by agriculture in the suburbs is reduced greatly and forced to rely on the
groundwater. The suburbs have been transformed into net well irrigation region. In addition, the
precipitation during the 80's is less than the average annual value. Hence, the groundwater is in
the state of over-exploitation. Refer to table 2-4 for details.

the total irrigation area). The multiple planting index is 1.67.
In the project region, animal husbandry is on the basis of family breeding. The animals
consist of cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, etc.. In 1997, there were 2803 thousand of animals.
The town-ship enterprise is mainly processing industries, with the total output of 664.21
million Yuan. The total agriculture output is 1083.19 million Yuan (351.55 million Yuan from
planting, 29 million Yuan from forestry, 307.44 million Yuan from animal husbandry, 33.33
million Yuan from fishery). The net income per household is about 14364 Yuan, and the net per
capita is 4977 Yuan.
2.2 Evaluation of the current environment quality in the project region
2.2.1 Current environment quality of soil
,          -:  "I--,.;i   tbh ceil ivcrcqnir matter in Beiiint! suburbs is



about 0.70-1.35%, with the weighted average of 1.15%. The total nitrogen is 0.06-0.8%, with the
weighted average of 0.073%. The quick phosphorus is 10-2Oppm, with the weighed average of 18
ppm. The total potassium is 2.0-2.8%. The quick potassium is 80-160 ppm, with the weighted
average of 1 06ppm. The soil fertility is between grade 3 and grade 4.
Because the arable land is reduced, the population is increasing, the living standard of people
is improved, then it is required to produce more agricultural products (grain, vegetable and other
crops ) per unit of arable land area. During recent years, some farmers of some regions are paying
more attention to the second industry and tertiary industry, the input to the land is relatively
reduced and the soil nutrition state can not satisfy the production requirement. According to the
statistic, 60.9% of the vegetable field is short of organic matter, 50.33% of the vegetable field is
short of the total nitrogen. 48.1% of the vegetable field is short of total phosphorus, 74% of the
vegetable field is short of the quick potassium. The soil nutrition content in the plain grain-
production region is less than that in the vegetable field (1.28% less for organic matter, 0.021%
less for total nitrogen, 46ppm less for quick phosphorus, 30ppm less for quick potassium). The
monitoring results for 9 grain fields in Changping county show that the quick phosphorus is
reduced by 1-35.8 ppm and the quick potassium is reduced by 23.9ppm, which means that the
arable land quality has been greatly affected.
2.2.2 Current environment quality of the surface water
The water body functions in the project region consist of drinking source, groundwater
recharge, water supply, water drainage, water transmission, sight-seeing and agricultural water
consumption. According to "Beijing environment general planning" (July, 1996), the locations and
primary functions of the Beijing rivers and lakes are detailed in table 2-6.

Dunng the times of 1997-1998, Beijing water environment monitonng center conducted the
water quality monitoring for 82 rivers (segments), 17 reservoirs, and 19 lakes. The number of the



water quality monitoring sites is 238. The monitoring water quality parameters consist of: water
temperature, odor, transparency, turbidity, PH value, EC, SS, NH4-N, COD ,,.,, COD,,, BOD ,
N03-N, N02-N, total hardness, total alkalinity, chloride, F, phenol, cyanogen, As, Hg, Cr, Cu, Pb,
Zn, Cd, Petroleum-type, Total phosphorous, Total Nitrogen, bacteria, coli-form, plankton, etc.
The monitoring results show that the rivers in the project region are polluted mainly by the
organic matter. According to "Surface water Environment Quality Standard" (GB3838-88), the
water quality of Yongding river system, Da Qing river system, Jiyun river system, Chaobai river
system and the upper reach of Bei Yun river system is relatively good (Grade 11-Ill). The middle
and lower reaches of Bei Yun river system have the water quality of Grade IV-V. Some river
segments including Qing He, Tong Hui He, Lian Hua he have the water quality of exceeding
Grade V during some time intervals, the main pollutants are BOD, COD, NH4-N, Petroleum-type
and Cr.
Basing on the analysis above, most of the rivers in the project region can satisfy the water
quality standard determined by the water Quality standards" (GB 5084-92), the water can satisfy
the requirement for agricultural irrigation water quality.
2.23 Current environmental quality of groundwater
There are 423 water table monitoring stations in Beijing to conduct the timely monitoring,
and 150 of them using automatic monitoring method to conduct real-time monitoring. There are
205 water quality monitoring wells in an area of 6400 km- of plain region. Each well monitors 27
water quality parameters, and 3 monitonrng per year are conducted when the water is at sufficient-
level, average-level and insufficient-level.
The monitoring results show that there are 52.69% of the total monitoring wells having good
water quality and 47.31% of the total monitoring wells having low-quality water. The groundwater
in the suburbs is polluted at various levels. The groundwater is polluted mainly by river
infiltration supply, irrational stacking of large amounts of industrial and domestic rubbish, large
application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, precipitation infiltration and leaching.
Evaluation is conducted by water quality function classification method, and verified by
fuzzy mathematics evaluation method. Among the total 2.455 billion m3 of groundwater in Beijing,
2.214 billion m3 of groundwater satisfies the agricultural irrigation water quality standard
requirement (90.2% of the total exploitable amount). About 1.329 billion m3 of groundwater
satisfies the drinking water quality standard requirement(54.1% of the total). Generally speaking,
most of the groundwater is the clean and good-quality water resources. The low-quality
groundwater is mainly due to the overdosage of salinity, total hardness, chloride, N03-N, fluoride,
etc.
The water with the salinity more than 1000 mg/L is not suitable for drinking, and there is
2.7% of this kind of water in Beijing, which is mainly distributed in some regions of Ban Jie He of
Tong zhou, Shi Jing Shan, Feng Tai and Haidian. There is 0.1% of the total water with the salinity
more than 2000 mg/L. This kind of water is not suitable is not suitable for irrigation, but it is
mainly distributed in Tian Tan region of ChongWen District and has no effect on the project
region. the water salinity in the project region fully satisfies the irrigation water quality
requirement.
The total hardness standard for drinking water and irrigation water is 450 mg/L. There is
6.6%0 of the Beijing area exceeding the above standard, which is mainly located in some regions of
Q; JianFang of Changping, Shi Jingshan, Chaoyang, Tongzhou.



The chloride standard for dnnking water and irrigation water is 250mg/L. There is 0.8% of
the total Beijing area exceeding the above standard, which is only located in Ban Jie He of
Tongzhou. The chloride content in the project region satisfies the irrigation water quality
requirement.
There is no standard requirement of N03-N standard for drinking water is 20 mg/L. There is
5.2% of the total Beijing area exceeding the above standard, which is distributed in Huang Cun,
Ping Di, Li Xian of Daxing and the southeast suburbs of the city.
The fluoride standard for drinking water is 1.Omg/L, the fluoride standard for irrigation water
is 2.Omg/L. The water satisfies the fluoride standard of drinking water. But all the water satisfies
the fluoride standard for irrigation water.
The water quality in the project region is relatively good and is slightly polluted. Generally
speaking, Tongzhou, Daxing and Changping are affected relatively greatly by the industrial
pollution. Mi Yun and Pinggu are less affectd.

3.1.2 Content of agricultural projects construction
During the project construction, a series of related agricultural water-saving measures are to
be implemented in order to realize the above irrigation schedule, save more water resources, and
increase the agricultural production even with reduction of crops ETc. The agricultural projects
construction consists of soil amelioration, good varieties breeding and processing plants protection
service, agricultural technology extension, agricultural machinery, and prevention and treatment of
pest disasters.
The project proposes the following agricultural water-saving and yield-increasing measures:
(1) Agricultural humidity-conservation and yield-increasing measures
In the project region, the winter wheat and surnmer com stalks are retumed to the open or the
non-tillage by covering is applied, the anti-drought agents are used to reduce soil water
evaporation, to increase the soil organic matter, to enhance the soil capacity of conserving water
and fertility and to maintain the soil structure. For the vegetable, the plastic film covering
cultivation technology is to be applied, except that some of the vegetable field is to be transformed
into greenhouses. These measures can reduce the evaporation from vegetable land, increase the
field temperature, prevent or reduce the weeds growth, make the vegetable planting time early and
realize the targets of water-saving and yield-increasing. According to the experinental and
investigation results "Research Report about the Authentic Water Amount Saved" provided by the
Central Project Office, the water-saving efficiency of various measures is detailed in table 3-2.

(2) Measures of restricting the non-effective evaporation and increasing the
transpiration water utilization efficiency
Besides the measures mentioned above, the project region plans to introduce water-saving
and drought-resistant crops varieties, for example, Jing 411, Jing Dong 8 of winter wheat and
Tong Kang 5 of summer corn.
In order to guarantee the crops yield growth and improve the water utilization efficiency, the
prescribed fertilization technology is to be used according to the soil survey data. According to the
soil nutrients composition and the crops nutrients requirement, the prescribed fertilization
technology makes it possible to fertilize the soil timely and correctly in order to realize the targets
of conserving fertilizers and water. At the same time, land leveling in some regions is to be
practiced in order to improve irrigation quality and crops planting quality. Soil loosening is to be
done to improve the soil physical properties, reduce soil unit weight, enhance the soil porosity for
better crops growth condition. According to the soil water content monitoring results, irnprove the
irrigation schedule and the management level of field water content.
Refer to table 3-3 for details about the agricultural water-saving amount by the above
agricultural water-saving measures.

4 Evaluation of the environmental influence by the project construction
Water-saving irrigation is the essential part of the project. By combining the agricultural,
forestry and management water-saving measures, the project aims at promoting the agricultural
development and sustainable water resources utilization and increasing of farmers' income. The
advanced water-saving irrigation technology and the related agricultural measures will have great
effect on the agricultural production, and have favorable and averse influence on the environment.
In addition, the application of pesticides and chemical fertilizers as well as construction process
will have certain influence on the environment.
4.1 Identification and screening of environmental influence factors
The environmental influence factors are complicated because of the wide scope and the
difference of natural geographical condition, irrigation water source, irrigation pattems and so on.
Hence, the environmental influence evaluation should be done as follows: Analysis the project
content, nature, dimension, location, and the construction conditions. Determine the
environment influence factors by using the two-degree matrix tabling method. Select the factors
that are related to the project. Determine the emphasis and scope of the evaluation. Refer to table
4-1 for details.

After the preliminary analysis, there are the following adverse influences related to the
project:
(1). Influence on the water resources amount and water supply-demand balance by the
variation of the water circulation system;
(2). Influence on the water table by water-saving projects
(3). Influence on the soil-water environment by pesticides and chemical fertilizers
(4). Influence on the environment by agricultural measures
(5). Influence on the receiving water body water quality by the implementation of the project
(6). Influence on the environment by the soil discharge, soil and water erosion, machinery
noise during the construction period.
4.2 Preliminary analysis of the project
4.2.1 Analysis of the environment influence by the water conservancy projects
The water conservancy projects of the project consist of water transmission projects, water
allocation projects, and the field projects. The enviromnental influence includes:
(1) Analysis of the influence on the resources enviromnent by the water resources
environment by the water resources allocation.
Water-saving irrigation is the project of water resources utilization. The variation of irrigation
pattern will affect the water resources utilization efficiency. Water conservancy projects will affect
the transformation of different water resources (groundwater and surface water, shallow
groundwater and confined water). The different irrigation water sources, irrigation patterns,
irrigation water quantities, local geographical features, water resource utilization situations have
different influences on the resources environment. The project region is located in the water-short
region of North China, groundwater is the primary water source for irndustrial and agricultural
development, the water demand is increasing year by year. There is the problem that the water
table in some regions is continuously declining. The key point of this environment evaluation is to
make clear the project will aggravate the water table declining problem or the project will alleviate
the water table declining problem.
At present, the comprehensive utilization coefficient for irrigation water in the project region
is 0.58. After the completion of the project, the comprehensive utilization coefficient will satisfy
the required standard by "Water-Saving Irrigation Technical Specification" (SL 207-98), that is, no
less than 0.75 for canal lining region, no less than 0.80 for pipeline irrigation region, no less than
0.85 for spray irrigation region. The comprehensive utilization coefficient will be as high as 0.804.
The agricultural water resources utilization efficiency is greatly enhance, the irrigation water
demand is greatly reduced. Hence, the water resources supply-demand conflict in the project
region will be alleviated after the completion of the project.
(2) Analysis of the influence on the soil and groundwater quality by the water-saving
irrigation
According to the water environment function classification and the preliminary irrigation
water quality survey, the water quality of irrigation water sources can basically satisfy the
irrigation water quality standard. After the completion of the project, the water demand is reduced
and the infiltration amount is reduced, then it is predicted that the influence on the soil
environment and the wvater body quality by the irrigation water quality will be relatively small.



(3) Analysis of the influence on controlling soil-water loss by the water-saving irrigation
For many years, the sustainable development of mountain regions and soil-water
conservation have been the key tasks of Beijing agricultural development. A scientific and
complete system has been established form theory, policy, management, design to implementation.
The imnplementation of the project will input new fund and technology to the existing projects.
The water-saving irrigation project will replace the traditional irrigation method. Under the
normal condition, spray irrigation causes no surface runoff, reduces the soil erosion, alleviates the
damage of the soil structure. according to survey, the water utilization efficiency of water-saving
irrigation is greatly increased (as high as 80%). At the same time, the land is conserved and the
planting area is increase by 15%/o-20%.
4.2.2 Analysis of the environment influence by the agricultural projects
Chemnical fertilizer application is the important method of increasing the fertility and grain
yield. But the chemical fertilizer application has the influence on the water environment. Transport
of N. P from the field is the main non-point pollution of water envirom-nent. The consequence is
the pollution of rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Especially it causes the eutrophication of lakes and
reservoirs and N03-N pollution of groundwater. There is no reversed flow of water-saving
irrigation water, the balance-fertilization measures will increase the utilization efficiency of
chemical fertilizers by crops, it is predicted that the project will not aggravate the pollution of
surrounding surface water environment.
Under the condition of water-saving irrigation, the irrigation water return supply for
groundwater is reduced. The nitrogen fertilizer application is reduced because of balance-
fertilization. But there is still some nitrogen entering the groundwater. Hence, whether the
chemical fertilizer application will cause N03-N pollution of groundwater or not will be the
primary task of environment monitoring after the completion of the project.
Pesticides application is the primary method of preventing and treating diseases and pests
disasters and is widely used. After the completion of the project, the pesticides application amount
is going to be reduced. Refer to table 4-2 for details. Even though the project will alleviate the
potential influence on the environment by pesticides, but the influence on environment by
pesticides is the important enviromnental problem requiring great attention.

The project also consist of agricultural water-saving measures, soil amelioration, and good
varieties breeding, which help to enhance the water resources utilization efficiency, improve the
soil fertility and increase the grain yield. But all the measures may have influence on the water
environment. soil and ecological environment (for exarnple, plastic film  residual) and the



corresponding evaluation should be done.
4.3  Influence on the water supply and water demand situation in the project region by the
water-saving irrigation
4.3.1    Irrigation  projects  and  water  resources  utilization  situation  before  the
implementation of the project
At present, there is an area of 26109 ha of effective irrigation area is in the project region
(24104 ha of earth-canal irrigation, 220.7 ha of spray irrigation, 1784.3 ha of low-pressure pipe
irrigation). The current comprehensive utilization coefficient for irrigation water is 0.58. After the
completion of the project, all of the earth-canal irrigation will be transformed into water-saving
irrigation. The low-pressure pipeline irrigation area will be 20481 ha, the spray irrigation area will
be 1687 ha, the canal lining area will be 1918 ha, the micro-irrigation area will be 2033 ha.. the
comprehensive utilization coefficient for irrigation water will be as high as 0.804.
Refer to tables 4-3, 4-4, 4-5 for details about the water usage situation in the project region
before the implementation of the water-saving irrigation project.

From the 3 tables above, we can see that the irrigation water in the project region is mainly
relying on the groundwater before the implementation of the project. Because the water demand
exceeds the water supply available in all of the counties of the project region, the production is
maintaining by overexploitation of the groundwater. Without the variation of water usage method
as soon as possible, the groundwater would enter the vicious circulation.
4.3.2 Water resources supply and demand situation after the implementation of the project
The project is the renovation project. The project will help to implement water-saving
irrigation in the regions where there were no irrigation facilities. The project will renovate the
existing low-efficiency irrigation projects and make them become water-saving irrigation projects.
At the same time, 6 high-standard water-saving irrigation area is to be 24104 ha.. After the
implementation of the water-saving irrigation, surface irrigation and the backwards non-planning
irrigation pattern will be termninated, and the water utilization efficiency will be improved.
According to the estimating by "Water-saving Irrigation Technical Specification", 30% of the
original water amount can be conserved by the application of the water-saving irrigation. Refer to
table 4-6 for details about the predicted water amounts saved in the counties of the project region
after the implementation of the water-saving irrigation measures.

Under the current condition (p=50%), the comprehensive net irrigation water demand by all
the crops in the project region is 96480 thousand m3 and the gross irrigation water demand is
167157 thousand m3. After the completion of the project, the gross irrigation water demand will be
97730 thousand m3 with the conservancy of 69427 thousand m3 of irrigation water per year.
Refer to tables 4-7, 4-8, 4-9 for details about the water resources supply-demand balance

From the tables above, we can see that the water resources supply available in 2005 will be
123,701,000 m3 and the corresponding water demand will be 115577000 m3with the surplus of
8214000 m3; the water resources supply available in 2010 will be 123701000 m3 and the
corresponding water demand will be 117210000 m3 with the surplus of 6491000 rn'. Hence, the
implementation of water-saving measures will change the original water resources shortage
situation to the new situation with some surplus of water resources.
With the planting structure adjustmnent and agricultural water-saving measures, the project
will help to increase the water resources utilization efficiency and alleviate the long -existing
conflict between the agricultural water demand and the industrial and domestic water demand.
Solving the conflict between water supply and water demand has an important role in the
sustainable water resources utilization and development in the project region.
4.4 influence on the water table and the secondary soil salinization by water-saving
irrigation.
4.4.1 Influence on the water table by the water-saving irrigation
The continuous declining of water table in the project regions the primary water enviromnent
problem. Evaluation of the project region on the water table by water-saving irrigation has been
done. Water Balance Method is used during the evaluation process, primarily considering the
process of precipitation supply, filed evapotanspiration, runoff and drainage, etc.
During the early 80's, the water table in the project was 3-Sm deep, but it is 10-20 deep now.
Analysis shows that the irrigation water demand is to be reduced after the completion of the
project, and the groundwater exploitation amount is to be reduced. During the year (P=50%),the
water table will not decline, the water table in some regions may slightly rises; during the
year(P>50%), the water table will rise in most regions of the project region; During the
year(Pc50%),the water table will decline and the declining degree is less than that without the
project.
Hence, the implementation of the project can conserve the water resources and will not
aggravate the continuous declining of water table. The project can help to raise the water table to
some extent, alleviate the water supply-demand conflict and improve the 'hydro-geological
environment in the project region.
4.4.2 Influence on the secondary salinization by water-saving irrigation
Groundwater dynamic balance is affected by the irrigation water amount and irrigation-
drainage pattems. There are some areas of the project region having the problem of secondary soil
salinzation caused by dramatic rising of water table result by surface irrigation. After several years
of soil amelioration, there is almost no saline-alkali soil in the project region.
Secondary soil salinzation is tightly related to the water table. When the water table critical
depth, the salts in the soil will accumulate the upper soil layer by the capillary water movement
and the intense soil evaporation. Under the condition of traditional irrigation pattem, there is a
great water loss occurs in the depressions, and the salt spots appear in the relatively high place.
After the implementation the project, the water-saving irrigation is used in the well-irrigation
regions . Pumping the groundwater for irrigation in spring and summer will cause water table
declining, but the groundwater can be recharged by the precipitation supply during the rainy
season. According to the experiment in Da Xing, the water balance can be realized during rain-
-1      p the irriation relativelv uniform in time and space,



help crops to receive water content, and reduce the irrigation return water amount. All these
measures can effectively prevent the occurrence of secondary soil salinzation.
4.5 Influence on the soil-water environment by the irrigation water quality
Mi Yun and Chao Yang use the surface water for irrigation. The project using surface water is
located in the second-degree water source protection area, north of Mi Yun Reservoir. Ban chongzi
Reservoir and Yao Qiao Yu Reservoir belong to Mang Niu River and An Dan Mu River,
respectively. Within the tow watersheds, there is no polluting industry, few villages, no toxic
pesticides. The water quality satisfies Grade tow of national surface water environmental quality
standard and satisfies the drinking water quality standard. Hence , there is no pollution of
groundwater and surface water by using this clean water source for irrigation.
The south project region in Mi Yun is located in the lower reach of Mi Yun Reservoir, near
Jing Mi water canal and Sha Chong Reservoir. The river quality satisfies Grade 2-3 of national
surface water quality. Hence, the irrigation water can not cause pollution of water environment.
The place of using surface water in Chao Yang is located at Lai Guang Ying. The surface
water comes form Yang Fang Reservoir and Bei Xiao He. The water quality of water form Yang
Fang Reservoir is graded to be 4-5. But this is mainly due to the overdosage of NH3-N, CoDcr,
BOD5, that is, overdosage of organic pollution paramneters. Hence it can not cause pollution of
crops and water environment. The water quality of Bei Xiao He is better than that of water form
Yang Fang Reservoir, and there is no possibility of pollution.
All the 7 counties(27 subproject regions)in the project region rely on the groundwater for
irrigation at various levels. At present, almost all the groundwater can satisfy the irrigation water
quality standard. Only a small area in the southeast part of Tong Zhou can not satisfy the irrigation
water quality standard. The water usage in this area should be restricted.
The analysis above shows that the irrigation water source will not pollute the crops and soil-
water environment in the project region.
4.6 Influence on the soil-water environment by chemical fertilizer application
After the implementation of water-saving irrigation, there is little reversed flow of irrigation
water; the project will have relatively small influence on the surface water environment. The
chemical fertilizer's influence is mainly reflected in the influence on soil and groundwater.
Phosphorus is easy to precipitate and to be absorbed, but it is difficult to be transported under the
soil environment. Many years of water quality monitoring shows that no phosphorus pollution
occurs and no groundwater eutrophication occurs. Hence, the nitrogen pollution should be the key
problem to be researched.
4.6.1 Chemical fertilizer application situation in the project region.
The soil in the project region is somewhat alkaline, there is a heavy task of ameliorating the
low-yield land. At present, the composite fertilizer application is 26.7 t/ha; the stalk-retuming
amount is 4200kg/ha. The chemical fertilizer varieties are as follows:
Nitrogen fertilizer: ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate
Phosphorus fertilizer: calcium superphosphate, double superphosphate
Composite fertilizer: organic fertilizer and biochemical fertilizer are also used
Farmers have realized that rational fertilizer can increase the crops yield. N.P.K fertilizers
chr-8,H h~rn trnalv combined with the chemical fertilizers and composite fertilizer as well as



organic fertilizer. After 90's, P.K fertilizers application amount is increasing and N fertilizers
application amount is decreasing. The composite fertilizers application amount is greatly
increasing. After the implementation of the project, the total fertilizers application amount is going
to be increasing.

4.6.2   Nitrogen fertilizer transport and transformation on the condition of water-saving
irrigation and its influence on the environment
N-fertilizer transport and transformation process in the crops-soil-groundwater system is very
complicated, consisting of a series of process, such as physical, chemical and biochemical process
(crops uptake, soil adsorption, nitrification, denitrification, dynamic dispersion). The process have
direct effect on the pollution of groundwater by the N-fertilizer in the irrigation process.
The crops uptake of N varies greatly. Under the suitable condition, the crops uptake of N is as
high as 80% of the total. Under normal condition, that value is less than 50%. Hence, N-fertilizer
application is the potential pollution of groundwater. Nitrate is the most common pollutant in the
groundwater. In some fields, nitrate leaching causes large-area pollution of groundwateT.
The nitrogen transport and transformation in the soil and groundwater is affected by many
factors. The agricultural-environment groundwater pollution is the comprehensive functioning
result of all factors.
According to the research by Thomas E. Waddel, the diffusion distribution of chemical
fertilizer in the environmental medium is summarized in table 4-11.

Groundwater below the root zone              5-15                          < I
Foreign research data show that the N-fertilizer application amount exceeding 150 kg/ha.y
(10 kg/mu. y) will cause N03-N pollution. The N-fertilizer application amount in previous years in
the project region exceeded the above level. The traditional irrigation method made the nitrogen
transport easily. Then the groundwater may be polluted by N03-N. Hence it is important to restrict
the N-fertilizer application amount during the project construction period and after the completion
of the project to prevent the surface water and groundwater pollution.
Water flow is the medium for the root-zone nitrate to move to the groundwater. Under certain
soil texture condition, NO3-N leaching loss is proportional to the irrigation water leakage.
Irrigation application affects the transport and transformation of nitrogen in the soil and affects the
total nitrogen content and N03-N content as well as their vertical distributions. Nitrification
increase the irrigation amount increase, but the NO3-N deep leakage increases either. There are
two main part of nitrogen loss: loss by decomposition and denitrification of NH4-N, loss by NO3-
N deep leakage caused by nitrification. Water-saving irrigation improves the water resources
utilization efficiency and reduces the water leakage amount. With other conditions being the same,
the NO3-N pollution of groundwater caused by N-fertilizer on the condition of water-saving
irrigation will be becoming less intense.
After the implementation of the project, total chemical fertilizer application armount is to be
increased, But, according to the balance-fertilization technology, p-fertilizer and K- fertilizer are to
be increased, N-fertilizer is to be reduced. The nitrogen transport and transformation in the soil-
water-crops system is affected by many factors. In addition, the soil water content, planting
composition and fertilizer balance are tightly related to the nitrogen utilization efficiency.
After the implementation of the project, both the well-irrigation area and surface water
irrigation area have less irrigation water supply for the groundwater. Hence, the possibility of
nitrate leakage with water is reduced. On the condition of water-saving irrigation and balance-
fertilization, the nitrate pollution index is greatly reduced. In other words, the possibility of
groundwater pollution by fertilization is going to be reduced.
In addition, bialance-fertilization, fertilization by measuring the soil, rational water-fertilizer
combination will be helpful to reduce the nitrate leaching loss, increase the nitrogen uptake
efficiency by crops, and alleviate the chemical fertilizer pollution.
4.7 influence on the soil and groundwater environment bv pesticides



With the development of industry and agriculture, there are more and more artificial synthetic
organic chemical substances. In agriculture, the pesticides application amount is decreasing
because of the enhancement of public environmental awareness, but the pesticides are still the
potential threat to the ecological environment.
4.7.1 Pesticides application in the project region
At preset, the total pesticides application per year in Beijing is 4025-6300 t, about 0.8-1.1 kg
per Mu. of arable land. The pesticides application per unit area varies for different crops (largest
for vegetable, then fruit tree). For the open-field crops, the application amount and the application
times for wheat is the largest. For com, the pesticides are usually the herbicides. The organic
phosphorus pesticides are the most common pesticides (about 92% of the total pesticides) to be
used. The organic chlorine pesticides are banned to be used.
From early 60's to present, the biological prevention and treatment of pests disasters have
been conducted and developed quickly. The average annual pesticides application amount is the
early 80's was reduced 26.2-39.3 t in Beijing. The average annual pesticides application amount
in the late 80's was reduced by 53.6-80.4 t. About 400-600 t of chemical pesticides were reduced
during the 10 years. This shows the achievement of biological prevention and treatment of pest
disasters.
4.7.2 Influence on the soil and groundwater environment by pesticides
Pesticides are applied directly into the environment. Some of the pesticides volatilize into the
atmosphere and may cause air pollution. Some of the pesticides fall down onto the soil and may
cause soil pollution. Some of the pesticides are leaching to the groundwater and may cause
groundwater pollution. Since 70's, people are starting to study the environment properties and
environmental behavior of pesticides. But the research progress is relatively slow due to the
complicated polluting mechanism.
There are various pesticides for various crops. The application of pesticides should abide by
the national "pesticides Safe Usage Standard" (GB 4245-89). The most widely used pesticides in
the project region are organic phosphorus pesticides, such as phosphorus methylamine, Rogor,
methyl 1605, "1605". These pesticides stay short of time in the soil and are easy to be degraded.
They have low possibility to pollute the groundwater. Refer to table 4-12 for details about the
chemical properties and the transport properties is the soil for phosphorus methylamine and Rogor.

From the total above, GUS for phosphorus methylamine and Roger is less than 1.8, which
means they are hard to be leached into the groundwater. There are no data about GUS index for
methyl 1650 and "1605". Some researches discover that "1605" can be fully decomposed with one
planting season and can not accrue in the soil. In the alkali soil, Methyl 1605 is not stable and can
be degradated 95% within 7 days. The soil in the project region is some-what alkali, it is predicted
- - . + 1.  0   q    n qatcides wi  be



relatively small.
The transport of pesticides to the groundwater depends on its physical and chemical
properties, soil properties and water flow function. Water-saving irrigation reduces the irrigation
water amount and the irrigation water return supply for groundwater is also reduced (especially
with drip irrigation and spray irrigation). In addition, stalk-returning will enhance the soil organic
content, which is helpful for adsorption and degradation of pesticides.
From the analysis above, we can conclude that water-saving irrigation with agricultural
measures as well as prescribed fertilization will reduce the possibility of potential pesticides
groundwater pollution.
The pesticides transport and transformation involves environmental chemistry, environmental
geology, hydraulic dynamics, pedology, agricultural science and computer science. The behavior
and mechanism of pesticides in the environment research is very fragile and there are a lot of
things to be desired. After the implementation of the project, it is necessary to monitoring the
application amount, application patter and the envirommental residuals, to emphasize the
precaution measures, to insist on application of high efficiency, low-toxic, low-residual pesticides
and to enlarge the area of biological treatment projects.
4.8 Evaluation of the influence on social and economic development and ecological environment
by the project
The implementation of the project will have an important role in the social and economic
development and enhancement of living standard.
4.8.1   The implementation of the project will promote the rational adjustment of the
planting composition
Irrigation condition improvement will enhance water resources utilization efficiency and
production efficiency, reduce the agricultural water waste and promote the rational adjustment of
planting composition. According to the local land use characteristics and economic development
requirement, improve the planting composition, select high-yield and stable-yield crops (such as
flower, fruit trees, greenhouse vegetables, anti-season vegetables, medical herbs), and increase the
output per unit area. It is possible to charge the traditional tillage system, to increase the land use
efficiency, to improve the soil structure and to widely develop the machanized production.
Hence, the extension and popularization of water-saving irrigation is a technical revolution to
the traditional planting mode. Its influence is not restricted to the project region, it will promote
the whole agricultural development in Beijing.
4.8.2 Influence on the agricultural economy by the implementation of the project
The improvement of irrigation facilities and planting composition adjustment will help to
increase the yields of grain, vegetable and fruits, which is certain to promote the agricultural
economy development.
A lot of work and achievements have been realized in the planting composition adjustment,
tillage, tillage change and irrigation technologies. Dunng the planting stage of the project , it is
proposed that the planting areas for vegetable and fruit should be appropriately increased without
large variation of the planting areas for wheat, com, vegetable and fruit trees. A lot of experiments
are to be carried out in the aspects of soil, slope. Unit width discharge and tillage. An optional
combination of different components is to be used to instruct the project construction. It is
predicted that the water-saving and yield-increasing benefit will be realized.
The implementation of the project Aill improve the aericultural prodaction condition.



transform the rough field management to scientific management, increase the agricultural output
of the project region and make the project region be the production base of grain, oil and other
agricultural products for the capital.
In addition, with the enhancement of production level and increase of economic income, the
industries of electricity, roads and transportation will be developed future by the modem
agriculture. Hence developing water-saving irrigation project is necessary the farmer's income and
enhancement of public living standard.
4.8.3 Influence on the ecological environment by project construction
(I) Function of the project construction in improving the agricultural ecology in the project
region.
The sand storms in Beijing mainly come from BaoTou, inner Mongolia and west part of He
Tao region. The sand storm in spring is the main cause of dust pollution of atmosphere. Other
destruction natural disasters, such as gust, hail, pests, frost and flood, occur mainly in local
regions.
Therr is 520 kha of forest area in Beijing and the forest coverage rate is 36.3%. The project
provide the capital a green protection circle, increase the air humidity in the project region, and
provide the favorable condition for preventing occurrence of dry hot wind in the project region.
The implementation of the project will increase the capacity to resist natural disasters.
Drought is the most frequent natural disaster in Beijing. Water-saving irrigation project reduce the
water demand, and the irrigation water mainly comes from the groundwater, then the irrigation
guaranteed rate is increased. Also, the water-saving irrigation can improve the field micro-climate
and pest disaster caused by long-time dry and hot weather.
There are various distance and pests disaster in the project region. The project various
disaster in the project region. The project will help to select disease-resistant crops varieties to
replace the original varieties. The pesticides application and low-residual pesticides are to be used.
Use pests to control pests, extend the biological prevention and treatment measures to control
pests disasters. All the above measures are beneficial to the construction and development of the
ecological environment.
4.9    Analysis of the influence on the water quality of receiving water body by the
implementation of the project
The implementation of the project will have some influence on the local surface runoff and
groundwater supply, improve the quality of receiving water body. There is little revered irrigation
water, the variation of planting composition and irrigation patterns will reduce the surface runoff,
enhancement of land use efficiency will reduce the soil-water loss and increase the surface water
environment capacity. All of the above results will help to improve the river water quality to some
extent.
After the completion of the project, the application amounts of chemical fertilizers and
pesticides are to be increased. But the irrigation water outflow is reduced and the water body's
self-purification capacity is increased, the original water-fertilizer relationship is to be changed.
Water-saving Irrigation and related agricultural technology will accelerate the fertilizer transport
and transformation in the soil and increased the uptake amount by the crops and increase the
utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer, and reduce the possibility of polluting the surface
water and groundwater. Hence, some of its disadvantages can be balanced. Moreover, the
.A- -A    i-v,,l fertilizers will



further reduce the influence.
4.10 Influence on the environment by the construction process
The main tasks during the construction process are the water transmission projects
construction, roads and bridges construction and land leveling projects. There are some local and
provisional pollution during the construct period, such as soil discharge, noise and soil-water loss.
(1) Waste residue
Waste residues mainly come from earth engineering and canal lining. The project has large
scope of construction, and the excavation and landfill are conducted almost at the same time, so
there are relatively few waste residues during the construction process.
(2) dust
Earth works can produce some dust, especially during the dry and windy period in spring.
But the construction sites are mainly located in areas with few people, then the influence is
relatively small. Manage to avoid construction during windy period.
(3) soil-water loss
Most of the canal lining works are performed on the existing canals, only a small amount of
canals are need to be dug. So the vegetation is slightly damnaged. Construction during rainy season
will cause some soil-water loss.
Serious soil-water loss will occur if the rural roads construction are conducted during the
season or the roads construction methods are inappropriate. During the rainy season, roads are
easy to be damaged if the drainage system is not adequate, and the adverse influence on the
surrounding fields will occur.
(4) noise
Noise is produced by mechanical excavation, sand and stone processing, concrete blending or
moving vehicles. But the influence is relatively small, because the construction sites are almost far
from the village or towns. Vehicles should not enter the public dwelling regions at nights. Select
machinery of low-noise or adjust the working time table to reduce the potential noise pollution.
(5) Oil leakage from machinery may occur. Select the fixed place outside the tillage region to
fill oil for the machinery or conduct the maintenance work in order to avoid adverse influence on
the soil.
(6) Land leveling many cause top soil movement and appearance of deep soil.in the future
tillage, deep tillage, application of composite fertilizer and stalk-retuming measures should be
conducted to increase the field fertility.
4.11 General evaluation of the influence on the environment by the project construction
and the countermeasures
From the. analysis above, we can conclude that the project will enhance water resources
utilization efficiency, improve the agricultural ecological environment, increase he grain yield and
finally promote the coordinated development of agriculture and environment protection, after the
completion of the project, the related environmental benefit and damage analysis is contained in
the appendix table 2; some environmental factors analysis and the evaluation suggestion are
contained in the appendix table 3.
4.11.1 Water environment pollution prevention and treatment measures
The implementation of the project will have slight adverse influence on the surface water
quality. but with the town-ship enterprise development and the enhancement of public living
standard ,the wastewater discharge amount will be increased which may cause adverse influence
34



on the lower reach of the project region. In order to prevent and treat the water environment
pollution and assure smooth agricultural production and economic development, following
measures should be used:
(1) Strictly control existing point-source pollution ; assure the total pollutant discharge
amount for rivers in the project region being controlled within the permissible scope of
environment capacity; implement "closing, suspending, combining, transforming and moving"
policy for the enterprises which can not meet the requirement of standard wastewater discharge .
(2) The conjunctive operation among canals, wells and rivers should be encouraged to
enhance irrigation situation, and control the land surface subsiding. Implement conjunctive
operation of surface water and groundwater, prevent the groundwater pollution by the leakage of
surface water.
4.11.2 Measures of alleviating the influence on the water environment by pesticides and
chemical fertilizers
After the implementation of the project, the application amounts of pesticides and chemical
fertilizers will be changed. The non-point pollution caused by the pesticides and chemical
fertilizers should be controlled to its minimum level.
(1) Implement balance-fertilization, fertilization by measuring soil nutrition ,real-time
fertilization and independent nitrogen fertilizers application ; rationally adjust the composition
proportions of N,P,K fertilizers; Increase the organic fertilizer application amount; use rational
irrigation and drainage pattem to reduce N-fertilizer leaching loss and alleviate the groundwater
pollution.
(2) Adjust the structure of chemical fertilizer varieties and develop chemical fertilizers of
high-efficiency, multi-composition and slow-effective; Carbamide and multi-element composite
fertilizers containing N,P,K and various trace elements should be increasingly used, extend the
utilization of biological fertilizers which are long-effective, low-application amour and low-cost.
(3) The application of pesticides should conform to the national "Pesticides safe usage
standard". Use safe, low-toxic, high-efficiency and low-residue pesticides. Precaution measures
are essential in controlling groundwater pollution by pesticides. Develop the biological prevention
and treatment projects. Prevent or reduce the possibility of river water pollution by pesticide
through field runoff.
(4) During the implementation of the project, select the typical region to conduct monitoring
of pesticides application amount and time and implement application amount control.
4.11.3 Measures of allowing the adverse environment influence during the construction
period
(I) Conduct timely clearance of the waste residues produced during the construction process
and transport them to the nomninated stacking places.
(2) Avoid canal excavation and roads construction during rainy season, intensity the
vegetation reinstatement along the canals and prevent soil-water loss.
(3) The construction vehicles passing through public dwelling area should move slowly and
blow no whistle, manage to avoid vehicle passing through public dwelling area at nights.
4.11.4 Other environmental problems and alleviating measures
the main problem is related to plastic film residue. The use of plastic film can increase the
soil temperature and humidity, and increase grain yield. But the plastic film residue in the soil
causes adverse influence on the ecological environment. Some researches show that the film



residue can cause had crops seedlings situation and reduce the grain yield. In addition, the plastic
film residue causes scenery pollution. Hence, the agricultural plastic film residue should be
retrieved timely.
5 Analysis and evaluation of the benefit of the project
5.1 Economic benefit analysis
The implementation of the project will realize the sustainable agricultural development,
accelerate the production base construction of grains, vegetable, fruits of "high-efficiency, high-
yield and high-quality", and alleviate about direct economic revenue for the project region, but
also promote the development of tertiary industry, processing industry and breeding industry.
According to the calculation, the project can newly develop 24104 ha of water-saving
irrigation area and save 0.069 billion m3 of water per year.
Water-saving irrigation together with the agricultural yield-increasing measures (such as
prescribed fertilization, enhancing soil fertility, good varieties selection and breeding ) will further
promote the agricultural production. According to the existing data analysis, the project can
enhance the irrigation guaranteed rate and increase the grain yield by 10-15% and fruit yields by
15-30%. Refer to table 5-1 for details.

annual benefit increase during the benefit-stable period is 86726 thousand Yuan. The economic
and financial analysis shouws the value of IRR is greater than 12%.
5.2 Social benefit analvsis
5.2.1 Disaster reduction, disaster, disaster prevention
The implementation of the project will enhance the field irrigation and drainage standard and
increase the irrigation water guaranteed rate, which will alleviate the hazards on the agricultural
production by droughts and floods. Extension of drought-resistant, wind-resistant crops varieties
will increase the crops capacity for disaster reduction and disaster prevention. The forestry
measures will reduce the sandstorrn and gust hazards, beautify the environment and conserve soil-
water reasons.
5.2.2 Reduce water affaire disputes and promote social stability
The implementation of the project will reduce the water loss, increase water resources
36



utilization efficiency, reduce the water usage conflicts among industry, agriculture and domestic
life and the water usage conflicts among different administration regions, reduce water affair
disputes and promote social stability.
With regional economic development and water affair reduction, the person-to-person
relationship, people's living standard, infrastructure and cultural recreation facilities will be
improved. Hence, people's cultural quality will be improved.
In addition, SIDD experiments and establishment of water supply companies and water user's
association will improve the management mechanism and water resources management. SIDD is
responsible for the construction, implementation, operation and managejment of the project, for
supplying water at cost-price, recovering the water conservancy investment and making
sustainable development of water conservancy fixed assets.
5.2.3 Promote regional economy development
The implementation of the project will promote the agricultural science and technology
progress, enhance agricultural production level, promote rational adjustment of planting
arrangements, realize the development for transforming agricultural planting into high-efficiency,
high-yield and high-quality commercial structure. At the same time, agricultural production
development can promote the development of forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, provide
substantial raw materials for processing industry and promote the development of transportation
and town-ship enterprises. The farmers' income will be increased and a lot of employment
opportunities are supplied for women and some surplus labor. The regional economy will be fully
developed.
5.3 Environment benefit analysis
5.3.1 Environmental protection investment
In order to assure less adverse environmental influence on the environrnent and promote
general improvement of the environment, the environment factors should be controlled in the
project region and precaution measures should be implemented for potential pollution during the
construction period. The field forest network construction and application of soil-water
conservancy measures should be taken into account with the environmental protection contents.
Refer to table 5-2 for details about the corresponding expenditures.

5.3.2 Environmental protection benefit analvsis
The implementation of the project has an important role in improving the regional ecological
environment, rational water resources utilization, and sustainable development of the project



region. _
The implementation of water conservancy projects can help the rational water resources
development and utilization, alleviate the hazards caused by drought, flood and salinization and
bring about various environmental benefit. Developing water-saving imgation project can enhance
the water resources utilization efficiency, reduce groundwater exploitation amount, effectively
alleviate the water consumption conflicts, realize the sound circulation of water ecological
environment, and achieve maximum comprehensive benefit with the limited water resources.
The regional hydro-geological condition can be improved by the groundwater recharging
projects. Spray irrigation can improve the field micro-climate. In addition, the project can help to
control the water table, improve the soil physical and chemical properties, reduce the fertilizers
loss and maintain sound agricultural ecological environment.
The development of various industries (agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery ) will
richen the local farmers' life, which improves the system efficiency and rational circulation of
energy flow and material flow.
The field forest network construction and fruit trees development will improve the climate
condition and alleviate the sandstorm hazards. According to the related data, the fruit trees can
reduce the wind velocity by 25-35%, increase the temperature by 1-2C in winter and reduce
temperature in summer, and reduce the evaporation by about 20%. The field forest network
construction is the essential part of ecological agriculture construction. With the development of
forestry construction, the natural environment in the project region will be improved to some
degree.
6. Environment monitoring and protection management plan
6.1 Environment monitoring plan
The implementation of the project will have some influence on the planting composition,
water table, water quality, soil and the surrounding environmental factors. In order to accurately
and timely reflect the current environment quality and developing tendency, the monitoring should
be intensified for providing scientific data for environment management and pollution control.
6.1.1 Environmental monitoring and management institutions
Monitoring institutions at city-level and county-level are to be established to be responsible
for data collecting, summing, analyzing, feed-backing and indexing. The institutions are connected
to MIS system with the branch-end at the base monitoring point in the field. The data transmission
and index should be quick and accurate. The main responsibilities of the two-level monitoring
institutions are as follows:
Municipal project monitoring center----accept various monitoring tasks issued by the
Central Project Office; instruct the monitoring stations at the county-level; conduct scientific
research and technical training.
Project management stations at country-level----receive the supervision of the municipal
project monitoring center; implement various plans according to the related specifications; collect
data, analyze data and submit monitonrng reports; propose measures to solve the related problems.

7 Public participation
Beijing Word Bank-Fund Water-Saving Irrigation project involves the agriculture
development of 36 towns of 7 countries with a population of 285,715 thousand people. The
farmers' direct benefit is involved and the project must be carefully conducted.
Water-Saving irrigation plays an active role in the local social and economic development. It
is important to make good use of the function of public participation and public supervision to
eliminate or alleviate the adverse the environmental influence during the construction and
operation periods. It is essential to realize the concurrent development of both economy
construction and environmental protection, and to safeguard the public interests. Hence, with the
sufficient proof and precise design, the investigation of the opinions and suggestion of different
social groups should be conducted.
7.1 Investigation content and method
Propaganda and investigation have been conducted in order to inform all the related people of
project content, meaningfulness and potential adverse influence and proposed prevention and
treatment measure. Public opinions and suggestion about the proposed project are investigated by
the way of holding various-level government departments conferences, holding propaganda day of
"Sending science and technology to the country-sides", sending "Public consulting investigation
table" via activities of "Water conservancy in the Mountain Areas Richens Farmers", organizing
expert consulting and social entity investigation. The final report about the public participation
investigation is forrned by compiling the related data and information collected.
7.2 Investigation result
Among the 980 persons investigated, all of them agree the construction of the project. About
200 persons (20%) of them gave their suggestions and opinions for the project. All of the
govemment officials, experts and social entities support the construction of the project.
The reasons for supporting the construction of the projection are as follows:
(1) Beijing is the capital and should be developed into an intemational open metropolis. But
the water shortage problem in Beijing restricts the development and construction. The
implementation of the project will effectively alleviate the water supply-demand conflicts and
make it possible to achieve more benefits with the limited water resources.
(2) The implementation of the project will promote the regional economic and social
development, enhance the possibility of employment for women, enhance the social status of
women, improve the agricultural management level, and improve public living standards.
(3) The implementation of the project will improve the irrigation facilities and related
facilities. promote overall development of tertiary industry, processing industry and breeding



(4) During the implementation of the project, advanced agricultural technologies are to be
extended to effectively control environmental pollution. The project will promote the sound
circulation of regional agricultural ecology and provide favorable condition for providing high-
efficiency, high-yield and high-quality agricultural products (grain, vegetable, fruit,etc.)
Public suggestion and opinions are as follows:
(1) The proposed project should be carried out as soon as possible to benefit the local
farmers.
(2) During the construction of the project, environmental protection arrangement should
be done in order to reduce the construction noise and the damage of ecological environment.
(3) During the implementation of the project, fanners' benefit should be protected; farmers'
burden should be alleviate. The project quality should be practical and reliable.
(4) The management and utilization level of water-saving irrigation project should be
improved; the scientific farming skills should be enhanced.
8 Evaluation conclusion and suggestions
8.1 Evaluation conclusion
There is a water resources shortage problem in Beijing. The irrigation water amount has to be
reduced. Hence, developing water-saving irrigation in water-short undeveloped regions will play
an important role in increasing land use efficiency, promoting the public living quality in the
project region.
After the analysis and evaluation above have been done, we can reach the following
preliminary conclusion:
(1) Water-Saving irrigation (spray irrigation, micro-irrigation, pipeline irrigation and canal
lining technology) will increase the water resources utilization coefficient to be 0.70-0.85 from the
original value of 0.4-0.65 (surface irrigation). The crops irrigation quota is to be reduced. The
implementation of the project will effectively alleviate water resources supply-demand conflict in
Beijing and make it possible to achieve more benefits with the limited water resources.
(2) After the implementation of the project, water-saving irrigation technology and advanced
agricultural technology are to be extended, which enhances the yield per unit area and promotes
the economic development in the project region.
(3) The implementation of the project will improve the irrigation facilities and related
facilities, promote overall development of tertiary industry, processing industry and breeding
industry, etc. and enhance public cultural quality in the project region.
(4) During the implementation of the project, advanced agricultural technology is to be
extended to effectively control environmental pollution. The project will alleviate the continuous
declining on water table and may makle it possible for the water table to slightly rise. At the same
time, vegetation is to be enlarged, which helps to reduce soil-water loss and promote the sound
circulation of regional ecological environment in the project region.
(5) Scientific irrigation pattem and the related agricultural measures (balance-fertilization,
temperature-increasing and humidity-keeping, stalk-retaining) will help to deliver the water
content and nutrients to the crops root zone uniformly and timely, help to improve the soil
structure and enhance fertilizer utilization efficiency.
(6) The implementation of the project will accelerate the extension and popularization of
science and technology, help farmers to master modem scientific knowledge and scientific
agricultural production management technologies. The project will not only enhance the scientific



and cultural level of farmers, but also improve the social environment in the project region.
Hence, the project will be beneficial for the environmental protection and development
of ecological agriculture, promote the sustainable development of agriculture, has notable
social, economic, and environmental benefits.
After the implementation of the project, the potential influence on the soil and groundwater
pollution by chemical fertilizers and pesticides will be reduced by water-saving irrigation,
agricultural measures and management measure, but the influence will be still existing.
Precaution is the primary measure for controlling the potential influence buy chemical
fertilization and pesticides. The concrete management measures are as follows:
(I) Implement balance-fertilization, fertilization by measuring soil, real-time fertilization and
independent nitrogen fertilizer application which help to reduce N-feTtilizer leaching loss.
© The application of pesticides should conform to the national "Pesticide Safe Usage
Standard". Use safe, low-toxic, high-efficiency and low-residue pesticides.
During the construction period, local and provisional noise, dust and soil-water loss may be
produced by the earth excavation and machinery construction, etc.. hence:
(D Conduct timely clearance of the waste residues produced during the construction process
and transport them to the nominated stacking places.
(a) Avoid canal excavation and roads construction during rainy season, intensify the
vegetation reinstatement along the canals and prevent soil-water loss.
(E the construction vehicles passing through public dwelling area should move slowly and
blow no whistle, manage to avoid vehicles passing through public dwelling area at nights
8.2 Suggestions
(1) Implement projects of water irrigation, water storage and water recharge, conduct rational
control of the water table, make balance of the water resources supply-demand
It is suggested that the groundwater recharge engineering system should be continuously
implemented during the project construction to block rain flood and reservoir discharge water.
Also, the groundwater exploitation amount per year should not exceed the average annual
groundwater supply amount in order to maintain water resources supply-demand balance.
(2) Rationally apply chemical fertilizers and pesticides, ameliorate the soil and prevent
pollution
In the chemical fertilizers application, the N-element amount demand should be determined
correctly and be applied deeply by several times. The P-fertilizer utilization efficiency can be
improved by collective application into the root zone and combination with organic fertilizers. The
suitable composition of N, P, K should be decided experiments and soil properties.
In the pesticides application, strictly prohibit usage of organic chlorine pesticides, promote
the usage of high-efficiency, low-toxic, low-residue pesticides, restrict the usage amount of copper
sulphate, extend the biological prevention and treatment of diseases and pests disasters.
(3) Protect groundwater resources
Following measures for protecting groundwater resources should be implemented to
safeguard the primary irrigation water source.
(I) Implement the wastewater treatment plants related to the project construction plan as
soon as possible.
02 Intensify the treatment of polluting sources.



Prohibit treating wastewater by seeping wells and seeping depressions.
