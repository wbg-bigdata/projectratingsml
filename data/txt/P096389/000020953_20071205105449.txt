                                LOANAND PROGRAMSUMMARY


Borrower:                    Ukraine
Amount:                      US$ 300 million
Terms:                       Payable in 17 years, including 5 years o f grace (and level principal
                             repayment), at six-month LIBOR for US$ plusvariable spread for
                             Variable-Rate Single Currency Loans.
Front-endFee:                0.25% o f the LoanAmount
Objectives and Description:  The proposed Second Development Policy Loan (DPL-11) will support
                             priority reforms insocial and economic spheres as reflected ina series o f
                             successive Government programs. This operation has been designed by
                             the Government o f Ukraine prior to the parliamentary elections of
                             September 30, 2007. It contains a set o f objectives and priorities that
                             display significant continuity with earlier government programs and
                             which are likely to remain focus areas for any incoming administration.
                             Indeed, Ukraine's basic economic development vision i s shared across
                             the political spectrum and includes the growing integration with Europe
                             and the adoption o f its institutional fkamework for the regulation o f
                             markets, a strong emphasis on social services and inclusion, and efforts
                             to boost Ukraine's competitiveness on international markets. This
                             development vision i s concretized in the program supported by the DPL
                             series in three pillars: (i) improving the investment climate to sustain
                             growth, (ii) creating fiscal space for growth through strengthened public
                             finances and public sector reforms; and (iii)  improving service delivery
                             and social inclusion.

                             DPL-I1 builds on the achievements o f DPL-I. The first loan in the series
                             supported important measures to liberalize trade, reduce tax distortions,
                             create a telecommunications regulator, and reorganize and streamline
                             public sector finances under the leadership o f the Ministry o f Finance
                             among others. DPL-I envisaged an ambitious agenda o f further reforms
                             laid out over a 2-3 year period. DPL-I1 supports the completion o f
                             around two thirds o f the envisaged measures as well as the achievement
                             (in several areas over-achievement)      o f the associated medium-term
                             outcome indicators.

                             Ukraine has over the past two years advanced reforms across a range o f
                             critical dimensions. DPL-I1supports prior actions in all three pillars o f
                             the DPL program. In the area o f improving the investment climate
                             around 59 laws were amended or new laws enacted to meet the
                            requirements o f Ukraine's possible accession to the WTO, which the
                             authorities expect by the end o f 2007. The telecommunications sector has
                            been further liberalized resulting in increased competition, falling user
                             charges and significant new investment to improve service quality. A
                            new inspections law was passed and some further deregulation measures
                            taken to reduce obstacles to doing business. The economy has had to
                             adjust to a doubling o f gas import prices between 2005 and 2007 and has

             done so through decisive increases in gas and electricity tariffs charged
             to all domestic consumer categories, thus reducing the quasi-fiscal deficit
             inthe sector. There has also beenprogress inreducing the large stock of
             inherited debts in the energy sector. Inthe area o f creating fiscal space
             for growth, fiscal discipline as a whole has been maintaineddespite the
             political pressures for increased social transfers and a law on the
             management o f state-owned enterprises was enacted. In the social
             dimension, the authorities carried out for the first time an internationally
             recognized standardized test in general secondary education, laying the
             basis for improvements inquality.

             The D P L series envisages a third operation (DPL-111), for which
             benchmarks and triggers have been agreed withthe authorities.
             Improving the investment climate: The Government of Ukraine plans
             persist in its efforts to improve the business climate focusing on
             deregulation, inspections reform and the reform o f standardization, as
             well as further customs reforms. Private investment i s to be attracted
             through a new law on Private Public Partnerships and through the
             adoption o f a Law on Joint Stock Companies consistent with OECD
             principles o f good corporate governance. Financial sector regulation i s
             also planned to be strengthened and efforts to improve the financial
             sustainability o f the energy sector and increase its attractiveness for
             private investment are to be continued.
             Creating fiscal space for growth: The authorities plan a series o f
             measures to improve the efficiency o f the public sector, including tax
             reform, improvements in tax administration, a new law on public
             procurement in accordance with international good practice, further
             improvements in the management and oversight o f state-owned
             enterprises, improved capital budgeting and simplified inter-government
             fiscal transfers, as well as maintaining an overall ceiling on the fiscal
             deficit o f no more than 3 percent.
             Improving service delivery and social inclusion: Planned reforms in
             this area are centeredaround the increase inthe efficiency o f spending in
             health and education as the key to improved service delivery, in
             particular by revising norms to allow rationalization o f facilities and staff
             and create room for greater investment. Social insurance contributions
             are also planned to be unified to reduce compliance costs.

Benefits:    Endorsement of sound policy: Despite significqnt political volatility,
             with three different governments since the approval o f DPL-I and two
             parliamentary elections, Ukraine has made steady progress over the past
             two years. Macroeconomic policy on the whole has been sound, and
             while    supported by a benign external environment,               economic
             performance has outperformed earlier expectations by a significant
             margin. Investors have come to realize Ukraine's potential and the
             country's access to international markets has improved. Inthe context o f
             a recently more volatile global financial environment, DPL-I1 provides
             access to a stable and cheap source o f financing in addition to a signal o f
             confidence to the international markets.




                                  6

          Anchor for reforms and vehicle for policy dialogue: The DPL
          program has provided an anchor for successive government reform
          efforts and many o f the measures charted originally inDPL-Ihave found
          reflection in successive government programs. The DPL provides a
          vehicle to integrate the Bank's policy dialogue on one cross-sectoral
          platform and thereby creates significant synergies with the investment
          lending portfolio and the Bank's technical assistance activities. The
          authorities have usedthe DPLprogram as a vehicle for their own internal
          coordination. The DPL also provides a platform for cooperation with
          other donors, as evidenced in the significant parallel technical assistance
          support provided to complement the DPL.

Risks:    Political: On September 30, 2007, Ukraine held early parliamentary
          elections. Negotiations post-election around the formation o f a
          parliamentary coalition and a new government could be protracted,
          delaying key legislative and executive measures envisaged in the
          program. Moreover, in some areas, such as further increases in energy
          tariffs, public resistance may slow reform. These risks are mitigated by
          the sense o f a national consensus around the key development vision, but
          remain substantialnonetheless.

          Economic: DPL-I1 is being prepared against the background o f
          considerable volatility in international financial markets. Ukraine has
          become increasingly integrated into international finance, and thus i s
          now more vulnerable to a negative shift in sentiment and a tightening o f
          liquidity. This is compounded by a still relative concentrated export
          structure and thus vulnerability to negative terms o f trade shifts, and
          monetary fiscal policy mix that places the burden o f adjustment squarely
          on fiscal policy in the face o f a negative shock. Rapid expansion o f the
          banking sector may also have created growing underlying credit risks
          that would become exposed under a less benign macro-economic
          environment. These risks are mitigated by a strong past record o f fiscal
          rectitude, significant headroom due to low public sector debt levels, and
          relative small external and internal imbalances.

          Risk mitigation through DPL: DPL-I1places significant emphasis on
          further reforms to improve the investment climate, attract more stable,
          long-term funding, and thus create the basis for economic diversification.
          It also supports improvements in public sector efficiency, which is
          geared at the creation o f fiscal space for future growth, but would also
          make fiscal policy adjustment to a negative shock easier. Banking sector
          supervision and financial market regulation are receiving attention under
          the DPL program, while efforts to improve social sector financing are
          expected to lay the foundation for improved service delivery and a
          greater willingness o f the population to make its own contribution.

               1. RECENTPOLITICALAND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

A. POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

1.       Ukraine has experienced significant politicalvolatility over the past years, yet the country
has maintained steady and gradual progress in key reform areas. The "Orange revolution" in late
2004 signified a breakthrough the inthe country's democratic culture, inthe establishment o fpolitical and
media freedoms, and in improvements in government transparency. The price Ukraine has paid for this
progress i s a significant level o f political instability, as different political forces have competed for
leadership o f the country. Yet, Ukraine's political system has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to
generate compromise and this has allowed reforms to proceed despite significant political instability.

2.       Following parliamentary elections in March 2006, a coalition government was formed
under the leadership of the Party of the Regions. The resulting "cohabitation" betweenPresident
Yushchenko and the Government of PrimeMinister Yanukovich has been difficult.While repeated
attempts were made by representatives from both sides to agree on a mechanism for political
collaboration, most notably in the August 2006 "Universal" declaration, in practice relations have been
fraught with conflict over issues such as Ukraine's potential membership in NATO, the appointment o f
senior cabinet official, and over selected policy issues. Tensions peaked inApril 2007, with the President
dissolving parliament and calling for early parliamentary elections.

3.       An underlying reason for these difficulties is the existing ambiguities in the constitution
concerningthe division of power betweenthe Presidency, the Parliament and the Government. The
constitution was amended as part o f the political deal that allowed a re-run o f the 2004 presidential
elections and as a result significant powers were transferred from the Presidency to the Parliament and the
Cabinet o f Ministers. Yet, the amendments were drafted quickly and remain ambiguous in several key
dimensions.

4.       Early parliamentary elections were held on September 30, 2007. While the Party o f the
Regions retained its position as the largest faction in the new Verkhovna Rada, the Bloc Yulia
Timoshenko and the pro-presidential Our Ukraine-People's Self-Defense Unionwon a narrow majority o f
228 o f the 450 seats. As o f the writing o f this document, the new parliament had not yet convened. The
existing government will remain acting until a new parliamentary coalition is formed and a new Prime
Minister has been elected.

5.       Notwithstanding frequent government turnover, a broad consensus exists on Ukraine's
vision of economic development. All three major political blocks went into the election with a pro-
market platform. The pro-market consensus has allowed Ukraine to make steady if uneven progress in
key structural reforms despite repeated political volatility and has been an anchor to the policy dialogue
for a number o f years. The economy has taken the recent political uncertainty in its stride and the major
business interests, which are strongly represented in all branches o f the executive and legislative powers,
have little interest in a drawn-out political conflict. The current political environment places risks on the
implementationo f an economic and social reform program and may at times lead to policy reversals, yet,
experience over the recent past indicates that fundamentally Ukraine has continued to move forward on
key dimensions o f economic reform.

 B. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS AND POVERTY'

 6.       Ukraine has enjoyed one of the fastest rates of poverty reduction in ECA since the onset of
 economic recovery in 1999. Poverty has fallen sharply from 31 percent in 2001 to 14 percent in 2004
 and to an estimated 8 percent in 2005. This reduction was driven mainly by rapid increases inreal wages
 as well as generous increases in social transfers, in particular pensions, in the wake o f the presidential
 election campaign o f 2004. While still significant, the gap in living standards between urban and rural
 areas has been declining.

 7.       Among large families, the unemployed, and households headed by single mothers, poverty
 remains high. The incidence o f poverty i s close to 30 percent in households with six or more members,
 more than three times the national average. Incontrast, the incidence o f poverty i s not higher than average
 among pensioners, confirming the positive effect that the recent increases inpension payments have had.
 Education and employment status also influence poverty to a significant extent. However, although the
 unemployed have a higher incidence o f poverty, in absolute terms the majority o f the poor live in
 households headed by the employed or by pensioners. Returns to education have been increasing in
 Ukraine, and so the incidence o f poverty i s declining in more educated households, an effect that has
 become steeper over time. Poverty i s linked with greater exposure to health risks and lesser access to
 health care, given the burden o f out o f pocketpayments.

8.       The recent increase in household energy prices has created significant social pressure.
Household prices for gas doubled between April 2006 and early 2007, and power tariffs were also
increased significantly. However, even poor households only spend an estimated 7 percent o f their total
budget on energy consumption. As a result, according to simulations conducted by the World Bank, even
a doubling in energy prices increases the aggregate poverty rate by just 1.7 percentage points.
Nonetheless, the burden o f rising utility bills i s felt by a large proportion o f the population and has
emerged as a key policy issue.

9.       Ukraine spends a high proportion of GDP on health and education and this i s reflected in
relatively high coverage in primary and lower secondary education and in access to basic
healthcare. However, quality i s variable, and spending patterns are highly inefficient (as analyzed further
below in this document). In education, inequality o f access widens significantly at the upper secondary
level and i s also prevalent in pre-school education, which negatively affects poor children's educational
outcomes. Inhealth care, inequalities inaccess are determined both by significant variations inthe quality
o f service between rural and urban locations, and by the prevalence o f significant informal payments,
which may reach a level similar to total public spending on healthcare.


   2. MAKING SENSE OF RECENTECONOMIC GROWTH PERFORMANCE

A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

10.      Ukraine has experienced a solid recovery since the turn of the century, with growth
averaging almost 7.5 percent between 2000-06 (see Table 2.1). Ukraine's recovery started from a low
base, as GDP had fallen to below half o f its pre-transition level in 1999, one o f the lowest levels among
all ECA countries. The Russian financial crisis o f 1998 led to a realignment o f real exchange rates
throughout the Commonwealth o f Independent States, and the resulting increased competitiveness o f
Ukrainian goods led to a resumptiono f growth based initially on greatly under-utilized capacity. This was
reinforced by the financial stabilization, hardening o f budget constraints and acceleration o f structural
reforms achieved under the administrationo f Prime Minister Yushchenko inoffice between 2000-01.

11.      While growth was export led until2004, inthe last two years there has been a shift towards
domestic demand as the main source of growth and concerns have been raised about the
sustainability of Ukraine's expansion. Strong consumption growth inrecent years has been fuelled by
rapid real wage growth, driven inpart by generous pre-election hikes inpublic sector wages and transfers
approved in 2004. A rapid expansion in consumer credit to households has also helped to sustain
consumption growth. Real wage growth in this latter period exceeded the growth o f productivity both
economy-wide and in industry. This, together with a structure o f exports strongly concentrated around
metallurgy and chemicals and thus vulnerable to negative terms o f trade shifts, has led to concerns that
the period o f extensive growth inUkraine may be coming to an end.'

12.      Yet, after a dip in 2005, Ukraine's recent growth performance has outperformed earlier
predictions with growth reaching an annualized rate of 7.9 percent in the first half of 2007. Strong
investment demand and highmetal prices, together with the overall favorable internationalbusiness cycle
have fuelled the recent upswing. The doubling in the price o f imported natural gas (from US$62/tcm in
2005 to US$ 95/tcm in 2006 and further to US$ 130/tcm in 2007) was offset by the upswing in metal
prices, and Bank staff estimates indicate that overall Ukraine's terms o f trade may have improved by 3.8
percent in 2006 and will rise further in 2007. This has contained the increase in external imbalances and

 The need for greater economic diversification and for improvements inthe investment climate to help bring this about was
emphasized inthe Bank's Country Economic Memorandum (2004) and Trade Study (2005).


                                                             11

supported the continued strong expansion o f domestic demand. Private investments accelerated motivated
by the need to reduce huge energy inefficiencies3 and financed by record inflows o f FDI and private
lending. Inaddition, investments decisions that had been postponed before the Parliamentary elections in
March 2006 and in the context o f the re-privatization debate during 2005 were realized after elections
passed peacefully and democratically and the re-privatization drive ebbed away. As a result, fixed
investment was a growth leader posting an increase o f over 15 percent.

14.      While the external environment has supported growth, there are also structural factors that
may keep the pace of expansion above earlier expected rates. Ukraine experienced one o f the sharpest
declines in output at the start o f transition and consequently it has still some room left for recovery based
on increasing capacity utilization. These hidden productivity reserves are further enhanced by the recent
strengthening o f governance inthe domestic corporate sector, the rising inflow o f foreign investment, and
the resulting deepening o f industrialre~tructuring.~         This also implies that a deepening o f structural reform
while critical to sustain growth in the medium-run represents less o f a constraint on growth in the short-
run(see Box 2.1). Insome respects, therefore, Ukraine may still be catching up and mirroring the pattern
o f recovery experienced by more advanced Eastern European countries inthe second halfo f the 1990s.

Box 2.1: Recovery from the transition crisis and the impact of reform on economic growth

The Figure below illustrates the interaction between initial output decline and the contribution o f reform to
economic growth. A country has two available steady state growth paths, depending on the depth o f structural
reforms (which may be thought o f as raising both steady state income through an increase in investment and the
long-term rate of productivity growth - i.e. shifting the growth path up and making it steeper). Because of an initial
exogenous output decline, the country is below both steady state paths at point A. Even if this country accelerates
reforms at that point, the benefits become apparent only after point B.

B. SUSTAINING MACROECONOMIC BALANCE THROUGH THE RECOVERY

15.       The shift from export to domestic demand led growth has led to a significant change in
external balances from a large current account surplus to a small deficit of 1.5 percent in 2006. At
the same time, capital inflows have been buoyant, reflecting improved perceptions o f Ukraine as an
investment location. The current account deficit in 2006 was more than 2 times financed by FDIinflows
o f US$ 5.3 billion. As a result, foreign-exchange reserves have tripled since end-2004 to 5 months o f
imports (USD 31.7 billion) as o f end October 2007. The shift towards a moderate current account deficit
i s reflective o f Ukraine's need to import capital to modernize its economy, and different methodologies
suggest that Ukraine is currently fairly close to external balance.'


  World Bank2007, "Unleashing Prosperity: Productivity Growth inEastern Europe and Former Soviet Union, forthcoming.
  The IMF (Staff Papers, Article IV Consultation, 2006) uses both regression analysis and international comparisons o f unit labor
costs and wage rates to examine whether Ukraine's exchange rate i s currently adequatelyvalued. The basic conclusion is that


                                                              13

16.       Ukraine creditworthiness (as assessed by international rating agencies) has improved and
financial markets have deepened. Fitch upgradedUkraine's Sovereign LongTerm ForeignDebt Rating
to BB- in January 2005 (upgrading the outlook to positive in October 2006), while Standard and Poor's
followed in M a y 2005. The OECD transferred Ukraine from the sixth to the fifth risk group in its
classification o f export credit risk in January 2007. These improvements have been reflected in growing
international market access. Banking credit to the private sector has expanded rapidly, Ukraine's largest
corporations have entered the Eurobond market in force, and the value o f the Ukrainian stock market
(PFTS) has doubled over the past two years (see above). However, international market volatility in the
wake o f the U S sub-prime mortgage crisis have not left Ukraine unaffected. Bond spreads have reversed
their trend decline since early 2005. In early November, Ukraine issued a US$ 700 million 10-year
Eurobond at 6.75 percent, a spread o f 240 bps, well above the low o f 9Obps in the secondary market
recorded inM a y 2007. Risks associated with market volatility are discussed in Sections 3 and 7.

17.       Foreign borrowingby the private sector has substantially increasedover the past two years,
and the current account deficit is also a reflection of improved access to international financing.
The strong growth performance has been reflected inmarket optimism leading to growing inflows o f debt
and equity financing in the private sector. In 2006 alone, external private debt increased by an expected
USD 14.7 billion. Together with the FDI inflows, this accounts for 18 percent o f GDP. A substantial
share o f these inflows have been intermediated through the banking system, which has on-lent finds
borrowed abroad to domestic borrowers in foreign currency. As o f mid-2007, 51 percent o f commercial
banks loans to the private sector were extended in foreign currencies, while for loans to the household
sector the ratio stood at 67 percent. The increasing foreign exchange exposure o f the private sector has
been motivated in part by the effective stability o f the exchange rate o f the UAH to the USD as well as
the absence o f long-term sources o f domestic funding, but it represents a potential source o f risk going
forward. The NBU has reacted by tightening provisioning requirements for lending to un-hedged
domestic borrowers, introducing differential reserve requirements for deposits in local and foreign
currency, and increasing minimum capital requirements in the banking sector to EURO 10 million. A
further tightening o f provisioning requirements and higher risk weights for loans in foreign currency in
calculating net bank capital are being considered as additional steps.

18.       While the quasi nominal exchange rate anchor has been successful in stabilizing inflation
from high levels in the mid-late 1990s, more recently inflation has been volatile and the case for a
gradual move towards a more flexible monetary framework has been growing. CPI inflation peaked
inmid-2005 at about 15percentyear onyear drivenbylarge hikes inpublic wages andpensions, andthe
rigidity o f the supply response infood markets (e.g. meat and sugar). The impact and persistence o f these
shocks on inflation have been enhanced by a monetary policy framework that tends to transmit external
conditions directly into changes in monetary conditions. The exchange rate realignment by 5 percent to
UAWUSD 5.05 in April 2005 coupled with a cooling economy lessened inflation pressures until mid-
2006. Subsequently, revisions o f gas and electricity tariffs, the pass-through o f gas price increases into
higher tariffs for communal and heating services, and more recently rising food prices following a poor
harvest have pushedinflation back into double digits. The CPI ended 2006 with an 11.6 percent increase
and stood at 14.8 percent year on year in October, with the services sub-component posting a 50 percent
year on year growth. The uncertainty regarding future terms o f trade developments, the risks associated

from apositionof alargeundervaluation,Ukraine's real exchangeratehasmovedto within 10-15 percent of it's equilibrium
level.
6 It shouldbenotedthat asubstantial share of capitalinflows was offset inthe capitalbalanceby substantialincreases inoutflows
into the currencymarket, as residentspurchasedlarge amounts of USdollars(total BOPoutflows fromcurrencypurchases are
estimatedat US%9 billionin2006). This was one symptomof growingdollarizationduring2006 but it does to some extent
provideahedgeinthe private sector againstthe large USdollar liabilities incurred(althoughthe extent to which currency is held
by individualswho have also taken out US dollar mortgages,for instance, is not known).


                                                             14

with large foreign exchange exposure inthe private sector and the likelihood of further supply side price
shocks as a result o f energy and utility tariff adjustments increase the case for a move towards a more
flexible monetarypolicy framework.

19.      Fiscal policy has contributed to buoyant domestic demand growth, although overall fiscal
deficits have been contained through increased tax collection. Following an election driven fiscal
deficit o f 4.5 percent in2004, the general government deficit declined to 2.3 percent o f GDP in 2005 and
further to 1.3 percent in 2006. However, public expenditures have grown steadily since 2001, reaching a
record highin2005-06 o f 44 percent o f GDP, one o f the highest levels inthe region. Public spending has
been increasingly dominated by consumption and current transfers, driven by hikes inrecurrent spending
mainly inpensions and the public wage bill. Conversely, public investments decreased to below 2 percent
o f GDP. However, a 5 percentage points o f GDP increase in the average tax burden on the economy has
allowed the Government to keep fiscal deficits in check. Moreover, spending measures in place since
January 2006 have been effective in controlling the rise in pension payments, but the large size o f
transfers and entitlements made the budget less flexible to adapt to macroeconomic shocks and crowd out
both public and private investments7.

20.      Despite revisions to the 2007 budget that push public sector wage growth again above the
rate of projected nominal GDP growth, the fiscal deficit is unlikely to exceed 3 percent. InMarch
and again in May 2007, the Parliament amended the 2007 Budget by introducing faster phase-in of
minimum wage and pension increases and other social programs. The combined cost for the budget is
estimated at UAH 12 billion (1.8 percent o f GDP). Nonetheless, higher revenues from significantly higher
nominal GDP than had been forecast inthe 2007 budget law are likely sufficient to keep the deficit under
3 percent o f GDP. Given political pressure to improve living conditions among public sector employees,
many o f whom remain yet to benefit from Ukraine's transition to the market, the government's response
i s understandable and has been managed prudently from an overall fiscal point o f view. However, the
challenge going forward will be to manage a gradual reduction in the size o f the public sector in parallel
with an improvement inthe efficiency o f spending and the quality o fpublic services, which insome areas
may require additionalresources. This operation suggests initial steps inthis direction (see Section 6).


C. RECENT PROGRESSINSTRUCTURAL REFORMAND ADJUSTMENT

21.      Ukraine's progress in structural reform has been modest but continuous, in a pattern
consistently followed since 2000. Ukraine ranks slightly above average among the CIS countries interms
o f progress in structural reform as measured by the EBRD Transition Indicators (Figure 2.1). Its average
overall rating was 3.0 in2006, up from 2.6 in2000, and it has been converging towards the E C A average
since 1999. Nonetheless, the EBRD indicators reveal particular weaknesses in the process o f enterprise
restructuring and governance, in the area o f competition policy, in the performance o f the non-bank
financial sector, and in infrastructure reforms. The World Bank's Governance Ratings mirror the process
o f slow improvement in recent years, although in several dimensions o f governance Ukraine trails other
middle income countries, particularly inthe rule o f law and inthe control o f corruption.

22.      Ukraine's structural transformation in many ways resembles the transformation
experienced by more advanced reformers in EU-8 with a 5-7 year lag. Several indicators have started
to mirror those achieved ineastern Europe duringthe second half o f the 199Os, including the share o f FDI
in GDP (above 5 percent on average in2005-2006 and forecast to remain above this level in2007), the
share the foreign banks in total banking sector capital (increased from below 10 percent in 2004 to 27
percent in 2006), the depth of the financia1 sector as reflected in the ratios of deposits and Ioans to the
private sector to GDP. Figure 2.2 summarizes some of these key achievements. These trends are not
unique to Ukraine among the former Soviet Union republics; both Kazakhstan and Russia have
experienced very similar developments. Nonetheless they do suggest that reforms may have crossed a
critical threshold in the recent past which has allowed the process of recovery from the initial transition
recession to be deepened and sustained.

23.      Microeconomic evidence suggests that enterprise restructuring is proceeding despite the
difficult regulatory environment. Business entry was around 8 percent per annum over 2005-2006,
above the target value set in the DPL program. Recent studies have found that productivity in Ukrainian



                                                    16

manufacturing between 2002-2005 increased by around 40 percent, and that the contribution o f
reallocationo f employment from lower to higher productivity firms, as well as the entry o f new and exit
o f old firms contributed more than half o f this increase.* This suggests significant restructuring not
dissimilar to what was observed in Hungary in the mid-1990s and in the Baltics at the end o f the 1990s.
Moreover, the contribution o f reallocation and net entry has been increasing over time in Ukraine,
whereas it has been leveling o f f in the more advanced reformers. This suggests once more that Ukraine
may be following these countries with a 5-7 year lag.

24.       A major push was made in late 2006 and again in June 2007 to bring Ukrainian legislation
in compliancewith WTO requirementsand thus lay the foundationfor accessionto the WTO. The
last tranche o f laws complement a package o f around 75 legislative pieces amended or replaced altogether
to meet WTO requirements. The legislative measures taken are discussed in further detail in Section 6.
Ukraine will with WTO accession lock in important advances in structural reform and accept key rules
concerning future policy, including:
          Bindthe import tariffreductions that it carried out during2005-2007;
          Reform customs procedures in line with international standards (Ukraine also ratified the Kyoto
          convention on customs in2006);
          Gradually reduce (or phase out) export duties on scrap metal and selected agriculturalproducts
          Gradually shift the mode o f agricultural support from input and production subsidies ("amber and
          yellow box") to measures supporting agricultural competitiveness, the environment and rural
          development ("green box");
          Accept limits on the kinds o f investment support (TRIMS) that would be acceptable (for instance,
          the Foreign Economic Zones that existed prior to 2005 would not be);
          Accept a much stronger regime for the protectiono f intellectualproperty rights (TRIPS);
          Reform its standardization, licensing and labeling regime to remove any discrimination against
          importers;
          Adhere to the GATT's Art. 24 injoining any regional free trade area.

25.       WTO accession is now a shared goal among all political forces and will provide an anchor
to economic and institutional reforms going forward. It should be emphasized that this was not always
the case. Key debates on WTO relevant legislation in the Parliament were tumultuous and their support
far fi-om assured. However, over the past two to three years there has been a growing recognition among
Ukrainian policy makers o f the importance to establish policy credibility. WTO accession i s seen as one
important vehicle in this regard, and the recent increases in investor interest in Ukraine suggests that the
willingness to submit the country to a set o f international accepted rules i s paying off.

26.       The energy sector is another area where major advanceswere made in structural reforms.
Following the adoption o f a law on energy debts, the stock o f these debts resulting from non-payments in
the past, decreased for the first time in2006. Moreover, with the move to gas imports under a take-or-pay
contract from RosUkrEnergo, Ukraine effectively abolished barter deals in the gas sector, a major source
o f corruption in the past, and a fact that i s not often appreciated in its significance. Despite import prices
risingby 53 percent, the quasi-fiscal deficit inthe energy sector actually fell as a percent o f GDP in2006,
as a result o f strong domestic price adjustment, even if one allows for a significant temporary fall in
collections as these tariff adjustments started to bite at the end o f the year. The large domestic energy
price adjustment reflects the commitment o f the Government to market pricing, promotion o f energy
efficiency, and fiscal sustainability. Ukraine's industrial sector has reacted to the price increase by

significantly increasing investment in energy saving, one o f the factors behind the revival o f investment
demand in 2006. Since March 2007, Ukraine has started to auction some o f the electricity available for
export in an open and competitive process, again a major step forward intransparency, as power exports
to the region had in the past been based on long-term contracts at below market prices. Further reforms
are planned inthe context o f harmonizationo f the energy sector with the EU, as explained below.

27.     Ukraine's telecommunicationssector hasundergonefundamentalstructural transformation
as a result of foreign entry and greater competition. The establishment o f an independent
telecommunications regulator, supported by D P L I,       and the subsequent further liberalization o f the sector
has encouraged strong entry into the mobile phone sector, with sector penetration rising to 63 percent in
2006, and has brought fixed line tariffs for international calls down to levels much closer to those
observed in Europe. Internet usage has increased more than five times since 2002. Together with the
banking sector, and the retail industry,telecommunications provides a shiningexample o f the benefits o f
foreign investment and greater competition.

28.      Despite these positive measures and the evidence of real structuraltransformation taking
hold, Ukraine still faces significant reform challenges. Ukraine ranks low in many indicators o f the
quality o f its investment climate such as the World Bank's Doing Business (where it i s placed 139' out o f
178), the IFC's regular SME surveys, or more specific sector regulation surveys, such as a recent survey
on the costs o f trade and transit, where Ukraine ranks 73rdout o f 112 countries. It also ranks poorly on
key dimensions o f governance, such as reflected in the World Bank's Governance Indicators. This
performance i s inconsistent with Ukraine's aspirations as a country on par with many o f the new EU
member states. The corresponding reform challenges are summarized below - more details are given in
Section 6:
         First, Ukraine must further improve its investment climate. This will be critical to reap the
         gains from accession to the WTO and to sustain productivity improvements in the enterprise
         sector once the forces o f initial reallocation peter out. Many advanced transition economies
         experienced a slow-down in growth in the late 1990s early 2000s before the dynamics o f
         accession forced further improvements in the investment climate and resulted in additional FDI
         inflows and technological upgrades along the international value chain.g Particular challenges in
         this area supported by this operation are to (i)    upgrade Ukraine's trade facilitation, transport and
         logistics system to meet the standards o f international competition, (ii)remove remaining
         obstacles to entrepreneurship to give the domestic private sector a better chance to compete and
         create additional jobs (iii)   improve the performance o f its domestic financial, and inparticular its
         equity markets, through better corporate governance and regulation, and (iv) continue reforming
         the energy sector as one o f the linchpins o f Ukraine's economy.

    0    Second, Ukraine must modernize its public sector to meet the challenge of an open,
         competitive economy. This requires first and foremost a continuation o f fiscal discipline to
         mitigate against risks stemming from potential external shocks, but it also includes the
         modernization o f tax policy and administration to allow Ukraine to broaden further its tax base
         and reduce its currently highmarginal rates, which are a hindrance to its external competitiveness
         and promote the shadow economy (based on underreporting o f income)." In the medium-term,
         Ukraine needs to create fiscal space for growth through reducing the share o f public consumption
         and transfers in total expenditures and increasing public investment, while improving strategic
         planning and execution o f capital expenditures. Ukraine's public financial management, while
         recently improved, needs to be further strengthened to allow the budget to play a role in the
         strategic allocation o f resources laying the foundations for sustained future growth. While

         Ukraine faces the challenge to further reduce the share o f assets in state hands, it also needs
         urgently to manage these assets more effectively and contain quasi-fiscal and governance risks in
         state-owned enterprises." And finally, Ukraine's inter-governmental fiscal relations need to be
         reformed as a key buildingblock towards the improved quality o f public services, many o f which
         are deliveredat the local level.'*
         Third, Ukraine needs to make further efforts to spread the fruits of economic growth
         equitably amongits population.Withbudget spending as large as it is as a share o f GDP this is
         not primarily a question o f spending more money. Instead, the issue i s largely one o f spending it
         more effe~tively.'~Ukraine's social spending (on health, education, pensions and social
         assistance) already consumes the bulk o f its budget resources, as further analyzed below.
         However, to deliver better quality services, spending will need to be reoriented from the current
         input-norm driven focus on maintaining staffing levels and basic structures intact, towards more
         performance-related spending, including sufficient allocations for rehabilitation, maintenance and
         capital investment. Social transfers need to be better targeted and the current system o f social
         privileges needs to be reformed. The pension system, with spending as highas 14percent o f GDP
         (as of 2006), needs to be reformed to become fairer (linking contributions more closely with
         benefits), more efficient (improving compliance rates and allowing contribution rates to fall), and
         financially sustainable over the medium term (given Ukraine's rapidly declining population). The
         challenges o f social reform are exacerbated by the fact that health and education consistently
         receive low marks in terms o f quality in surveys o f the Ukrainian population, but that there i s no
         common appreciation yet about the need not to spend more but more effectively not just within
         the political spectrum but also among the pe0p1e.l~

29.      These three interrelated challenges provide the basic motivation for the DPL program, built
around three pillars supporting respectively (i)        improvements inthe investment climate, (ii) fiscal creating
space for growth through strengthened public finances and public sector reform, and (iii)improving
service delivery and social inclusion. The reform agenda behind this program i s both broad and
challenging, supporting a sequenced and persistent cross-sectoral engagement over some period o f time.
The specific design features o f this operation to respond to this challenge are further explained in Section
5.

30.      While Ukraineremainsvulnerable to a number of shocks, and risinginflationis a source of
concern, overall the macro policy framework remains adequate for the DPLto proceed. Bank Staff
expect solid, but not spectacular, economic performance going forward. Growth i s expected at an average
of 5.5 percent per year inthe medium-term. This forecast builds on the assumption that structural reforms
will advance gradually, but recognizes that Ukraine's growth over the short term may continue to receive
an additional fillip from the forces o frecovery and convergence (see Box 2.1).15 This forecast i s similar to

the outlook prepared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). An assessment o f current
macroeconomic policies and short-term prospects by the IMFi s contained inAnnex V.

31.       Macroeconomic policy is expected to continue to safeguard relative macroeconomic
stability. Ukraine's track record over the past seven years indicates a strong policy consensus around the
basic goal o f macroeconomic stability, reflectedinfiscal discipline andmoderate inflation. Sustaining this
policy stance in the face o f potential external shocks i s likely over time to require a greater role for
monetary policy and a move towards more nominal exchange rate flexibility. Consequently, the National
Bank o f Ukraine has indicated that it intends to move gradually towards inflation targeting but it has left
the timeframe open. Its officials highlight short term risks in MU'Sability to adopt such a stance,
particularly under the current political situation and given the still limited volume o f domestic tradable
securities that could be used for open-market operations. As a domestic debt market takes time to
develop, the move towards greater flexibility i s likely to be gradual and extend throughout the period o f
implementationo f this operation.

32.       The main parameters o f the macroeconomic forecasts are provided in Table 3.1. The key factors
underlyingthese projections are as follows:

               The current account is expectedto move into larger deficits due to a forecast deterioration
               inUkraine's terms oftrade, increasedimports of goods and services associated withgrowing
               investment demand and rising disposable incomes, and increased availability o f international
               financing. Under the assumption o f declining metal prices and increasing natural gas prices
               for Ukraine, the terms o f trade would deteriorate by some 7 percent in 2008-2010. The
               current account deficit i s expected to increase further, but remain safely financed by FDIand
               other long-termprivate inflows inthe base case.

               Private consumption growth is expected to decelerate to below the rate of GDP growth
               after 2008 following a decline inthe growth rate o f public sector wages and pensions. Rising
               energy prices and growing investment spending are also likely to put pressure on wage
               growth in the private sector, although this may go hand in hand with increasing wage
               differentiation, as the labor market tightens at higher skill levels.

               The growth rate of gross fixed investments is projected to exceed GDP growth at an
               average rate o f 9 percent in 2007-2010, as the political situation i s expected to remain stable
               and Ukrainian companies use the improved access to finance to modernize production
               facilities in the context o f energy price increases in the need to improve competitiveness
               following WTO accession. Public investment will also gradually increase.

               The National bank of Ukraine is expected to move gradually to a system of inflation
               targeting. The level o f gross international reserves will stabilize at above 4 months o f
               imports, as the NBU will limit reserve accumulation to the rate o f import growth. CPI
               inflation will return to single digits.

               The government will maintain fiscal prudence and keep the budget deficit below 3
               percent. Public consumption and transfers growth will decelerate to provide more room for
               capital spending and reduction o f the tax burden. With this fiscal target public debt levels
               remain sustainable under 20 percent GDP.

well below its production possibility frontier.

33.     Despite genuine progress in economic transition and institutional development, the rapid
pace of growth is still supported by external factors that are either temporary or inherently
unpredictable. This includes strong world prices for Ukrainian exports, most notably o f iron and steel, a
still moderately undervalued national currency, internal excess capacity, and extremely rapid growth in
credit. As these conditions weaken, the challenges to economic policy will become greater. Inthe short
run, the primary challenge will be to maintain a sufficiently tight fiscal framework to dampen domestic
demand and to be able to counteract negative external shocks. Moreover, Ukraine will need to lay the
basis for a gradual shift towards greater exchange rate flexibility which would allow for a larger role for
monetary policy to maintain economic balance in the future. Over the medium term, an acceleration o f
reform will be essential ifrecent high growth rates are to be sustained. The Letter o f Development Policy
(Annex 111) prepared by the authorities underlines the commitment to fiscal prudence and to a gradual
move towards inflation targeting as the key monetary policy framework.

34.      The most important macroeconomic risks are rooted in various external shocks, rapid
growth of the banking sector, reversal of capital inflows and tightening of Ukraine's access to
international financing, and inadequate macroeconomic policy responses:

         (i)   Terms of trade shock. As Ukraine's economy i s highly dependent on international trade, a
               sudden and sharp turnaround o f metal prices (or demand) that have recently been well
               above historical averages might trigger a sharp decline in the current account balance
               resulting in the need to reduce domestic absorption and causing a temporary decline in
               growth.

        (ii)   Reversal of recent capital inflows and tightening of Ukraine's access to international
               financing. In case of a global or regional downturn, as well as a drastic change o f market
               sentiment, a sudden stop to capital inflows would imply a substantial financing gap for the
               balance o f payments and trigger an exchange rate adjustment. Recent developments in
               international capital markets highlight these risks. Triggered by concerns over the fall-out
               from the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States, liquidity tightened in
               international markets between mid-June and early August, leading to higher risk premia



                                                    21

                and falls inequity markets. InUkraine, equity markets have declined somewhat after record
                gains and as in other emerging markets bond spreads have widened. Nevertheless, reserve
                accumulation by the NBUhas continuedand liquidity inthe banking system remains high.

         (iii)Creditandexchangeraterisksinthebankingsector. Empiricalevidencesuggeststhat
                systemic banking problems have most often arisen in the presence o f rapidly expanding
                banking sectors, due to a combination o f inexperienced managers, weak business
                accounting and reporting, and inadequate lending practices. Credit risks have a higher
                probability o f realization coupled with an external shock (particularly given the large
                foreign exchange exposure o f Ukraine's private sector). While access to the international
                bond market has reducedmaturity and roll-over risks, and open foreign exchange positions
                inthe banking sector are small, there are significant credit risks associated with the rapid
                credit expansion and the possibility o f exchange rate movements as many domestic
                borrowers are unhedged. Moreover, refinancing risks in selected banks could lead to
                tightening liquidity throughout the banking system against the background o f still fragile
                confidence. This underscores the importance o f the NBU's continued efforts to strengthen
                bank regulation and supervision, and to act fast and decisively to resolve problem banks.

         (iv)   Inappropriate macroeconomic policy responses. Should metal prices and external
                demand fall sharply, there would be the need for a sharper fiscal adjustment, accompanied
                by some exchange rate adjustment. Tightening external liquidity would hurt investment
                demand and may cause difficulties in the banking sector, where recent credit growth has
                been very fast. An inadequate fiscal and monetaryresponse, with rising fiscal deficits and a
                delayed but sharp exchange rate adjustment would exacerbate these risks. The appropriate
                policy response would therefore be a gradual shift towards greater exchange rate flexibility
                 from the present position o f external strength to force private agents to adequately account
                and price foreign exchange risk.

35.      The authorities are expected to manage these risks and safeguard Ukraine's overall
macroeconomic stability over the medium to longrun.The commitment to macroeconomic stability i s
a shared goal across the political spectrum. Should an unexpected external shock occur, it i s expected that
the authorities would react with a combination o f fiscal tightening and exchange rate adjustments. The
execution o f fiscal policy over recent years leaves little doubt regarding the commitment to low overall
deficits. Indeed, fiscal performance in 2007 has been on target, and election-related spending pressures
have been contained. Moreover, there are a wide range o f opportunities for expenditure cuts in socially
not sensitive areas.16, while the current generosity in the area o f public wages and pensions would be
unlikely to continue inthe face o f an external shock. Given political pressure in favor o f exporter interests
incase of an external shock a nominal devaluation is likely, which initselfwould cushionthe adjustment
somewhat, albeit at the cost o f complicating the reduction in inflation. The biggest risk in such an
adjustment scenario would be the banking sector, which could face the double burden o f tightening
external liquidity and a deteriorating credit portfolio due to exchange rate adjustment. These risks are
mitigated by the substantial presence o f foreign banks that have taken long-term strategic positions in the
sector. While the degree o f parent support in the event o f tightening liquidity i s difficult to predict (and
should not be taken for granted), it i s still more likely that an adjustment would hurt second-tier banks
hardest and lead to further sector consolidation, which would over time strengthen the sector as a whole.


16 These include coal sector subsidies, which go largely to support a domestic miningequipment manufacturer
rather than to support coal sector restructuring; agricultural subsidies and tax expenditures, which inmany instances
benefit large farms rather than smallholders; discretionary benefits to particular occupations, such as generous
pension allowances for Rada deputies etc.. For a detailed review o f opportunities to create fiscal space through
expenditure reallocations, see the Public Finance Review (206).

The envisaged improvement in the legal fi-amework for bank supervision supported by this operation
should allow the NBU to more effectively deal with potentially insolvent second-tier banks and i s thus
another riskmitigating factor. Risks are discussed infurther detail inSection 7 below.


                                4. THE GOVERNMENTPROGRAM

A. ECONOMIC REFORMS 2000-2007: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE

36.      Despite significant political volatility, a common vision of economic reform has remained at
the core of successive government programs. Ukraine has seen three medium term programs since
2000, each with its own implementation plan. These programs and plans have changed with each
successive administration adjusting to different levels o furgency and priorities as seen by the government
in office. Nevertheless, and despite some differences in emphasis and articulation, the long-term
development objectives and key reform planks have remained largely unchanged. Table 4.1 provides a
broad brush summary o f these common development goals that have survived in the reform agenda over
successive governments. The DPL program is designed around the "common denominator"
development goals that (have been and) are part of the core reform agenda as seen across the main
politicalforces.

37.      The change in reform emphasis and rhetoric in government programs has followed a
changing economic and political environment. Former president Kuchma's last reformprogram (2000-
2004) placed emphasis on the shift away from the barter economy o f the late 1990s and moving towards
principles o f financial transparency and fiscal austerity in order to gain trust after the economic crisis.



                                                      23

After taking office in January 2005 current President Yushchenko and his new government under
(former) Prime Minister Timoshenko rapidly articulated a new reform program entitled "Meeting the
People" with its implementation plan called "EU Action Plan". This program and its plan articulated a
vision o f economic openness and transparency in the context o f aiming for accelerated and closer
economic integrationwith the EuropeanUnion and the rest o f the world, whilst sharing the h i t s o frecent
growth more equitably among the population. Following the parliamentary elections in2006, the program
put forward by current Prime Minister Yanukovich places emphasis on reinvigorating growth based on
increased private investment and trade, while continuing the efforts in improving public service delivery.
Nonetheless, the differences are more around format than substance, as the common themes in Table 4.1
reveal.


B. MAPPINGTHE CONSENSUS:REFORMPLANS GOING FORWARD

38.     The consensus around key development objectives is a central rationale for proceedingwith
this DPL at a time of significant political uncertainty. Being appraised just before parliamentary
elections, this operation cannot build on a formal Government program that would provide a framework
for future policy action. However, the Bank's team has consulted closely with both the current
Government and key members o f the political opposition as well as the President's office and these
consultations have confirmed that a significant degree o f consensus exists around Ukraine's key
economic reformpriorities.

39.     The consensus development vision aims to strengthen Ukraine's competitiveness and
further its integration with Europe and with the global economy. There i s agreement that this will
require improvements inthe business climate, inthe depth o f the financial sector, incorporate governance
and transparency, and inthe delivery o f infrastructure services. There i s also a consensus around the need
to modernize Ukraine's public sector, to lower the tax burden, improve public sector financial
management and make spending more efficient, in order to meet the social aspirations o f the population
while gradually reducing the size and scope o f the public sector.

40.     The DPL program is designed in support of this common development vision and provides
an anchor for its implementation. The Bank explicitly takes into account the fact that Ukraine's
political environment may continue to be characterized by volatility. The challenge facing Ukraine i s
primarily one o f implementation rather than articulation o f strategic priorities. Implementation obstacles
relate to the many particular interests that would be affected by reforms, and any government requires
strong champions to push reform measures through the parliament and subsequently oversee their
enforcement by the large bureaucracy. This challenge i s also shared by reformers on both sides o f the
political spectrum. Ukraine i s inneed o f greater policy consistency and discipline inimplementation. One
o f the purposes o f the DPL program i s to be an anchor for policy makers that provides for some
continuity.

41.     The key reform priorities and a roadmap of development policy actions to address the
associated challenges are articulated in the Letter of Development Policy requesting the Bank's
assistance (Annex 110. This statement o f policy intentions was prepared by the Government o f Prime
Minister Yanukovich but has been reviewed and endorsed by the President's office and provides a sound
framework for the policy dialogue over the coming 18 months. Based on the articulation o f the long-term
development vision inthe different Government programs reviewed above, and on the actions included in
the Letter o f Development Policy, reform intentions can be summarized and grouped into the following
priority areas: (i)promoting innovation, investment, and trade, (ii)    modernizing the public sector, (iii)
improving public service delivery, (iv) increasing social inclusion and alleviating poverty, and (v)
furthering deregulation and promoting employment through small business development.

Promotion of Innovation, Investment and Trade

42.       The authorities place significant emphasis on turning Ukraine into an export-oriented,
competitive economy and most recently the WTO agenda has been at the forefront of reforms.
Ukraine has a solid stock o f human capital and - as a legacy from the Soviet Union - certain high-tech
industries are present inthe country, most notably the aerospace industry.A Competitiveness Council has
been created under the patronage o f the President o f Ukraine, and in 2006 an Investment Promotion
Agency was established with the support o f DPL            I.17 The authorities have shied away so far from
embracing an openly activist industrialpolicy and have sought the Bank's advice on ways to promote the
country's competitiveness inmarket-friendly ways.18

43.       WTO accessionand closer integrationwith the EUis a shared policyvision on bothsides of
the politicalspectrum. Following the passage o fkey legislationto enter WTO, negotiations with the EU
over an expended free trade agreement are likely to drive this agenda going forward. There i s also
agreement that Ukraine must maintain close relations with Russia, still its single largest trading partner.
However, there clearly i s a difference in the emphasis and tone concerning relations with Russia between
the main political forces. Key challenges in this relationship relate to the full implementation o f the
existing free trade agreement between both countries and the negotiation o f import prices and modalities
for natural gas. Sensitivities around the issue o f Ukraine's possible membership in NATO rather than
fundamental differences concerning economic relations set the two sides o f the political spectrum apart on
this issue.

44.       Ukraineplansto mobilizesignificant privateinvestmentto support the modernizationof its
economy.The authorities are aware o fthe needto improve the investment climate to this effect as well as
continue to strengthen the financial sector. The Government program aims to improve corporate
governance and the functioning o f the domestic capital market, including by adopting the long awaited
new Joint Stock Company Law, to allow domestic savings to be mobilized and channeled more
effectively to domestic companies. This priority i s supported by other political forces, despite strong
resistance by vested interests. A draft has been submitted to Parliament and it i s expected that it would be
discussed and adopted soon after the elections. The EU Free Trade Agreement negotiations are likely to
provide a framework for hrther improvements in the regulation and supervision o f financial markets.
Moreover, the upcoming European Football Championships in Ukraine and Poland in 2012 provide
another incentive and opportunity to set the conditions for greater private investment, including in
transport, municipal and tourism related services.

45.       The promotionof Ukraine's transit potentialandthe full use of Ukraine's existingtransport
assets is one of the authorities' primaryobjectives. To this end, an ambitious investment program has
been designed and the authorities plan to support it with significant public resources, whilst aiming,
where possible, to attract private capital, including through the development o f a Law on Public Private
Partnerships. The authorities are also paying attention to transport safety issues, both in road
transportation and through the introduction o f European flight safety standards. In the railway sector, a
sector reform program developed with EBRD support and endorsedby the Cabinet o f Ministers calls for a

some overlapping mandates and greater funding authority. Yet, a recent MIGA needs assessment on InvestUkraine
(the initial investmentpromotionagency) assesses the InvestUkraine's objectives and work-program positively,
noting, however, the needto improve skills o f staff and embed investment promotion into a broader strategic
framework.
''Draft  laws are being prepared on InvestmentPromotion, Regional Development andPublic Private Partnerships
and the Bank's advice has beensought on all three laws.

reduction o f cross-subsidies between freight and passenger traffic as well as between export and domestic
freight operations, to bringrailway tariffs inline with WTO requirements.

46.      One of the primary areas for efficiency improvements and modernization investments in
Ukraine is improving energy efficiency. The Ministry o f Fuel and Energy has developed and the
Cabinet o f Ministers endorsed an Action Plan for reformover the period 2007-2011, which forms a strong
basis for Bank support. Key measures include further price adjustment and strengthening o f collection
di~cipline'~;moving to market based pricing in the coal sector and privatizing remaining coal mines;
passing a law to formally establish the independence o f the energy regulator; privatization o f domestic
power distribution companies; developing further the domestic wholesale electricity market and creating
the conditions to allow Ukraine to be integrated into the European energy market; improving corporate
governance inthe energy companies through the conclusion o f performance contracts, the appointment o f
independent directors to supervisory boards, and mandatory independent financial audits to be carried out
and published annually; developing a domestic natural gas market; modernizing the domestic gas
distribution system; and creating conditions for the greater exploitation and use o f domestic natural gas
reserves. This i s an extraordinarily ambitious agenda to be implemented over the period through 2011,
with the sequencing of individual measures yet to be fully mapped and agreed. The DPL program
provides one important plank o f support for implementationo f the above measures.

47.      To address the significant regionalvariations in living standards, successive governments
have worked on measures to address competitiveness issues at the regional level. The current
Government's plans include changing the allocation o f capital subventions from the budget, developing
regional-central agreements to guide the support for lagging regions, introducing a property tax to
enhance local budget revenues, and encouraging the pooling o f resources at the regional district level to
better exploit economies o f scope and scale. In addition, the authorities are aiming to make their
agricultural sector more internationally competitive, by facilitating investment, creating a land market,
harmonizing food safety standards with the EU and bringing agriculture support measures in line with
WTO requirements. Energy saving and the development o f bio-fuel is also to be encouraged. So far,
however, little o f the agricultural agenda has been moving towards implementation, and the political
consensus to remove key obstacles such as repeated state interventions into agricultural markets or the
lack o f a functioning land market seems to be missing. This operation recalibrates its expectations on the
pace o fprogress inlandreforminparticular andhas dropped corresponding policybenchmarks.

Reform of the Public Sector

48.      According to government plans, the management of state-owned enterprises is to be
tightened and the state is to exit those companies in which it retains non-strategic minority
interests.Inthis way, the financial performance of state-owned companies is to be strengthenedand their
ability to finance their own modernization enhanced, whilst the scope for private investment in non-
strategic sectors i s to be increased. Nonetheless, privatization i s likely to continue to face controversy,
given that it often confronts the business interests o f key economic players. This operation focuses its
support on reforming the management of SOEs rather than on reinvigorating the privatization process.
This is not an implicit ranking o f priorities, but rather reflects the expectation that privatization will
remain controversial and its implementation, if it progresses at all, may continue to be marred by lack o f
transparency.

49.       Tax and budgetary reforms have received increasing prominence in the policy debate, with
the aim to reduce the state's claim on the economy's resources, thereby creating more room for private
investment.20Government plans inthe area o f tax and budgetreform extend towards the capital budgeting
system which i s to be made more efficient, and towards state procurement, which is to be brought inline
with international standards. A new tax code has been drafted by the authorities, but its fate after the
elections remains somewhat uncertain. Nonetheless, key aspects o f the tax code in the area o f tax policy
and importantlytax administration may nonetheless be passed as individual pieces o f legislation.

50.       After significant backtracking in the area of state procurement legislation, the passage of a
new law is emerging as a central policy concern. The Government's renewed commitment to reform
was underlined by President Yushchenko who in signingthe December 2006 amendments to the Law o f
State Procurement called for a renewed legislative initiative by the summer o f 2007 to bring the law to
international standards. Developments over the summer o f 2007 have again brought this issue to the fore,
and there seems to be wide agreement that the current law needs to be changed. It i s therefore to be
expected that amendments (or a new law) that address the major concerns raised against the current law
would be passed soon after the parliamentary elections.21

51.       The authorities place the review of relations between the central and local government at
the center of their efforts to improve public services. In doing so, they concur with the emerging
findings o f the Bank's Public Finance Review Volume 11, which examines the nexus between fiscal
decentralization and public service delivery. The Government's reform strategy also echoes the findings
o f the 2004 World Development Report on public service delivery in aiming to shift the locus o f
accountability closer to the final consumer o f public services. Key legislative initiatives in this area are
the development of a concept for territorial reform, and changes to the budget code that enhance local
revenue raising capacity. However, as noted in a recent Bank policy note on sub-national government
borrowing, the envisaged legal amendments in the latter area so far do not provide an adequate
framework to allow local governments to take charge o f their own investment needs.22The authorities
have also continued progress on the development o f a new Civil Service L a d 3 . However, the existing
draft, which has been extensively commented on by the donor community, has not so far been submitted
to the parliamentand the reformagenda inthis area may slip.

Improving Public Service Delivery

52.       In the area of public service delivery, subsequent government programs have contained a
particular emphasis on education and health. These two public services account for around 25 percent
o f total budget outlays and often represent the bulk o f local government budget expenditures. In the
education sector, the authorities follow a three-pronged strategy based on (i)                    selectively modernizing
schools, with a particular focus on rural and the provision o f computer and IT equipment; (ii)                   enhancing
the role o f independent student assessments, including through the full roll-out in 2007 o f the Trends in
International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), to which Ukraine signed up and which it piloted
in2005; and (iii)     alignment with the Bologna process in higher education. Higher education i s deserving

o f particular attention, because Ukraine uniquely has almost two thirds o f the age cohort of 18-21 year
olds enrolled in higher education, yet the labor market relevance o f this investment has been called into
doubt because o f uneven quality o f graduates and a structural mismatch between slulls taught and skills
demanded by the market.

53.      In the health sector, the program contains two priorities.First, the Government plans to
revisit the legislativelimitations on rationalizing the network of health facilities. Although this will
face tough discussions in parliament, it i s nonetheless a critical first step towards optimizing the size o f
the large, underutilized, and inefficient network o f health facilities. This would allow a more efficient use
o f resources and has the potential to increase quality through better equipped facilities once closures and
mergers are allowed. In addition, relaxing other normatives that affects budget flexibility at the facility
level (and as a consequence at the local government level) is also part o f the broad objective o f improving
the quality o f service delivery though sectoral and local government reform. Second, the authorities
have reconfirmed their commitment to contain the HIV/AIDS epidemics, where Ukraine is facing
the worst rates of increaseinEurope.

Increase social inclusion andpoverty reduction

54.      The social inclusionagenda remains an importantone in the 2007 program. Importantly, the
promotion o fjob creation i s placed at the top o f the Government's priorities in this area. The authorities
stress the needto bringinformaljobs into the formal sector including through a reduction inthe very high
rates o f payroll taxation over time, and to increase the labor market relevance o f training programs to
improve the matching o fjob seekers and vacancies.

55.      In the area of poverty reduction and social protection, the program makes reference to
ongoing efforts to reformthe administration of social security. A law on the introduction o f a Single
Social Security was passed in first reading in early 2007, providing for the unification o f the existing four
separate social insurance payments. This follows earlier efforts to unify the administration of social
transfer payments. The final passage o f the law has been delayed due to the dissolution o f the parliament
butremains firmly on the reformagenda. Two additional bigreforminitiatives that are plannedalthough
not yet initiated are (i)    the reform o f social transfers and privileges to make them more directly means
tested (at present there are over 13 constitutionally guaranteed specific benefits, the incidence o f which i s
often regre~sive)'~and (ii)the introduction o f a fully funded mandatory second pillar in the pension
system. The latter will require parallel reforms in the regulatory framework for the operation o f pension
funds, and importantly, the further development of the domestic capital market to increase the supply o f
domestic assets available for pension fundinvestment.

Promoting SMEs and reducing the cost of doing business

56.      The current government's program continues the particular focus on the promotion of
SMEs, and- as inprevious programs this issueis givenprominenceby singlingit out rather than
                                             -
merging it with the general objective of improving the business climate. Inthis context, the program
stresses licensing and inspection reform as well as the reform o f the standards system to bring it in
compliance with the EU. The current government program also foresees the provision o f budget funded
interest rates subsidies for credits to SMEs through the financial system, although this measure may not
see unanimous support inthe financial community.

                               5. THE BANK'S PROGRAM OF SUPPORT

A. PROGRAMRELEVANCEAND LINKTO THE BANK'S STRATEGY

57.      This operationwas developedtogether with a new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and
i s strongly anchoredinitsprinciples. The new CPS stresses inparticular the need for a) selectivity and
b) flexibility in addressing Ukraine's evolving needs as a middle income country with strong access to
international financial markets. The DPL i s selective in its policy benchmarks, and has been recalibrated
to some extent to take into account the likely pace o f progress in reform, given repeated political
instability and hence reduced capacity to carry through an ambitious reform agenda. The DPL i s also
flexible in line with the Bank's best practice lessons in conditionality. The program foresees only a
limited number of triggers for the next adjustment operation and leaves open the possibility o f upgrading
other benchmarks to triggers, while de-emphasizing selected policy triggers to match the program to the
sequencing o freforms, as long as the overall pace o f progress i sjudged sufficient.

58.      The current operation retains a three pillar cross-sectoral design in reflection of the
continuity of the reformagendafromthe previousCAS2'.The DPLprogramthat beganwith DPL 1in
2005 laid out an ambitious reform agenda, which remains unfinished in a number o f important
dimensions. The Bank's team has considered redesigning the DPL series together with the new CPS but
opted for continuity in reflection o f the significant continuity in the Government's reform plans and
vision and inorder to safeguard the role o f the DPL as an anchor for the Bank's policy dialogue across the
whole program. It i s envisaged that this strategy would remain inplace untilthe completion o f the series
with DPL 111.After that the question whether to proceed with thematic DPLs insupport o f eachpillar or
continue the cross-sectoral focus would needto be reconsidered.

59.      The new CPS hasadopteda two pillar support strategy,which providesa usefulframework
for the evolution of the DPL series going forward. Specifically, the new CPS moves away from the
seven pillar strategy o f the old CAS towards a much simpler framework, based around improving
competitiveness by strengthening the business climate and investing ininfrastructure on the one hand, and
improving the delivery o f public services through the reform o f public finance and public administration
on the other. This design aims to take into account to the greatest possible extent the synergies between
different reform areas, whilst forcing the Bank to be more selective in its support. The DPL program i s
currently based on a three pillar strategy, but the second and third pillars are strongly linked, since the
Bank's support i s targeted towards reforms that would increase the efficiency and effectiveness o f public
services as the main entry point towards greater service quality. This i s precisely the strategy followed in
the CPS.

60.      The DPL program contains significant linkages to the Bank's investmentlending portfolio,
although the latter has implemented with mixed success. For example, the DPL program supports
policy reform in the energy sector, which in turn has been key to unlock the Bank's investment lending
support, which now amounts to two large operations (Hydropower Rehabilitation, US$ 106 million and
Power Transmission Project, US$ 200 million), with further loans in preparation. The DPL program has
continuously supported measures to improve fiscal management and modernize tax policy and

25 The 2003-2007 CAS was built around seven pillar as follows: (i) macroeconomic and financial stability, (ii)  poverty reduction
and mitigation o f social risks, (iii)
                                     comprehensive and harmonized humandevelopment, (iv) protection o f the natural
environment, (v) greater integration into the world economic and financial system, (vi) dynamic regional development and
reduction o f regional imbalances, and (vii) improved transparency and accountability o f the government. These seven pillars can
be matched into a framework with three thematic areas including(a) promoting economic growth and private sector development
(pillars(i), and (v)); (b) improved governance (pillars (vi) and (vii)) and (c) greater social inclusion (pillars (ii)and(iii)see
           (iv),                                                                                                            -
IEGevaluation o fthe 2003-2007 CAS. The simpler three thematic areas framework correspondsvery closely to the design of the
DPLprogram.


                                                               29

administration, efforts that are complemented by a State Tax Administration Modernization project,
approved in 2001. The Public Finance Management Reform project, prepared in parallel with this
operation, i s supported by conditionality related to debt management, intergovernmental fiscal relations,
capital budgeting, while drawing on the progress in consolidation o f the public finance management
system supported by DPL I.    The Bank's investment loans in support o f modernizing social assistance as
well as improving access to education are also linked closely with policy reforms supported by this DPL.
Itbears emphasis that the business deregulation agenda supported bythis operation has been substantially
designed by an IFC team, working in parallel through technical assistance. Improvements in the
regulatory framework for public private partnerships envisaged under DPL I11 will create further
opportunities for IFC as well as Bank lending, particularly inthe transport sector.

61.      The Bank's DPL program (as the former PAL program) plays an important role in
anchoring the Government's reform program. Over time, as macroeconomic performance has
improved, and Ukraine's access to market financing has widened, the Bank's role has changed. Financing
needs, while still relevant, no longer dominate inthe dialogue, but the Bank's involvement in the reform
program through the DPL i s regarded by the authorities as an important signal to domestic political
constituencies and international financial markets. Moreover, the Bank plays a useful role in bringing
different government agencies and ministries together and focusing reform efforts on concrete next steps.
Through the DPL program the Bank can help to concretize the realization o f the Government's broad
vision o f economic reform and protect the quality o f policy making against interference by special interest
groups. This role has been particularly critical in the most recent period and the Government's strong
request to continue with the preparation o f the D P L are a reflection o f the value it sees in the Bank
providing this framework.

62.       Moreover, the DPL program helps to anchor common development objectives articulated
by successivegovernments' programs bringing a sense of reform continuity. However, playing this
role effectively requires the Bank to become more selective in its policy interventions and adopt greater
flexibility in response to domestic political realities and changes in reform emphasis, particularly in the
context o f dealing with a middle income country with good access to financial markets.


B. OVERALLDESIGNOFTHE DPLPROGRAM

63.      The Government has requested the Bank's support for the implementation of its medium-
term program(2007-2011) startingwith a second DevelopmentPolicy Loan. As demonstrated inthe
foregoing section, the recent government programs exhibit continuity and a similar vision in basic core
areas o f economic and social development (see Section 4). This continuity, underlinedby the fact that the
first loan inthis series was approved under the first Timoshenko government, provides an opportunity for
the Bank to continue its programmatic support through the D P L series despite o f the current political
uncertainty.

64.      As articulated in Section 2, Ukraine's reform agenda remains unfinished across a large
number of areas. Progress inmacroeconomic stabilization, trade integration and access to international
financial markets notwithstanding, the investment climate in Ukaine remains comparatively weak and
the economy insufficiently diversified. The public sector i s large and has even grown in recent years,
highlightingthe need for improved public sector efficiency. While there has been progress ingovernance
and accountability over the last two years, Ukraine still lags its Eastern European peers. Despite
reductions in poverty and recent increases in average household incomes, issues o f social fairness
commanda highdegree o fpolitical significance. The public's ratings o f key social services such as health
and education are poor, although public spending in these areas i s comparatively high. These various



                                                      30

challenges, and the desire o f the government to tackle all these issues intheir reform agenda, indicate that
the design o f the DPLprogram around three closely inter-linked thematic areas remains appropriate.

65.       There are close inter-thematic linkages, which i s the basic rationale for choosing a multi-
sectoral approach instead of a series of single sector DPLs. The underlying rationale o f the present
DPL program is that there cannot be a sustained improvement in private sector competitiveness and
infrastructure policy without tackling issues o f public finance and public administration and without
paying due attention to public service delivery and social protection. A single-theme approach would
indeed offer greater focus with overall fewer and more targeted policy benchmarks. However, there i s a
clear indication that the government will move forward inits reform agenda across thematic areas. At the
same time, and given the structure o f the government in Ukraine the authorities may not yet be ready to
handle successfully the high transaction costs o f multiple policy lending operations at once. While this
may change, the proposal in this operation i s to bring the current cross-sectoral agenda to its conclusion
and then consider jointly with the authorities whether a more thematic approach would be appropriate.

66.       While the DPL program is designed to maintain the cross-sectoral approach it also
envisages narrowed conditionality and greater selectivity in thematic focus going forward. DPL I
already narrowed the scope and breadth o f conditionality compared to the PAL program. It supported
seven prior actions and laid out a matrix o f institutional and policy reform for 2005 and 2006 with a total
o f 48 benchmarks, with some back-loading o f critical reforms into 2006. In a clear departure from the
PAL design, DPL Ididnot specify reform triggers for DPL 11,but instead envisaged an annual update o f
the framework to match preferred government sequencing o f reforms across the main areas o f
engagement. As Section 6 and Annex Ibelow show, this framework has provided for positive reform
outcomes with a large proportion o f benchmarks reached. Infact, since a large percentage o f the original
48 benchmarks laid out by DPL Ihave been accomplished (as shown by Annex I), operation brings     this
some new benchmarks (for DPL 111) tailored to the latest economic and policy environment in the
country. While narrowing conditionality further, DPL I1specifies triggers for the next operation (DPL 111)
to avoid policy slippages towards the closing o f this programmatic series (see Box 5.1).


Box 5.1: Narrowing conditionality and Improving Flexibility
Consistent with the principles o f good practice on conditionality this operation presents the following design
features:
First, D P L I1narrows conditionality further. The policy matrix includes a total o f 24 future benchmarks and triggers
envisaged to be implemented over a timeframe o f around 12-18 months.
Second, this operation specifies 6 triggers for the next operation (DPL 111) in the program. These triggers are
justified and elaborated in detail in Section 6. The purpose i s to achieve breakthrough in a few critical areas as a
result o f the program. The design assumes broad continuity in the government's strategic vision and a gradual
deepening o f the dialogue around critical reform bottlenecks. It is envisaged that these triggers would become prior
actions for D P L 111, although some deviation from the reformpath specified inthis operation would still be possible.
Third, significant efforts have been made to ensure that the reformtriggers and other benchmarks are owned by the
authorities. Four o f the six triggers concern legislative initiatives that have already been prepared and for which the
authorities believe there i s a good chance o f parliamentary approval. Bank staff have commented and extensively
discussed this legislation with the authorities (indeed Bank recommendations have in several instances -
procurement reform and strengthening o f capital market regulation - been quoted positively by government
counterparts in the local press). The authorities look to Bank support as a key element to push through this
legislation, which faces some resistance from vested interests in the parliament. One trigger (the fiscal deficit
ceiling) concerns an area where successive governments have demonstrated strong commitment. The sixth trigger
(the quasi-fiscal deficit inthe energy sector) is politically the most difficult, given popular resistance against further
utility price increases. Nonetheless, the authorities recognize the need to continuously improve the financial
condition o f the energy sector as a key pre-condition for attracting private investment and reducing the country's
energy inefficiency and dependence.



                                                            31

Fourth, as the representation o f the institutional and policy reform matrix in Annex I1reveals, in some areas no
conditionality i s specified going forward (e.g. in telecommunications reform or in the reform o f the insurance
market), while other areas acquire greater prominence (such as the promotion o fprivate investmentintransport and
energy). I t i s envisaged that hture DPLs may adopt even greater selectivity and emphasis o f themes within the
overall multi-sectoral architecture, reflecting the depth o f engagement in particular areas. The sequence o f
benchmarks from DPL Ithrough DPL I11has been tailored to progress from legislation to implementation, although
in line with Ukraine's large remaining legislative agenda, legislative actions still dominate in the matrix of
institutional andpolicy reform.

67.       The sequence of DPLs envisaged by the program provides for a progression from policy
development to implementation, depending on the status of the engagement. For example, the
deregulation agenda that was relatively broadly specified and designed inDPL Ihas progressedtowards a
very specific focus on the reform o f inspections, the implementationo f permits and licensingreforms and
the implementation o f standards reforms. In the energy sector, DPL Ifocused on the development o f an
energy sector action plan, and future operations will be designed to support the implementation o f the
action plan. In the social sectors, the present operation focuses the agenda on financing issues in health
and education, reflecting past experience that the broad strategic engagement around the development o f
sector strategies under PAL and DPL Idid not achieve the desired result.

taken by DPL 111.As explained further below, the current operation specifies a series o f triggers for D P L

C. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS FROMTHE BANK'S AAA AND DONOR
    COORDINATION

69.     This operation draws heavily on the Bank's AAA program. The flagship AAA product in
this respect was the programmatic Public Finance Review (PFR), with the first volume (PFR I)
completed in September 2006 and the second volume planned for release before end 2007. The PFR
highlights the critical issue o f creating fiscal space for growth through making the public sector more
efficient and allowing thereby a reduction in the state's tax take. This central idea is reflectedthroughout
the Government program, including in the suggested reform steps for improving tax and expenditure
policy in a number o f areas, bringing fiscal sustainability to the pension system, and strengthening the
capital budget system. Analytical support inthe areas o f intergovernmental fiscal relations and efficiency
and performance in health and education services i s ongoing through the second phase o f the Public
Finance Review (PFR 11) (in process o f being finalized). Preliminary findings o f the PFR I1 were
discussed with the government in early 2007 and helped to shape the dialogue in these areas for DPL
moving forward.

70.     In 2007, the Bank completed a Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment (PEFA) for
Ukraine, which benchmarks the country's public financial system against international
comparators and provided the basis for discussions on further improvements in public financial
management. Key findings o f the PEFA assessment are that Ukraine scores relatively well against
regional and international comparators on budget credibility, comprehensiveness and transparency, but
retains weaknesses in areas such as public procurement, internal audit, controls over payroll and the
management o f state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The DPL picks up on this analysis through its support for
a new law on public procurement as well as measures to improve SOE management and financial
reporting. Efforts to further consolidate the public financial management system, integrate it into a
medium-term planning framework and further improve financial controls are also pursued under the
Bank's Public Finance Management investment loan.

71.     A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) and a Corporate Governance ROSC
were completed in 2006, and a Financial and Auditing ROSC was drafted in 2007, all drawing
attention to the outstandinggovernance challenges that Ukraine faces. The CPAR analyzed in depth
the reversal in public procurement reform during 2005 and 2006, which has led to the fragmentation o f
the public procurement system and the loss o f public oversight with key functions transferred to a non-
government entity. The ROSC exercises have motivated recommendations to strengthen the legal and
regulatory framework to support the development o f the capital markets, which are included in the DPL
program. A Financial Sector Assessment Program (F-SAP) Update, under preparation, consolidates these
recommendations and extends them to the financial sector (including banking) as a whole. IFC's Public
Enterprise Partnership program has continued to advise on measures to improve the business climate for
SMEs and the measures proposed in this operation draw directly on this work in focusing on inspections
and standards reform. A Transport Strategy Note was prepared in 2006 to re-launch the Bank's
engagement in the transport sector and its recommendations find reflection in the emphasis the
Government i s placing on usingits transport and transit potential inthe 2007 program.

72.     In addition, the Bank has provided just in time advice in a number of critical areas,
including tax policy, grain export quotas, and energy price effects. It provided tax policy advice
through a swift but comprehensive revision o f the new draft tax code under discussion during May-June
o f 2007. It provided an analytical note and took a strong public stance against the introduction o f grain
export quotas and will continue the dialogue with the authorities in this area and in agricultural policy

more generally. It was one o f the first institutionsto come forth with estimates o f the impact o f higher gas
prices on Ukraine's economy and has updated this analysis with a policy note supporting the authorities'
efforts to raise domestic energy tariffs. The Bank has also published an updated poverty assessment that
examines in particular the impact o f higher energy prices on the poor and shows that targeted support
would be effective and affordable insheltering the poor from the energy price shock.



                                         6. THE PROPOSED OPERATION

A. CONTINUITY INTHE MULTISECTORALAND PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH

73.        The proposed DPL I1continues the multi-sectoral approach initiated by DPL-I under the
same thematic umbrellas. Inaddition, DPL I1refines the coverage o f each thematic umbrella to adjust
its structure to the current economic and reform scenario. Thus, DPL I1supports selected objectives and
priorities o f the government under the following themes: (i)                    improving the investment climate for growth,
(ii)creatingfiscalspaceforgrowththroughstrengthenedpublicfinancesandpublicsectorreform, (iii)
improving service delivery and social inclusion.26Table 6.1 lays out key prior actions/triggers under
this programmatic and multi-sectoral operation. All prior actions under DPL 11 have been
completed to date. Annex I1contains the detailed policy and institutional refom matrix with all the
actions inthe three operations, including medium-term outcomes.

26 Inline with DPLI,reformpriorities are grouped somewhat differently than inthe government program: business
deregulation issues are included under the investment climate heading, which public service delivery is grouped
together with the social inclusion agenda. This does not affect the substance, however.
27 The full list o f legislation passed i s contained in a Annex, Schedule 1o f the Loan Agreement. It encompasses 59+ laws post
DPL Iacross a variety of sectors including in: Customs procedures, Trade barriers, tariffs, and export taxation, Property and
intellectual rights, Banking(to allow foreign banks to open branches inUkraine), Insurance regulation, Foreigneconomic
activities, Agriculture.

74.        There has been significant progressin the policies and reforms laid out as "future actions"
under DPL I.The first DPL put forward an ambitious multi-sectoral agenda of benchmarks to be
undertaken by the government. Annex Ishows the status o f all "future actions" laid out by the DPL I.                     As
o f today, close to 85 percent o f the measures are either accomplished, are prior actions for the DPL 11,or
triggers for DPL I11(see Annex Iwhich contains a status report o f all future actions laid out initially by
D P L I). The remaining actions (around 15 percent) have been dropped from the program in mutual
agreement with the government either because the respective policy objective i s pursued through a
different approach under the same DPL program, because the specific policy action can be better and
more appropriately addressed through a different type o f Bank instrument such as technical assistance, or
because o f a potential disengagement o f the bank inthe area.

75.        Two notable "exits" havebeenthe engagementwith the government onthe restructuringof
Savings Bank and the dropping of conditionality regarding the establishment of a land market.
Regarding Savings Bank, following repeated delays in proceeding to a Memorandum o f Development
that would outline the future strategic directions for the bank in December 2006 the authorities
approached the World Bank with the request to drop this from the list o f DPL benchmarks. Considering
the muchreduced systemic importance o f Savings Bank, the Bank agreed to this request, noting however
its desire to continue to monitor Savings Bank's performance and willingness to assist inthe restructuring
process should the government decide on its preferred course o f action with technical assistance. In
relation to the land market, the Bank unilaterally took the decision not to push for the establishment o f a
single registry for immovable property and land as well as for the lifting o f the moratorium on land sales
through the DPL (these had been PAL I1conditions). This reflects the team's assessment that these areas
continue to be fraught with controversy and the fact that the Bank already has a large investment
operation that has been in prolonged difficulty because o f lack of progress on this issue. The DPL i s
unlikely to leverage breakthrough in this area, and instead the program would risk being held up by
continued delays.



                                                                36

76.     In addition, the Bank has shifted its support for privatizationto sector specific concerns,
such as through the support for a law on Public Private Partnerships focused on the attraction o f
investment in the transport sector and through supporting greater private investment in the energy sector.
While privatization remains a key challenge for Ukraine, given that more than half o f total employment
remains in the state sector, it has been fraught with political controversy inrecent years and dogged with
allegations o f lack o f transparency. The re-privatization o f Krivorozhstal in 2005 raised significant
revenues (US$4.8 billion) for the state, but the broader re-privatization drive in which it was executed
also caused concern about the sanctity o f property rights and contributed to a sharp investment slowdown.
Talung account o f these concerns, the re-privatization policy was stopped and has not reappeared as a
major political theme since. The 2007 budget included large privatization revenues, including from the
sale o f three large SOEs: Luhansk Teplovoz locomotive plan, Odessa Port Side chemical plant, and
Urktelecom. Inthe event, only the first o f the three has been sold and its sale i s being contested in court
amidst allegations o f lack o f transparency. Given the highly politicized nature o f privatization, the Bank
needs to adjust its strategy and support greater private investment in the economy through multiple
approaches. Public Private Partnerships in transport as well as in municipal utilities are one promising
avenue, as i s further privatization o f energy distribution, where the state already holds only minority
stakes in several companies. The broader energy sector reforms supported by this operation will help lay
the foundations for an acceleration o f privatization in the sector. In addition, the greater emphasis on
improved management o f SOEs i s geared to mitigate some o f the underlying fiscal risks (even ifnot fully
addressing efficiency losses) associated with extensive government ownership o fproductive assets.

77.      In most cases, the mediumterm outcomes establishedunder DPL Ihave been exceeded by
the results (medium term outcomes), as discussed in detail in section 2. Several medium term
outcomes show impressive progress across all three thematic areas. Inthe area o f business climate some
clear examples are the surge in per capita foreign direct investment (FDI) from USD 36 to 110 in 2006,
the rate o f business entry up to 8 percent in 2006 (1 percent above expectations in DPL I),          and the
increased confidence in the banking sector as reflected by the deposits to GDP ratio that reached 35
percent (7 percentage points above the established medium term outcome). Inthe area o f public finance
and public administration deficits were kept below the ceiling established o f 3.5 percent o f GDP, tax
arrears at 1.4 percent o f GDP outperformed DPL Imedium-term targets (of 3 percent of GDP), budget
arrears also fell to just 0.14 percent o f GDP (close to the DPL Imedium-term target to eliminate budget
arrears altogether), and pension outlays were kept under control after the 2005 surge (2006 expenditure
were 1.1 percent o f GDP below the level of 2005). Moreover, with stronger than expected growth in
GDP, the degree o f fiscal discipline maintainedthroughout allowed public debt to fall to just 15 percent
o f GDP. Inthe area o f social inclusion, social insurance collection went up and poverty rates decreased
consistently since 2005 (see Section 1).The strong achievements on medium-term outcomes set by DPL-I
has allowed the Bank and the authorities to jointly develop a new set o f medium-term outcomes, whilst
narrowing the monitoring measures to reflect changes that the Bank expects to directly influence under
the program.


B. THE DPL I1PROGRAMAND THE PROGRAMTOWARDS DPL I11

78.      This section explains the DPL I1program under its three thematic umbrellas: (i)       improving the
investment climate for growth, (ii)   creating fiscal space for growth through strengthened public finances
and public sector reform, and (iii)   improving service delivery and social inclusion. Each sub-section
highlights the policy accomplishments this operation supports (as laid out inthe "future actions'' in the
DPL I), discusses the prior actions already fulfilled for DPL 11, and finally sets a road map o f
          then
tentative triggers and benchmarks for DPL 111. Moreover, this section explains the relevance o f the
program inthe economic and reform context o fUkraine. The matrix o fpolicy and institutional reform for



                                                      37

the overall DPL program i s in Annex I1and clearly summarizes the sequence o f actions and reforms
achieved and envisagedby this operation.

B.1       Improving the Investment Climate for Growth

79.       There i s a large spectrum o f reforms needed to improve the investment climate in Ukraine, and
thus maintain (or increase) the level of foreign direct investment, enable export diversification and fbrther
trade integration, facilitate private business growth, and achieve greater competitiveness. The DPL I1and
the D P L I11 encapsulate critical reforms to improve the business climate in four sub-themes: (a)
improving international integration through trade liberalization and facilitation and investment, logistics
and promotion; (b) removing obstacles for entrepreneurship; (c) strengthening financial sector and
corporate governance; and (d) improving energy security and energy sector competitiveness. These sub-
themes encompass the broadreformprogramlaid out by the first D P L operation and provide a framework
that i s inline with the government's objectives and priorities.

80.       As a key basis to foster the overall investment climate, and in line with the requirements of
the new CPS, this operation is based on the need to maintain an adequate macroeconomic
framework. As articulated in Section 3 (and confirmed by the IMF Assessment Letter inAnnex V), this
i s currently the case in Ukraine and will continue to be a pre-condition for fbture development policy
lending. The new CPS concretizes the requirements o f an adequate macroeconomic framework with
reference to single digit or low double digit inflation and the maintenance o f public debt below 25 percent
o f GDP.These targets are consistent with the medium-term outcomes targeted by the DPL.**

Improving International Integration through Trade, Logistics and Transport Liberalization and
Facilitation

81.       Sustained economic growth will need to rely on strong export performance, on trade
liberalization and logistics facilitation, and on greater export diversification. Important results have
been achieved in the area o f trade liberalization under the DPL program. The government moved further
inthis area through a comprehensive reduction intariffs for a large list ofproducts across industries. At
the same time, Ukraine obtained "market economy" status, which was granted by the EU in2005 and by
the U S in 2006. Moreover, it locked in these gains by laying the legislative basis for WTO accession in
late 2006. Beyond this, however, the government will need to pay more attention to behind the border
issues such as trade and transit facilitation and logistics inorder to foster export diversification. Ukraine i s
located between two large markets: Russia and the EU. Moreover, Ukraine has large ports in the Black
Sea, and the country i s a possible transit corridor for products that come from the Caucasus and the
Middle East towards Europe and vice-versa. Yet, this potential may not be realized without greater
investments in transport infrastructure and improvements in trade and transit facilitation. For example,
Bank Staff estimate that given size o f the network o f roads, the country should be spending around 1.5
percent o f GDP just on road maintenance, but current spending i s only one third o f this level. There i s
scope for attracting private investment through a legal framework to promote Public Private Partnerships,
but this is still underdeveloped and proper regulation to minimize fiscal risks under PPP schemes is
needed. The railway sector has undergone little institutional reform.

82.       Legislative efforts that started in the late 1990s have continued throughout the last three
executive governments that took office placing Ukraine at the door to WTO. The formal negotiations


28 Infact, the government deficit target o f3 percent, with growth expected at 5.5 percent over the medium-term
would lead to a further decline inthe public debt ratio to GDP from the current 15 percent. Ulu-aine has some space
for additional government borrowing, but caution i s nonetheless warranted given sizeable implicit fiscal liabilities in
the pension system and the lost savings o f the former Soviet Sberbank.

for WTO accession date back 10 years, starting in 1997 with the administration o f former president
Kuchma. Since 2005 three different executive governments have taken office (all under current President
Yushchenko), and despite party line differences, all have placed WTO accession at the top o f the agenda.
The important goal o f WTO accession about to be achieved represents the effort o f several successive
governments and will be large step forward for Ukraine inthe structural reform agenda.

83.       The DPL I1 suuuorts as a prior action the enactment of critical pieces of ledslation
rewired for WTO accession. The full list includes approximately 38 laws passed in 2005-06 and 21
passed in late 2006 and 2007, including revisions to: (i)customs procedures; (ii)trade legislation,
including tariffs, and export taxation;       (iii)property and intellectual property rights, (iv) banking
regulation, allowing foreign banks to open branches in Ukraine (which also has positive externalities in
the mitigation o f risks in this sector), (v) insurance regulation; (vi) laws on foreign economic activities;
and (vii) agriculture. This completes a package of 75+ laws modified over the last 10 years and 149 bi-
lateral protocol agreements signed by Ukraine with all WTO members (except Kyrgyzstan). Onthis basis,
the authorities expect the Working Party to establish before the meeting o f the WTO Council inlate 2007
that Ukraine has fulfilled all requirements by member countries and i s thus ready for accession. This
compounded prior action rephrases the regulatory reform benchmarks related to WTO accession
contained inDPL Ias future actions and further extends them to reflect recent good progress.

84.      The DPL 11also suuuorts as a urior action the concrete steps taken to liberalize the
telecommunications sector, including tariff rebalancing, frequency allocations, issuance of new
mobile licenses and regulating interconnection obligations. These measures have been supported by
the adoption in June 2006 by the Cabinet o f Ministers o f a Concept o f the Development o f
Telecommunications Sector, in line with EU requirements. The National Commission on Regulation o f
Telecommunication, established with DPL -Iassistance, issued regulations on tariffs that brought
international fixed line tariffs down by between 40-80 percent. For instance tariffs per minute to Western
Europe declined from US$1 to US$0.6, to North America from US$0.55 to US$0.36, and to Asia, Africa
and Latin America from US$ 1.60 to US$0.6. Moreover, in December 2005, the Cabinet o f Ministers
adopted a resolution allocating 75 percent o f the military spectrum to civilian usage, and the government
has supported its implementation through budget funding to military and special users to facilitate the
spectrum migration. In2006 alone, 126 mobile phone licenses were issued and penetration rates increased
to 63 percent by year end. Open network access and associated rules and procedures were also regulated
in a sequence of Cabinet o f Ministers resolutions. Additionally, this operation supports other actions
taken under the program including the following: (i)    the completion o f comprehensive reduction o f import
tariffs, and (ii)the reform concept o f the railways sector approved by the CoM. This latter action was not
part o f the D P L program in its first operation but it i s an important step in supporting greater trade and
transport facilitation and has links with the reform o f state enterprises discussed further below.

85.      Movingforward, DPL Inwould support the full implementationof technical proceduresin
lineEU(and WTO), the further harmonizationofUkraine's customs regimewith the requirements
of the revised Kyoto Convention, and the facilitation of greater privateinvestment through PPPs.
The DPL I11foresees the following benchmarks: (i)Technical Procedures are fully in line with EU (and
WTO), including: (a) gradual decrease in the list o f goods which are subject to compulsory certification
aiming at further adapting o f the Technical regulation system in Ukraine to the EU requirements, (b)
review and cancelling o f outdated standards and adoption o f European standards, and (c) amending the
Articles 14 and 15 o f the Law o f Ukraine "On Protection o f Consumer Rights"; (ii)            Customs code
harmonized with the Kyoto Convention (as revised in 1997); and (iii)          amendments to legislation (or a
new Law) are adopted on PPP to promote private investments intransport infrastructure while addressing
fiscal risks. The reduction o f mandatory certification requirements would significantly ease behind the
border obstacles, as attested by several business surveys. Ukraine acceded to the Kyoto Convention in
2006, but needs to harmonize its legislative and regulatory framework with its obligations as a member.


                                                      39

This is expected to lead over time to a reduction inthe share o f goods undergoingphysical inspection at
customs and thus reduce border and inland transit times (although this would also require work to reduce
the burden o f multiple inspections by different agencies at the border). Finally, legislation on PPP would
allow Ukraine to modernize its transport system and attract private investment in key infrastructure
projects such as the European Football Championships 2012. Given the fiscal and governance risks
associated with unsolicited bids or inadequate concession arrangements, the Bank's and other donors'
support inthis area i s critical.

Removing Obstaclesfor Entrepreneurship

86.     A continuedeffort in reducingthe costs of doingbusinessis criticalfor Ukraine.Despite the
progress achieved over the last years, the framework under which businesses operate in the country
continues to be characterized by burdensome regulation and repeated discretionary interventions by
public officials. The D P L program was originally designed to support a wholesale deregulation effort.
This took off well in 2005 with the cancellation o f thousands o f redundant permits and significant
improvements inbusiness entry regulations. However, these encouraging initial efforts have slowed down
considerably and the policy dialogue with the authorities has shifted towards a more specific, evidence-
based approach. Inparticular, this operation benefits from the technical assistance provided by the IFC in
this area basedaroundregular surveys o f small andmedium-sized businesses operating inUkraine. These
surveys have revealed inspections, licensing, and tax administration as key constraints on business
development.

87.     As a urior action this oueration suuuorts the enactment of a new Insuection Law (in line
with EU legislation on this issue) as a way to further advance the derepulation agenda. The
enactment o f the Inspection Law has been an important achievement in consolidating separate pieces o f
regulation in this area into a single framework that i s harmonized with EU legislation on inspections. In
particular, the law foresees the move towards a risk-based inspections regime, which will significantly
reduce the burden o f inspections for businesses, and prevent multiple inspections o f the same company by
different government entities. IFC calculations put the benefits in terms o f reduced losses o f managerial
time at over US$ 200 million. The D P L I1also supports the enacted legislation to r e f o m the permit
system for business as a critical r e f o m in advancing business deregulation. Additionally, this operation
supports other actions taken under the program, including progress in eliminating the "worst ten
offenders" regulatory acts and other burdensome regulatory acts.

88.      The DPL I11would support full implementation(through the removalof existingobstacles)
of the laws on permits,public control of entrepreneurialactivity andlicensing.While these pieces o f
legislation have been already adopted, concrete steps are necessary for their full implementation. In
particular, the operation aims for progress in the publication o f an official list o f all permits and the
discontinuation o f the issuance o f illegal permits, a move towards the declaration and silence i s consent
principles, and the adoption o f risk-based inspection regimes in all major inspectorates. Progress in
implementation may be continuous rather than discrete and the DPL specifies results-based medium-term
outcomes against which advances can be charted and assessed.

Strengthening Financial Sector and Corporate Governance

89.      The rapid credit expansion in the banking sector and the need to adequately underpin the
acceleratingdevelopmentof the non-bank financial sector underscorethe urgency of strengthening
financial regulation and supervision while at the same time improving corporate governance.
Increased foreign ownership has helped to improve transparency and has brought international standards




                                                      40

in credit and portfolio analysis to several banks. However, key challenges inregulation and supervision
remain, particularly inthe areas o f enforcement o fultimate ownership discl~sure~~,consolidated and risk-
based supervision, and banking sector corporate governance. In the non-bank financial sector, weak
supervision, lack o f transparency inthe ultimate ownership o f intermediaries and issuers, non-transparent
pricing, lack o f a benchmark yield curve, and the lack o f independence o f regulatory agencies are
hampering the development o f the sector and the capital markets in general. Weaknesses in financial
sector regulation are coupledwith poor accounting practices and disregard for minority shareholder rights
among many market participants. The DPL program continues this critical reform agenda, coupled with
specific technical assistance providedby the financial sector unit.

90.      The DPL I1 supports the following actions taken for the strengthening of the financial
sector and corporate governance: (i)        the adoption o f the NBU's Supervisory Development Plan (SDP)
for banking supervision (2006-2010) and annual action plans within this framework; (ii)                    amendments
enacted to the Law on Stock and Stock Market to improve the legal framework for corporate governance
and securitization; and (iii) the establishment o f the registry of Court Judgments. Going forward, the Bank
i s concentrating its assistance to the NBUon concrete supervisory actions to be carried out in the context
o f the SDP, supported by significant technical assistance efforts. The Law on Stock and Stock Markets
established listing requirements and licenses the largest trading platform (the First Securities Trading
System) as a stock exchange. The registry o f Court Judgments i s an important tool in raising the
consistency o f rulings and in containing corruption and improving transparency in the court system. This
action also includes the introduction o f a dataset with public disclosure.

91.      As a trigger for DPL IIIthis oDeration DroDoses the enactment of the law on Joint Stock
ComDanies (JSC). This law, which passed first reading inthe parliament in early 2007 would strengthen
the protection o f minority shareholder rights, establish tighter reporting standards for all publicly listed
companies, and generally (and significantly) would advance corporate governance principles in Ukraine
to bringthem closer to best international practice.

92.      In the context of strengthening banking regulation and supervision, the following DPL III
benchmarks have been agreed: (i)          Enactment o f legal amendments to banking law to enforce ultimate
ownership disclosure-       this would significantly enhance the definition o f beneficiary ownership to
include related legal entities, family and other associated persons and make possible a proper consolidated
supervision; (ii)strengthenthe processes for problembank supervision based on the results o f the review
o f three banks recently closed; (iii)    further the implementation o f risk based supervision in accordance
with the Action Plan adopted based on the current situation and the recommendations o f retained expert
consultants; (iv) enacted legal amendments to banking law                  on corporate governance o f banks in
accordance with the recommendations o f the Bade committee; (v) enacted legal amendments to banking
law on the implementation o f consolidated supervision. Actions (ii)           and (iii) relate directly to the
                                                                                         above
implementation o f the NBU's Supervisory Development Plan. The Bank will support progress on
problem bank supervision through its own banking expert, while the implementation o f risk based
supervision i s supported with the help o f a technical assistance grant to the NBU. Consolidated
supervision in the banking sector also requires amendments to the Law on Financial Services, which are
also supported by this operation.

93.      In the context of developing the capital markets, the DPL 111would support the following
benchmarks: (i)     the existing Draft Law on Financial Services i s revised and submitted to Parliament,
clearly empowering SCSSM and SCFWSM to trace the ultimate controllers o f securities market
participants and NBFIs, and to request economic, financial, and criminal records o f these controllers; (ii)


29 The Ukrainian legislation contains a requirement for disclosure o f ultimate beneficiaries for joint stock companies
listed on a stock exchange.


                                                         41

a Strategy i s adopted strengthening the political and financial independence o f the two financial market
regulators - the SCSSM and the SCRFSM, in accordance with international standards; (iii)SCSSM to
issue a regulation prohibiting any entity (legal or physical) from acquiring (directly or indirectly) more
than 5% o f shares in any clearing and settlement company. To help in the accomplishment o f these
benchmarks, and the overall reforms needed inthe supervisory agencies, the establishment o f multi-year
twinning programs is recommended between SCSSM and SCRFSM and financial sector regulators in
European countries and related training programs. (The programs should focus on buildingthe capacity o f
the regulators inthe areas o f licensing, risk-based supervision, and enforcement in line with international
standards, and with the support o f the World Bank and other donors).

ImprovingEnergy Efficiency and Security

94.      The energy sector has seen major advancesin structural reforms. In particular,significant
progress has been achieved in bringing financial solvency to energy companies and in adjusting
tariffs for households and public utilities after the energy price increases. Financial discipline
brought about by the energy debt law (prior action for DPL I1as discussed further below) and tighter
controls on cash collections pushed energy companies to improve their financial performance. The
pressure o f strong domestic tariff adjustments for households and public utilities with nominal tariffs
doubling since late 2005 has helped to reduce cross-subsidies from industry to non-industry and has
allowed a reduction in the quasi-fiscal deficit in the gas sector in both nominal terms and as a ratio to
GDP (see Figure 6.1). The reduction was achieved in 2006 against the background o f a 53 percent
increase in the price o f gas imported from Russia and through the doubling o f gas tariffs charged to
households and communal utilities, while maintaining aggregate collection rates above 85 percent.
Electricity wholesale prices have increased from 3.96 U S cts/KWh in 2005, to 4.7 U S cts/KWh in 2006
and are now closer to cost recovery levels estimated by the Bank at around 5.8 ctsKWh in 2006. As a
result the quasi-fiscal deficit in the gas and electricity sector declined from an estimated 3.5 percent of
GDP in 2005 to around 2.4 percent in 2006 (for details see Annex IV). It should be noted that these
calculations exclude the heating and coal sectors. Tariffs for heating services are set locally by municipal
authorities and the data i s patchy preventingthe calculation o f aggregate numbers. However, pass through
at the municipal level has been less than full, as debts in municipal heating companies are reportedly
accumulating. The coal sector has experienced rising prices, which are now close to import parity even
for the cheapest domestic coal, largely consumed by thermal power plants. The associated quasi-fiscal
subsidy is therefore marginal to the size o f the overall deficit, even though direct budget subsidies to the
coal sector remainhigh.

95.      The pass through of higher energy pricesto industry also triggeredimportantadjustments:
Ukraine's industrial sector, for example, reacted by escalating investment in energy savings, another
critical element to improve energy efficiency in the country. As additional signals o f positive changes in
the sector, the move to gas imports under a take-or-pay contract from RosUkrEnergo effectively
abolished barter deals in the gas sector, a major source o f corruption in the past. Moreover, Ukraine has
begun to auction electricity available for export in an open and competitive process-see         Section 3).
Overall the authorities (have been and) are strongly committed to structural reforms inthis area, despite a
highlevelo fpolitical sensitivity.

the price paid by each consumer i s multiplied by the share intotal consumption, to obtain a weighted unit price. This i s compared
to a benchmark unit price. There are two options for the benchmark price - import parity prices or unit costs. The chart is based
on a calculation using unit costs o f gas as the price benchmark. As shown inthe underlying note, this makes no difference for the
trend o f declining quasi-fiscal deficits inthe gas sector.

96.        Nonetheless, significant reform challenges remain to be addressed to improve energy sector
performance and efficiency. The coal sector restructuring process has been ineffective, as rising
subsidies have gone in tandem with declining production volumes and persistent losses in many state-
owned mines. Additionally, continued efforts in cash collection would significantly benefit energy
companies' financial stance. A key to the success inall these areas over the mediumterm i s to lay out the
basis for private participation through better regulation and transparent privatization in some energy sub-
sectors.

97.        The DPL IIsupports as a prior action the enactment of the law on enerw debt (in 2005)
and the commencement (in 2006) of the debt restructuring process. As explained earlier, the pressure
for financial discipline in energy companies brought about by this law, its implementation, and a related
package o f measures was an important element to reinvigorate market oriented reforms in this sector.
Following the approval o f this law the stock o f debts resulting from non-payments inthe past, decreased
for the first time in 2006. Specifically, debts outstanding from electricity distribution companies to the
wholesale market operator (Energomarket) declined by UAH3 billionbetween January 2005 and January
2007, or by 18 percent. This i s only a beginning and further debt restructuring and reduction will be
critical ifprivate investment into the sector i s to be attracted.

98.        In parallel, this operationsupports as prior action the reduction inthe quasi-fiscal deficit as
a percent of GDP between 2005 and 2006. This was not a future action under DPL-I but it i s an
achievement that it i s at the core o f the reform. Another important benchmark for DPL I1 was
accomplished with the adoption o f the Action Plan for Energy sector reform that lays out the bases for
integration with the European market, articulates steps to bring tariffs above cost recovery levels, and
aims for further private participation across energy sectors. The Bank through the DPL program supports
this moving reform agenda and will continue to do so throughout the implementation stage through DPL
I11(and future DPLs).



                                                                        43

99.       This operation proposes as triggers for DPLIII(i)the enactment of a law to strewthen the
financial and administrative independence of the energy remlator (NERC) and (ii)keepiw the
enerw sector quasi-fiscal deficit at current levels inthe face of likelv future enerpv price hikes. The
energy regulator (NERC) lacks sufficient financial and administrative independence, thus creating risks
for energy companies and reducing private sector interest in investments. In addition, DPL I11would
maintain the focus on financial discipline through a trigger to maintain the quasi-fiscal deficit in the
energy sector as a percent o f GDP at or below the level in2006. Specifically it allows this to be reached
through a combination o f the following: (i)          average cash collections i s above 95% and 90% in the
electricity and gas sectors, respectively, and (ii)        gas and electricity tariffs continue to move towards
economic cost recovery levels.30This latter trigger does not require each o f the sub-measures to be met,
bearing in mindthe political sensitivity o f each o f them, and the observed link between higher tariffs and
reduced collections in the short run. However, it does require the combination o f measures to safeguard
the overall achievements made inthis area in2006 against the backgroundo f a possible further rise ingas
import prices. Additionally, DPL I11has the following benchmark: Private participation in energy sector
i s advanced as evidenced by the following: (i)            privatization plan for power distribution companies
(Oblenergos) i s approved by CoM clarifying list o f companies to be sold to strategic investors; and (ii)
law on privatization o f coal mines i s submitted to parliament and corresponding normative acts are
approved by the State Property Fundthrough a privatization plan.


B.2       CreatingFiscal Space for Growththrough StrengthenedPublicFinancesandPublic
Sector Reform

100.      Sustained economic growth in Ukraine will over the medium-term have to be based on higher
private and public investment. To make this possible, public consumption and transfers will need to be
reduced from their presently highlevels. The Government needs to create fiscal space to finance greater
public outlays on infrastructure modernization and improvements in public services while decreasing the
tax burden on the private sector and thus making room for greater private investment. Moreover, the
government needs to face these challenges while keeping fiscal discipline. This would involve continued
reforms in the areas o f tax policy and tax administration, budgeting, public administration, and
intergovernmental fiscal relations. At the same time, Ukraine needs to strengthen the management and
governance o f State Owned Enterprises (SOEs).

ContinuingFiscal Discipline

101.      Despite massive expenditure hikes in 2005, with the size of expenditures to GDP largely
unchanged in 2006, fiscal deficits were kept under control. Going forward, the authorities need to
remain mindful o f the fiscal pressures created by increases in current spending such as wages and
pensions.

102.      The DPL I1supports as a prior action keepinp fiscal deficit below 3.5% of GDP in 2005 and
2006.      should be remembered that at the time the deficit target was defined in the D P L I,there was
significant concern that social spending promises made during the 2004 election and honored by the
incoming government would lead to unsustainably large fiscal deficits and jeopardize macroeconomic
balance. In the event, fiscal policy was rapidly tightened through a combination o f reductions in tax
expenditures, improved collections and some parametric changes to contain ballooning pension spending.
This operation supports some o fthese underlying fiscal measures: (i) reductiono fthe share o fpension
                                                                                the

expenditures to GDP by 1 percentage point in 2006 relative to 200531(which was achieved through new
indexationrules and other measures; this together with higher contribution collections allowed the closing
o f the deficit o f the pension system), (ii)  the reduction intax arrears consistently since 200432,and (iii)           the
reduction inbudget arrears compared to 2005.33

103.      Movinp forward and takinp into account the importance over fiscal discipline plavs in the
mitipationof macroeconomicrisks, DPLI11proPoses a trigger for maintainin9 fiscal balance below
3% of GDP for 2007 and 2008. The target is meant to safeguardoverall fiscal discipline inthe context o f
potential populist pressures for further increases in public consumption spending, particularly on the eve
o f early parliamentary elections. Together with related benchmarks and efforts to improve the capital
budgeting system this over time will facilitate the shift towards greater investment spending. If taken
together with expected GDP growth in the 5-6 percent range, this deficit target will lead to a further
decline inpublic debt to GDP and i s thus consistent with the aim to create fiscal space for growth. Inthe
light o fpotentialnegative external shocks, a tighter deficit target seems unadvisable, even ifunder current
circumstances the 3% o f GDP target is likely to be undershot. Moreover, DPL I11 includes as a
benchmark measures designed to create fiscal savings to help to the long term fiscal sustainability o f the
PAYG pension system, through a selection o f                    the following parametric changes: (a) lengthened
contribution period for minimumpension (suggested to 30 years for women and 35 years for men); (b)
suspended increases in pensions (to subsistence minimum) to working pensioners; (c) maintained the
current inflation indexationpattern for subsistence minimum; (d) pension benefits indexed with inflation;
(e) replaced general minimumpensionincreases with means-tested benefits. The authorities for reasons o f
political sensitivity have shied away so far from a firm commitment to consider increases in the
retirement age, but the Bankplans to continue the discussion on this inthe context o f DPL 111.

Improving TaxPolicy and Administration

104.      Tax policy and tax administration reform needs to continue. There has been some progress in
tax policy and administration over the last 2 years, but risks o f backsliding in some areas remain a
concern (for example inthe VAT refunds and the tax incentives on free economic zones).

105.      The DPL IIsupports the progress toward establishing a self-contained Tax Code which
would also strengthen the regulatory framework for tax administration. In February 2007, the
Cabinet o f Ministers approved a Concept for Tax reform, and more recently has prepared a Draft Tax
Code that has been discussed widely with stakeholders, including through intensive discussions with the
Bank geared to improve some specific policy areas o f this document. This operation also supports the
elimination o f the double pass-though without paying VAT on gas imports (while the latter was not a
action envisaged originally in the program it has been a key change to allow base expansion in this
important tax).




3'2006 and2007 pensionexpendituresoutlays as % of GDP are higherdue the transfer ofpaymentsof militarypensions, judges,

allowed such spendingreductionin2006 remaininplace in2007.

106.     DPL 111includesselectedbenchmarksintax policyand administrationgearedto increasing
the competitiveness of the tax system and bringing it in compliance with WTO rules. The
benchmarks in tax policy include: (i)        reform to the VAT for agriculture introduced in 2008 in line with
EUdirectives andWTOrules; and (ii) taxes harmonizedwith WTO requirements. These have been
                                              excise
selected because o f their importance to ensure WTO accession can proceed. Support for tax policy reform
through a new tax code will continue, but the authorities have signaled that the timing for its adoption
remains uncertain, and therefore this operation chooses more specific tax policy benchmarks. In the
context o f tax administration, the authorities have recommitted to reduce the stock o f VAT refunds
outstanding for more than 60 days to 30 percent o f the quarterly flow o f VAT refund claims. This was an
earlier D P L - Ibenchmark, which was however missed by a large margin. The re-engagement o f the
authorities on this issue and the adoption o f a benchmark that implies a significant reduction o f VAT
refunds outstanding i s an important positive signal o freform commitment inthis area.

Accelerating Public Administration Reform andPublic Financial Management

107.        Some progress has been observed in areas of public administrative reform and public
financial management but some backsliding has also taken place, and consequently major
challenges remain. The recent WB Public Expenditure and Financial Accounting (PEFA) report reveals
strengths in the credibility and predictability o f the budget process, as well as progress in the
comprehensiveness o f the budget. But both the PFR Iand the PEFA report that areas such as capital
budgeting and the implementation o f an overall medium-term budget framework remain a challenge.
Moreover, the state procurement framework suffered significant backsliding and it is now a major
weakness. Amendments passed inDecember 2005 to the Law on Public Procurement represented a major
set back by introducing an NGO and the Antimonopoly committee o f the parliament into the core the
public procurement system (see section 6 G).

108.      The DPL I1supports actions taken to improve public financial management including the
following: (i)    the completion o f functional review o f Ministry o f Finance in 2005 and 2006, (ii)the
regulation allowing the audit chambers to audit budget revenues, and (iii)            the continuous implementation
o f the Development Concept for Public Internal Financial Audit and Control (PIFC), which from now on
would be closely assisted by the EUc o m m i ~ s i o n . ~ ~

109.      Movingforward, a trigger for the DPL I11would be revisionsto the legislativeframework
for uublic urocurement in linewith good international uractice. The Bank together with the EC and
the OECDBIGMA has given extensive recommendations and comments on draft pieces o f legislation.
Recently, there i s an increased consensus across political parties and policy making about the problems o f
the current system and the momentum for reform along international standards i s increasing.
Amendments have been drafted that would redress some o f the current system's major shortcomings and
the authorities believe that revisions to the legislative framework are likely to go through in 2008. With
public procurement accounting for some US$4.5 billion per annum, this would both lead to significant
expected budget savings and greatly improved governance. The Bank's support to government reform
efforts i s particularly important inthe light o f significant vested interests against this step.

110.        In the context of public financial management reform, DPL I11 would support the
adoption of a Cabinet of Ministers decisionon debt management and strategy, including the setting
o f debt management objectives, cost and risk definitions and actions geared to support the domestic debt


34A continued effort has beenplaced inimplementingthe strategyfor PIFC, particularlythroughtrainingandtechnical advice
(includedthat providedunder the Bank's Public FinancialManagementProject). Morerecently, the government ofUkrainehas
signedan agreementwith the EUcommissionto continuestrengtheningcapacityinthis areathrough avariety of activities
including a twining exercisewith the audit departmentof an EUmember state.

market development in line with good international practice; and requiring M o F to report on its
performance against these debt management objectives. Improving institutional aspects o f public debt
management is one o f the pillars for buildinga domestic debt market (the joint note sent by the WB, IMF,
OECD, and U S A l D to the M o F and the NEW inMay, 2007 contains a number o f other recommendations
for the development o f the domestic debt market).

111 I      Discussionswith the authorities on future reforms have also focused around the question
of improvements in capital budgeting. A key finding o f the Public Finance Review Iis that Ukraine
needs to create sufficient fiscal space to finance an increase in productive investments and its reform
agenda, and do so within a consistent and prudent macro-fiscal framework (which also involves reducing
the overall size o f the government). A number o f the benchmarks for DPL I11 across the thematic
umbrellas are geared to that objective. But the PFR Ialso states that an improved capital budgeting
process i s critical to ensure that resources freed up elsewhere are used efficiently on the investment side
of the budget. Consequently, D P L I11includes the following benchmarks to improve the capitalbudgeting
process: (i) introduction o f medium-term strategic plans and programs with budget ceilings (for current
and capital spending) by line ministry; (ii)     reduction by 25 percent o f the number o f State targeted
programs by the end o f 2008 [compared to 20061; (iii)    improvements in project evaluation and selection
through amendments o f the existing Cabinet o f Ministers resolution #lo6 (3 1January, 2007) to expand its
coverage to all public investment and to include project selection and evaluation criteria in line with
international good practice.

Improving Governance in State OwnedEnterprises

112.     Concerns regarding the transparency in the management and the governance of SOEs
persist. DPL-I supported measures to improve transparency in the management of SOE, including
holding open and competitive tenders for management teams for these enterprises but implementationhas
been uneven. Management selection remains politicized, financial disclosure and independent audits are
not mandatory, financial oversight over SOEs has been tightened but dividend policies are still subject to
annual changes and determined more by fiscal than business development considerations, and the
appointment o f independent directors on supervisory boards o f SOEs i s not taking place. Moreover,
responsibilities for SOEs are fragmented across the Cabinet o f Ministers, the State Property Fundand the
LineMinistries, inadditionto the powerful enterprise directors themselves.

113.     The DPL I1suuportsas a urior actionthe enactedLaw onthe Management of State Owned
Enterprises. This law, in broad terms, has set an appropriate framework for dealing with management
and governance concerns, and moves this reform agenda inthe right direction. It i s highlighted as a prior
action because it reflects a previously absent understanding o f the underlying fiscal risks o f mal-
performing SOEs and introduces important concepts for future reform such as corporatization,
consolidated management o f state assets, performance based managerial contracts etc.. Nevertheless, this
law i s a framework Law and leaves specifics o f implementationand enforcement to be clarified by C o M
resolutions.

114.     DPL IlIwould support the implementation of the Law on the management of SOEs
through the following specific benchmarks:(i) CoM resolutionon dividendpolicy # 702 is revised
                                                    the
taking into account the investment needs o f SOEs as expressed in their annual financial plans; and (ii)
management o f unitary State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) i s selected on a competitive basis and
performance basedmanagement contracts are established, as evidenced by the examination o f a sample o f
SOEs. These benchmarks are geared to the implementation o f existing normative acts that guide the
implementation o f the framework law. Resolution#702 sets out clear principles and the timing for setting
o f dividends by SOEs. However, it still includes only marginal flexibility to respond to SOE investment
needs, allowing dividends to be reduced by 10 percent from the centrally set dividend rate on retained


                                                     47

SOE profits. The selection o f SOE management will be reviewed based on a sample o f strategic
enterprises covered by resolution #234, which was supported under DPL- I.Improvements inboth areas
will need to go hand in hand with better accounting and financial reporting by SOEs so that their true
investment needs and managerial performance can be properly evaluated. The authorities have agreed
with the Bank to engage ina continuous dialogue inthis area, recognizing that progress will necessarily
be gradual given the size o f the challenge.

Reinvigorating Intergovernmental Fiscal Reform

115.    The intergovernmentalfinance system, which funnels one third of the consolidated budget
of Ukraine through local governments, requires renewed reform momentum following some
backslidingsince the first wave of budgetreforms in2001-02. There are certain overlapping functions
between levels o f government, which harms efficiency and generates wasteful spending. Fiscal effort at
the local level remains low, creating an overdependence on fiscal transfers from the center for many local
governments. This i s partly due to the lack o f substantial own sources o f revenue. Additionally, some
revenues assigned to local governments provide low yields given administrative costs and are thus
inefficient. Fiscal transfers have become less transparent since the reforms in 2001-02. While the main
transfer (i.e., the equalization transfer) i s formula based, the number o f allocation factors and the
complexity inthe formula (withad-hoc changes) have increased significantly. Moreover, some o f the new
factors undermine incentives for efficiency improvements in service provision at the local level.
Appropriate amendments to improve the current problematic legislative framework for sub-national
borrowing are yet to be approved and implementedinUkraine.

116.     Since this is a newly (re-)emerging agenda, no prior actions are foreseen for DPL II.
However, this operation supports the evolving reform agenda through progress on the following
benchmarks for DPL HI: (i)        allocation o f expenditure functions between oblasts, rayons, towns and
villages are further clarified and improved; (ii)the equalization transfer formula is strengthened; (iii)
improvement o fprocedure for public investment transfers through adoption o f uniform and stable criteria,
which also includes a framework for evaluation and monitoring o f utilization o f these transfers; and (iv)
the legal and normative basis for local governments' borrowing i s improved consistent with good
international practice. Most o f these benchmarks imply significant and long haul re-structuring o f
intergovernmental fiscal relations, that is, aside from the legislationneeded to start the process. Thus, the
DPL I11(inits short time span) would recognize progress inthese benchmarks.

B.3      Improving Service Delivery and Social Inclusion

 117.    Ukraine faces a demographic challenge, as well as the problems o f deteriorating health and
education services and costly and poorly targeted social assistance. The inherited network and staffing o f
service facilities in health and education remains highly inefficient, despite significant budget outlays,
which compare favorably with other countries inthe region. The key challenge thus i s how to better use
existing resources to improve quality and performance. The pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system faces
challenges o f long-term sustainability (given demographic shifts that would lead to a ratio o f 111.43 o f
workers/pensions by 2055), fairness (there i s currently almost no link between past contributions and
pension payments) and efficiency (compliance i s low given very low rates o f return and highcompliance
costs). Social assistance faces new challenges, such as rising utility prices, which it i s ill-designed to
address given weaknesses intargeting and a focus on occupational privileges which are costly to both the
budget and public service providers.




                                                      48

Improving efficiency and Performance of Education

118.     Ukraine has a sizable but largely inefficient public education system. The level o f public
spending on education has been increasing in Ukraine, reaching 6.4 percent o f GDP in 2006, a
comparatively high level. However, these resources are inefficiently spent, as revealed by a
studentkeacher ratio close to 10 (one o f the lowest levels in Eastern Europe and in the world). These
inefficiencies are coupled with some evidence o f poor performance o f the system and a mismatch
between the needs o f the labor market and the training programs provided. Resources are critical to
modernize the sector but the bulk o f spending goes to cover wages and utility expenditures, leaving little
room for expenditures on equipment, teaching aids, teachers training and re-training, and improved
infrastructure-     all necessary to improve quality. Although local authorities are responsible for education,
they have little budgetary and administrative autonomy. Budget formation in education remains input
driven (guided by the network o f facilities and existing staffing) creating significant regional inequities in
the quality o f service, as poorer regions inparticular have to spend the bulk o f the allocated resources on
maintaining staffing levels and keeping an oversized and underutilized network o f service facilities. At
the same time, the education system lacks any acceptable measurement o f performance and quality to
guide education policy and reform. Inother countries, the political determination to reform the sector has
come only after a closer analysis o f the correspondence between spending and the achievement o f
outcomes inan international comparison.

119.     Taking into account the need for an international performance benchmark to Palvanize
reform efforts, DPL I1 supports as a prior action the successful implementation of the first
international accepted standardized test in secondarv education (test in international mathematics
and science studv - TIMSS) in the countrv. For the first time, in early 2007 Ukraine implemented an
internationally recognized standardized test, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study
(TIMSS). This i s a critical milestone inestablishing a baseline for performance and quality measurement
in education in the country. An objective performance measure serves two key purposes. On the one
hand, it raises awareness o f the current quality gap existing between Ukraine's education performance
and highest world standards. On the other hand, it provides a baseline against which the effectiveness o f
future reforms can be evaluated and thus would be a critical component o f a move from an input to a
more output oriented financing and management system inthe sector.

 120.    Going forward, DPL IIIwould focus on supporting efforts to reform the sector's financing
and its associated inefficiencies. Specifically, DPL I11would support efforts to move away from input
based norms in budget formation, as the key to greater sector efficiency, including the following
benchmark:. Standard normative for staffing for general secondary education are optimized based on an
evaluation o f the regulation (inagreement with WE3 advice).

 Improving efficiency and Performance of Health Care

 121.    Inefficiencies in the provision of health care acute. Ukraine inherited an extensive hospital
infrastructure and staffing system (e.g., the number o f hospitalbeds per 100 000 population i s 716 which
i s 30 percent higher than the EU-10 average; the average length o f stay (ALOS) inUkrainian hospitals i s
 12.3 days compared with 7.5 for the EU-10 in 2004). Most o f the limited resources are being spent on
staff salaries and utilities leaving little room for needed supplies, adequate and modern equipment,
maintenance, and repairs to deteriorated infrastructure. At the same time, rough estimates o f formal and
informal out-of-pocket expenditures suggest that they may be as high as total public expenditures in the
sector.35 Thus, total health expenditure i s at least in the range o f 6-6.5 percent o f GDP, which i s


35 These out o f pocket expenditures include payments to professional health staff, self-provision o f supplies and medicines and in
some cases equipment, and transportation costs.


                                                              49

comparable to other countries in the region. The health sector faces a very similar problem compared to
the education sector, that is, a budget formation at the facility level (and then at the local government
level) based on input criteria (e.g., staffing according to the number o f beds and other facility
characteristics, and inputsbased on the extensive and largely underutilizednetwork o f facilities). The use
o f input criteria has created incentives to overspend on beds and salaries relative to equipment, supplies
and pharmaceuticals. While some healthindicators have been improving over the last 5 years (e.g., infant
mortality, maternal mortality) others have remained stagnant or have deteriorated (e.g., mortality o f males
aged 25-39, and incidence o f tuberculosis (TB) and HIV AIDS).

122.     DPL I1supportsthe development of nationalprograms against HIV AIDSand TB. The DPL
Iprogramlaidoutasfutureactiontheadoptionofanationalhealthsectorstrategy.Astrategydocument
has been produced but the current government has decided to proceed with implementation in a more
targeted manner. The national programs against TB (2007-2010) and HIV AIDS (2004-2008) are a
reflection o f this focused approach to implementationwhilst being a pre-condition for the mobilization o f
significant donor support. Starting with TB and HIV AIDS i s appropriate given the acute deterioration o f
the incidence indicators inthese illnesses. The Bank supports this approach, whilst maintaining its general
dialogue on health sector reforms. The Bank team i s presently working with the Ministry o f Health to
strengthen further the operationalization o f the HIV/AIDS program in the context o f exploring ways to
support its implementationdirectly through budget financing.

123.     In parallel with efforts in the education sector, DPL I11 would concentrate support in
improvingthe efficiency of health sector financing through a revisionof current input norms that
dictate the financing of health facilities at the local level. The main benchmarks are as follows: the
revision o f norms contained in the M o H order # 33, and elimination o f certain norms that impose
rigidities (and inefficiency) on the budgets o f health facilities and local governments to allow a gradual
reduction o f staffing (inagreement with WB advice).

Improving Social Insurance and Social Protection

 124.    Ukraine's PAYGpensionsystemfaces severe structural challengesrelatingto its long-term
sustainability, fairness, and efficiency. Ukraine has one o f the worst demographic profiles among
transition countries. It i s estimated that by 2055 there will be 1 worker for every 1.4 pensioners. To
address these multiple challenges, the Government plans the introduction o f a multi-pillar pension system
and the administrative reform social security to reduce compliance costs. But reforms face important
hurdles, including the political sensitivity surrounding further parametric adjustments to the PAYG
system needed for long-term sustainability, the management o f transitory fiscal costs and the regulatory
and market foundations for the effective operation o f a second and third pension pillar. Social security
administration i s cumbersome as four different payments are to be made to different funds and payments
differ across employee categories leading to more than hundred payment forms to be filled each year by,
even smaller companies. Simplifying this administrative system i s essential regardless o f the introduction
or not o f a multi-pillar reform. The system o f social protection and social privileges i s costly and non-
transparent, and may not achieve the redistributive goals it i s designed to meet. It i s estimated that actual
public expenditures for privileges are equivalent to approximately 1.6 percent o f Ukraine's GDP. But the
total cost o f these privileges i s difficult to estimate because many privileges take the form o f reduced
tariffs and fares for the use o f public services, for which the supplyingpublic companies are rarely fully
compensated.

 125.    The DPL I1 supports the establishment and operational initiation in 2006 of a unified
database for the registry of all social privilege beneficiaries,an important action, which is likely to
be a key instrument to improve targeting in the system moving forward. Beyond this, and in
recognition o f the political sensitivities surrounding the issue o f social privileges, the Bank has chosen a


                                                       50

step-by-step policy dialogue inthis area, and has agreed with the Ministry o f Labor and Social Protection
initially to focus on the monetization o f housing subsidies. A pilot i s being carried out and its evaluation
by mid-2008 should allow a more ambitious nation-wide program to be designed, which could then be
supported by future DPLs. Inparallel, analytical work has being carried out on the incidence o f energy
price increases on the poor which further serves to underline the need to move towards better targeted
social support, and shows that the cost o f such support would be significantly less than what the
government currently spends.

126.     This operation proposes as a trigger for DPL I11the enactment of legislation that would
allow the unification of the main administrationfunctions of the four social insurance fund under
the Pension Fund (PF).The government has put forward a program and draft law to do so, including
under the advice o f the Bank's Pension Administration Project under preparation, for which enactment o f
the law i s a condition for negotiation. This reform in the administration o f social security payments i s
closely related to measures to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, which are high in Ukraine,
particularly for payroll taxes (social insurance contributions), as evidenced by several WB surveys. It
would also reduce significantly administrative costs. As stated earlier, this i s a critical reform independent
o f the scope and timing o f any other pension reform as it would help address efficiency issues in the
current PAYG system. Future actionsheforms in the area o f pensions are also linked to the menu o f
actions offered to the government to achieve i s listed in the section "continuing fiscal discipline" above,
which would improve the long-term sustainability o f the PAYGsystem.




                            7. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. DONOR COORDINATION

127.     The DPL program has been designed in close collaborationwith donors, most importantly
the European Commission (EC) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and this
collaboration and mutual support will continue through implementation. The Bank has worked
closely with the European Union in designing the policy matrix o f the current operation. The EC i s
shifting its own assistance increasingly towards budget support and has selected the energy sector and
public financial management as the target areas for its first budget support operation, expected to be
approved before the end o f 2007. DPL I1has benefited from close coordination with the EC to ensure
consistency in the respective policy matrices. The DPL rests on an assessment o f the macroeconomic
framework elaborated in close consultations with the IMF as reflected inthe assessment letter o f the IMF
(Annex V).

128.     The programhasalso beencoordinatedwith other donorsinthe country.The Bankhas been
collaborating with USAID in the areas o f capital market development, where USAID'S technical
assistance support i s designed to help implement policies supported under the D P L program (such as the
new Joint Stock Company Law, the introduction o f risk-based and consolidated supervision and the
introduction o f new accounting standards - all DPL I11benchmarks). Future DPLs provide an opportunity
to align in particular the governance agenda with the assistance provided through the Millennium
Challenge Corporation. A Dutch Constituency Trust Fund has financed important preparatory work for
WTO accession, a core issue for DPL 11. The Bank has also recently applied for Dutch grant to support
the implementation o f policies intax and budget reform supported by the DPL. DFID has co-funded the
Bank's Public Finance Review I1(PFR 11), one o f the key analytical underpinnings o f the DPL moving
forward. The government o f Japan has provided financial support through a PHRD grant. Other donors
have been closely consulted throughout the DPL preparation.

129.     A recentIEGevaluationof the PAL programand an evaluationof the 2000-2003 and 2004-
2007 CAS'Sconsistently rate the impact of the Bank's adjustment program as satisfactory. The

the same token, the IEG evaluation o f the P A L program rates the outcome o f PAL 1 and PAL 2
satisfactory. The basis for this positive assessment i s both Ukraine's strong overall macroeconomic
performance during this period and the fact that almost all benchmarks under the PAL program were
eventually fully met, albeit with considerable delays.

130.     IEG further commends the cross-sectoral PAL design, although it recommends greater
focus and selectivity going forward. This lesson has been incorporated into the DPL program which
relies on less than 7 triggers ineachDPL operation, supported by additional policy benchmarks that allow
for significant flexibility to sequence the reform agenda in line with political feasibility and shifting
government priorities.

131.     IEGrecommendsfurther that the DPLprogrambemore closely integratedwith investment
lending. This recommendationhas been embeddedin the design of DPLII and DPLIII and will be
at the center of the DPL-CPS relationship moving forward. The current operation is closely linked
with investment lending in the energy sector, in public financial management, and pension reform; it
starts the policy dialogue to support investment lending in transport - a newly emerging area, and it has
contributed to focusing the agenda in health and education initially on financing issues as an entry point
into the broader reform in both areas. Going forward, the new CPS proposes a distinction between core
programs, where investment and development policy lending complement each other to make deep and
concerted progress in areas at the center o f the national development strategy, and development and
advocacy programs, where the reform roadmap i s either insufficiently articulated or insufficient political
consensus exists to move forward. In these areas, development policy conditionality should be used
sparingly and instead non-lending engagement may be more appropriate to define the reform roadmap.
However, the current operation does use DPL benchmarks in selected areas such as financial market
regulation and supervision, tax reform and administration, inter-governmental fiscal relations and the
reform o f the pension system to indicate the preferred reformpath, recognizing that additional discussion
may be required to see it fully implemented.

132.     IEG also argues against back-loading conditionality and tranching of development policy
lending. Both recommendations are consistent with emerging best practice. This operation continues in
the single-tranche tradition o f DPL I.The programmatic nature o f the operation allows the reform
program to be sequenced over a number o f years, and while the pace o f implementationhas insome cases
been adjusted by shiftingreformbenchmarks fiom DPL I1into D P L I11triggers, the programmatic design
has made sure that the DPL program as a whole i s not held hostage to delays in the implementation o f
selected benchmarks, as long as overall progress i s assessedto be satisfactory.


C. POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

133.     The Bank is assisting the government in analyzing poverty and social impact of selected
policies that may have a distributional impact. Some o f the actions in the energy sector call for
keeping up the levels o f cash collection in electricity and gas, while at the same time pashing-out the
cross-subsidization (through under-pricing) to residential (and non residential) customers. In the same



                                                     52

way parametric changes to the PAYGpension system may have some milder distributional implications.
The Bank has completed an updated poverty assessment to identify the impact o f the pass-through o f
energy prices to poor households and to identify the best avenues to improve targeting (and level support)
for the poorer segments o f the population, although given the political sensitivity o f social privileges and
difficulties inmoving towards means testing experienced inthe past, this agenda i s likely to move slowly.
Inthepensionarea, parametric changeswouldmakethe PAYGsystemfinancial more sustainable, andif
coupled with the introduction o f a second pillar would improve the overall fairness o f the pension system.
Lower compliance costs should also be o f benefit to the poor by raising their net wage (the poor are often
less able than the richto avoid taxation).

134.     Energy prices, and higher cash collection have an impact on the poor but there are several
mitigating factors. From January 2006, import prices for Russian gas increased by 52 percent and by
another 35 percent in January 2007. The government passed through these increases over time doubling
household energy tariffs. The size o f the increase has raised concern about its potentially negative social
impact. However, calculations carried out by the World Bank suggest that because even the poor do not
spend a very large proportiono f their income on energy, a doubling o f energy prices from the levels at the
end o f 2005 would raise poverty by only 1.7 percentage points. Moreover, it would cost only US$ 63
million to restore all those that had become poor as a result o f energy price increases to a spending level
just above the poverty line36.These results are inline with the fact that the poorest inrural areas continue
to largely rely on fuel wood as the major source o f energy and thus were expected to be less affected by
the rise in gas and power prices than the urban population (where poverty rates are much lower-see
section 1). Moreover, Naftogaz in January 2007 introduced a two-tier tariff that differentiates between
higher and lower level consumers (like a lifeline tariff), which allows Naftogaz to meet overall cost-
recovery targets whilst taking into account affordability limits among low income consumers. The DPL I
program led to the establishment o f a unified registry for the recipients o f social privileges. This registry
would play a key role in improving the targeting o f social assistance to the poor, including through the
privileges and social subsidies for utilities and housing heating. Currently, social assistance i s poorly
targeted to the poor and it i s costly to the state.

135.     The reforms proposed on the education and health sector would free up resources to be
issued within the same sectors in order to improve quality of services that would favor the poor.
The inefficiencies o f these sectors generate extremely tight budgets burdened with current spending
leaving little for investments in equipments, teaching aids, training, and medicines, which inturn leads to
poor provision o f services. This has a higher negative impact on the poor since service facilities and
providers have to request formal and informal payments to receive appropriate services. In health,
particularly, this issue i s acute and poorer segments of the population are hit harder. This operation sets a
first step ina long term agenda o f resolving these problems inUkraine. Moreover, inthe education sector,
this operation supports the introduction o fthe first internationallyrecognized standardizedtest. This will
be a key instrument to push for quality improvements, as it has been in other European countries, since it
exposes shortcomings in an objective and internationally comparable way.


D. ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

136.      Specific actions under the proposed DPL operation are not expected to have any significant
negative effect on the environment. In sectors that have a close link with the environment and that are
supported in one way or another by this operation such as Energy, the actions laid out by this operation
mightimprove environmental conditions inthe long runas they are geared to improve energy efficiency.

There i s a possibility that fuel substitution towards greater reliance o f fuel wood, and the substitution o f
domestic coal for imported gas as relative prices change might lead to greater carbon emissions.
However, substitution possibilities in urban households are limited due to the predominance o f central
district heating while rural households already rely to a significant extent o f fuel wood for cooking and
heating. Nonetheless, there could be some risk deforestation ifreliance on fuel wood increases. Persistent
inefficienciesinthe domestic coal industrywill limit the extent o f substitution to coal over the timeframe
o f this operation. Ukraine's accession to the WTO will set limits on the overall degree o f support to
agriculture, which could affect the management o f naturalresources. Significantly, the WTO also requires
Ukraine to move from inefficient input and production subsidies to more environmentally fiiendly "green
box" measures o f support. The rest o f the measures for all other sectors and areas in this operation are
fiscal, institutional, and regulatory innature and wouldnot have any visible impact on the environment.

137.     DPL Isupported Ukraine's efforts to gain eligibility for emissions tradingunder the Kyoto
protocol and this is now proceeding. The Bank will continue to support Ukraine in maximizing the
benefits to which it i s eligible under the Kyoto protocol both under Joint Implementation arrangements
and with the sale o f emission reductions by the government. In addition, the Bank has been highlighting
the issue o f environmental risks and pollution management in a local context through a targeted technical
assistance project in Zaporizhia. Success o f this technical assistance may catalyze greater progress at the
national level in environmental risk management and reduction o f industrial pollution. However, this
agenda i s insufficiently developed as yet to serve as a basis for development policy conditions in this
operation. The Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL) program also supported the reform o f
environmental penalties and permits. The Bank i s pursuing the implementation o f this agenda further in
the context o f overall efforts to focus the permit system on real health and environmental hazards and
thereby increase both its effectiveness and reduce its costs for businesses.


E. RISKSAND MITIGATION

PoliticalRisks

138.     Politicalinstability may delay the implementation of the reformprogram. Risks are related
both to delays in the constitution o f a new government following the parliamentary elections o f
September 30, 2007, and as a result a stalemate in the legislative agenda, as well as in the potential
change o f key positions inthe new government. A protracted political crisis in which the power struggle
between the major political groups dominates the policy agenda could delay or even lead to a break-down
inthe reformagenda.

139.     Ukraine's recent politicalhistory suggests a protractedpoliticalcrisis is relativelyunlikely.
Ukraine's political system has generated compromise around key reform constraints in the past, such as
the financial and fiscal stabilization duringthe late 1990s, the development o f the banking sector, and the
adoption o f measures taking Ukraine to the door o f WTO accession. All major political groups are
committed to further market-based reforms and the political and business elite would have a lot o f loose
from the economic consequences o f a protracted stalemate. While political risks to program
implementation are substantial, this operation takes the view that they are best managed through
continued active engagement and appropriately calibrated conditionality. The design reflects this by a
selective use o f triggers inareas considered critical to further progress, and inwhich a national consensus
seems to have emerged.

140.     The support of Ukraine's major businessgroupsis also likely to promotea resolutionof the
current political uncertainty going forward. As stated earlier, representatives o f major business
interests are embedded in all branches o f the executive and legislative powers, and they are not likely to


                                                      54

allow an ever-lasting political stand off. However, in some areas business interests are also entrenched
against structural reform measures. Policy engagement going forward will need to be targeted both
at policy makers in the new government and at key stakeholders inthe Parliament as well as the
businesscommunity andcivil society to foster demandfor change.

141.     Moreover, the DPL is designed to provide an anchor to the government's reform efforts
with an agenda that is common across the main political forces. The DPL encompasses selected
pieces o f the reform agenda that are a "common denominator" o f the last three governments' programs
(involving parties across the political spectrum). The program supported by the DPL series therefore
represents in some sense a common development vision. The selective use o f triggers complemented with
a broader set o f benchmarks in areas where the engagement still needs to deepen allows the Government
considerable flexibility to choose the reform sequence to fit with political realities while focusing on
critical constraints.

Economic Risks

142.     The detailed discussion in Section 3 highlights negative terms of trade shocks, a sudden
reversal of capital flows due to tightening conditions in emerging markets, tightening of Ukraine's
access to international financing, forex exposure risks together with weak supervision in the
banking sector, and inappropriate policy responsesto external shocks as key economic risks            .Terms
o f trade shocks are a significant potential source o f risk, given the likelihood o f further energy price
increases, and the possibility that current high metals prices may not be sustained. The baseline forecast
already contains the assumption of a gradual decline in the terms o f trade until 2009, but a sudden
deterioration o flarger order o f magnitude would create significantly larger current account deficits. Under
current financing conditions, even current account deficits above the 5-6 percent o f GDP in the base case
could be financed for a temporary period without great difficulty, but an adjustment inthe real exchange
rate would nonetheless be required over the medium term. This in turn could cause stress inthe banking
system. A combination o f a terms o f trade shock, a tightening o f external liquidity, a resulting large
devaluation and corresponding banking sector stress would cause significant challenges for the authorities
requiring a much tighter fiscal policy and temporarily slowing growth as domestic demand declines and
exports respond with a lag to exchange rate adjustment.

143.     The developments in the international financial markets in early August 2007 have
highlighted these risks. As liquidity tightened significantly in international markets between mid-June
and early August, risk premia rose and equity markets fell worldwide. In Ukraine, too, equity markets
have declined somewhat after record gains, and bond and borrowing spreads have widened. But reserve
accumulation by the NBUhas continued and liquidity in the banking system remains high.It i s too early
to assess the full implications o f recent developments, and while Ukraine boasts significant strengths in
terms o f its macroeconomic fundamentals, it would be vulnerable if a protractedglobal downturn were to
reduce metal prices at the same time as external financing became more expensive. Negative
developments in other financial markets in the region, inparticular in Russia, could also pose contagion
risks. Refinancing risks in the banking sector, which has substantially relied on foreign financing for its
fast recent expansion, could spread fiom individual banks to the system as a whole, requiring close and
continued monitoring o f liquidity levels.

144.     Nevertheless, the authorities are likely to react to a worsening of the macroeconomic
situation prudently. The assumption i s that if the current account were to fall sharply, the exchange rate
would have to be devalued earlier rather than later and fiscal policy would have to be tightened to support
the external adjustment. Ukraine's track record certainly indicates a strong commitment to
macroeconomic balance and the authorities are well aware o f the risks.        The NBU intends to move



                                                    55

towards greater exchange rate flexibility but has left the timeframe open. Central bankers point to the
current political instability, the potential negative implications o f initial exchange rate appreciation driven
by balance o fpayments inflows on competitiveness, and to the insufficient development o f stock markets,
(including traded government securities) as arguments against a rapid change inthe monetary framework.
However, inthe event o f a negative external shock, the NBUi s expected to react swiftly. It i s also likely
that fiscal policy would be supportive of any required adjustment to prevent an increase in the
fiscal deficit. Despite much election related rhetoric there is no indication to date o f a loosening o f the
fiscal stance, which should facilitate further adjustment if the need arose. In the banking sector, the
increasing presence of foreign bank (currently owning around 30 percent of bank capital) to some
extent mitigates against the risk of a system-wide solvency and liquidity crisis, as parent banks are
expected to support their subsidiaries with both liquidity and additional capital if needed. The shake-out
among second and third tier banks may even lead to a welcome sector consolidation if the NBUreacts
swiftly to close or force to merge insolvent banks. Maintaining NBU's independence and strengthening
further its supervisory and enforcement capacity are key to address the risks in the financial sector.
Overall, despite the risks Ukraine faces, the maintenance o f macroeconomic stability remains the base
case scenario.

 145.    The implementation of the reform program laid out in this operation would in itself be a
risk-mitigatingfactor. Key measures supported by this DPL concern the quality o fbank supervision, the
strength o f the country's legislative framework for corporate governance and financial market
development, which should improve the financial sector's resilience against the shocks described above.
While the reform program in this area i s laid out over a period of time, this reflects the authorities'
judgment about the possible timingo f future risks. By the same token, measures to support the removal o f
behind the border obstacles to trade and entrepreneurship should help export diversification and make the
country more immune against negative terms of trade shocks. And the DPL contains clear triggers on
fiscal management that are geared towards avoiding the risk o f inadequate policy reactions against
external shocks, whilst indirectly enhancing the authorities' credibility in the eyes o f the market. This
rationale for the D P L i s clearly understood by the authorities as explained in the Letter o f Development
Policy (see Annex 110.


F. MONITORINGAND EVALUATION

 146.    This operation's monitoring and evaluation will be supported by a variety data sources and
analytical work developed by different stakeholders. These include: (i)             State Statistics Committee
(which i s also supported a Bank project); (ii)Ministry o f Finance and State Treasury reports (both
institutions supported by the PFM project under preparation); (iii)reports from the State Tax
Administration (also supported by a Bank project); (iv) reports from the Ministry o f Economy; (v)
investment climate surveys and assessments produced annually by the Bank and the IFC; (vi)
Programmatic analytical work developed by the Bank such as the Public Finance Review, PEFA, and
ROCS assessments; (vii)analytical work producedby the IMF and other donors, including EU.

 147.    The baseline and medium term outcome figures are clearly stated in the Policy and
Institutional Reform Matrix (Annex I). The baselines and outcomes establishedare objective, concrete,
and measurable indicators o f economic and institutional performance. They will be tracked periodically
underthe DPLprogram.

G. FIDUCIARYASPECTS

148.      The government's reform efforts have improvedthe Public FinancialManagement
(PFM) significantlyover the lastsix years.The Bankhas recently assessedthe current state o f
the PFMincludingprocurement as described inparagraph 70 and 71 above (see also Figure 6.1).
The PFM assessment from 2007 concluded that Ukraine has in place fundamental systems for
macro-fiscal management, some elements o f a framework to enable strategic allocation o f
resources, and selected tools for improving operational efficiency. Reforms inrecent years have
put in place the treasury and improved budget processes. Poor capital budget completion rates
and weaknesses inexternal and internal audits are add to the fiduciary risks o f the PFM system.
Ongoing reform efforts are targeting improvements in strategic resource allocation as well as
operational efficiency and accountability.

149.       Recent procurement law changes appear to have set back the efforts to improve
efficient and accountable use of public resources. Prior to the 2005 amendments the Public
Procurement Department had the internationally accepted functions appropriate to a government
Authorized Agency (AA) in countries with a decentralized public procurement system. These
functions included issuingby-laws, providing methodological guidance and support to procuring
entities, approving non-competitive procedures, publishing public procurement bulletins, and
complaints resolution.                      After the December 2005 Amendment, the functions o f the Public
Procurement Department have beendiluted and assigned, indescending order o f authority, to the
Tender Chamber (TC) (which is now an NGO), the Special Control Commission (SCC) under
the Accounting Chamber, the Accounting Chamber, Parliament, the Anti-Monopoly Committee
(AMC), and central executive bodies. The current public procurement system is thus fragmented
and the distribution of functions has created governance concerns. More recently, however,
there is an increased consensus across political parties andpolicy making about the problems of
the current system and the momentum for reform along international standards i s increasing.

        o f the concept o f Public Internal Financial Audit and Control in this second loan. The
        third DPL will support strengthening o f the budgeting process, amendments to the
        procurement law (trigger), and improved public debt management.

151.    The IMF conducted a safeguards assessment of the NBUinJuly 2004 and found that
the NBUhad made progress in recent years to strengthen its safeguards framework. However,
further improvements couldbemade insome areas, notablythe areas o ffinancial reporting, legal
structure and independence. The main recommendations o f the IMF Safeguard assessment
included (a) full adoption o f International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), (b) a detailed
review o f the NBU Law, and other legislation that impinges on the central bank, in order to
strengthen the NBU's independence, and (c) semiannual audits by the NBU's internal audit
function o f the monetary data reported to the Fund. InDecember 2006, IMF concluded that most
o f the assessment's recommendations have been implemented. The outstanding issues in 2006
were as following: (i) adoption o f International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and
                         full
(ii)detailedreviewoftheNBULaw,andotherlegislationthatimpingesonthecentralbank,in

order to strengthen the MU'Sindependence.              Moreover, the audit reports on the financial
statements o f the NBU for the year 2003 and 2004 provided a clean audit opinion, with certain
emphases o f matter. The audit reports on the financial statements o f the NBU for the years 2005
and 2006 were qualified. The qualifications in the audit reports were primarily due to the
uncertaintyregarding repayment o f internal State debt, which indicates that the recommendations
from the previous IMF Safeguard assessmenthave beenimplemented..


H. LOANADMINISTRATION

152.    Borrower and Credit Amount. The borrower is the Government o f Ukraine represented by the
Ministry of Finance. This operation is a single-tranche variable spread loan (VSL) o f US$300 million.
The loanproceeds would be made available to the Borrower upon loan effectiveness.

153.    Disbursement.Upon approval o fthe loan andnotificationbythe Bank o fLoaneffectiveness, the
Government will submit a withdrawal application. The International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) will deposit the proceeds o f the loan into deposit account at the request o f the
Ministry of Finance. Prior to that the Bank will withdraw from the Loan Account a front-end fee
amounting to 0.25 percent o f the loan amount. If, after deposit inthis NBUaccount, the proceeds o f
the Loan are used for ineligible purposes (for example, to finance goods or services on the IBRDstandard
negative list), the IBRD will require the borrower to return that amount to the account for use for eligible
purposes. Amounts rehndedto the Bankupon such request shall be cancelled.

154.    Accounts, Auditing and ClosingDate. The Government will maintain accounts andrecords, or
ensure that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in accordance with
provision of the Loan Agreement. Such accounts and records will be maintained in a form acceptable to


                                                    58

the Bank. Within seven days of remittance o f funds by IBRD, the Government will provide a
confirmation to IBRDthat the hnds have been received by NEW and are available for financing budgeted
expenditures including debt servicing o f foreign currency loans raised by GoU.

155.   Audit o f the past PAL deposit accounts resulted in unqualified audit opinions. Past audits, and
generally positive assessment by the IMF, indicate that there are no strong reasons for asking additional
safeguards such as an audit o f the deposit account. As a result of the above, no audit will be necessary
under this DPL.

                ANNEX 3: Letter of DevelopmentPolicyfromthe GovernmentofUkraine

                                       (Unofficial translation)

Dear Mr.Zoellick:

   The Government o f Ukraine assures the World Bank and you o f its high esteem and has the
honor to notify you o f the following.

   The Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine highly appreciates the possibility o f cooperating with the
World Bank and we would be grateful ifthe World Bank lent its support to our economic reform
strategy. We see such support as an effective tool to help furthering reforms and sustaining the
positive dynamics o f economic growth inUkraine. Inview o f this, we look forward to continuing
our partnership through the program o f the Development Policy Loan I1(hereinafter referred to as
DPL11).

   Starting inthe third quarter of 2005, after the proceeds o f the First Development Policy Loan
(DPL I))  were received and inthe process of fulfilling benchmarks set for the DPL 11, Ukraine has
been implementing a number o f strategic reforms and actions to promote sustainable economic
growth, improve the business climate, public finance, public administration, and social welfare.
Specifically, the Government accomplished the following key economic policy measures:

    Enacted legislative amendments to prepare accession to WTO, including those key
    legislationchanges to allow foreign banksto open branches inUkraine, to improve
    intellectual property rights and to eliminate trade barriers.
    Liberalized the telecommunications sector, including tariff rebalancing, frequency
    allocations, issuance o f mobile phone licenses, andregulationo f interconnection.
    Enacted the Law o f Ukraine "On the Key Principles o fPublic Control o f Entrepreneurial
    Activity."
    Enacted the law "On State Regulation o fthe Energy Sector o f Ukraine."
    Maintained the deficit ofthe consolidated budget within 4 and 3.5% o f GDP in2005 and
    2006 respectively and within 3% o f GDP in2007.
    Enacted the Law "On the Management o f State OwnedEnterprises."
    Implementedpilot performance test ingeneral secondary education (test ininternational
    mathematics and science study) and undertook related activities at national level in2007.
    The quasi-fiscal deficit inthe energy sector as apercentage to GDPdid not increase
    following the rise innatural gas prices.

   Also, within the context o f the program laid out by the DPL IPolicy and Institutional Reform
Matrix, the following policies were accomplished:

        Secured for Ukraine market economy status granted by the United States and European
        Union;


                                                 70

        Introduced a register o f courtjudgments;
        Repealed a number o f laws hindering entrepreneurship inthe country;
        Restructured arrears inthe energy sector;
        Enacted the new Law o f Ukraine "On Securities and the Stock Market" to improve the
        legal framework for operation o fthe stock market and its participants;
        Reduced budget arrears;
        Reduced the share o f active tax arrears inGDP;
        Lowered the ratio ofpensionexpenditures to GDP in2006 compared to 2005;
        Draft Law "On the Civil Service" (new version) approved bythe Cabinet of Ministers;
        Completed the fhnctional review o fthe Ministry o f Finance;
        Enacted legislationdesignedto develop the state internal financial control;
        Adopted, in the health sector, the Concept        o f Development o f Primary Health Care
        (approved the PHC Reform Plan)
        Introduced a unified database for registering the recipients o f all social benefits so as to
        improve targeting social services to the poorest strata o fthe population.

   Inaddition to these actions, the Government also carried out some other reforms andmeasures,
specifically:
        approved the Concept o f the State Program for RailroadTransport Reform;
        eliminated the double pass-through (at import and at the first wholesale transaction with
        VAT taxpayers insidethe country) without paying VAT charges on gas
        adopted the Plan o fDevelopment o f BankingSupervisionby the National Bank o f Ukraine
        for 2006-2010;
        approved the national plan for control o f TB (2007-2010) and HIV/AIDS (2004-2008);
        improved transparency o f remuneration for government employees through increasing the
        share o f salary (incash) inthe overall package o f compensation for work.

   All these reforms will hrther contribute to improving Ukraine's economic performance.
Ukraine's economy has experienced rapid development on several fronts. The financial market i s
growing swiftly with commercial banks lending reaching new customers and international
strategic investors entering the securities market. Large Ukrainian companies are making their
activity more transparent and are gaining better access to international financial and securities
markets. Moreover, direct foreign investments have doubled compared to 2003-2004. The
implementation o f corresponding legislation and reforms has prepared Ukraine for accession to
WTO (expected for 2008.)

   At the same time, the Government faces important challenges to sustain andimprove
macroeconomic indicators and maintain economic stability. The Government is carrying out
intensive work to introducereforms aimed at ensuring the diversification o f the export base
while promoting the interests o fthe national commodity producers inexternal markets,
increasing the country's transit potential, enhancing efficiency inthe use o fnatural resources,
andrealizing the scientific potential inthe area o fhightechnologies.

   Meanwhile, despite pressures to increase substantially social payments and wages the
Government will pursue its policy o f fiscal conservatism andkeep fiscal deficits low.



                                                  71

    We note that, to some extent, Ukraine's performance has improved owing to external factors,
which might change inthe future. Furthermore, a fundamental concern for maintaining the stable
positive dynamics o f Ukraine's economic development i s the high inflation rate, which is partly
due to higher prices for imported energy resources andthe resultingincrease inthe cost o ftariffs
and final products. The Government will continue to make vigorous efforts to maintain price
stability as well as promote gradual transition to a monetary regime targetingprice stability.

   To address these challenges and to maintain the current economic growth that benefits all
Ukrainian citizens, the Government o f Ukraine has designed a medium-term program entitled
"Stability, Competitiveness, and New Quality o f Life". This program envisages reforms in areas
such as investments and export promotion, energy security, public infrastructure, taxation, public
administration, land property rights, and public service provision, particularly in health care,
education, and social protection. The broad areas o freform andthe specific actions to be undertaken
are concurrent with the programmatic reform agenda established under the programmatic
Development Policy Loan series. Inrealizing its overall medium-term program, the government will
particularlyfocus on:

        Improvinginternational integration through liberalization and promotion o f trade, as well as
        investmentswhile improving logistics to support exporters.
        Creatingmore favorable conditions for business promotion;
        Strengthening the financial sector and corporate governance;
        Improving the level o f energy security and energy efficiency;
        Maintaining financial discipline;
        Improving taxation policy and administration;
        Accelerating public administrative reform and reform in the area o f public financial
       management
       Improving the management o f state-owned enterprises;

        Raising the efficiency andperformance o fthe education system;
       Raising the efficiency andperformance o fthe healthcare system;

    Inorder to advance successfully towards these objectives, the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine
i s set on continuing consultations with the public and increasing the citizens' participation in
government decision-making, extending economic freedoms, continuing the liberalization o f the
economy, and providing greater economic freedom to the regions o fUkraine.

    The implementation o f the above program o f systemic reforms is expected to generate
important long-term advantages to the economy, but it will require some short-term financial and
technical support from the World Bank. This support from the World Bank, within the framework
o f the DPL-I1and a future DPL I11operation, would help significantly in anchoring this wave of
reforms.

   The representatives o f the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine and the World Bank worked jointly
indesigningspecific policies andmeasures to move forward onthe reform areas listedabove. The
actions supported within the framework o f DPL program as benchmarks for a future DPL I11

operation are hrther discussed below under three overarching themes: (i)        improvinginvestment
climate for economic development, (ii)   improving fiscal policy and public administration, and (iii)
improving service delivery and social inclusion. In addition, and in order to create an adequate
environment for the reform progress, the government is committed to maintaining a stable
macroeconomic framework. Below we briefly discuss key pressing issues for maintaining
macroeconomic balance and plannedmeasures to attain that goal.

                      MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC BALANCE

   As the prices for energy resources increased throughout 2006 and in the first six months o f
2007, the Government managed not only to maintain macroeconomic stability, but also to create
favorable conditions for speeding up economic growth.

   Real GDP growth in2006 was 7.1 percent (against 2005), and accelerated to 7.9% year on year
inthe first half of 2007. The volume of industrial output in2006 increased by 6.2 percent and in
January-April 2007 by 11.8 percent. The highest growth was registered in the machine building,
food, and metallurgy industries, with 11.8 percent, 10.0 percent, and 13.8 percent real growth,
respectively (year on year for the first half o f 2007). There is also an upward dynamic in gross
value added in other types o f economic activity: for example, wholesale and retail trade and
transport gross value added by 17.0 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively (year on year for the first
half o f 2007).

   In 2006 and in the first seven months of 2007 domestic demand remained strong and
contributed to maintain economic growth. The Government's active social policy facilitated the
population's growing purchasing power. The growing consumer demand was combined by a
stronger export component owing to a better situation on the world market o f metal products and
reinvigorated investment growth aimed at renewing fixed assets, introducing energy-saving
technologies, and modernizing production. In turn, investment demand and the population's
growing incomes caused the buildup in imports. As a result, the growth rates o f commodity and
services imports (22 percent in 2006, 30.6 percent in Q1 o f 2007)) exceeded the growth rates o f
exports (13.2 percent in 2006, and 28.5 percent in Ql).     This resulted in a negative foreign trade
balance and a deficit in the current account. In Q1 o f 2007, the deficit in the current account was
U S $1.3 billion, which i s up 1.7 times on the same period in 2006. However, the higher levels o f
capital inflows allowed the deficit o f the current account to be more than offset while foreign
exchange reserves continued to increase. Ukraine is increasingly perceived as an attractive
destination for investment. InQ1 o f 2007, the inflow o f direct foreign investment into Ukraine's
economy was US $1.2 billion ,which i s up 3.9 percent on the same period last year, while FX
reserves had reached U S $ 2 6 billionbythe endo f June o f 2007.

   The Government has continued to demonstrate its ability to maintain balanced budgets while
reducing the level o f the national debt. The fiscal deficit in 2006 did not exceed the ceiling
established by the D P L program (in fact, the fiscal deficit o f the consolidated budget in 2006 was
just 0.7 percent o f GDP). This was possible by increasing revenue mobilization efforts and
reducing the transfer for deficit coverage sent from the budget to the Pension Fund. Although
budget hnds were predominantly allocated for financing social spending (accounting for 56.6
percent o f the 2006 consolidated budget against 60.5 percent in2005), the financing o f investment



                                                 73

programs was gradually renewed in 2006 (from 12.9 percent o f total spending in 2005 to 14
percent in 2006). In2007, this dynamic continued, taking into consideration that the growth rates
o f social entitlements will be less thanin2005-2006.

    Through the second quarter o f 2007, the revenues o f the state budget were over-fulfilled. The
revenue mobilization increases made it possible to introduce changes to the 2007 budget law,
aimed at increasing social spending (in particular, increasing o f salaries, wages and pensions and
raising of social standards). At the same time, it should be noted that this did not pose a threat to
the budgetary balance inview o f the fact that the threshold (planned) amount o f the budget deficit
remainedunchanged.

    The period o fpolitical instability since April 2007, has hadlittle effect on the economy. Infact,
after April output continued to grow at expected rates, foreign exchange reserves in the National
Bank continued to grow, and the stock market index registered a new recordhigh.

    At the present time the country's economy has no substantial macroeconomic imbalances but
the Government remains aware o f potential macroeconomic risks related to external and internal
factors. Inorder to prevent and avoid negative shocks over the medium term, the Government and
the National Bank o f Ukraine plan to gradually switch over to a monetary regime based on price
stability. This envisages creating macroeconomic, fiscal, and institutional conditions including
macroeconomic and fiscal balance, the gradual transition to a regime o f inflation targeting, and
measures for developing the securities market. The fiscal and monetary authorities are ready to
react swiftly, prudently, and appropriately to any negative development.


        IMPROVINGTHE INVESTMENT CLIMATE FORECONOMIC GROWTH

    Moving forward, one o f the priorities determined in the Government action program is the
creation o f a favorable investment climate to ensure the preconditions for long-term sustainable
economic growth.

    The Government intendsto deepen the country's integration into the international economy and
attract strategic investments to key sectors o f the economy. After considerable trade liberalization
and laying o f the foundations for WTO accession, the work on the reform program will focus on
improving transport and transit, communications, logistics for exporters, and attracting private
investment in infrastructure development, specifically, for building and modernizing roads. The
DPL I11program envisions that the Customs Code o f Ukraine will be brought in line with the
Kyoto Convention. Moreover, the government foresees the introduction o f amendments to
legislation (or adoption o f a new law) on state-private partnership to facilitate private investment
intransport infrastructure and other sectors but bearinginmindpotential fiscal risks. Inorder to
have a baseline and later a full fledge system to evaluate the country's logistics, the government
intends to set a system o f performance measurement on key transit routes and export corridors
across the country. At the same time, the government will continue implementing improved
technical procedures regardingproduct certification and standards, compatible with EUlegislation
andWTO compliant.




                                                  74

   The Government will continue to work on the creation o f conditions for an accelerated
development o f small and medium-size businesses, including through the removal o f burdensome
and unnecessary regulatory policies and procedures. For the continued adjustment o f regulatory
policy, and in order to create a favorable entrepreneurial environment, the Government will
complete the implementation o f the laws on permits for economic activities, licensing, and
inspections o fbusiness activities.

   To improve banking supervision and reduce risks inthe financial system, the Government will
enhance the role o f the NBU by supporting legislative bills on consolidated supervision,
enforcement o f disclosure of ultimate beneficiary owners, and enhanced corporate governance in
banks. The NBUwill also take measures to improve procedures for the supervision o f problem
banks.

   The Ukrainian Government also intends to adopt the Law On Joint Stock Companies to
approximate legislation in Ukraine to the corporate governance principles prevalent in OECD
countries. The Government will also enhance the powers o f the Securities and Stock Market State
Commission and the State Commission for Regulating Financial Services Markets to supervise the
financial activity o f joint stock companies and non-banking institutions. Specifically, this would
involve introducing amendments to legislation binding joint stock companies and non-banking
financial institutions to fimish information about their actual owners and properly comply with
this legislation.

   Higher efficiency in the use o f energy resources in Ukraine i s decisive for supporting
competitiveness, sustained growth and economic independence in the future. The Government
intends to reform the gas market, accelerate restructuring o f the coal sector, continue privatizing
the electricity distribution network, and improve the financial standing o f energy companies,
particularly encouraging higher levels o f cash collection and not allowing the quasi-fiscal deficit to
grow due to under-pricing.


  IMPROVING FISCAL POLICY, PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC
                                        ADMINISTRATION

   Improving public finances to foster growth requires a number o f measures related to reforming,
the public sector, the tax system, carrying out administrative reform, introducing budget controls
reforming the public procurement system and management o f state-owned enterprises. Part o f the
reform in this area will be anchored in new pieces o f legislation that are consistent with EU
standards and will clearly define the rights and competence o f each element o f the public
administration structure.

   The cornerstone of this agenda is to maintain a prudent fiscal stance, and the government is
committed to do so by keepinglow fiscal deficits (below the target established under the DPL I11
program). This would also imply continuing the effort in containing pension outlays and creating
the basis for the fiscal sustainability o f the current pay as you go system in the context o f future
plannedreforms. To bring the tax system in line with the priorities o f the state policy o f socio-
economic development while gradually reducing the tax burden over the medium term, the



                                                  75

Government will continue implementing measures to broaden the tax base o f the value added tax
including through reforms to the VAT in agriculture, while making the process o f refund more
expeditious. At the same time, efforts will be oriented to close loopholes and curtail avoidance
schemes, while striving to reduce, over the medium term, marginal rates on taxes such as the
enterprise profit tax in the future. The government is currently refining a draft o f the new Tax
Code which will be likely to be discussed inthe context o f the elected parliament inearly 2008.

   The improvement o f the budgeting processes i s an important area of the continued reform o f
public finance management. The government intends to start the introduction o f medium term
strategic plans and programs with budget ceilings for current and capital spending across all
spending units and agencies. It also plans to reduce by at least 25 percent the number o f state
targeted programs, which currently reduce capital budget flexibility. These measures are part o f
the government's efforts to improve the budgetary process, capital budgeting, and ensure that
scarcepublic investment resources are spent as effectively as possible.

   The adoption o f reforms in public procurement is an essential element o f systemic reform and
the government is aware o f the governance concerns the current system generates. Inthis context,
the government is working to revise the legislative framework o f public procurement through the
amendments to the Law o f Ukraine On Procurement of Goods, Works and Services for Public
Funds. The aim i s to improve this system inline with best international practice.

   Reforming the civil service on the basis o f political neutrality, transparency, and integrity is a
national priority. To this effect the Cabinet o f Ministers approved a draft law o f Ukraine On the
Civil Service and a presidential decree was enacted (on September 20, 2007) entitled "On the
Measures to Reform the Civil Service in Ukraine and Ensure the Protection o f Constitutional
Rights of Civil Servants." The components o f civil service reform include the separation o f
political and administrative posts, improvement o f the procedure for conducting competitive
exams to fillpositions o f civil servants, introduction of an additional mechanism for the protection
o f civil servants, increasing their responsibility, and making the system o f remuneration more
transparent. The introduction o f an electronic system in government agencies is one o f the main
steps toward comprehensively reforming the civil service to make it professional, transparent,
more efficient, and capable o fproviding quality services to citizens.

   The current Government supports the policy o f regional development and it i s an advocate o f
granting local government more autonomy for dealing with service delivery and other
socioeconomic issues. At the present time the Government is working on amendments to the
Budget Code defining more clearly the functions andresponsibilities of local governments, giving
themmore autonomy andstrengthening the financialbasis o flocal self-government specificallyby
introducing property taxes (in the medium-term), making more transparent the distribution of
resources through the mechanisms o f transfers and improving the legal framework for local
government borrowing.

   Improving management and enhancing transparency o f state-owned enterprises (and assets) i s
also at the top o f the reform agenda o f the Government. To improve administration o f state-owned
enterprises, the Government plans to ensure the implementation o f the law on the management o f




                                                 76

State Owned Enterprises through issuing Cabinet o f Ministers regulations concerning dividend
policy, management selection, andfinancial reporting.


               IMPROVING SERVICEDELIVERY AND SOCIAL INCLUSION

    The improvement o f social services, social insurance and social support to the poorest segments
of the population are among the priorities of the Government. Efficient and improved public
services are essential for that purpose. The Government intends to implement measures to ensure
the best possible use o fresources allocated for public healthcare andeducation, and to improve the
quality o f services inthese sectors.

    Underthe DPLprogram, the Government plans to improve the normative framework regulating
teaching and non-teaching staffing in general educational establishments. Moreover, the
Government plans to revise the norms set forth inthe Ministry of Health Order No.33 (established
in February 23, 2000) "On Staffing Standards and Standard Staffs of Health Facilities",
eliminating some of the input based norms that impose rigidities in the use o f staffing and other
resources on the budgets o f healthcare institutions and local governments. Inaccordance with the
State Program o f Ukraine's Social and Economic Development for 2007 the Government will set
up a legal framework to promote the optimization of the network o f institutions by merging or
closing them.

    Throughout the past four years, the pension system reform has been the constant focus o f
government policy. The Government i s working on the creation o f conditions for the introduction
o f a fully fundeduniversal mandatorypension insurance systemto complement the current pay-as-
you-go system. The Government acknowledges that to ensure the stability o f the existing PAYG
system inthe long-term and to generate part o f the required fiscal savings to afford the transition,
it is necessary to introduce several parametric changes. Within the DPL I11program framework, as
mentioned earlier, the Government will evaluate which measures are feasible to be introduced as
to ensure financial stability o f the PAYG pension system. The Government submitted to
parliament for consideration the draft Law On the System of Collection and Recording of a Single
Social Contribution to Mandatory State Social Insurance, which was considered by parliament on
April 11, 2007 and passed in first reading. The enactment o f this Law will allow a reduction in
compliance (for contributors) and administrative costs related to the collection o f contributions
under the current four funds by consolidating collection and other administrative function under
the PensionFund.

                                               RISKS

    The Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine i s committed to implementing the program o f reforms
listed in this letter, which would contribute to a substantial improvement in the country's
economic policy framework. There are risks, however, that may occur in the implementation o f
the program, including the following:




                                                 77

          A Verkhovna Rada's failure to pass laws that are instrumental in implementing the
          program o f reforms. To mitigate this risk, the CoM will cooperate with the VR on a
         permanent basis;
          Insufficient public support o f the Government. To mitigate this risk, the CoM will
          consult policies periodically with the public;
          A worsening o f foreign trade and economic conditions, especially due to external
          shocks. The Government will take measures to mitigate that through strengthening the
          macroeconomic framework and diversifyingproduction.


                           COORDINATION AND MONITORING


  From the start o f the DPL program, the Government has been maintaining transparency o f the
decision-making process and i s introducing a mechanism o f consultations with the public. The
C o M has appointed the Ministry o f Economy as the implementing agency to coordinate and
monitor implementation under the DPL program.
