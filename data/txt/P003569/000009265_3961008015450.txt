MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A SHANGHAI-ZHEJIANG HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for $260 million equivalent to help finance a
Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace. The proceeds of the
Bank loan would be made available to Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province on the
same terms, with Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province bearing the foreign exchange
risk.
2.         Country/Sector Background.  Following the open-door economic policy
adopted by China in 1978 and the influx of foreign investment, the demand for transport grew
substantially: annual freight and passenger traffic across modes increased by about 7 percent
and 10 percent per year, respectively. Despite this, investment in transport infrastructure has
been extremely low. During 1981-1991, investment equaled 1.3 percent of GNP, lower than
the 2-3 percent levels achieved in Brazil and India. The government now recognizes that
underinvestment in transport infrastructure has caused serious bottlenecks that are constraints to
future sustainable growth of the Chinese economy.
3.         Within this context, China's highway sector continues to grow rapidly. The
demand for expansion and upgrading of the road network is supported by recent traffic growth
in major corridors of 20 percent per year. The vehicle fleet has grown by 255 percent since
1985. Passenger and freight traffic turnover on highways has doubled since 1985; this volume
of traffic, coupled with an aging existing road network designed for lower levels of traffic and
for a different mix of vehicles, has contributed to serious problems of congestion in major
provincial corridors and in most cities.
4.         Rationale for Bank Involvement. The main component of the Chinese
government's strategy for the highway sector is the development of a National Trunk Highway
System (NTHS), comprising 12 major interprovincial highways for the exclusive use of motor
vehicles; these routes would connect all provincial capitals and cities with population exceeding
500,000. The construction of 25,000 km of high-standard, access-controlled highways for the
NTHS has been accorded the highest investment priority by central government. This scope of
construction represents a tremendous challenge: as of 1991, only 500 km of the system had
been built, with an additional 4,000 km to be added during the Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-
1995).
5.         The proposed project supports the government's strategy for the highway sector
and is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed at the Board on June 1, 1995,
specifically addressing one of the Bank's key objectives, the alleviation of infrastructure
bottlenecks. In the highway sector, the Bank strategy is to assist in the development,
management and financing of the highway system with emphasis on introduction of important
new technologies and the avoidance of some of the better-known problems of rapid
motorization, including inappropriate pricing and subsidies, neglect of safety and environmental
side effects, and urban congestion. The proposed project supports the Bank strategy in several



of these areas. The Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor that is the focus of the proposed project is
experiencing rapid econonic growth: this factor, combined with the high density of population
and increasing motorization in the project area, is reflected in traffic growth rates of up to 20
percent per year and increasingly serious congestion. The project would help relieve congestion
through construction of a new expressway and the upgrading of other roads to increase capacity
for high-speed traffic in the corridor.
6.         The Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway that would be constructed under the
proposed project forms an important segment of the coastal route of China's NTHS, which will
link Heilongjiang Province in the extreme northeast of China with Hainan Island at China's
southernmost point. The Bank is financing or has financed the construction of sections of this
route and of important provincial roads in several eastern provinces of China, including
Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway would
provide high-speed linkages with other key expressways, including the Shanghai Inner Ring
Road and the Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway (both being constructed with Bank assistance), to
form a continuous, 295-km expressway route between Shanghai and Ningbo, linking the most
rapidly developing areas of Zhejiang with the major trade and communications center of
Shanghai.
7.         Bank participation in this project is beneficial to the highway and planning
agencies in Shanghai and Zhejiang by fostering the adoption of more up-to-date technical and
project management practices, including the use of design reviews, contracting, and
construction supervision. Bank involvement places emphasis on the importance of efficient
organization, operation, and maintenance of the new expressway that would be financed by
road user charges and operated as a toll road. The use of tolls is increasingly important for
sustainability of road investments in China.
8.         Development of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, a bi-provincial highway,
will afford opportunities for the Bank to help alleviate constraints in the movement of
passengers and goods across administrative boundaries and to promote regional trade. The
Bank's involvement in the project is helping to improve coordination and cooperation between
the provinces of Shanghai and Zhejiang, with lessons that will be relevant for future Bank
projects in China and more generally, for links of China's NTHS that will require coordination
across a large number of provinces.
9.         The project's pilot program for road safety (the Road Safety Program) supports
the Bank's strategy for participation in China's highway sector. The magnitude of the road
safety problem in China is receiving increasing attention as vehicle ownership levels and traffic
continue to grow at unprecedented rates, and as a high-speed road network is developed, factors
that could contribute to the already serious road safety problem. Appropriate interventions and
solutions to improve road safety in corridors such as those in the proposed project,
characterized by a high volume of mixed traffic with a significant proportion of bicycle traffic,
are still being identified and are of central concern both to the Chinese government and to the
Bank. Through participation in the formulation of the Road Safety Program, the Bank has
provided critical technical expertise to help identify potential solutions, including road safety-
conscious designs that would be used to upgrade selected roads in the pilot and a program for
strengthening road safety technical capacity in provincial highway agencies. Bank involvement
during supervision would afford opportunities to provide additional technical advice on road
safety and to disseminate lessons of the pilot to other provinces in China.
10.        Because of the dense human settlements along the project route, intensive
preparation of environmental and resettlement activities under the project has been critical to the



-3-
development of strategies and action plans for adequate environmental protection and income
restoration of project-affected people.  In particular, the Bank has made a significant
contribution to the preparation of and planning for resettlement activities by providing technical
expertise for the assessment of resettlement impacts and the formulation of Resettlement Action
Plans (RAPs), and by providing guidance on how to meet the institutional requirements for
implementation of resettlement, including the monitoring of resettlement impacts.
11.        Lessons from  Previous Bank Operations.  The Bank has accumulated
substantial experience on China's highway sector through the preparation and implementation of
twelve previous highway projects. Of these, one highway project has been completed and a
second was recently closed.
12.        Bank experience in China shows generally strong implementation capacity for the
main physical components in highway projects and for expressway components in particular.
However,  delays in implementation often occur for other project components: lack of
familiarity with procurement procedures and inadequate planning and  design of traffic
engineering facilities (traffic monitoring, telecommunications, tolling, and lighting) have
resulted in the implementation of traffic engineering and equipment procurement being delayed
beyond completion of the highway civil works. Preparation of the proposed project has
specifically emphasized the procurement, management and operations of the tolled expressway
that would be constructed. The proposed project has also benefited from advance preparation of
bidding documentation for major civil works and other components and independent design
reviews, which should help reduce delays during implementation.
13.        Land acquisition and the resettlement of affected people has also led to
implementation difficulties, including delays and cost overruns, in Bank-financed highway
projects in China and other countries. The proposed project covers a densely populated and
fast-growing corridor and, typical of the southeastern coastal area, a large number of people and
properties would be affected by land acquisition and resettlement. Bank experience shows that
the institutional requirements, including assessment of resettlement impact, monitoring and
reporting, are significant but often underestimated by project authorities. The resettlement
activities under the proposed project take into consideration the previous lessons learned, and
has addressed a broader range of technical issues than previous transport projects in China (see
para 29).
14.        The Bank has had considerable involvement with transport infrastructure projects
in both Shanghai and Zhejiang. A Shanghai Metropolitan Transport Project was approved by
the Board in September 1991, and a Second Shanghai Metropolitan Transport Project was
approved in September 1993. The main infrastructure component of both projects is the
construction of 27 km of the Inner Ring Road around the center of Shanghai; the projects also
provide access via bridges to the new development area in Pudong. The implementation of
projects in Shanghai has indicated strong capabilities in civil works design and construction, but
relatively weak institutional capacity affecting planning and implementation, weak enforcement
of traffic regulations (in part, due to difficulty in interagency cooperation), inefficient public
transport operations, poor interagency cooperation, and lack of consideration of environmental
impacts. The proposed project would address several areas of weakness: first, the project
includes an institutional strengthening component, comprising training courses and the
provision of equipment to improve the capacity of highway agencies to plan, manage, and
operate roads. The environmental aspects of the project have been addressed jointly with the
Bank throughout preparation, resulting in specific action plans for the construction and
operation phases of the project that would be monitored throughout implementation;  the



- 4 -
provision of environmental equipment under this project would also strengthen Shanghai's
capacity for environmental testing and management.
15.        A Zhejiang Provincial Highway Project was approved by the Board in May 1992;
this project includes construction of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway that would adjoin the
Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway in the proposed project. During the first two years of
implementation of the ongoing project, there were serious difficulties with expressway
construction quality and the monitoring of resettlement activities. Measures were taken to
strengthen staff capabilities, improve internal quality controls, and address resettlement
monitoring, and the project is now rated as satisfactory. The construction problems resulted
from the delegation of authority to lower level agencies that were unfamiliar with contracting
procedures, supervision, and quality control, with negative impacts on construction quality,
physical progress, and cost of the expressway. Bank experience in many other countries has
demonstrated that poorly constructed roads lower economic benefits and vehicle operating cost
savings, and may reduce reliability and accessibility of the road. Higher costs may result from
premature deterioration, requiring corrective actions in the form of increased maintenance and
rehabilitation. The proposed project has taken these findings into consideration. The project
would be supervised by a joint supervision team, comprising a core team of international and
domestic experts complemented by experienced personnel recruited from other construction
supervision firms and local staff. Terms of reference of the international consultants ensure
adequate numbers of technical staff and procedures for quality control. The project would also
include an important construction supervision training program to be held prior to the start of
construction.  Regular Bank supervision would focus on the adequacy of construction
supervision and quality control procedures.
16.        Several of the most important lessons learned in implementation of highway
projects worldwide concern road maintenance. Bank policy papers in 1979 and 1988
underscored the fact that neglect of road maintenance can ultimately result in very high costs to
restore infrastructure, and that new road construction must be balanced with the need for road
maintenance. In previous Bank studies, the maintenance of China's roads was considered
adequate. However, the rapidly expanding network size and high rates of vehicle and traffic
growth in China suggest that maintenance requirements may accelerate in coming years. The
Bank is currently reviewing the implementation experience of Road Data Bank/Pavement
Management Systems components that have been included in several previous highway
projects. The proposed project has taken these issues into account, and would strengthen the
capacity for maintenance of Shanghai and Zhejiang roads through the provision of equipment
for operations and maintenance of expressways and other roads.
17.        Based on the Bank's experience with institutional and policy aspects of highway
projects in China and elsewhere, the phasing of studies and technical assistance and the intensity
of Bank supervision are key factors in sustainability of outcomes. Institutional components that
are implemented early in the project period tend to have a greater impact than free-standing
studies carried out in the advanced stages of a project. Bank experience also shows that road
safety programs benefit from careful monitoring of safety conditions and the impact of
interventions to improve safety. Institutional components for road safety are most effective
when geared to the capabilities of the project agency, taking into consideration staff strength,
technical capacity, and operating constraints, and the success of road safety programs depends
on effective coordination between highway departments and traffic police. These lessons have
been taken into consideration in designing the Road Safety Program in the proposed project,
which would pilot road safety-conscious engineering designs and strengthen road safety
practices. The scope of this component is small -- well-suited to the capacity of the municipal
highway authorities involved in day-to-day implementation.  The civil works would be



- 5 -
implemented in a manner to maximize the demonstration effect of the program and to allow for
learning from implementation of each works package; regular monitoring and reporting are
included to measure the impact of road safety interventions. The Road Safety Program would
be implemented early in overall project implementation, which would permit earlier review and
adoption of the pilot findings.
18.        Project Objectives. The project is designed to (a) increase highway capacity
in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor in order to relieve existing congestion and promote
economic development; (b) improve road safety in northern Zhejiang; and (c) develop highway
sector institutional capability in Shanghai and Zhejiang.
19.        Project Description.   The  project comprises:  (a) construction of the
Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, a 130-km divided four-lane access-controlled highway,
including service facilities and the supply and installation of electrical, electronic and mechanical
(E&M) equipment for tolling, traffic monitoring, telecommunication and lighting, and the
upgrading of 56 km of crossroads at interchange locations in Zhejiang Province to improve
access to the new expressway;  (b) construction supervision of the Shanghai-Hangzhou
Expressway; (c) the Road Safety Program, a pilot program in northern Zhejiang to improve
safety on highways in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor after opening of the new expressway,
comprising the upgrading of 86 km of National Route (NR) 320 road sections and structures in
Jiaxing Municipality, including construction supervision, and the provision of technical
assistance, training, and equipment to improve road safety practices in Zhejiang highway
agencies; and (d) institutional strengthening of highway agencies in Shanghai and Zhejiang,
comprising (i) a staff training program covering highway planning, design, construction, and
maintenance and (ii) strengthening of technical capacity through the addition of equipment for
central laboratories, environmental protection and research for the Shanghai-Hangzhou
Expressway, operation and maintenance of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, and
maintenance of the provincial and county road networks.
20.        Project Costs and Financing. The project is estimated to cost $729 million,
with a foreign exchange component of $271 million (37 percent). The Bank loan would finance
$260 million, about 36 percent of total project cost. The central government would provide an
additional $58 million in grant funding, and Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province
would finance $177 million and $234 million of the estimated cost, respectively.  Local
contributions from Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province would be drawn primarily
from highway sector user charges.
21.        Retroactive financing of $26 million (10 percent of the IBRD loan) has been
requested and would apply to payments made after September 1, 1994 (based on a planned date
of loan signing of September 1, 1995). The presentation of the proj,.ct to the Board has been
delayed while activities essential to the success of the project such as Government approval,
financing plans, and preparation of satisfactory RAPs were being completed. Retroactive
financing has been requested for necessary start-up activities for expressway construction and
advance contracting of a road to bypass Hangzhou. These activities will allow the originally
envisaged sequencing of project activities to be maintained and will help avoid implementation
delays. Project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Schedule B indicates
procurement arrangements and the estimated disbursement schedule. Schedules C and D
present a timetable of key project activities and the status of Bank Group operations in China,
respectively. Maps 25817, 25818, and 25819 are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 14034-CHA dated July 11, 1995, is being distributed separately.

22.        Project  Implementation.    The  Shanghai-based  Shanghai-Hangzhou
Expressway Construction Executive Conmmission and the Zhejiang Provincial Expressway
Project Executive Conmnission would implement the expressway and institutional strengthening
components. A road safety unit within the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration Bureau
together with the Zhejiang Provincial Communications Department would be responsible for
implementation of the Road Safety Program.
23.         Implementation should benefit from the previous experience in Shanghai and
Zhejiang in implementing major, Bank-financed infrastructure projects.  The Zhejiang
Provincial Expressway Project Executive Comnmnission is responsible for implementation of the
Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway component of the ongoing Zhejiang Provincial Highway
Project: this project had a poor performance rating in 1994, but remedial actions have now been
taken and the project is rated as satisfactory.  The Zhejiang Provincial Communications
Department is implementing the rural road improvement program under the same project, and
was previously involved in the Bank-financed Highway Project.  The implementation
difficulties experienced under other highway projects in China have been addressed during
preparation of the current project, and would be revisited during project implementation.
24.         Project Sustainability. The sustainability of the physical investments under
this project is dependent on quality of the initial construction and adequate funding for routine
and periodic maintenance. In the proposed project, the use of an independent construction
supervision team comprising international and domestic experts, combined with up-front
construction supervision training and regular Bank supervision missions will help to ensure
quality control. With regard to maintenance of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, funds
collected from road users in the form of tolls will be earmarked for routine and periodic
maintenance. Maintenance of the road sections included under the Road Safety Program would
be funded by revenues from user charges collected by provincial highway authorities.
25.        Sustainability of the institutional aspects of any project, including the training
component (expressway) and the training and technical assistance under the Road Safety
Program under this project, typically depends upon Borrower commitment to project objectives
and the potential for adaptation of recommendations to local circumstances, the dedication of
adequate physical and human resources for implementation of institutional aspects, and high-
level commitment to the review of findings. The planning and implementation of the Road
Safety Program involves Zhejiang's primary engineering and highway management agencies,
which possess the necessary human and physical resources, relevant experience, and authority
in the sector to help ensure adequate attention to and implementation of findings of the pilot.
Further, the road safety technical assistance, to be initiated early in project implementation,
focuses on strengthening of existing road safety practices through training and the
development/introduction of new road safety practices within the highway sector agencies. The
timing and targeting of road safety activities at the road agency level helps ensure sustainability
of the pilot findings and integration of the new approaches to road safety.
26.        Agreed Actions.  Agreement was reached at negotiations that the central
government will make the proceeds of the loan available to Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang
Province on the same terms as those of the Bank loan, with Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang
Province bearing the foreign exchange risk.  Additional assurances were obtained from
Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province that:  (a) proposals for toll operations,
methodology for toll setting, and measures to facilitate interprovincial traffic movements will be
submitted to the Bank by December 31, 1995; (b) information on the recomnmended toll levels
and organizational arrangements for the Expressway will be submitted to the Bank by December
31, 1998;  (c) adequate staffing and organizational arrangements for project implementing



- 7 -
agencies and supervision teams will at all times be maintained; (d) as a condition of
disbursement for works packages under the Road Safety Program, the Bank will receive and
approve information on the design, technical aspects, construction supervision, and layout plans
for junctions, as well as a report containing an assessment of the likely impact of works on road
safety; (e) environment and resettlement activities will be carried out according to action plans
acceptable to the Bank, and regular monitoring of resettlement against RAPs will be conducted;
(f) each year, a detailed implementation plan for all project activities and a two-year rolling plan
for training will be submitted to the Bank; and (g) quarterly monitoring reports measuring the
impact of project activities on road safety will be submitted to the Bank. The signature of
contracts with international consultants for the provision of construction supervision services is
a condition of loan effectiveness.
27.         Environmental Aspects. This is a category A project. It has been ascertained
that the expressway would not pass through ecologically sensitive areas. However, there are
potential environmental problems such as: social disruption, noise, air and water pollution, soil
erosion, water management, operation of quarries, waste disposal and control of traffic.
Environmental Assessments (EAs) were carried out, and based on their findings, Environmental
Action Plans (EAPs) to address the problems identified have been prepared and submitted to the
Bank and found satisfactory. When appropriate measures as indicated in the EAPs are taken,
expressway construction and operation should have no significant adverse impact on the
environment.
28.         Resettlement. An estimated 42,300 people would be affected by construction
of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, of whom 34,700 would lose land only, 900 would
lose housing only, 5,100 would lose both house and land, and 1,600 would be affected by
enterprise relocation. An estimated 13,964 additional people would be affected by resettlement
under the Road Safety Program. Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) covering all project
components have been received and are acceptable to the Bank.
29.         During project preparation, counterpart staff have worked extensively with Bank
experts to improve the planning, execution, and monitoring of the resettlement activities under
this project, and have specifically addressed: (a) the establishment of a policy framework to
ensure that living standards for all categories of affected persons are, at a minimum, restored;
(b) the establishment of transparent mechanisms to redress grievances of affected persons and
the procedure for appeals; (c) the necessity to compensate for all affected assets, and housing in
particular, at full replacement values; (d) the inclusion of contingencies, especially for inflation,
in resettlement budgets; (e) the strengthening of institutional arrangements for both internal and
external monitoring of land acquisition and resettlement activities; and (f) the planning and
execution of detailed processes of job creation. All of these issues, while complex, have been
satisfactorily addressed in RAPs for the proposed project.
30.         Due to the advanced state of preparation of this project, resettlement for the
Zhejiang expressway section and for the Road Safety Program is complete; the Bank has
received an initial monitoring report for these resettlement activities. The already-completed as
well as all future resettlement activities are being carried out according to the RAPs found
acceptable to the Bank.
31.         Project Costs and Benefits. The economic evaluation of the project was
based on the economic cost of road investments, operating costs of the new roads, and benefits
to the local economies. Economic costs comprise investment costs (project development,
design, land acquisition and resettlement, construction, construction supervision, and electrical
and mechanical works) and operating costs (routine and periodic maintenance and expressway



- 8 -
operations, including toll collection and administration costs). Benefits from the project as a
whole would accrue to road users in the form of cost, time, and accident savings, and to the
provincial governments in the form of reduced highway maintenance costs and reduced burden
on emergency services. Many road users are own-account truck operators for productive
enterprises or, in the rural areas, individual farmers, and thus should capture the benefits of the
project directly. Public freight and passenger services are also likely to respond to increased
competition so that transport cost savings would be passed on to users; at minimum, reduced
operating costs would permit future price increases to be held down. Passengers would in any
case enjoy the time savings offered by the project. The net present value of the proposed
Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway Project is Y 17.0 billion and the EIRR is estimated at 33 percent.
32.         The main quantifiable benefits of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway and
associated access roads would include (a) reduced traffic congestion for traffic remaining on the
existing Shanghai-Hangzhou highway and (b) improved driving conditions, reduced traffic
interference, and reduced travel distances and times for expressway traffic due to restricted
access and the direct and less congested nature of the new alignment. The EIRR for the
Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway was estimated in the base case, taking into consideration the
economic cost of this investment component, reduction in vehicle operating costs, and time
savings. The net present value of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway component is Y 15.9
billion, and the EIRR is estimated at 33 percent. The EIRR would be reduced to about 27
percent if there were a cost overrun by 50 percent. If traffic growth and generated traffic were
50 percent lower than the base case, the EIRR would decline to 19 percent. The EIRR would be
reduced to the 12 percent discount rate if there were a 200 percent cost increase combined with
low traffic growth and little additional generated traffic.
33.        The principal direct benefits of the Road Safety Program  would derive from
savings in vehicle operating costs, reduced congestion, and a reduction in traffic accidents along
sections of NR 320 that are improved under the program. The investments in the Road Safety
Program are designed to reduce the number and severity of accidents through (a) the separation
of slow-moving bicycles and agricultural vehicles from faster vehicular traffic through the
provision of separate lanes for the slow traffic and (b) improved intersection layouts. Longer-
term (but unquantified) benefits from the Road Safety Program would include (a) generally
improved design of highway carriageways and intersections in the region based on training
received and experience gained in this project, and (b) reduction in the number of accidents
through remedial work at blackspots identified using equipment and training provided under the
project. The EfRR of the Road Safety Program was estimated in the base case taking into
consideration the economic costs of the physical investments, the economic value of accident
reduction, vehicle operating cost savings and time savings. The present value of the Road
Safety Program's physical investments is Y 1.1 billion, and the EIRR is estimated at 54 percent.
The EIRR would decline to 42 percent in the event of a 50 percent cost overrun. If the accident
reduction rate were only one-third of the expected rate used in the base case, the EIRR would
fall to 26 percent. The EIRR would be reduced to the 12 percent discount rate if there were both
a cost overrun by 200 percent and accident reduction of less than 10 percent of the expected
rate.
34.        The project has important institutional benefits that would derive from the road
safety technical assistance, staff training, and the addition of equipment needed to manage
expressways and other roads in Shanghai and Zhejiang. The road safety practices developed
under this project would be applicable to most roads in the project corridor, providing potential
longer-term safety benefits. The exposure of highway sector staff to subjects included in
training and their involvement in the procurement processes under the project would also
provide longer-term benefits for the sector: staff in the Shanghai and Zhejiang implementing



-9-
agencies are likely to manage the roads included in this project over the long term, and to be
involved in the development of other major highway and expressway projects. The equipment
included in the project would strengthen the capacity of Shanghai and Zhejiang highway
agencies for road maintenance, expressway operations, research, and construction. These
institutional benefits, while significant, have not been quantified or included in the EIRR
evaluation.
35.        Risks. Project preparation has focused on the mitigation of risks specific to this
project or risks identified in other Bank-financed highway projects. Preparation has
incorporated specific lessons from Bank projects in China and has involved the Ministry of
Communications for assistance in technical matters and project formulation.  International
experts have also been involved in the design of the expressway and road safety project
components and in the preparation of bidding documents and technical specifications.
36.        The proposed project sustained delays during preparation due to changes in
design, complications in preparing action plans to address the impact of resettlement, and
difficulty in securing government approvals and financing (including IBRD financing). Bank
experience in the highway sector shows that delays caused by these factors are not uncommon
and, if not resolved promptly, may seriously delay the implementation of civil works
components, typically resulting in cost overruns.  However, insistence by Government
authorities and the Bank on resolution of key issues prior to startup of this project should reduce
the risk of delays during implementation.
37.        Bank-wide experience also shows that there are risks of overly optimistic
estimates of traffic growth and diversion to the project road, key assumptions in estimating
project benefits. The economic evaluation for this project has considered scenarios with low
traffic growth, low diversion of traffic, and cost overruns. The project remains economically
viable over a wide variety of scenarios.
38.        There are also concerns that, in an attempt to accelerate the implementation of
works, undue emphasis may be placed on physical progress of works, with insufficient
attention to quality. The Bank's experience under the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Project led
to considerable emphasis being placed on construction quality, effectiveness of construction
supervision, and the adequacy of staffing and organization of implementing agencies during
project preparation. This emphasis will be maintained during supervision.
36.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it,
including retroactive financing of $26 million.

balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the doLLar and the SDR.
In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b) Credit fully disbursed.
