SECOND POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 1268-YDR)
PREFACE
1.      The projects consisted of the construction of two fuel-efficient
diesel generating stations and associated transmission and distribution
networks. The first (Wadi ladramawt) project, a 4x4 Kw installation at
Qaraw and the second (Second Power) project, a 3x2.2 MV installation at
Shehr formed key power sector investments by the Public Corporation for
Electric Power (PCEP) to support agricultural and domestic loads in the
Wadi Hadramawt valley and five towns east of Mukalla respectively.
2.      This Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle
East and North Africa Region, Country Department III, Industry and Energy
Division on the basis of staff appraisal reports, supervision reports and
other documents in IDA files and project completion data prepared by PCEP
as well as of information obtained during an IDA mission to Aden in
February-March, 1988.
3.        In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
OED sent copies of the draft report to the Borrower, the executing agency,
and the co-financier. No specific comments ou tle report were received.

PEOPLE'S DEKOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEWEN
WADI HADRAMAWT POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 829-YDR)
AND
SECOND POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 1268-YDR)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The project was to provide impetus to agricultural development in
Wadi !ladramuwt by electrifying 80 state farms and 325 cooperative deep
tubewell pumps for irrigation purposes in the Wadi area by erecting a 4x4
MW diesel generating plant and constructing about 1,000 Km of related
transmission and distribution networks. As the first stage of an
electrification scheme, the project was to (a) replace existing scattered
and inefficient power facilities, (b) supply power to a Ilarge number of new
consumers, and (c) upgrade the capabilities of PCEP.
2.        The project was completed nearly five years behind appraisal
schedule. The main cause for the delay was the slow growth in agricultural
loads compared to appraisal projections. This led PCEP to divert available
power to more domestic consumers. As appraised, 80X sales were slated for
agr'-industrial loads, however, as realized, nearly 601 sales are to
domestic consumers. This was a shift in project objectives. The objective
of providing impetus to agricultural development was only partially met.
Although higher domestic consumer tariffs did somewhat compensate PCEP for
delays, the additional revenues were not sufficiett to remoma a financial
strain on PCEP. The impact of the delays and financial condition of PCEP is
reflected in a lower economic rate of return of 52 realized as against 152
appraised.

WADI HADRAMALWT POWZR PROJECT (CREDIT 829-YDR)
AND
SECOND POWR PROJECT (CREDIT 1268-YDR)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The Second Power Project aimed at improving power supply to five
small towns and thirteen villages east of Mukalla, the second largest city
in PDRY and capital of Hadramawt Governerate. The project successfully (a)
replaced a large number of inefficient generators with a central and more
fuel-efficient, 6.6 MV power station; (b) erected a 165 Km network
(exceeding appraisal estimates) that reduced system losses; and (c) met
unsatisfied demand, connecting nearly 11,500 consumers (against 7,300 as
appraised).
2.        PCEP failed to meet the agreed financial performance targets
under the credit agreements. Essentially to achieve a break-even
performance by 1986, it was agreed that tariff increases would be
implemented in 1983. 1984 and 1985. While IDA insisted on the specified
timely increases, the Government sought to achieve break-even by other
means. In 1986, at IDA's suggestion PCEP commissioned a financial study to
determine measures required to improve PCEP's financial performance. The
study recommended a reform of fuel pricing policies, reduction of arrears
on accounts receivables as well as improvement in internal management.
These are under consideration by the Government. Their implementation is
being dealt with under the proposed Third Power Project.

WADI HADRAMAWT POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 829-YDB)
AND
SECOND POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 1268-YDR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.11     Since independence, PDR" '- emphasized long range economic
E r lopment objectives by broadening the base of a service-oriented economy
^r -d Aden, developing productive capacity of other economic sectors and
o<onmting investments in outlying regions. Together with agricultural
development in W&dI Hadramawt, fisheries development along the coast, and
road networks linking the interior with the coast, the two power projects
have supported Government plans by providing efficient and reliable
electric power replacing outdated and inefficient options available
earlier, to areas in Wadi Hadramawt and east of Mukalla.
1.02     In 1969, the Government established the Public Corporation for
Electric Power (PCEP) consolidating the erstwhile Aden Flectricity
Corporation and a multitude of mixed, municipal, private and governmental
utilities. Public power facilities in Aden, Abyan. Mukalla, and Sauyun
were gradually taken over. A seven member board reporting to the Ministry
of Industries was set up.
1.03     In early 1970s 902 of PCEP's total generating capacity was located
In Aden. Moreover, a sizable portion of transmission and distribution
lines, in early 19709, was also completed by PCEP with its own force
account. By late 19709 however, dearth of trained and qualified technical
staff had begun to affect PCEP operations. After the departure of
expatriates and change in Governmental policies, domestic load in Aden
declined substantially. Moreover given encouragement to agro-industries
etc. growth of power demand began taking place in outlying remote areas at
a much faster rate than for domestic consumers in Aden.



2-
1.04     Wadi Hadramawt, the largest agricultural region in PDRY, is
situated in the center of the country, 500 Km by air and 950 Km by road
from Aden. Its inhabitants, roughly 152 of PDRY's population, depended on
spate and ground waters for irrigation before commencement of the Project.
They used old and unreliable diesel pumps to lift water from 2,000 open and
100 deep wells. During 1970s, the Government, together with IDA, Kuwait
Fund and bilateral assistance was considering investments in agriculture
and transportation in Wadi Hadramawt. An earlier IDA credit (Cr. 560-YDR)
partly financed a highway linking Sawyun with Mukalla on the coast. Such
developments pointed to imminent increases in electric power demand -- the
Wadi had a total of 3.6 MV of installed capacity in 1978. While most of
this was supplied by scattered, under-utilized and inefficient diesel
units, only 1 MW belonged to PCEP. Twenty-four hours supply was only
conrected to 52 of the Wadi population. The Wadi Hadramavt Power Project
was evolved largely to alleviate this situation.
1.05     By early 1980s, installed capacity in PDRY had reached 108 MV.
Steam plants, gas turbines and diesel plants accounted for roughly 34, 13
and 61 MV respectively. An additional 64 MW was expected with the
commissioning of the station at Al Mansoura. Existing generating
facilities were old and fuel inefficient with frequent power failures and
low reserve margins. PCEP's transmission system comprised of 130 Km of 33
KV overhead lines and a 150 MVA transformer capacity. The Aden system,
comprised of 84U of PCEP's generation of 230 GWh in 1982, and 402 of this
served domestic households.
1.06     The need for training of PCEP staff was felt more than ever in
early 1980s. Specific needs were identified, for reviewing power subsector
development priorities as well as the bases for tariffs, especially when
government policies precluded PCEP from operating on a commercial basis.
Studies initiated under Wadi Hadramawt Power Project allowed IDA to engage
in a dialogue on PCEP's financial viability, tariffs, system planning,
management information systems and training. Recognizing these needs and
Government policy of providing investment and social amenities in rural
areas, the Second Power Project was developed. In addition to providing
for a more efficient and central diesel power station, it aimed at training
PCEP staff.
1.07     During implementation of both projects, PCEP went through
considerable financial difficulties and was unable to achieve the
financial objectives agreed under Cr. 829-YDR and subsequently revised
under Cr. 1268-YDR ( para 3.16). At IDA's suggestion PCEP engaged, in 1986,
consultants to study options for strengthening its financial operations.
These included increasing tariffs, reducing the input prices of diesel and
heavy fuel oil through concerted Government action, reducing arrears of
accounts receivables and undertaking internal management improvement
measures. The implementation of recommendations of the study is being
addressed under the Third Power Project.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin and Preiaration
2.01     The Association identified the Wadi Hadramawt Power Project in the
fifth Governorate in May 1976 when an energy sector mission visited PDRY
and recommended that the Government should arrange to have a feasibility
study carried out prior to this project. A preparation mission, in
February 1977, also visited the Arab Fund to discuss its interest and
potential involvement in the project. IDA granted a Project Preparation
facility (PPF) advance in March 1977 which enabled the Government to hire
engineering consultants to conduct a feasibility study. The terms of
reference were agreed with the Bank and the study was completed in August
1977. In November 1977 the Association appraised the project. Based or
discussions with IDA the consultants revised their draft report with
respect to irrigation loads, construction program and project costs.
2.02     By 1979, the GovernmentlPCEP concentrated their efforts in another
area (five towns east of Mukalla) in the fifth Governorate. The electric
supply in the area of *five towns east of Mukalla" was not continuous,
power failures were frequent and suppressed demand existed due to
inadequate capacity of isolated small diesel generators supplying
electricity in that area. Therefore, to satisfactorily meet the power
demand of this area, the GovernmentlPCEP expedited processing of a Second
Power Project. With the help of consultants (retained under a PPF
advance), PCEP completed a feasibility study and submitted it to the
association for its review and consideration. Initially, in early 1980,
PCEP had difficulties in providing adequate construction manpower for
installing transmission and di,tribution networks under the Wadi Hadramawt
Project (Cr. 829-YDR). Therefore, the identification mission (10180) for
the Second Power Project recommended a review of PCEP's manpower
development plan.
2.03     The GovernmentlPCEP subsequently evolved a manpower development
plan for PCEP, however PCEP's financial position continued to be
unsatisfactory. Furthermore, its financial performance could not be
properly evaluated as its Branch assets were not valued. To improve PCEP's
financial performance the Government re-examined a proposal for tariff
increases to enable PCEP to generate adequate resources to cover its total
operating expenses including interest and depreciation charges based on
revalued assets. Consequently, asset v&luation of PCEP's Branches and
training for PCEP's financial staff became prime concerns for financial
appraisal. The issues addressed by the IDA appraisal in October 1981
included: (a) revision of financial and investment plan, (b) elimination
of fuel subsidies, (c) staffing and manpower development plans of PCEP, and
(d) power subsector planning issues in the context of PDRY energy balance
and the overall sectoral policy.



2.04     Conditions for effectiveness of Cr. 829-YDR were: agreement on co-
financing arrangements, establishment of a project unit and hiring of
engineering and supervision consultants. The effectiveness of Cr.1268-YDR
was tied primarily to the finalization of co-financing arrangements. After
fulfilling the conditions of effectiveness, the two credits became
effective on 9118179 and 11l1183 after delays of ten months and two months
respectively compared to the planned dates of effectiveness.
Proiect Descriptions
2.05     As originally appraised the two projects covered the followings
(a) Credit 829-YDR -- A 16 (4x4) MW diesel power plant at Qaraw: 82
Km of wood pole transmission linest three 33111 XV sub-stations at
Qarasi, Al Qatn and Al Ghuraf; an 11 KV wood-pole distribution
network of about 580 Kin; about 500 1110.4 KV transformer stations
totalling about 20 MVA; a low voltage distribution network of
about 340 Km; meters and service connections for about 7,500
consumers; overseas training for management and staff of PCEP;
training materials and equipments and tariff and power development
studies.
(b) Credit 1268-]MR -- A 6.6 (3x2.2) MW diesel power station at
Shehr; 84 Km of 33 KV and 11 Km of 11 KV overhead transmission
lines; six 33/11 XV substation transformers totalling 10.5 MVA;
about 146 11/0.4 KV distribution transformers totalling 8,400 KVA;
about 51 Km of 11 KV and 48 Km of low voltage distribution lines;
meters and service connections for about 7,300 consumers; vehicles
for transporting network construction equipmentg and overseas
training for management and tecbnical staff of PCEP.
Proiect Objectives
2.06     In line with overall regional equity, social and rural development
objectives in PDRY, the two projects aimed at improving regionally diverse
power systems. More specifically, in Wadi Hadramawt Power Project, the
main objective was to assist the government in improving the agricultural
productivity by electrification of deep tubewells in the Wadi Hadramawt
Region. In addition projected growth in domestic and other demrnd was to
be provided for. Moreover given the power sector development and
investment plans for 1978-83, another objective was to financially recover,
over and above operating expenses, a margin for PCEP to provide for future
investment. The Second Power Project was primarily designed to replace
existing independent generating sets in five towns by a central and more
efficient power station, reducing system losses and meeting unsatisfied
demand. Furthermore, the objectives of building PCEP's capabilities as an
institution to technically, administzatively, and financially undertake
greater sectoral responsibilities over time, were common to both projects.



Changes in ?roiect Scope
2.07     Both projects involved some changes in scope during
implementation. In Cr. 829-YDR, due to the slow growth in connecting
irrigation loads, the unutilized installed capacity vas redirected to
servicing domestic consumption, rather than agro-industrial consumption as
envisaged in the original scope of the project. This entailed extending
the network to 110 villages (electrified by May 1985) in addition to the 51
villages (electrified by May 1984) originally included in the scope of the
project.
Under Cr. 1268-YDR the scope of the project was also expanded to
include more service connections than appraised. This implied increasing
RV transformer installations (to 13 MVA from 10.5 appraised), decreasing
distribution transformers tto 73 of 7150 KVA capacity from 146 of 8400 EVA
capacity as appraised) and ultimately providing 11,500 service connections
in 1987 as against 7,300 as appraised. The distribution network increased
by 662 over the 100 Km network as appraised.
MII. DIMPLEMENTATION
Physical Imolementation
3.01     Both projects took more time to complete than appraised.  Credit
829-YDR was granted three extensions of one year each, and Credit 1268-YDR
three extensions totalling one year. Tables 3.1 and 3.2 show the appraised
and actual completion dates of major components of the two projects.
Credit 829-YDR (Wadi Hadramawt Power Prolect)
3.02     The appraisal estimated completion by end of 1983.  This target,
in retrospect, was unrealistic. It was optimistic in assessing PCEP's
capabilities largely due to its being the first IDA operation in the power
sector. The following reasons mainly account for the delays in completion
of the project componentss
(a) Delays in agricultural loading;
(b) Delayed credit effectiveness;
(c) Award of supply contracts;
(d) Shortage of construction manpower.



-6_
Delays in Agricultural Loading
3.03     This is the main reason for delay in the Wadi ladramswt Project.
It was largely due to a lack of adequate co rdination between PCEP and the
Ministry of Agriculture.  The Government, at IDA's requests provided
detai's of a drilling program. This was taken as satisfactorY evidence of
the firmness of the drilling program and government's commitment to carry
it out. In fact, as it turned out, the drilling program was not very firm.
Drilling and pump installations proceeded exceedingly slowly.1 After pumps
were installed PCEP procured transformers to match their sizes. Power
factor improvement and reduction of line losses required capacitors to fit
the electric pump motors. Thus delayed installation of pumps was usually
linked to a series of delays. Further. the fuel oil tank facility at the
port of Al Xhalf was completed three years later than scheduled therefore
PCEP had to burn costlier fuel oil at the Qaraw power stations. To
compound this, subsidies were available to cooperatives for purchasing
diesel oil at 400 fils/gallon when PCEP paid 477 fils/gallon, in 1982.
This coupled with under utilization of capacity resulting in higher fixed
costs per KWh strongly affected competitiveness of electric pumping against
its diesel alternative. Further, in a few cases advance paymentwas
required from cooperatives towards the costs of drilling deep tubewells.
The cooperative were unable to pay this. Thus, cooperatives had little
incentives to opt for electric pumping. PCEP then attempted to compensate
the loss in pumping load by increasing bousehold demand and thereby more
fully utilizing capacity. But this, in effect, was a shift in the
project's objectives.2
1/ The appraised load forecast assumed that '40 tubewells will be drilled
in 1978 and 52 wells/year will be drilled until 1983 and increasing to
63 wells/year until the end of 1986 ...... By 1986 a total of 514
irrigation pumps would be connected to the central grid.' The
appraisal assumed that by 1983, 80 state farms and 325 cooperative deep
tubewell pumps would take electric supply, however, by 1988, only 80
state farm deep tubewells and 77 cooperative deep tubewells had been
connected.
2/ Correspondingly, 11,500 services connections, against 7,300 appraised,
and 106 Km LV lines against 48 Km appraised were installed by early
1988.

b!   Even though the power station is commissioned and operating, the contractor for
power station works has gone to arbitration regarding rejection of additional
payment claiAs by PCEP.
The central thrust of Credit-829 was to provide for more efficient
agricultural pumping operations. It was appraised that agro-industrial
loads would consume 80 of the generation. Eventually domestic consumers
now take up 602 of electricity sales. The Government decided to extend the
network to electrify villages in addition to the 51 appraised and even
thouh p80 itate farm deep tubewell pumps had been connected only 77
cooperative pumps were in place at the beginning of 1988.
Delayed Credit Effectiveness
3.04     During appraisal it was agreed that signing of loan agreements
between the Government and other external co-financiers (covering the
remaining foreign costs of the Project -- US$ 14.5 million from the Arab
Fund and US$ 5.5 million from Islamic Development Bank) would be a
condition for effectiveness. The Arab Fund manAgement approval for the
project came by mid-1979 and subsequently the Islamic Development Bank
processed its request using IDA and Arab Fund appraisals, resulting in ten
months delay in effectiveness.

Award -of SUPDL  Contracts
3.05     As envisaged in the appraisal, all procurement contracts were to
be finalized and awarded by November 1978. Excepting equipment for
constructing overhead lines (bids for which were evaluated as late as
August 1980). coutracts for all equipamnt were awarded only by December
1979. This was partly due to the unfamiliarity of PCIP and its consultants
with the Association's procuremont procedures. initially. Moreover. since
(a) PCVW was in process of revising its manpower and project Implementation
scheduleg (b) the Mukalla-Swyun road construction was delayed; and (c)
supply for equipment and materials was postponed for a few months at PC!P's
instance, the power station schedule slipped ultimately.
Shortage of  0onstruction ManDower
3.06     At appraisal, PCEP's proposal to carry out the installation of the
transmission and distribution network was accepted. It met the following
criteria: (a) size of job and remoteness of site could limit competition.
(b) departmental forces being more efficient than other means, tc) the
project's execution would not entail a large pernmannt addition to the work
force, and td) excess capacity of manupwer in PCEP would allow such a task
to be undertaken without much additional cost. the Association agreed with
PCEP to include, a project unit led by an ezperienced full time engineer
with experience In network construction assisted by a consultant, as a
condition of credit effectiveness. Although the project was declared
effective with the appointment of key project unit staff PCEP had
difficulties in mobilizing skilled and unskilled staff requlred for the
construction of the transmission and distribution network. Its proposal to
assign the task to & foreign contractor was pursued by the Govermnat but
foreigp financing {expected up to US$ 10 million) was unavailable.
increasing PCEP's technical staff moderately and leaving expatriates to do
the work was expected to cost US$ 4 million at least. Once the Government
assigned national priority to the project, it was possible to mobilize
manpower to execute the project. In this connection the Association
offered to finance a broader and longer term manpower development plan
which was to provide an assessment not only for Immediate technical
staffing needs but for administrative, financial and other skills required
for existing and planned operations of PCIP. Accordingly, PCEP appointed
consultants to study its short and long term training needs.3 The
Association reviewed the study and agreed to provide funds to meet the
foreign exchange requirements of the first stage (crash training program)
required to meet PCEP's near term training requirements.
31 Funding for the study was provided by a grant from the French
Government.



- 10 -
3.07     By late 1980 an administrative unit was formed in Wadi with a
counterpart unit at PCEP in Aden. Route alignment and initial works
started and work was initiated without an organized action plan.
Meanwhile, due to difficulties by PCEP in the initial stage of project
implementation. PCEP in agreement with the Association arranged for on-site
training for its staff with British Electricity Interational. Given this
background, a preliminary revised implementation schedule was provided by
PCEP to the Association in June 1981. The next six months saw the
establishment of the site unit, line erection work start up, and physical
completion of civil works and installation of power plant.
Credit 1268 - YDR (Second Power Proiect)
3.08     Delays in the projects implementation were due to a number of
factors. Initially there Was a financing gap for the power station
component funded by OPEC due to the price of the lowest evaluated
responsive bidder being higher than the engineer's estimates. Only after
the Arab Fund agreed to bridge the gap advance payments could-be made to
the power station contractor. The staff of the contractor experienced
delays in obtaining visas. Consequently, the excavation work vere slowed
down. A decision to complete excavatians for a fourth unit (ft,includeO
in the project) delayed the opening of letters of credit, agisUvt'ather
contracts. The delivery of equipment, which was on the crii4cal path took
more time. Finally the distribution network was extended snt the nuaber of
service connections were increased. The following, however, are the main
reasons for implementation delays in this project:
(a) Delays in tariff increases;
(b) Delays in PCEP staff training;
,e) Delays in contract awards.
Delays in Tariff Increases
3.09     As discussed in the section on fliancial perforriance, tariff
increases to recover the operating expenses of PCEP Were not undertaken in
a timely manner.4  Together with delayed submission of branih accounts
(para 3.10) these caused a breakdown in IDA's dialogue with the
GovernmentlPCEP and considerably delayed projeet supervisions. Indirectly
this delayed project implementation. The impasse was broken with an
agreement to conduct a Financial Study, c,'ipletion of whichw as scheduled
by October 1986. However because of the political disturbances in January
1986 and fire in PCEP's accounts department during the disturbances PCEP
delayed signing of the consultancy contract for the study. Moreover, the
consultants could not adhere to their work program schedule and this study
could only be completed by April 1987. Discussions between IDA and PCEP
were further delayed until November 1987.
41 Though not directly related to project delays, IDA's telex (11123183)
urging PCEP to advise bidders of a possibility that IDA financing may
not be available if the tariff issue was not satisfactorily resolved,
led to delays in processing tenders.



- 11 -
Delays in PCEP Staff Training
3.10     Delays in implementation of the techaical assistance for training
PCEP's staff vere due to the revision of the subcomponent. Originally
training abroad of PCEP's staff accounted for 702 of the cost of the
training of subcouponent while the training equipment represented the
balance 30Z. The training subcomponent was later revised to include crash
training program (para 3.06) recommended by the consultants. The
Association agreed to provide about US$ 0.83 million to cover the foreign
exchange requirement of the program urgently needed by PCEP. However, due
to initial delayst (i) in-finalizing terms of reference for the training
consultancy services, (i.) in the Government's approval for the local
funding required for the program, (iii) due to political disturbances in
January 1986, the contract for the consultancy services was only signed by
end of 1986. Thereafter, the consultants prepared the bid documents for
the training equipment and since then only one bid was received, PCEP had
difficulties in finalizing the contract award even though the Association
had given its "no objection" in November 1987. Later, in view of the
importance of training the accounts were kept open only for a period of six
months up to June 30, 1988 after the credit closing date (extended thrice)
of December 31, 1987, the Association even agreed for 100? advance payment
PCEP obtaining appropriate security from the contractor for the training
equipment. However, the contract remains to be signed (as of June 23,
1988) since the contractor is likely to be declared bankrupt in the French
court. The training consultants, h wever, agreed to take over the
responsibility of supplying the t.rtining equipment within the same contract
price. Till the revised contraot is finalized the Association, on an
exceptional basis, has agreed to keep the accounts open for a further
period of 3 months up to September 30, 1988.
Delays in Contract Awards
3.11     It was appraised that the power station contract would be awarded
by January 1983. This was, however, done in July 1983 only after the
financing gap for the power station component was bridged by the Arab Fund.
Accordingly the completion for commissioning of the power station was
revised to September 1985 which was an ambitious estimate by PCEP compared
to the Consultants' estimate of completion in November 1985. The award of
supply contracts were relatively smoother. However at PCEP's request the
delivery of materials was deferred to September 1984 to allow the network
contractor to get established before arrival of materials. The network
erection contract was awarded before the contractor proceeded with detailed
soil investigations. Because the contractor had experienced a slow
mobilization of site works and had underestimated the amount of rocks the
two phases of the contract finished in April - May 1987 as against
contractually planned in the middle of 1985.

Protect Costs
3.12     Annex tables 1 and 2 cor;, re the detailed coat estimates at
appraisal with the revised5 estib4k-ed cost of the project. In the case of
Cr.829-YDR total estimated project costs of US$ 38.55 million exceeded the
appraisal estimate by about 361 mainly due to the slow agricultural load
growth in the project region and electrification of additional villages to
ensure full utilization of the 16 aV installed generating capacity. In
Cr.1268-YDR the increase of about 222 was mainly due to the increased power
station costs (para 3.08) and additional distribution networks including
service convections required for meeting the increased consuomr demand in
the  five town region* during the period of du.ay in prs,ject
implementation. This was largely borne by the infusion of additional funds
from the Arab Fund. Under Cr.829-YDR the increases in cost can be largely
attributed to project delays and the extension of the electrical network to
the additional villages and the town of Gasim. Under Cr.1268-YDR the
largest increase came in the engineering and supervision contracts. This
cost overrun of approxlmately US 4.0 million was quite predictable even at
as the project began since the lowest and most responsive bid received for
the power station contract was roughly 402 higher than that appraised.
This initial increase was covered by Arab Fund assistance. Table 3.3 below
shows this in the context of the financing plans

DIsbursements
3.13 For Credit 829-ThR# delays in implementation of the power station
and transmission and distribution components resulted in delays in
disbursements against components funded by the Association by a period of
two years (from end of 1982 to the end of 1984). As regards technical
assistance subcomponent for training, disbursements were slow for reasons
given in pars 3.10. The balance amount of US$ 0.63 million (IA of June 17,
1988) in the credit is tow estimate4 to be fully disbursed by September 30.
1988. Annex tables 3 and 5 give further details.
3.14     For Credit 1268-YDRs the slow disbursements up to June 30, 1986
are due to the mutual agreement with the GovernmentlPCEP (during 1984) not
to send withdrawal applications to the Association except those for tua
engineering consultants since PCEP was in default of the financial
covenants regarding agreed tariff increases. During the period 1984 to
June 1986, the GovernmentIPCEP made payments to the contractors according
to the contracts. However. only after the tariff issues was resolved by
end of June 1986 and the credit closing date was extended by one year to
December 31, 1986, did PCEP submit withdrawal applications to IDA against
payments made to contractors. Therefore by end of September 1986, the
credit was fully disbursed two and a half months ahead of the credit
closing date. Anmex tables 4 and 6 give further details.

Operating Performance
3.15     As discussed in paras 1.05 and 1.06, PCEP's operations have
steadily increased in scope and magnitude over the last ten years. It's
engineering operations developed largely during the Second Power Project.
Barring a few instances of delays, the current performance of the power
system is indicative of the success with the force account method of
project implementation. The Wadi system is fully loaded and the idle
station capacity issue is no longer a problem Table 3.5 shows its
operating performance. Since 1983, peak demand grew at 132, generation at
17S and sales at 20S and operating targets for 1983 set in the SAR were all
met by 1987-88. There have been no significant problems in operation and
maintenance of the Wadi system. Initial indications of operations at
Shehr power station suggest no technical problems. Minor loss reduction
and load dispatch problems in the PCEP wide system are being encountered
and these are being addressed in the proposed Third Power Project.

Financial Performance
3.16     Under Cr.829-YDR, the Government and PCEP agreed with IDA that
PCEP's financial objectives were the achievement of break-even performance
in 1980, 22 rate of return (on revalued assets) in 1981 increasing steadily
to 86 in 1985. Interim targets for 1982, 1983 and 1984 were to be
discussed with the Association. However, PCEP was unable to achieve agreed
targets for the following reasons:



- 15 -
(a)    Increases in Domestic Fuel Prices: At the time of signing
Cr. 829-YDR (1979), domestic fuel prices were substantially
below international levels. The Government was concerned
that the low energy prices encouraged excessive consumption
of energy products. To restrain the growth of energy
consumption by encouraging demand management and
conservation measures and to reduce the impact of energy
consumption on the import bill, in 1980 the Government
doubled the prices of the main energy products to all
consumers including PCEP. Another small increase was also
implemented in lP31.  The impact on PCEP was to
dramatically increase its fuel costs, from about 442 of its
total revenues in 1979 to about 105X in 1981.
(b)    Increases in Salaries and Pension Contributions:  In 1981
the Government mandated salary increases of about 24Z. In
1979 the Government introduced a requirement for public
sector agencies to contribute an amount equivalent to 202
of their employees salaries to an employee pension fund.
The percentage contribution was subsequently reduced to 152
in 1981.
(c)    Inadequate Tariff Adiustments:  PCEP increased its tariffs
in September and November 1981 and again in January 1982.
The three increases amounted to about a 392 average tariff
increase within a year and raised the average tariff from
25.0 fils to about 34.75 fils per kWh. However, these
increases were not adequate to compensate for the increases
in fuel and other costs to enable PCEP to meet its revenue
requirements. The Government had to provide a fuel oil
subsidy in 1980 and 1981 to help PCEP to meet its accounts
payable. The Government also agreed to provide PCEP with
operating subsidies to cover accumulated losses up to the
end of 1982 and for each year thereafter.
3.17     By the time Cr. 1268-YDR was appraised, it had become clear for
the reasons outlined above, that the financial objectives agreed under Cr.
829-YDR could not be achieved. The GovernmentIPCEP and IDA agreed on a
revised financial plan which was interded to restore PCEP's financial
health. The basic objective was that PCEP was to achieve break-even
performance in 1986 (i.e. generate revenues from its operations adequate to
cover its total operating costs including depreciation on revalued assets
and interest chargeable to operations). This was to be achieved by average
tariff increases on 102 in 1983, and 152 in 1984 and 1985, and also the
Government was to fund the foreign exchange costs of PCEP's investment
program through equity contributions with the exception of the foreign
exchange costs of the Second Power Project. At the same time, the fuel
subsidy to PCEP was to be gradually withdrawn and comp.etely phased-out by
1985.



- 16 -
3.18     PCEP's actual financial performance for the period 1982-86 did not
meet the revised objectives. Table 3.6 below sumarsized the key data and
performance indicators for the period. Detailed financial statements are
shown in Annex Tables 7, 8, and 9.
3.19     The results show marked variations from year to year for several
reasons. The low rate of return (negative 6Z) in 1982 reflects the
continuing impact of the doubling of fuel products prices in 1980 plus
another small increase in 1981, and the 242 increase in wages and salaries
in 1981. The higher rate of return (negative 1S) in 1983 was due to a
robust increase in sales (about 152) and a sales mix reflecting an increase
In higher priced commercial and industrial sales. However, PCEP was not
able to implement a 102 average tariff increase in that year as agreed
under Cr. 1268-YDR. The further improvements in the rate of return in 1984
and 1985 resulted from tariff increases of about 62 and 102 in those years
respectively. These increases were less than the 152 in each of 1984 and
1985 that had been agreed. The decline in performance in 1986 resulted
from a fall in sales and revenues caused by the political disturbances in
that year and economic conditions since 1982.

- 17 _
3.20     As there was no tariff increase in 1983 and the increases in 1984
and 1985 were less than those which had been anticipated, their impact on
PCEP's financial position was negligible and it became apparent that PCEP
would not achieve break-even in 1986. In addition, when oil prices fell on
the international market in early. 1986, the Government did not adjust the
cost of fuel to PCEP. As a result, these prices remained about 1.5 times
and twice the internaticnal level for fuel and diesel oil respectively.
Thus the high cost of fuel became a burden on PCEP's finances. Further,
projections of PCEP's future financial perfomance was complicated by the
expected commissioning of the Hiswa power and water desalination assets
whose capital and operating costs were difficult to estimate. The
Government also felt that the Bank's insistence on tariff increases was too
simplistic and that it was necessary to fully investigate the scope for
cost-reduction measures within PCEP. Therefore, in 1986, the Government
and IDA agreed to amend Cr. 1268-YDTR and to require PCEP to conduct a
financial study with the basic objective of finding ways and means of
improving PCEPI's financial performance. The study was completed in April
1987 and IDA and the Government/PCEP discussed its findings in November
1987. The main recommendations of the financial study were that (a) the
prices of heavy fuel oil and diesel oil charged to PCEP should be reduced
to their international equivalents; (b) PCZP should reach an agreement with
the Government on reduction of arrears of accounts receivables due from
Government and public sector agencies; (c) efforts should be made to reduce
network losses from current level on 182 to about 122 by 1995; and (d) PCEP
should improve its cost control performance through implementation of
adequate budgeting and costing systems.
3.21     The Government 1CEP are generally in agreement with the
recomuendations of the consultants for the financial study. With regard to
the pricing of fuel products [(a) above,], the Government has directed MEM,
PCEP, and the Yemen National Oil Company (YNOC) to prepare a report for
submission to the Supreme Council of Ministers by June 1988, recoureAding
to the Government the basis for future pricing of fuel oil to PCEP.
Ongarding reduction of PCEP's arrears of accounts receivables from the
,.vernment and public sector agencies l(b) above), discussions are underway
between PCEP and the Government. The consultants recommendation to reduce
network losses to about 122 by 1995 t(c) above], is fully appreciated by
PCEP and its 1986-91 investment program includes the necessary investments
to that date. Regarding improvements in cost control perfomnance t(d)
above], PCEP is currently in the process of implementing computer-based
financial and cost accounting systems and developing a budgetary system
based on pre-set operational standards.
Institutional Performance
3.22     PCEP is still institutionally weak.  As discussed in paragraphs
1.06 through 1.07, the development of PCEPI' institutional capabilities
took place largely during 1982-1986. IDA's involvement in the two
projects, suggests that shortages of qualified staff, skilled and unskilled
did affect project implementation but PCEP managed to meet its



- 18 -
institutional commitments. In 1981, of the 2,000 staff, there were sixteen
qualified engineers. However, under training program 34 engineers, 22
technicians and one accountant had been sent abroad for training. From a
small institution initially, through the execution of Wadi Hadramawt Power
Project (Cr.829-YDR), PCEP had established that with complementary training
it could keep up with the institutional responsibility of the development
program that it undertook. However, as technical capacity grew, networks
also expanded. To exercise financial control, PCEP staff had to be trained
in accounting. This had become one of the key concerns of staffing in the
appraisal of the Second Power Project. Delays in closing accounts and
reporting on financial performance throughout the execution of the two
projects are indicative of the problem manifesting itself widely. With
increases in the installed capacity, systems planning and operations and
maintenance responsibilities of PCEP had started overwhelming the staff.
Overall, it can be safely assessed that while technical managerial and
operational capabilities of PCEP have grown tremendously over the last ten
years, the expansion in its mandate has, on the balance, demanded a
commensurate performance.
3.23     At the end of the two projects further assistance stands warranted
in institutional matters. PCEP's current operations indicate weaknesses in
in-house generation skills, routine operations and maintenance functions,
technical wing of planning operations and system planning apparatus. The
accounting functions, in spite of the recent clearance of a back-log of
accounting work, remain weak and require excessive top management
involvement. Training in these areas will allow better practices to be
institutionalized at the working levels. Furthermore, PCEP's present
salary structure which follows that of the Government is unable to attract
adequately qualified staff and a number of organizational functions remain
unstaffed.
3.24     PCEP is fully aware and recognizes these institutional issues.
Earlier, as the burden of force account construction could only enable on-
the-job training, while external training proved institutionally very
costly, an effective training strategy could not be followed. With IDA's
assistance, the first phase of the crash training program was initiated
under Cr-829. It arranged for the above mentioned external training.
However, it emerged that even along with funds from Cr-1268, the second
phase of the project could not be undertaken, Consultants are attempting
to agree on an comprehensive terms of reference and the training is
scheduled to be implemented under the Third Project. Other specific
proposals for developing PCEP's institutional capabilities are being
incorporated in designing the Third Power Project.

IV. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
4.01     Economic rates of return for the two projects have been
recalculated using the same methodologies as at appraisal. However costs
and benefits stand revised on the basis of available data. Actual project
related expenditures have been used by deflating8 the capital costs in
nominal prices to 1987 prices in both cases. Operations and maintenance
costs are estimated using appraisal assumptions. Fuel costs, adjusted for
transportation costs in 1987 prices are used to establish total cost
streams. Since no household energy consumption statistics were available.
a re-evaluation of benefits from domestic fuel savings was not done.
Appraisal estimates are evaluated as being conservative an4, therefore.
have been used in both cases. In the case of Wadi Hadramawt Power Project
the slow loading in irrigation pumps, the general delay in project
implementation and the impact of increased domestic consumption have been
reflected by fuel savings as percentage of fuel costs. It is assumed that
since along with agricultural loads, more domestic consumption is also
being served than that appraised, savings can be realized only in later
years. Starting in 1988 therefore gradually fuel savings are lower than,
and later equal fuel costs to reflect their enhanced economic value. Other
details of this calculations are shown in Annex Tables 10 and 11. Based on
these assumptions the re-estimated economic rates of return compare with
appraisal estimates as followss

Wadi Hadramawt Power Project    152          5.OZ
Second Power Project            13S          12.6S
4.02     In the case of Wadi Hadramawt Power Project the economic return is
substantially lower than appraised   This is largely due to the
implementation delays that brought benefits relatively later after capital
investments were made. Furthermore, the pattern in which these benefits
were realized was also skewed towards later years.
4.03     While the Second Power Project also suffered from delays, larger
capital expenditures were made in later years of project implementation.
This allows a conclusion that it is less costly to delay execution before
incurring expenditure for projects than after. Moreover, initial
performance of Shehr Power Station is very efficient and losses are low.
The sales forecasts of consultant studies are optimistic primarily because
more network and service connections are in place than appraised.

V. LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSIONS
Performance of IDA and the Borrower
5.01     Th( Wadi Hadramawt Power Project suffered from delays in credit
effectiveness, problems of coordination between PCEP and the Ministry of
Agriculture and an optimistic assessment of its drilling program which
failed to materialize as appraised. There are two important lessons to be
learnt from its experience. First, IDA's project appraisal was premature.
At appraisal, the ground-water potential was not fully known. Based on the
Government's planned extraction rates an optimistic drilling program was
evolved. Assurances of its timely completion formed the bases for the load
forecast which did not finally materialize. This resulted in a changed
network configuration and increased costs. Second, when seen in the context
of operations in the EMENA Region, the tariff covenants in Credit-829 were
quite unrealistic. Even an early supervision (November, 1980) indicated
that "strict compliance with section 4.03 of Project Agreement 829-YDR,
which requires PCEP to increase its rate of return from 2Z in 1981 to 8? in
1985 could lead to an immediate tariff increase of inappropriate
magnitude.i
5.02     The Second Power Project suffered from cost overruns, disagreement
with Government on measures required for PCEP to comply with the financial
covenants and consequent slow disbursements. This experience is further
instructive in two cases. First  a more specific one, the project gained
Board approval before bids were opened. If the lowest bid, which was well
above appraisal estimates, was known before Board approval, the cost
ramifications could have been addressed more expediently. Second, more
generally, there was a strong case for using breakeven criteria as a
financial -ovenant rather than the dated tariff increase that were implied
by it. The SAR of the Second Power Project recognizes that financial
objectives under Credit-829 were not realizable. Still, an Intermediate
requirement of specific tariff increases by stipulated dates was
covenanted, and later strictly applied, when the objective all along was
breakeven performance. This objective has now been highlighted in
appraising the Third Power Project.
5.03     In general, IDA's assistance to the power sector of PDRY has
considerably improved the institutional capabilities of PCEP. However, it
still remains weak. Given its expanded role and greater responsibilities,
as well as shortages of skilled staff, PCEP still has difficulties in
efficiently mAnaging its generation, transmission and distribution
facilities. A comparision of methods of installation -- force account in
Cr. 829-YDR and by contractor in Cr. 1268-YDR -- indicates that delays in
implementation of installation activities were comwon to both. On the
other hand, after initial delays, PCEP was better organized (Cr. 829-YDR)
and could smoothly carry out the installation of additional transmission
and distribution networks for electrification of additional villages and
could provide experienced staff for operation and maintenance of its
facilities for its Wadi Hadramawt Branch . The installation contractor for
Cr. 1268-YDR, in spite of experience in installation, took considerable



_ 21 -
time to settle down and experience considerable implementation delays.
Total dependence on one method of installation is not advisable for power
utilities which continuously need trained staff to staff its growing
operations. Further assistance to PCEP in improving its implementation and
managerial capabilities is necessary and forms a premise in appraisal of
the proposed Third Power Project.
5.04     The Association's involvement in these two projects focusses
particular attention to the role IDA should adopt when energy prices are
used as tax instruments by borrowers. More so, as seen in Credits 829 and
1268, even though Government provided PCEP subsidies during 1980-1982, in
the net, gon -'ment was taxing the electricity consumers. Any more tariff
increases would ultimately exacerbate this burden on consumers and add to
economy wide distortions. As recognized in the context of the Second Power
Project, it is important to maintain flexibility in project covenants in
order to exercise the Association's responsibility to give policy advice
when energy prices are above economic levels and are used as instruments of
tax policy. Excessive intervention in energy pricing by Governments is the
norm in a lot of countries. It is, therefore, important that project
covenants support economic objectives of pricing resources to avoid
misallocations.
Lessons Learned
5.05     The experience of these projects indicates the importance of
sectoral coordination, both by the borrower and by IDA. PCEP's operations
were largely affected by agricultural sector's delayed drilling program;
petroleum subsector's delayed installation of fuel tank facilities; water
subsector's excessive installed capacity at the Hiswa desalination plant
(now being addressed in the proposed Third Power Project). These were
primarily due to lack of a coordinated approach within the Government
ministries. However, IDA had ongoing operations in these sectors also and
a thorough inter-sectoral coordination was lacking, particularly in Cr.
829-YDR vis a via the drilling program. Therefore, it is essential that in
projects such as this one where project investments and revenues are
substantially dependent on a single group of consumers, the project
appraisal should go much deeper in assessing the firmness of the demand
projections. Greater inter-sectoral coordinat'.on both in the country and
IDA is a must in rjuch situations.
5.06     The Association should maintain flexibility in determining whether
project covenants are being met keeping in view the underlying objectives.
Increasing tariffs or decreasing fuel prices to PCEP would have both
entailed breakeven performance and economic pricing of electricity, thus
fulfilling the objective of efficient pricing underlying the financial
covenants. It was, thus, important that breakeven performance should have
been accepted rather than requJring specific tariff increases as covenanted
which would have increased taxation of electricity consumers. IDA's
approach in The Third Power Project incorporates this.

(a) Total project costs ectually expended. Does not include power developme_nt
study and training. Only engineering studies related to project execution
are included. Data from PCEP in current prices. Deflated by index composed
of 80S international and 202 domestic inflation to represent at constant
1987 prices.
Jb) Assumed equal to 2S of capital costs as in appraisal.
c Uses 1987 prices of heavy fuel (51.32 YD T) after 1985 and diesel (102.31 YDJT)
before 1985 at a consmption rate of .252 TIMVh and transportation costs
estimated at 11.68 YDIT. Average is used for 1987.
(d) Energy sales data from Table 4.2 "Generation and Sales 1980-85', PCR, 1987
and rass.ion estimates for preappraisal of Power ITI.
Ie) Estimated at 1987 prices ot .49 Fils/KWh.
(f) Puel savings in Vadi have been approximated as percentages of total fuel
consumption in Cc) given the slow loading of irrigation pumps and the
general delays in project implementation. SAR estimates sug est that
about 24Z higher savings could have been achieved by 1984. Lue to delayed and
insufficient loading, Cis has been moderated to equal the fuel consumption and that
too by 1986. This too is an optimistic assumption.

Notess
(a) Total project costs actually expended. Data from PCEP in current prices deflated
by index composed of SOZ international and 20S domestic inflation to represent
costs at 1987 prices. Rehabilitation investments in later years in proportion
to those in appraisal.
(b) Assed equal to 1.5  of capital investment to approximate appraisal assumptions.
(c From staff estimates for pre-appraisal of Power 1II. Operating data for
Shehr power station available only for one year.
Cd) Staff estimates from Power III pre-appraisal.
e  Staff estimates from Power III pre-appraisal.
(f) and (g) No adjustment to SAR assumptions, even for change in year since
household consumption estimates could not be developed. Moreover, since
service connections have exceeded appraisal estimates by more than 50S
and domestic fuel prices have doublad during 1981-87 vis-a-vis the
international prices their benefits have Increased in economic terms.
