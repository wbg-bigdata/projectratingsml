CHAPTER I
I. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
1.01     Management:  The Public Corporation for Electric Power (PCEP) is
governed by a board of eight members who, with the exception of the
representative of the Ministry of Industry, are PCEP's staff. The chairman of
the board is also the chief executive of PCEP (Annex 1.1). The board is more
of a management committee than a policy-making body and has very little
leverage on important matters which, as a matter of policy, are always
referred to the Government and the Politburo.
1.02     Staffing:  The shortage of skilled and semi-skilled labor is one of
the biggest development constraints in The People's Democratic Republic of
Yemen (PDRY). This shortage affects Project implementation and the operation
and maintenance of existing assets. In the case of PCEP, substantial progress
has been made to overcome this bottleneck. At the time of the appraisal of
the First Power Project (1978), PCEP had 16 qualified engineers and the
existing training center was conducting essentially theoretical courses as
virtually no training equipment existed.  Manpower development has been the
cornerstone of the Association's involvement in the power subsector and more
than 10% of the first IDA Credit was allocated to training and purchase of
training equipment. A training program has been developed and is being
implemented (57 employees have been sent abroad for training comprising 34
engineers, 22 technicians and 1 accountant), a new training center with
training equipment financed by the Association is under construction at Al
Mansoura Power Station and additional staff have been recruited (the number of
qualified engineers has more than doubled during the last 4 years--1978-81).
1.03     To attract scarce technical staff, PCEP has also designed a system of
inducement to its staff engaged in the operation and maintenance of generating
stations and networks. Despite all of this, there subsists staffing problems
in key areas. System planning is weak for lack of qualified staff. The
technical wing of the planning section needs to be reinforced; the section
head and his assistant need urgent training abroad in system planning and
rural electrification. Similarly, the head of the training department and his
deputy, who would form the nucleus of the future training institute at Al
Mansoura, should be sent abroad for training. Delays are experienced in
closing the accounts for lack of qualified staff in the accounting
department. PCEP is placing heavy emphasis on training in this area. The
designated Deputy Chief Accountant is being trained abroad under the existing
Credit. Training abroad is needed also for 4 section chiefs in the accounting
department. Upon return of the Deputy Chief Accountant, the Chief Accountant,
who is competent and hard working, would undertake a one year course in the UK
to obtain a MA in Accountancy as envisaged in the First Power Project. (He
could not be released earlier for lack of suitable replacement during his
absence). Furthermore, PCEP intends to hire three expatriates to work in the
corporation during the absence of the Chief Accountant and provide on-the-job
training for bookkeepers. The manpower development would be pursued in the



proposed Project through provision of funds for training abroad (about 15
staff-years) and technical advice on the training program. PCEP has agreed to
prepare and submit for the approval of the Association, detailed description
of all proposed fellowships.
1.04     Existing Facilities and ODerations;  PDRY's installed generation
capacity is about 108 MW consisting of 34 MW of steam plants, 13 MW of gas
turbines and 61 MW of diesel plants (see Annex 1.2).  PCEP controls about 76%
of this total, and its output accounts for 64% of total generated units.
PCEP's installed capacity in Aden includes 13 MW of steam plant, 13 MW of gas
turbines and 36.8 MW of diesel plants. A diesel power station, which is under
construction and is expected to be commissioned this year, will provide an
additional 64 MW (8x8). The existing generating facilities are old and very
fuel-inefficient, system losses including generation station energy
consumption are high (23%); power failures are frequent and the reserve margin
is only 12%. PCEP's transmission system comprises about 130 km of 33 kV
overhead lines and 150 MVA power transformer capacity. Sales of electricity
in the Aden area, which were 114 GWh in 1975, increased to 197 GWh at the end
of 1981 (Annex 1.3) (an average increase of 12.5% p.a.). In 1980, domestic
consumption accounted for 40.1% of total electricity sales, Government offices
and commerce accounted for 27.3%, agriculture and industry 31.5%, and the
remainder was accounted for by street lighting.
1.05     Electricity Tariffs:  The Government's objective is to apply a
uniform tariff throughout the country for each consumer category for equity
considerations and in an attempt to discourage migration from rural to urban
areas. At present tariffs in the Aden area are lower than those prevailing in
rural areas, while the quality of service is much better. However, the gap
between existing tariffs and their corresponding marginal cost is much bigger
in rural areas. In these circumstances, compliance with the Government
objective implies substantial cross-subsidization from urban to rural
consumers.
1.06     In 1980, under the First Power Project (829-YDR), a tariff study
together with a revaluation of PCEP's assets were carried out by foreign
consultants. The study recommended a level and structure of tariffs which
would convey to consumers the cost of resources employed in meeting their
demands while taking into account the social and financial constraints and the
need to obtain a satisfactory rate of return on revalued assets by 1986. They
recommended an average tariff increase of 45% effective January 1981. The
Association endorsed the consultants' recommendations and urged the Government
to implement them. However, the Government increased tariffs for selected
categories of consumers, on the Aden system only, in September and November
1981, by an average 27%. The Government has made a 29% tariff increase
effective as of January 1, 1982 for the agricultural and industrial consumers
which were not covered by the 1981 increase. Thus, the 1982 average tariff is
39% above the January 1981 level. IDA is actively pursuing a dialogue with
the Government and PCEP on this issue and with the proposed annual tariff
increases of an average 10% in 1983 and 15% in 1984 and 1985 (see para 3.12),
the Government will gradually bring tariffs closer to their corresponding
marginal cost of 78.8 fils/kWh in the Aden area.

1.07     Investment Program in the Power Subsector:  Under the First Power
Project, the Arab Fund, a Project cofinancier, has provided funds for the
preparation of a master plan for power development. PCEP is preparing draft
terms of reference for the study. The study would look, among other things,
into the economics of using coal as fuel for power generation, the possibility
of locating the power station near the refinery to take advantage of the hot
residual fuel oil/pitch available there and the feasibility of interconnection
with the Yemen Arab Republic.
1.08     Planned investment in the power subsector during the second 5-year
plan (1981-85) amounts to YD 69 million (US$200 million) representing 14% of
the total public investment program of the country. The bulk of this
investment program is for the construction of a thermal generating station
(2x25 MW of steam plant) for which financing has been secured from bilateral
sources for quite some time. However, there have been difficulties and the
Project has not yet started. An additional 50-MW of steam plant is being
considered by the Government; but there is no commitment as yet. Given the
uncertainty which has surrounded the bilateral financing, it is prudent to
have a contingency plan. However, the addition would not be justified if the
bilateral Project materializes.
1.09     While the quality of electricity services in the Aden area is
reasonably adequate, that prevailing in the rural areas is well below the
usual standards. The great majority of rural inhabitants does not have access
to electricity supply. One of the Government's objectives is to limit urban
migration through provision of social amenities in rural areas. The proposed
Project is one in a series of Government actions to improve the quality of
life in rural areas.
1.10     IDA Involvement in the Power Sector:  The proposed Project would be
the second IDA operation in the power subsector in PDRY. In 1978, the
Association approved a Credit of US$5 million to finance the electrification
of the Wadi Hadramawt (Credit 829-YDR). Despite some initial set backs, the
Project is now progressing satisfactorily and should be completed in 1985.
The Project provided the opportunity for the Association to engage in a
meaningful dialogue on various issues such as PCEP's financial viability,
tariffs, system planning, management information system and training.  The
continued involvement of the Association in the power subsector would provide
the opportunity to continue these worthwhile institution-building efforts.

II. The Project
2.01     Project Objectives:  At present electricity supply at the five towns
east of Mukalla and 13 nearby villages is based on independent local power
stations and networks. Supply is not continuous, power failures are frequent
and suppressed demand is known to be substantial. When completed, the Project
would replace the existing independent generating sets in the five towns by a
central and more fuel-efficient power station, reduce system losses and enable
presently unsatisfied demand to be met.
2.02      Project Description:  The proposed Project is the first stage of an
electrification scheme to supply electricity to five towns east of Mukalla and
13 nearby villages. It consists of the supply, construction and erection of
the following (see IBRD Map 16227):
i) 3x2.2 MW central diesel power station at As Shihr using
residual fuel oil;
ii) about 84 km of 33 kV and 11 km of 11-kV overhead transmission
lines;
iii) 6-33/11-kV substation transformers totalling 10.5 MVA;
iv) about 146-11/0.415 kV distribution transformers totalling 8,400
kVA;
v) about 51 km of 11 kV and 48 km of low voltage distribution
lines;
vi) meters and service connections for about 7,300 customers;
vii) mechanical equipment for transportation of material and
erection of transmission and distribution lines; and
viii) consultants services and training of staff abroad.
The second stage (not part of the Project) would consist of extension of the
central diesel power station with one generating set of 2.2 MW capacity and
the construction of additional distribution network to meet the increase in
demand.
2.03     Project Preparation and Engineering:  The Project feasibility study
was carried out by PCEP's consultants Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR), who are
also finalizing the preparation of detailed design and bid documents under an
IDA Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance. The feasibility study was
reviewed by the Association and found to be acceptable. PCR has completed the
field investigations, basic engineering designs for the networks (electrical
layout plans), and cost estimates. Detailed design and bid documents are at
an advanced stage of preparation and will be ready before Board presentation.



2.04     Project Cost Estimates:   The estimated cost of the Project, not
including customs duties and taxes from which PCEP is exempt, is YD 6.86
million (US$19.89 million) of which YD 5.85 million (US$17.0 million) would be
in foreign exchange. Project costs are based on consultants' estimates as
revised by the mission with base costs at the end of March 1982. In view of
the limited scale of civil work involved, and the stage of preparation of the
Project engineering, physical contingencies of 10% for generation, civil
component of substations and mechanical equipment and 5% for overhead lines,
substation and distribution equipment are considered adequate. Price
contingencies of 8.5% in 1982, 1983 and 1984, and 7.5% in 1985 have been added
for future escalation of local costs and 8.5% in 1982 and 7.5% in 1983 thru
1985 for foreign costs. Engineering services, including physical and price
contingencies, are estimated at US$1.34 million (foreign exchange component of
US$1.17 million) representing about 162 man-months of consultants' services at
an estimated cost of about US$8,300 per man-month, including all expenses.
Project costs are summarized below and detailed in Annex 2.1.

2.05     Project Financing:  The proposed credit of SDR 6.8 million (US$7.5
million equivalent) would finance about 44% of the foreign exchange cost of
the Project.  The OPEC Fund has indicated in principle its interest in
co-financing this Project for an equivalent of some US$7.5 million. The
Government has agreed to (i) provide the balance of the foreign exchange
required, about US$2.0 million, in addition to about US$2.9 million in local
costs and (ii) to cover any cost overruns.

Government and PCEP have agreed that the signing of cofinancing Loan Agreement
with the OPEC Fund would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit.
2.06     Project Implementation:  The Project would be implemented over three
years. Installation and erection of Project facilities would start in
January/February 1983. The construction of the power station and the supply
of all necessary plant and equipment would be the subject of one contract.
There would be a number of contracts for the supply of materials for the
33-kV, 11-kV, low voltage lines 33/11-kV substations and distribution
transformers, vehicles and erection equipment. The erection of the
transmission and distribution networks (except service connections and
associated single phase distribution lines which will be carried out by PCEP's
staff) would be the subject of one contract. PCEP's linesmen are being
trained by British consultants from British Electricity International (BEI)
under the First Power Project and would be capable of undertaking the
implementation of the Second Power Project. Staff for the operation and
maintenance of the system would be trained at Al Mansoura Training Center and
would be posted three months prior to the commissioning of the Project. Annex
2.2 gives the time schedule for the Project execution. The expected
completion date would be December 31, 1984.
2.07     Procurement:  The contracts for the construction of the transmission
and distribution network and the supply of the necessary material and
equipment for the network, vehicles and erection equipment would be financed
under the proposed Credit and let by international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank guidelines for procurement.  Items financed by the
cofinancier will be procured in accordance with his procedures. PCEP has
agreed to select an engineering consultant in accordance with Bank Guidelines
on the Use of Consultants to supervise the construction of the Project and to
appoint him not later than October 1, 1982, on terms and conditions acceptable
to the Association.
2.08     Disbursements. The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 6.8 million (US$7.5
million equivalent) would be disbursed over a three year period on the
following basis;
(a) 100% of the foreign cost of the contracts for supply and erection
of the transmission and distribution network, vehicles and erection
equipment;



- 7 -
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures on consultant's services for
preparation and supervision of the Project; and
(c) 100% of the foreign cost of training of staff.
Annex 2.3 shows the estimated schedule of disbursement of the Project which is
based on the Project implementation schedule. Annex 2.4 compares the Project
disbursement with the historical Bankwide sectoral disbursement profile and
the disbursement under the First Power Project and indicates that the proposed
Credit would be disbursed at a faster pace than the first Credit and the
Bankwide sectoral disbursement profile in view of:
(i) the relatively simple nature of the project;
(ii) its advanced stage of preparation;
(iii)  the Project financing arrangements which would ensure
that there would be no delay in Credit effectiveness; and
(iv) the Project implementation arrangements. Unlike the First
Power Project where most of the work was done by PCEP's force
account, the proposed Project would be installed mainly by
contractors (para 2.06). The closing date would be December 31, 1985
(12 months after the completion of the Project) to provide sufficient
time for the disbursement of the retention monies.
2.09     Lending Arrangements:  The Borrower would be the Government who will
onlend the full proceeds of the Credit to PCEP at the Bank interest rate of
11.6% for a term of 20 years including a 5-year grace period. The Government
would bear the foreign exchange risk on the IDA Credit as it has under the
First Power Project. Completion of a satisfactory subsidiary Loan Agreement
between the Government and PCEP would be a condition of Credit effectiveness.
2.10     Environmental Aspects:  The Project would have no adverse pollution
effects on the environment since the diesel power station would be located
outside the residential area and would replace a large number of less
efficient small generators of older designs. The overhead line would be
routed through the desert and PCEP is paying appropriate attention to the
aesthetic appearance of the transmission facilities, their compatibility with
the environment and suitable routing of the transmission line. The social
environment will be enhanced by bringing street lighting to the residential
areas concerned.
2.11     Risks:  Except for possible delays in securing the financing for the
Project and the difficulty of ensuring timely action on tariffs, no special
risks are foreseen, and no major problems are expected in view of the
implementation arrangements and the relatively simple nature of the Project.
2.12     Insurance:  PCEP's goods in transit are insured with the Yemen
National Insurance Company. As agreed during the negotiations of the First
Power Project, the Government carries self-insurance for PCEP's assets in
operation. These insurance arrangements are satisfactory.

III. FINANCE
3.01     Accounts:  PCEP's accounting system is good, but is not properly
implemented for lack of sufficient trained manpower. With the exception of
the Chief Accountant, the staff in the Accounting Department are unqualified
and there are nine vacancies which require qualified accountants. However,
substantial progress has been achieved in closing the accounts for the Aden
system which accounts for about 87% of PCEP's sales; the delay has been
brought down from three years to 10 months. With respect to branch accounts,
the situation is dismaying. Branch accounts are virtually non-existent and
unintelligible and have not been closed for a single year since 1975 (when
PCEP took over those branches from independent power companies operating
outside Aden). With its present human resource constraints, PCEP cannot carry
out the work involved in completing branch accounts (six branches for six
years) in order to produce balance sheets for past years.
3.02     A practical alternative would be to write off the old
'irreconcilables' from the books of accounts and to establish a sound de novo
basis from January 1983 onwards. To implement the above, a committee with the
requisite authority was set up before negotiations to establish the value of
the existing assets in the branches and to authorize the writing off of all
doubtful items. The Government and PCEP agreed to ensure that the committee
would complete its work and obtain Government approval of its recommendations
by February 28, 1983.
3.03     Under the existing Credit Agreement, PCEP is required to submit to
the Association its audited accounts within 5 months after the end of the
fiscal year. Compliance with this covenant has proven infeasible because of
delays in closing the Aden accounts, non-existence of branch accounts and poor
performance of the Central Board of Audit (CBA), the independent audit
authority appointed by the President (para. 3.04). The latest audit covers
1975-78 and that for the Aden system only. Under these circumstances,
maintaining the existing submission dates would be unrealistic. PCEP agreed
to submit to the Association:
i)  the 1981 unaudited accounts for Aden no later than November 1982 and
for subsequent years by the end of June of the following year and
efforts would be made to improve on these dates; and
ii)  the 1983 accounts for branches by September 1984 and at the same time
as those for Aden (June) in subsequent years.
3.04     Non-submission of audited accounts is part of a general problem with
CBA which is charged with the sole responsibility for auditing the accounts of
all Government departments and public sector enterprises. This auditing
arrangement pertains to all projects financed by the Association in PDRY. A
program for the audit of IDA financed projects was recently discussed with
CBA, which proposed the following timetable for the accounts of the Aden



system of PCEP: the 1979 accounts which have been submitted to CBA would be
audited by May 1982. The 1980 accounts will be submitted in May and audited
by September 1982 and the 1981 accounts will be submitted in September 1982 and
audited by March 1983. From fiscal year 1982 onwards, PCEP would submit its
accounts within six months following the end of the year and CBA would audit
the accounts within 4 months.  Agreement on this was reached with the
Government and PCEP.
3.05     Past Performance:  Under the first Credit Agreement (829-YDR) of July
14, 1978, PCEP was required to break even in 1980, and achieve a rate of
return of 2% in 1981, progressively increasing to 8% in 1985 and thereafter.
Interim targets for 1982, 1983 and 1984 were to be discussed with the
Association. PCEP has fallen short of the agreed targets for various reasons:
i) When the financial targets were established under the First Power
Project, petroleum products were sold at highly subsidized prices.
Subsequently however, in a commendable effort to induce conservation
and reduce its oil import bill, the Government decided to
substantially increase the prices of oil products for all categories
of consumers, including PCEP. Prices were more than doubled in 1980,
an additional small increase was implemented in 1981 and at present,
domestic prices of petroleum products are at par with border prices.
As a result, fuel oil cost which represented 44% of PCEP's total
revenues from electricity sales in 1979 rose to 105% of revenues at
the end of 1981. Furthermore, the cost of power purchased by PCEP
from the refinery was increased accordingly;
ii) Increases in other operating expenses, such as salaries and wages and
compulsory contribution to the newly established pension fund. In
September 1979, the Government raised salaries for all public and
para-statal employees by 24% (the first increase since 1970) and
introduced a compulsory contribution to the pension fund fully borne
by the employer and representing 20% of the salaries. The
contribution to the pension fund was subsequently reduced to 15% in
1981; and
iii) Most importantly, the Government's unwillingness to raise electricity
tariffs to cover these increases in variable costs.
At the Association's insistence, the Government raised tariffs in September
and November 1981, totalling an average 27%. An additional tariff increase of
29% for agricultural and industrial consumers was put in effect January 1,
1982. With such an increase, the average tariff has been raised from 25 fils
in 1981 to 34.75 fils in 1982, a 39% average increase in one year. While
such an increase is unprecedented in PCEP's history, it was not sufficient to
compensate for the increased fuel and other operating costs.
3.06     The amount of losses for the Aden system was YD 147 thousand in 1978,
YD 417 thousand in 1979, YD 3.5 million in 1980 and YD 5.8 million in 1981.
For three consecutive years, 1979 through 1981, PCEP had a negative internal
cash generation and could not meet its working capital requirements from its
revenues. Consequently, PCEP has had to rely entirely on external sources to



- 10 -
finance its investment program mostly in the form of Government capital
contribution to investment and, to a limited extent, in the form of loans. In
both cases, the Government has had to secure the foreign exchange component of
PCEP's investment program from outside bilateral and multilateral sources.
Funds obtained from bilateral sources have been passed on to PCEP as
Government equity while those from multilateral sources have been onlent to
PCEP by the Government. The Government has also had to accord a special fuel
subsidy to PCEP from 1980 with the intention of eliminating it over a period
of time. In spite of this fuel oil subsidy, PCEP is unable to settle its
accounts payable as illustrated by the amount due to Yemen National Oil
Company (YNOC) for its fuel oil delivery which represented the equivalent of
8.4 months of sales at the end of August 1981 when the current ratio was
0.69. PCEP has requested the Government to provide it with additional subsidy
to offset its losses. Such a subsidy would be in the form of injection of
fresh cash as equity contribution which will enable PCEP to settle YNOC's
dues. Furthermore, conversion of existing Government loans to PCEP into
permanent equity capital is envisaged. The financial projections have been
conservatively prepared on the assumption that such Government intervention
will not materialize. Financial statements for the Aden system for 1978
through 1981 are shown in Annexes 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, while Annexes 3.4, 3.5 and
3.6 show projections for 1982 through 1986.
3.07     The financial situation of the branches is even worse.  They too have
relied on the Government to provide a fuel subsidy and to finance their system
expansion and maintenance. Revenues from electricity sales are not sufficient
to cover even the fuel cost. Their losses amounted to YD 537 thousand in 1980
and YD 1.2 million in 1981. Branches accounted for 13% of PCEP's total
revenues and 18% of its total losses in 1981. An estimated Income statement
for 1980-1981 for the Branches is given in Annex 3.7 and projections for 1982
through 1986 are shown in Annex 3.8.
3.08     Receivables:  PCEP operates a computerized monthly billing system.
Substantial progress has been achieved in reducing the level of accounts
receivable which were at a record high, equivalent to 200 days of sales, at
the end of 1976. A major portion of accounts receivable consisted of old
bills, unpaid by the Government. As agreed under the First Power Project, the
Government set off its dues to PCEP against PCEP's dues to the Government.
PCEP has introduced a stringent collection policy and at present domestic
consumers are paying on time. Lately, there has been a slight deterioration
in the collection of receivables which increased from the equivalent 2.6
months of sales at the end of 1980 to 4 months at the end of August 1981,
solely on account of unpaid electricity bills by Government departments, State
farms and State enterprises. In the case of Government offices, the issue is
one of speeding the processing of PCEP's bills to ensure prompt payment. The
problem facing State enterprises and State farms is more fundamental since it
derives from a shortfall in revenues.  Government has agreed to ensure
settlement of electricity bills by March 31, 1983 for consumption through
December 31, 1982 by Government departments, State farms and State
enterprises. PCEP has agreed to ensure that its accounts receivable do not at
any time exceed three months of sales; and Government has also agreed to take
all measures necessary on its part to ensure that PCEP's receivables on
account of Government departments, State farms and State enterprises at no
time exceed the equivalent of 3 months of their electricity consumption.

3.09     Financing Plan:  The following table summarizes PCEP's sources and
applications of funds for the period 1982-86 (Annex 3.5) assuming:
a) an annual average tariff increase of 10% in 1983 and 15% in 1984
and 1985 (para 3.11);
b) elimination of the Government fuel subsidy to PCEP by the end of
1985;
c)  PCEP breaking evenL/  in 1986 for the Aden system and the three
main branches; and
d) With the exception of the proposed Project, the Government would
borrow the foreign exchange cost of PCEP's investment program and
pass it on to PCEP as equity contribution.
3.10     The other small rural systems, accounting for about 2% of total
generation, which have been created by the Government for social reasons,
would continue to depend on Government subsidies to cover their losses since
there is no hope of their becoming self-supporting in the foreseeable future.
They are technically branches of PCEP which installs their diesel generators
paid by the Government. Their system maintenance is taken care of by local
people. There is no reliable data on these operations and they have not been
incorporated in the financial projections.
/1   Breaking even is defined as total revenues covering full costs including
interest and depreciation charges calculated on revalued assets.

3.11     The above table indicates that: (a) the bulk of PCEP's investment
program (90.4%) would be financed from outside sources in the form of equity
contribution and Government subsidy (66%), loans (19.1%) and customers
contributions and deposits (5.3%); and (b) PCEP's contribution to investment
from internally generated funds excluding customers contributions is only
9.6%, largely on account of the unexpected Government decision to rationalize
prices of petroleum products, low tariffs, inadequate generation system, and
the size of the planned investment program in relation to the existing
assets. By 1986, the present installed generation capacity, woald have
doubled. From 1987 onwards, no major expansion of the generation plant is



- 13 -
anticipated, although rehabilitation of the transmission and distribution
network in Aden would continue. Although the level of net internal cash
generation contribution to investment is low for the total period of
1982-1986, it improves gradually from a negative position in 1982 and 1983 to
23% in 1984, 38% in 1985 and 78% in 1986, as tariff increases are implemented
and new generation units replace the old fuel-inefficient power stations which
would be retired.
3.12      Future Financial Performance:  The average tariff of 34.75 fils per
kWh (US10.1 per kWh) is quite high in relation to per capita income (YD 127,
US$370 in 1979) and it is clearly not possible to attain the financial
objectives set in the First Power Project. It is proposed to improve PCEP's
financial situation and move the tariffs closer to the long run marginal costs
(for Aden - 78.8 fils/kWh). In addition, to ensure a gradual elimination of
Goverment subsidies to PCEP by 1985 and PCEP's breaking even in 1986, annual
tariff increases of 10% in 1983 and 15% in 1984 and 1985 would be needed.
With these increases, fuel costs which exceeded PCEP's revenues from
electricity sales in 1981 would decline to 49.4% of revenues from operation in
1986; and PCEP would break even for the Aden system in 1985. The amount of
funds provided by the Government to PCEP as a contribution to investment would
gradually decrease from YD 4.7 million in 1982 to YD 1.0 million in 1986;
while the amount of subsidy required to cover PCEP's losses would decrease at
a faster rate from YD 5.2 million in 1982 to YD 1.2 million in 1985 and cease
in 1986. On a consolidated basis (Aden system+branches), all subsidies to
cover operating losses would be removed by the end of 1985 and PCEP would
break even for the system as a whole in 1986.
3.13      Because the bulk of PCEP's investment program is being financed by
the Government in the form of equity and taking into account the revaluation
reserve, PCEP's debt equity ratio would improve from 36/64 at the end of 1981
to 23/77 at the end of 1986. PCEP's current ratio which was 0.69 at the end
of 1981 would improve to 1.3 at the end of 1986, reflecting a progressively
improving liquidity position. The proposed IDA Credit would finance about 7%
of the cost of the 1982-86 investment program. Government and PCEP have
agreed to ensure removal of Government fuel subsidy to PCEP by 1985 and PCEP's
breaking even in 1986 for the Aden system and the three main branches. For
this purpose, Government and PCEP have also agreed to implement 'annual average
tariff increase of at least 10% from January 1, 1983 and 15% from January 1 of
1984 and 1985.
3.14      Debt Limitation:  Under the existing Credit Agreement, PCEP has
agreed to obtain the Association's prior consent to any borrowing it plans to
undertake whenever its internal cash generation is not sufficient to cover at
least 1.5 times its maximum debt service requirements in any future year.
This requirement is unduly restrictive and would be replaced by a more
appropriate covenant under which PCEP would obtain the Association's prior
approval for any new long-term borrowing unless its projected net revenue for
each year during the term of the debt (before depreciation and interest) is at
least equal to 1.5 times the projected debt service requirement for such year
on all its debts, including the debt to be incurred.

IV PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.01     Load Forecast:  Detailed load forecasts exist for the Aden area and
the Wadi Hadramawt. A forecast of electricity sales for the period 1981-1995
was prepared by PCEP's consultants (PCR) for the Project (five towns and 13
nearby villages east of Mukalla). According to this forecast, demands for
power are expected to grow from 1,482 kW in 1980 to 8,342 kW in 1995. On the
other hand, demand for energy will reach 19.5 GWh in 1995 from its 1980 level
of 4.0 GWh (Annex 4.1). A substantial share of electricity consumption in the
five towns is and would continue to be accounted for by household demand for
lighting and air-conditioning. At present, there is suppressed demand as
evidenced by the waiting list of applications for new connections. Planned
projects for housing, agriculture, potable water, gradual transfer of existing
diesel-driven loads and increased demand by existing consumers would sustain
the growth in electricity consumption. Increase in electricity tariffs would
not affect the growth in demand for electricity consumption since it is
largely a function of level of income which is essentially determined by the
inflow of remittances from the Gulf countries.
Least Cost Alternative
4.02     The Project's feasibility study was prepared by PCEP's consultants.
It was reviewed by the Association and found to be satisfactory. Based on the
forecast sales of electricity, several alternative schemes for the supply of
electricity to the five towns were considered: (i) five isolated systems,
(ii) interconnection of three towns and two towns respectively, (iii)
expansion of the existing power station at Al Mukalla with high voltage
transmission line to the five towns; and (iv) interconnection of the five
towns with the central power station. The interconnection of the five towns
by 33-kV overhead transmission lines with a central power station at As Shihr
was found to be the least cost alternative.
Return on Investment
4.03     The return on investment is 13% based on measurable benefits and
costs associated with the Project and defined over its expected life (see
Annex 4.2). The measurable costs include the capital cost of the Project, and
the cost of operation and maintenance. The measurable benefits include: the
revenues associated with the Project based on the prevailing average domestic
and commercial tariff of 50 fils/kWh (USc 14.5/kWh) in the Project area which
is taken as a proxy for the consumer's willingness to pay, and the net savings
in fuel attributable to the displacement by the Project of the output that
would otherwise be produced by existing higher cost plants and the net savings
accruing to the consumers from the substitution of electricity for kerosene.
Both costs and benefits are expressed in end-1981 prices.
4.04     If the price of petroleum products are increased at an annual rate of
about 3% to accommodate the expected increase in the real price of oil, and
assuming that tariffs are not increased in real terms by the Government over
the life of the Project, which is highly unlikely but used here as indicative
of the most pessimistic scenarios, the return on the project would be about
12%.

V. Agreements Reached and Recommendations
5.01       The Government and PCEP will:
(i)   ensure that the committee appointed to value PCEP's branch assets
should complete its work and obtain Government approval of its
recommendation by February 28, 1983 (para 3.02);
(ii)  arrange settlement of arrears through December 31, 1982, by all
State farms, State enterprises and Government departments by March
31, 1983 (para 3.08);
(iii)  ensure removal of Government fuel subsidy to PCEP by 1985 and
PCEP's breaking even in 1986 for the Aden system and the three main
branches (para 3.13); and
(iv)  implement annual average tariff increases of at least 10% from
January 1, 1983 and 15% for 1984 and 1985 (para 3.13).
5.02       Government will:
(a)    provide PCEP with all funds needed to complete the Project (para
2.05);
(b)    cause the Central Board of Audit to audit PCEP's accounts within 4
months of their submission (para. 3.04); and
(c)    take all measures necessary to ensure that PCEP's receivables on
account of Government Departments, State farms and State
enterprises at no time exceed the equivalent of 3 months of their
electricity consumption (para 3.08).
5.03       PCEP will:
(a)    submit for the approval of the Association, detailed descriptions
of all proposed fellowships (para 1.03);
(b)    appoint, not later than October 1, 1982, engineering consultants on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Association for the
supervision of the construction of the Project (para 2.07);
(c)    submit to the Association:  (1) the 1981 unaudited accounts for
Aden, no later than November 1982 and by the end of June of the
following year for subsequent years; and (2) the 1983 accounts for
branches by September 1984 and by the end of June of the following
year for subsequent years (para. 3.03);
(d)    submit the audited accounts on the following dates:
September 1982 for 1980 accounts, March 1983 for 1981 accounts and
within 10 months of the end of the fiscal year from 1982 and
subsequent years (para. 3.04);



- 16 -
(e)    ensure that its receivables for electricity supply shall at no time
exceed the equivalent of three months of sales (para 3.08); and
(f)    not incur any debt in any year without the Association's prior
approval, unless a reasonable forecast of its projected net revenue
for each year during the term of the debt before depreciation and
interest shall be not less than 1.5 times its projected debt
service requirements for such year on all its debts, including the
debt to be incurred.   This covenant would supersede the existing
debt limitation covenant of the First Power Project (para 3.14).
5.05       In view of the agreement on the matters set forth in this report,

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A. Income Statement
1.        Sales of Electricity in the Aden system are based on PCEP's estimated
load growth. The forecasts assume annual energy sales growth of 15% in 1982,
33% in 1983, 16% in 1984, 9.5% in 1985 and 10% in 1986. Average annual tariff
increases of 10% effective January 1, 1983 and 15% in 1984 and 1985 have been
assumed.
2.        Fuel price is assumed to increase by 4% each year.  Fuel and
lubricants are based on estimates of generation from steam and diesel units.
3.        Salaries and wages are assumed to increase by 15% each year. Material
and services and other operating expenses are assumed to increase in
proportion to increase in sales
4.        Depreciation is computed at an average annual rate of 6.75% on the
average gross fixed assets.
5.        Interest charges are based on PCEP's actual calculations.  New
borrowings are assumed to be at the following interest rates: IDA Credit to
the Government and loans from cofinanciers for the Project will be onlent to
PCEP at 11.6%. Interest during construction has been charged to operations in
accordance with PCEP's current practices.

B. Balance Sheet
6.       Gross fixed assets are based on consultant's valuation of PCEP's
assets at the end of 1980. Thereafter, they have been revalued at the end of
each subsequent year assuming the following annual inflation rates: 12.5% in
1981, 8.5% in 1982, 1983 and 1984, 7.5% in 1985 and 1986.
7.       Inventories are assumed to increase during 1982-86 in keeping pace
with operating requirements.
8.       Government subsidy for fuel oil to PCEP is assumed to be gradually
reduced and completely removed by the end of 1985.
9.       Accounts receivable are assumed to represent the equivalent of 3
months of sales from 1983 onwards.
C. Sources and Applications of Funds
10.  Construction requirement based on PCEP's estimates amount to:

8. Benefits:
A. Savings:
There are two types of savings that would be realised when the
Project is implemented:
a) Fuel saving of 36.42 fils/kWh for 4.77 million kWh due to the use
of a more economical central power station generating units using
fuel oil in replacement of existing individual small generating units
using diesel oil;
b) net saving of 132 fils/kWh on account of replacement of kerosene
by electricity for the additional domestic consumers based on
equivalent usage of 720 kWh/year per consumer.
