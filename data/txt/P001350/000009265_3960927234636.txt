MEMORANDUM AND RECONhEUDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF ITE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
FOR A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMNMT OF RENYA
FOR A FINANCIAL SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to Kenya for SDR 3.871 million (US$ 5 million equivalent) is submitted
for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years
maturity and would help f...*ace a financial sector technical assistance project.
The proceeds of the credit would be made available by the Borrower as a grant
to the Central Bank of Kenya.
2.          Background.  Kenya  already has many of the elements necessary for
the development of a vibrant and dynamic financial system, including a diverse
institutional base and competent Central Bank staff and management. The banking
and near-banking system includes the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), 24 commercial
banks and 50 near-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). Ten of the NBFIs are
affiliated with commercial banks. Kenya also has a stock exchange, 32 building
societies (although only a handful are sizeable or active), 53 insurance
companies, 10 development finance institutions (DFIs), a large Post Office
Savings Bank network and numerous savings and credit societies, pension plans
and other financial institutions.    The Government's financial sector reform
program, which is being supported by the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit
(FSAC) approved by the Board in June 1989, seeks to develop a more efficient and
market-oriented financial system. The program aims at removing distortions in
the mobilization and allocation of resources, increasing the efficiency of
intermediation and developing more flexible instruments of monetary policy. The
development of the financial system depends both on the maintenance of
appropriate economic policies and healthy institutions. Thus, the program also
calls for important institutional reforms, including the strengthening of the
Central Bank's capability to supervise the banking sector and move toward the
use of generalized monetary policy instruments, the restructuring of problem
institutions and the development of a stronger and larger cadre of banking
professionals to meet the needs of this rapidly growing sector.
3.          Project Obiectives.    The proposed  Financial  Sector Technical
Assistance Credit (FSTAC) will complement the reforms to be undertaken under the
FSAC by strengthening the capabilities of the Central Bank to manage financial
and monetary developments and assisting in training bank managers and staff.
Specifically, the FSTAC will support (i) the strengthening of the legal framework
for prudential supervision and the supervisory capabilities of the Central Bank,
thus improving efficiency and transparency in the financial system; (ii) the
establishment of a reserve money management system in the Central Bank and the
introduction of open market operations, thus providing Government with greater
flexibility in managing domestic demand and external balance; (iii) the design
of a restructuring program for troubled finAncial institutions; and, (iv) the
establishment of a College of Banking and Finance, which will provide training
to banking professionals, particularly from smaller and indigenously owned
institutions.



4.          Project Description. The proposed Credit for SDR 3.871 million (US$
5 million) would finance consultants' services, training, civil works and
equipment for the following components:
(i) Central Bank of Kenya -- Staff Development: the Credit would
finance overseas and local training of the Central Bank's Banking
Supervision staff (US$ 900,000);
(ii) Central Bank of Kenya -- Audits/Restructuring: the Credit would
assist in auditing troubled institutions, and in developing and
implementing action programs for these institutions. This component
also includes redrafting of the Banking Law and the acquisition of
computer equipment for the offsite surveillance unit in the Central
Bank   CUSS 820,000);
(iii) Central lank of Kenya -- Monetary Policy:  advise to the
Governor of the Central Bank on monetary policy issues, particularly
the establishment of a reserve money management system and improving
the monitoring and forecasting of monetary developments (US$
225,000); and
Civ) College of Banking and Finance:   the Credit would provide
financing for the foreigrn exchange costs of constructing residential
training facilities near Nairobi. The Credit would also finance some
of the furniture and fittings, including teaching materials and
equipment and vehicles, as well as technical assistance to the
College (USS 3,992,000).
5.          Total project costs are estimated at USS 5.94 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of USS 4.6 million (78 percent). The breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Details on procurement
and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B.  A
timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Kenya are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Since there is no Staff
Appraisal Report, the detailed project description and the project administration
and implementation arrangements are given in the Technical Annex.
6.          Rationale for IDA Involvements  The financial sector program is a
critical element in Government's structural adjustment process and involves
important steps in liberalizing and strengthening the sector.   Technical
assistance is necessary, however, to assist in the implementation of this
program.   Moreover,  the training and technical assistance as well as the
establishment of the College of Banking and Finance will provide the foundation
for the development of a strong cadre of Central Bank and banking professionals
in Kenya. Finally, IDA's involvement will help ensure consistency between the
objectives of the financial sector adjustment program and the technical
assistance program.
7.          Agreed Actions:  Most of the project components are already being
implemented. The legal and audit/restructuring work are already underway and



- 3 -
have been financed under a Project Preparation Facility.   in addition, the
advisor for the Research Department of the Central Bank has been identified, the
Director of the College of Banking and Finance has been appointed, courses at
the College are being offered in temporary facilities, the proposed staff
development and training program for the Central Bank's Banking Supervision
Department has been discussed and terms of reference for the long-term technical
assistance components have been agreed. Finally, agreement on the establishment
and operation of a Special Account as well as the procurement, disbursement and
reporting requirements for the Credit was reached during negotiations.
8.          Justification and Risks:  The project will help improve the Central
Bank's capacity to oversee an increasingly complex financial system and will
contribute to the development of stronger banking professionals. It will also
aid in the implementation of the restructuring of troubled institutions, thus
improving efficiency in the delivery of financial services, but also ensuring
that restructuring occurs with minimal disruption to the financial markets. No
major risks are foreseen, as work on all components is already underway and
Government commitment is high both to the overall reform program and to the
technical assistance component. .here is some risk that the restructuring of
troubled financial institutions may proceed more slowly than desired if the
Central Bank encounters political resistance. The assistance provided under this
Credit, however, is designed to provide the Central Bank with sufficient
technical expertise to prepare sound restructuring programs and determine their
appropriate phasing.
9.          Recommendationt I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

TECHNICAL ANNEX
SECTION A. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
1.          Kenya's banking and near-banking system consists of a diverse
institutional base, including the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), 24 commercial
banks and 50 near-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), a stock exchange, 32
building societies, 53 insurance companies, ten development finance institutions
(DFIs), a large Post Office Savings Bank network and numerous savings and credit
societies, pension plans and other financial institutions. This diverse
environment, coupled with sound economic policies and strong and capable
management within the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), provide the stage fo- the
development of a vibrant and dynamic financial system.   The Government's
financial sector reform program, which is being supported by the Financial Sector
Adjustment Credit (FSAC) approved by the Board in June, 1989, seeks to develop
a more efficient and market-oriented financial system, by removing distortions
in the mobilization and allocation of resources, increasing the efficiency of
intermediation and developing more flexible instruments of monetary policy.
Policy reform, without institutional reform, however, would constitute an
incomplete program. Thus, the program also calls for important institutional
reforms, including the strengthening of the Central Bank's capability to
supervise the banking sector and move toward the use of generalized monetary
policy instruments, designing restructuring plans for problem institutions and
the development of a stronger and larger cadre of banking professionals to meet
the needs of this rapidly growing sector. The proposed technical assistance
credit (FSTAC) would assist the CBK in implementing this important program, which
represents a critical element in the Government's overall structural adjustment
process.
Project Objectives
2.          The proposed Financial Sector Technical Assistance Credit (FSTAC)
will complement the reforms to be undertaken under the FSAC by strengthening the
CBK's capacity to oversee an increasingly complex financial system and will
contribute to the development of stronger banking professionals.   It will also
aid in the implementation of the restructuring of troubled institutions, thus
improving efficiency in the delivery of financial services, but also ensuring
that restructuring occurb with minimal disruption to the financial markets.
Specifically, the FSTAC will support (i) the strengthening of the legal framework
for prudential supervision and the supervisory capabilities of the Central Bank,
thus improving efficiency and transparency in the financial system; (ii) the
establishment of a reserve money management system in the Central Bank and the
introduction of open market operations, thus providing Government with greater
flexibility in managing domestic demand and external balance; (iii) the design
of restructuring plans for troubled financial institutions; and (iv) the
establishment of a College of Banking and Finance, which will provide training
to banking professionals and other staff, particularly from small and medium
indigenous-owned institutions.

Proiect Description
3.          The proposed Credit for SDR 3.871 million  (US $ 5.0 million
equivalent) would finance consultants' services, training, civil works and
equipment for the following components:
(i)   Central Bank of Kenya -- Staff Development: the Credit would
finance overseas and local training of the Central Bank's
Banking Supervision staff (US$ 900,000);
(ii)   Central Bank of Kenya -- AuditslRestructuring: the Credit would
finance   consultants'   services   in   auditing   troubled
institutions, and developing and implementing action programs
for these institutions.  This component would also finance
legal services for redrafting the Banking Act, and computer
equipment for the offsite surveillance unit in the Central Bank
(US$ 820,000).   The PPF would be refinanced  from this
component;
(iii)   Central Bank of Kenya -- Monetary Policy: a consultant would
advise the Governor of the Central Bank on monetary policy
issues, particularly the establishment of a reserve money
management system, and improving the quality and timeliness
of data on key monetary aggregates (US$ 225,000); and
(iv)   College of Banking and Finance:  the Credit would provide
financing for the foreign exchange costs of constructing
residential training facilities near Nairobi. The Credit would
also finance some of the furniture and fittings, including
teaching materials and equipment and vehicles as well as
technical assistance to the College (US$ 3.99 million).
Detailed descriptions of the project components are provided below.
Bank Supervision Department: Staff Development and Training
4.          Training in bank supervision is necessary in Kenya because bank
supervision itself is a relatively new function. Moreover, examination courses
are not generally offered in colleges and universities, in Kenya or elsewhere.
Even those persons with general banking knowledge are usually unable to conduct
bank examination work without further training. The proposed staff training
program has been prepared bearing in mind the planned developments in the Central
Bank's Supervision area. Thus, it is assumed that a minimum of 4 to 5 years
would be necessary for an examiner to acquire the skills necessary to lead an
inspection team into a bank as the examiner-in-charge. Therefore, most of the
formal training should be undertaken during this period.
The objectives of the training program ares
(i)   cater for the training needs of all staff in the department
from the time they join through senior management levell



- 13 -
(ii)   equip all staff, irrespective of seniority, with the necessary
technical skills to conduct effective on-site and off-site
examination of a bank;
(iii)   create self confidence in individual oZficers;
(iv)   develop a well motivated staff complement;
(v)   inspire staff to be professional; and
(vi)   retain talented staff by raising their career expectations,
thus assisting in providing the department with sufficient
continuity.
5.          The courses will cover technical, general and academic/professional
training. Most of the technical courses will be taken in the staff member's
first 8 years in the Department. The plan also intends that both technical and
general courses be required of all Departmental staff, as they are designed to
equip and prepare an individual to assume more senior responsibilities. In most
cases, professional courses should be encouraged rather than required as their
relevance an success will depend on the interest and ability of individual
officers. Thu plan includes, however, the sponsorship of a few candidates each
year for postgraduate courses in order to attract and retain high calibre staff
Who may otherwise go to other institutions, and to build a strong cadre of
individuals to take on more senior positions within the Central Bank.   The
training program has been developed along with a staff development program for
the Department and has been discussed fully with IDA staff. The program directly
addresses the needs of the Department and represents an appropriate mix of local
and overseas training.
Central Bank: Audits/Restructuring
6.          Under a Special Project Preparation Facility (SPPF) and a Project
Preparation Facility (PPF), consultants have already provided important
assistance to the Central Bank of Kenya in preparing the financial sector
adjustment program.   This assistance has included  -he installation of a
computerized data base system for monitoring all banks and financial
institutions, drafting of revised banking legislation, the preparation of new
raporting and audit requirements, the development of appropriate loan
provisioning and classification guidelines and the formulation and documentation
of new inspection procedures.  Consultants have also assisted in the audits of
troubled financial institutions and the preparation of action programs for their
restructuring. The proposed Credit will continue to support these activities,
and provides for additional technical assistance in the implementation of the
restructuring programs.   It will also finance the purchase of additional
microcomputers, software and equipment to enable the Central Bank to perfonm more
timely and detailed analyses of the financial institutions under its supervision.

Central Bank: Research Department Advisor
7.          An important element of the Government's financial sector adjustment
program is to introduce the use of more generalized monetary policy instruments
for the conduct of monetary policy. Such instruments, including the sale and
purchase of Government securities in primary and secondary markets, the Central
Bank discount rate and reserve requirements, will provide the Central Bank with
greater flexibility in managing the money supply, domestic demand and external
balance. In order to use these instruments, however, the Central Bank needs to
improve its monetary programming capabilities, and in particular, to begin to
develop more regular and complete forecasts of the various elements influencing
the supply of money in the economy. The proposed Research Department Advisor,
who has been identified and whose terms of reference have been discussed with
IDA staff, would assist the Central Bank in developing this forecasting ability.
He would also work closely wich the Treasury to improve the flow of information
between the Central Bank and that Ministry on matters such as expenditures, and
financial flows between ministries. Moreover, he would work closely with the
Monetary Policy Advisor, provided to the Central Bank by the IMP, who will be
working on the operational aspects of introducing open market operations in
Kenya. Finally, the Advisor would be available to Research Department staff and
the Governor of the Central Bank to prepare policy papers as necessary. IM",
IDA and CBR staff have worked together closely in defining the roles of both
advisors and in selecting them.
College of Banking and Finance
8.          Although reasonably healthy, Kenya's banking and financial sector
shows signs of growing strains because of the failure to develop managerial and
professional skills and provide clerical, teller and supervisory training in all
but the major banks.   Given the increasing sophistication of financial
instruments, the growing use of technology and the needs to increase operational
efficiency and productivity, improved training and development is clearly needed
in the sector. While the major banks have training centers which deal with basic
skills, the rest of the sector lacks any training resources other than in-house,
on-the-job training and private "colleges" and institutions, where quality is
uneven. Thus, Kenyans have received extremely low pass rates in the Chartered
Institute of Bankers (UK) examinations. Although *passes' in examination are
only surrogates for professional standards, more importantly they indicate that
candidates have generally been through comprehensive series of courses covering
the essential skills needed in the banking and financial sector. At present,
the banking examinations do not require formal qualifications in management apart
from one paper on the Nature of Management in the Chartered Institute of Bankers
(CIB) examinations. While modern management techniques are essential to the
future viability of Kenyan financial institutions, few good courses are currently
available. The need to upgrade the levels of professional and managerial skills
can thus best be addressed througb the development of the College of Banking and
Finance of Kenya (CBF) into a fully fledged training institution matching the
needs of the sector with courses, training and development programs which are
relevant, cost-effective and of high quality. Such an institution would help
improve the operational efficiency of the financial sector and would enable
Kenyans to gain recognized professional qualifications.



- 15 -
9.       The College, with a membership of 74 banking and financial institutions,
was formally registered under the Companies Act on September 23, 1988 as a
Company limited by guarantee and not having share capital. Present plans provide
for the College to begin operations in early 1989 in temporary premises and, once
established, to start on detailed plans to construct permanent facilities in the
Nairobi area to provide a central College for all banks, both to supplement the
limited range of courses offered by the major banks for their own staff and
provide professional, management and skills enhancement courses for the many
banks which have no facilities. Such a central training college would (i) offer
substantial economies of scale over the continued development o_ training centers
by each bank; (ii) reduce training staff needs to a manageable number given the
shortage of trainers and the reluctance of the smaller banks to establish their
own training schools and programs; (iii) encourage the introduction of consistent
and sound banking practices throughout the sector; (iv) allow for information
and experience to be shared between different banks and financial institutions;
and (v) provide a center of excellence in which programs relevant to local needs
and national aspirations can be designed and developed.
10.      Initially,  the  College  would  focus  on  providing  training  for
professional qualifications, technical training in banking practices and finance
for all levels of staff. and an extended program of management training and
development through a series of modules. In the longer term, the College would
develop research facilities, organize seminars, workshops and conferences and
provide consultancy services to member institutions. It might also ultimately
provide training to banking staff in other African countries or train staff from
other financial institutions in Kenya.
11.      The  proposed  College  will  be  residential,  modelled  along  and
complementary to the existing bank owned and managed training facilities. The
curriculum will cover both managerial and professional courses with the former
aimed at all management cadres and the latter, at least initially, following the
curriculum of the CIB (UK) syllabus and aimed at junior and some middle
management officers as part of their career development.   In addition, the
College would provide skill enhancement training to all clerical, teller and
junior staff for all institutions lacking such training. The College will be
managed by a Director supported by a Deputy Director/Senior Tutor, both of whom
have been selected and both of whom will carry a teaching load. Tutors will be
recruited on secondment from the banking community on a rotational basis and from
the academic community. Salaries and benefits will be comparable to the banking
sector to attract high quality staff. Once established it is intended that the
College will be financially self-supporting through fees charged to participating
institutions which will cover recurrent and investment costs. Participating
institutions will be able to recover at least part of the training costs through
the recently introduced national training levy.
12.      The College has carried out a training needs analysis through surveys
and a limited but focussed interview program. Estimates of the potential growth
of employment in the sector have been projected up to 1993. Based on these
estimates, as well as the current composition of staff and the ability of
institutions to release staff for training, IDA and College staff estimate that
with a 100 student residential hostel, training could be provided for each year
for:



- 16 -
- 160 students on professional subjects, assuming each class would
consist of 20 persons.  Since most of these subjects can best be
taught in an instructional mode this seems an appropriate approach;
- 500 students on management subjects, assuming each class would
consist of 20;
- up to 300 students for skill development courses (junior and clerical
staff) on a non-residential basis; and
- conferences, seminars and other training courses.
The training needs for clerical and supervisory staff were also analyzed.
Although a large number are already trained in the existing bank training
schools, over 23Z of the staff in the sector, namely the clerical and supervisory
staff of banks and NBFIs with no training schools, do not have access to training
facilities except on rare occasions when one of the training schools provides
a place for another bank. It is doubtful, however that banks and NBFIs will be
prepared to finance junior staff to attend residential courses. Nonetheless, the
College plans to offer some short-term skills development courses for junior and
clerical staff.
13.      The College will be located in a building to be constructed on a site
within a radius of about 20 km from Nairobi. A site has provisionally been
selected, providing a location free of urban development and largely being
developed for housing rather than industry and commerce.  The impact on the
environment would be minimal since access roads and facilities and services are
readily available and the building could be designed to fit in with the existing
landscape. Current plans propose a College with the following main componentss
administration block, seminar and lecture rooms, library, lecture theatre,
catering and hostel facilities and staff housing. In addition, the site would
be landscaped and essential internal roads constructed. The landscaping would
be particularly designed to allow the College to "blend" into the local scenery.
Given the distance of the College from Nairobi and the residential nature of the
courses, the College plans to build recreation facilities. These facilities are
expected to be financed by the member institutions and the cost has not been
included in the capital investment estimates for the College.
14.      Investment cost estimates have been derived from estimates provided by
the College as well as from information from a local quantity surveyor and from
the Ministry of Public Works. Based on the structures envisaged and the site
the construction, furniture and equipment costs are estimated at US$ 3.7 million.
The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$ 2.79, including state of the
art teaching equipment and computer facilities. Vehicles will also be purchased,
including a 20 seater bus, 2 pick-up trucks, 1 minibus and one vehicle for use
by senior staff of the College. Vehicle costs are expected to total USS 125,000,
thus bringing total capital costs to US$ 3.84 million. As foreign exchange will
be used to finance the vehicles, total foreign exchange costs will amount to USs
2.90 million. In addition, the Credit will provide US$ 150,000 in training and
technical assistance. Details of the capital investment costs, which include
contingencies, and the foreign exchange component are given below.

15.     The College has been established on the basic principle that, once
opened, it should be self-financing and not require funding from member
institutions on a continuing basis. Sources of income will include charges for
training courses; seminar and conference fees; consulting services, hire of the
facilities, external courses and seminars and research.   At this stage, in
calculating the recurrent income only the charges for training courses have been
included bearing in mind that it will take time to develop other sources of
income. The per diem fees charged to the member institutions will be sufficient
to cover the estimated recurrent costs and will be subject to a degree of
reimbursement from the Industrial Training Board from funds derived from the
Training Levy.   Recurrent costs, which are estimated at about US $ 700,000
equivalent per annum once the College is operational, will include personnel
costs, catering costs, utilities, maintenance and supplies, travel and other
miscellaneous administrative expenses.
16.      The College would offer two core programs--professional skills and
management subjects.   The professional skills course would be based on the
Chartered Institute of Bankers (UK) syllabus leading to qualifications of
Associate Membership, ACIB and covering courses such as banking law, monetary
economics, accountancy, investment, management, finance of international trade,
and banking practice. As appropriate, modifications would be made to include
topics specifically related to the local environment, e.g. banking law in Kenya.
Once the College is fully established, it intends to develop a local examination
system leading to a qualification recognized by the Kenya Institute of Banking.
Nonetheless, courses would continue to be provided covering the Institute of
Bankers (UK) syllabus. Each course would last about twelve weeks.

17.      The management development program wotld consist of a series of modules
over an extended period supplemented by on-the.-job training covering marketing,
competitive strategy, mazaging people, personnel issues, organizational
development, managing productivity and technology. Other courses and modules
would be established as necessary. The balance Or the facilities would host a
series of one to two week seminars and conferences on a wide range of subjects.
In addition, the growing spread of technology in the banking and financial
sectors    will  increasingly  demand  training  for  officer  cadre  staff  in
communications, computer technology and the use of many automated functions.
Office technology courses should cover technical and productivit, issues as well
as state-of-the-art marketing techniques.
18.      The program will use highly participative techniques of instruction
using case studies, groups and team discussions and business simulation
exercises.   All programs will be residential using the full day for cross-
fertilization and experience sharing with the students and instructors. Courses
-will be evaluated yearly prior to the program design for the next year and
adjustment and amendments made as needed. Feedback on the effectiveness will
be through reviews of results for the Institute of Chartered Bankers'
examinations and from participants and senior management reviews by member
institutions as well as end-of-course surveys.
19.      Under the Articles of Agreement management of the College will be vested
in a 14 member Board consisting oft
-  Six members nominated in writing and representing the banks belows
C Central Bank of Kenya;
. Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd.;
. Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd.;
. Standard Chartered Bank of Kenya Ltd.;
N ational Bank of Kenya Ltd.;
K Kenya Post Office Saving Bank.
-  Chairman of Kenya Institute of Bankers;
- A representative of the Office of the President;
- A representative of the Ministry of Finance/Treasury;
- A representative of the Ministry responsible for industrial training;
-  Four members elected at a General Meeting to represent respectively
other commercial banks (one) financial institutions (two) and
cooperative banking (one).
Two additional members may also be selected.
20.      The initial members of the Board are the Governor of the Central Bank
of Kenya, Chief Executives of Kenya Commercial Bank, Barclays Bank of Kenya,
Standard Chartered Bank of Kenya, National Bank of Kenya, and Kenya Post Office
Savings Bank, the Chairman of the Kenya Institute of Bankers and representatives

of the Office of the President (currently the Director of Personnel Management)
the Ministry of FinanceJTreasury (currently the Permanent Secretary), and the
Ministry responsible for industrial training. Day-to-day business and management
of the College is the responsibility of the Director who is appointed by the
Board. The tutorial staff will be drawn from the bankirg and financial sector
on a rotational basis and from academia and will be both full-time and part-time
based on the courses ultimately offered. It is intended that appointment to the
College is designed to be part of career development for staff with high
potential.   The Director will act as secretary to the Board.   The Deputy
Director, who will act for the Director in his absence, will also be the Senior
Tutor with general overall responsibility for professional, management and other
training.
SECTION B. PROJECT ADIINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
21.      Proiect Implementation. Responsibility for implementing the project will
rest primarily with the Central Bank of Kenya, while he College of Banking and
Finance will oversee the construction of the College's facilities. The Director
of the Banking Supervision Department would be responsible for the components
related to staff development within his department and the audit and
restructuring of troubled institutions.  Many of the project components are
already being implemented. The legal and audit/restructuring work are already
underway and have been financed under a Project Preparation Facility.   In
addition, the advisor for the Research Department of the Central Bank has been
identified, the Director of the College of Banking and Finance has been
appointed, courses are being offered in temporary facilities, the proposed staff
development and training program for the Central Bank's Banking Supervision
Department has been discussed and terms of reference for the long-term technical
assistance components have been agreed. Finally, agreement on the establishment
and operation of a Special Account as well as the procurement, disbursement and
reporting requirements for the Credit was reached during negotiations.
22.      Reportina, Accounts and Audits.  Separate accounts would be kept for
all expenditures under the project. The CBK will submit to IDA quarterly reports
on the progress of the CBF component (to be prepared by the CBF) and biaunual
reports on progress under the other components. Accounts for the CBF component
would be submitted to IDA on a quarterly and annual basis, while accounts for
other expenditures under the Credit would be submitted on an annual basis. The
Central Bank will maintain records of all transactions under the Credit in
accordance with sound accounting practices. Not later than six months after the
end of each fiscal year of the Government, all accounts will be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA and submitted to the Association. Audit
reports will include a separate opinion with regard to the claims submitted to
IDA on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs) and would state whether such
claims have been effected in accordance with the Credit Agreement.
23.      Project Costs and Financing.  Total project costs are estimated at US$
5.94 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$ 4.64 million,
or 78 percent of total costs. These costs exclude import duties and sales taxes
on equipment, furniture and fittings, which are expected to be exempted under
this program. Cost estimates are based on April, 1989 prices. A contingency



- 20 -
of 10 to 15 percent was added to cover physical and price changes during the
implementation of the project.
24.      The Government of Kenya would contribute US$ 937,500 equivalent to
cover local costs incurred in the construction of the CBF. This contribution
amounts to about 24 percent of total project costs for this component.  The
remaining components, which are largely technical assistance and training for
the Central Bank, will be financed 100 percent by the proposed Credit.  The IDA
credit is expected to finance US $ 4.64 million in foreign exchange costs and
US $ 363,500 in local costs.
25.      Procurement.  Procurement arrangements are sutmarized in Schedule B,
with the amounts in parentnaeses indicating the portion to be financed by IDA.
Bidding packages for goods (vehicles, and equipment/fittings/furniture) would
be prepared on an annual basis, and each contract that is expected to exceed US$
50,000 would be procured by international competitive bidding (ICB). Procurement
would follow local competitive bidding (LCB) for contracts under US$ 50,000.
Consultants for training and technical assistance will be selected in accordance
with Bank guidelines. Contracts for vehicles, and equipment/fittings/furniture
in excess of US $ 50,000 each will be subject to prior IDA review.  Other
contracts will be subject to selective post-award review.
26.      Disbursements.  As shown in Schedule B, disbursements would be made
against 100 percent of total expenditures for consultants services, 100 percent
of foreign exchange costs and 70 percent of local expenditures for civil works,
and equipment/fittings!furniture, and 100 percent of foreign expenditures for
vehicles.  Disbursements are expected to take place over a five year period
beginning in FY90. These disbursements include disbursements under the SPPF and
PPF advances, which will be refinanced under the proposed Credit. Disbursements
for contracts procured through ICB will be made against fully documented
withdrawal applications. Disbursements for other items wovld be made on the
basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs) detailing individual transactions in
a given period, together with certification of payment of the amounts involved
and of their eligibility under the Credit.  The Government will establish a
Special Account in the Central Bank in US dollars to expedite disbursements with
terms and conditions of operations acceptable to IDA. Upon credit effectiveness
and receipt of a withdrawal application, the Association will make an advance
deposit of US$ 250,000. The special account would be replenished upon receipt
and approval of satisfactory documented evidence of expenditures to be provided
by the Central Bank. The Central Bank will retain supporting documentation for
SOEs until at least 12 months after the closing of the Credit account and make
it available for review by IDA supervision missiona.
27.      Project Implementation Schedule.  The proposed Credit is expected to
become effective by late-July 1989, soon after the PSAC. The training program
will start in July 1989. Implementation of the construction phase of the College
will begin at or by project effectiveness and should take about two years.
Project completion is expected to be December 31, 1993, with the closing date
being June 30, 1994.
