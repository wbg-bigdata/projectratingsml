MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF RWANDA
FOR A FIRST EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to the
Republic of Rwanda for SDR 16.2 million (US$22.3 million equivalent) is submitted
for approval. The proposed credit, which would be on standard IDA terms with 40
years' maturity, would help support the adjustment of the structure of primary
education, improve its quality and strengthen the sector's management capacity.
The project would be cofinanced by UNDP (US$2.0 million).
2.      Backaround.  In 1977 the Government adopted a reform program  for
primary and secondary education whose objectives weres (a) to change the
structure of the educational system by lengthening primary education from six to
eight years, creating a three-year cycle of rural post-primary training and
unifying general secondary education into one six-year cycle; and (b) to adjust
the education content to the socio-cultural and economic realities of the country
by expanding teaching in Kinyarwanda (the national language) in primary
education, and vocationalizing/diversifying secondary education. In higher
education a reform program, adopted in 1987, aimed att (a) meeting the manpower
requirements for national development; (b) shortening the undergraduate programs
and enhancing quality; and (c) improving overall efficiency. The Government has
swiftly imp. 'ented the reform of primary and secondary education and has
initiated it  .n higher education.  In 1987/88 p:imary education enrollment
reached about 970,000 of which 49 percent were females.
3.      Sectoral issues and strategy.  The length of primary education and the
structure and excessive vocational orientation of secondary education have proven
to be problematic in terms of affordability and relevance. In recent years, this
situation has been rtacerbated by a combination of an explosive population growth
and economic crisis. The annual population growth rate has been about 3.7
percent. This, together with the economic crisis which resulted in a marked
deterioration of the Government's fiscal capacity since the early 1980s, have had
*       detrimental effects on both the quantity and quality of education.  In fact,
simulations of the future of the education system under current constraints and
policies show a significant fall in enrollment rates (from 62 to 49X) in primary
education over the next decade. The single most important measure to help
maintain the rates would be a reduction in the length of primary schooling from
eight to six years. Given the complexity of the adjustments needed by both
primary and secondary education, a two-stage approach is proposed, with the focus
on primary education in the first and post-primary education in the second. The
share of education in the Government's budget seems adequate (around 24 percent
and therefore on the high side by African standards) but the composition of
expenditures can be improved particularly by increasing the share of quality-
related inputs.
4.      Rationale for IDA involvement.  Considering the budgetary constraints as
well as the education system's problems regarding its overall structure, duration
and efficiency and their effects on enrollment rates in primary education, IDA's
overall strategy is to help the government initiate affordable development of the
sector through (a) progressive adjustment of the structure of the education



system, starting with primary education, while at the same time improving the
quality of education; and (b) increase of efficiency in resource allocation and
use, while mobilizing non-public resources. IDA's involvement is justified by
the agreement it has already reached with the government on medium term policies,
particularly reduction of the duration of primary education and the size of the
sector's investment program. The project was designed taking account of the
experience learned during implementation of the three IDA-financed projects in
Rwanda.
S.      Proiect obiectives.  The project would support government policies and
complement other donors' contributions to the sector investment program. Its
objectives are specifically to: (a) consolidate and expand primary education; (b)
improve the quality of primary education; and tc) strengthen sector management
capacity.
6.      Proiect description.
(a)     Consolidation and expansion of nrimarv education would be pursued
through the establishment of a primary education fund geared toward improving
both equity of access among and within prefectures and overall access and
enrollment rates at this level of education, while at the same time improving the
general conditions of learning. The project would finance the construction of
2,000 new classrooms, the rehabilitation of 400 existing classrooms and the
reconstruction of 300 others. It would also provide furniture for the 2,000 new
classrooms and for 30 percent of the 8,700 unfurnished ones,
(b)     Improvement of the quality of education would be achieved through (i)
pre-service training of primary teachers; (ii) professional development and in-
service training of primary education supervisors and teachers; and (iii)
strengthening applied pedagogical research. The project would finance civil
works, furniture, equipment, textbooks, technical assistance, local and external
training and incremental operating costs.
(c)     Strenathenina the sector's management capacltv would be reached by
reinforcing the capabilities of (i) central level departments in planning,
budgeting and control of expenditures, staff management and organization of
examinations; (ii) prefectoral level inspectorates in pedagogical leadership;
(iii) secondary schools in the efficient use of resources and (iv) the
university's management information system. The project would finance technical
assistance, equipment, local and external training and incremental operating
costs. In addition, the project includes the financing of the Project
Implementation Unit and provides funds for undertaking a number of studies and
the preparation of future investments.
7.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$26.9 million, of which
US$10.9 million would be in foreign exchange. Schedule A contains the project
cost summary and financing plan and Schedule B the amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, as well as a disbursement schedule. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of IDA operations in Rwanda are
given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map showing the locations of the
project components is attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9136-RW dated
March 1, 1991 is being distributed separately.
8.      Agreed actions.  The government has agreed to reduce primary education
from eight to six years and to have the process completed by October, 1993.
During negotiations, the government and IDA agreed on a policy statement
encompassing the government's sector strategy, the related investment program,
and its financing. In addition, the government agreed to (a) undertake a census
of teaching staff and a school mapping exercise for primary education and do the



- 3 -
same for secondary education personnel; (b) reorganize the national primary
education examination so as to assess the basic educational atteinments of
students; (c) undertake each year an annual government/IDA review of the draft
three-year rolling investment and expenditure program to ensure development of
the sector consistent with the country's financing capability, while respecting
the priority of allocating resources to primary education and quality-related
inputs; and (d) hold by April 30, 1993 at the latest, a GovernmentlIDA mid-term
review to assess progress in achieving the Project Development Objectives. A
condition of effectiveness of the credit would be that the conditions precedent
to the effectiveness of the cofinancing by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) have been fulfilled. The conditions of disbursement of the credit for the
primary educatioxn fund would be the establishment of the interministerial
commission under the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education (MINEPRISEC) or
his nominee, and the issuing of a ministerial circular providing information to
the local governments (communes - 143) on the functioning of the fund and related
procedures including the conditions to be met by the communes before funding
approval and the standard form of the protocol to be prepared by each commune.
9.      Benefits.   The reduction of primary education from eight to six years
will create 120,000 new places in primary schools for children of the 7-12 year
age-group. In addition, the benefits of this project would include: (a)
expansion of primary enrollments through the primary education fund whose
allocation will ensure equity across prefectures and communes, while creating
about 84,000 additional places; (b) establishment of a framework for improving
the quality of primary education, including a comprehensive teacher training
program and the development of a new curriculum which includes health, nutrition,
population and environmental concerns; and (c) strengthening of the technical
capacities of MINEPRISEC's central departments (as well as decentralized units)
for policy analysis and development and a more efficient use of existing
resources. The most immediate impact on primary education would be the
consolidation of existing enrollment rates (given present financial constraints)
and the improvement of the quality of education.
10.          Risks.    The risks are related to inadequate management capacity
throughout the educational system. Detailed preparation of the project
components jointly with national specialists, the provision for additional
staffing and the sizable training program supplemented by specialists in key
*       areas included in the proposed project should help overcome this problem.  In
addition, recent hostilities underscore the level of uncertainty and risk faced
by the country. The government rapidly brought the situation under control while
offering to solve the underlying political problems. In the long run, equitable
economic and social growth, part of which is expansion of basic education, would
be the best insurance against instability.
11.          Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
