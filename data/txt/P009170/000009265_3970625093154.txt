PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This  report  reviews  the  preparation,  implementation  and
achievements of the Morava Region Development Project for which Loan
1262-YU of US$20.0 million was made to the Republic Water Fund (RWF). On
February 28, 1980 RWF was replaced by the Republic Water Commtmity of
Interest (RWCI) which assummed the Bank loan obligations. The loan was
signed June 14, 1976, became effective November 3, 1976 and the final
disbursement was made on July 14 , 1983. The loan was guaranteed by the
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  In  addition  to  the  loan
agreement the Bank entered into project agreements with Bioktos (Titovo
Uzice), Vodovod  (Cacak), Milosevac  and  Aleksinac.   The  project was
implemented by RWCI, Bioktos, Vodovod, Milosevac, Aleksinac and SFUR.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle
East and North Africa Regional Office on the basis of the findings of a
project completion mission which visited Yugoslavia in FebruarylMarch
1984 and of a review of the Staff Appraisal and President's Reports, the
Loan and Project Agreements and other reports related to project
implementation.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
COED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED has sent copies of the draft
report to the Government and its agencies for their comments. Comments
received from the Republic Water Community of Interest are attached as an
Appendix to the report.

MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN 1262-YU
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 1262-YU, approved on May 20, 1976 for Morava Region Development
for an amount of US$20 million was in accordance with Bank lending policy,
focusing on less developed Regions and was of major assistance to the Republic
of Serbia in re-orienting its flood control investment program. The loan was
expected to finance the total project foreign exchange requirements.
The principal ohjectives of the loan were to develop low-cost flood
control programs such as zoning regulations, strengthened building codes,
river diversion and dredging to substitute for the planned construction of
multiple,  very  high-cost  dams which would not have resolved the flooding
problem.   In addition the loan provided for an economic program  study  to
accelerate  development  in  the  least  developed  regions  of  the  Republic.
Finally,  it was  to reduce the health hazards associated with intermittent
water service by providing adequate water supply and sewerage services to the
towns of Titovo Uzice and Cacak, and through study results to reduce pollution
and improve water quality in all the rivers of the Morava Basin.
Project effectiveness and start-up were timely (paras. 3.01 and
3.02). The Borrower, the Republic Water Fund, as foreseen at appraisal was
abolished and replaced uy the Regional Water Community of Interest (para.
3.03).  Except for the Vrutci dam there were no significant revisions  to
project scope of work (para. 3.05). Major project facilities were completed
after a three-year delay, mainly because of difficulties encountered with the
Vrutci  dam  (para.  3.08).   The  Cacak  water  production  facilities  were
commissioned close to appraisal schedule (para 3.10).
The project costs amounted to US$76.4 million (Dinar 2,386.4 million)
compared with appraisal estimates of US$55.9 million (Dinar 1,006.4 million).
The cost overrun is mainly due to the extended project implementation period,
higher than expected local and international inflation, and additional works
undertaken for the Vrutci dam (para. 3.15 and 3.16).



- vii -
RWCI has developed into a smoothly functioning authority and has
adjusted well to a  rapidly  increasing workload.  The water and sewerage
entities at Titovo Uzice and Cacak were well established at the time of
appraisal and performed well during project implementation. Neither their
organizational structures nor their staffing patterns have changed (paras-
6.02 to 6.03).
The financial performance of the Titovo Uzice and Cacak water supply
and sewerage entities was adequate in that tariff adjustments were approved
annually, and despite lower than forecast sales volumes, the entities attained
the revenue covenant in all years except 1982 (paras. 5.06 (iii) and 5.10
(ii)).
The benefits of the three studies - Flood Hazard Adjustment, Water
Quality and Regional Development - have already been significant (para. 4.02
to 4.05). The wate. supply and sewerage services for Titovo Uzice and Cacak
have  been  improved  (paras.  4.09  to  4.16).   The  benefits  of  the  pilot
irrigation components although substantial, are still to be determined (paras.
4.12 to 4.14).

MORAVA REGION DEVELOPKENT PROJECT
LOAN 1262-YU
PROJECT COMPLETION  PORT
I. INTRODUCTION
Background Data
1.01     The primary objective of the project was to develop low-cost flood
control programs to substitute the massive investments in proposed -das, and
to provide a plan for economic development both of which would serve as bases
to improve the planning and management of water resources within the Morava
River basin. In addition, the project provided for the extension of the water
supply and sewerage systems in the towns of Titovo Uzice and Cacak, and
contained two small agricultural research components.  Project costs were
estimated at US$51.4 million with a foreign exchange component of US$16.2
million.
Borrower
1.02     The borrower was the Republic Water Fund  '" which was responsible
for the development and allocation of water resources in Serbia. Portions of
the loan were onlent to: (i) Bioktos (Titovo Uzice) and Vodovod (Cacak) which
are organizations of associated Labor carrying out their activities through
socially-owned resources under Yugoslav law; and (ii) the Milosevac Farmers
Cooperative and Aleksinac Agro-Industrial Kombinat.
Bank Role in the Sector
1.03     Bank involvement in the water supply, sewerage and air pollution
sectors in Yugoslavia was initiated in 1971 and has continued through the
execution of nine projects.  The Bank has actively assisted the Borrowers in
project development and implementation as well as in the establishment of new
institutions and appropriate financial strategies. Lending in the sector has
been in accordance with Bank country policy, focussing on the less-developed
Republics,  and  on  meeting  basic  needs  through  improving  health  and
environmental conditions.
'The original borrower's functions and the Bank loan obligations were
transferred to the Republic Water Conmunity of Interest (RWCI) in
1980.

II. PROJECT PREPARPTION AND APPRAISAL
Proiect Origin and Objectives
2.01     Economic development in the Morava River basin had been impeded by
recurrent flooding and inadequate water resource developmeut. The Government
of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) requested Bank
assistance in 1972 for the financing of seven of twenty planned multipurpose
dams. During project identification, it was determined that the planned dams
would not prevent flood damage, and that because of silting problems, many of
the dams to be constructed would have silted up before the full twenty were
constructed. The Vrutci dam was retained in the program because it would
provide water supply to the town of Titovo Uzice and maintain river flow
volumes during the dry summer period.
2.02     Thus, instead of encouraging non-economic major investments in dam
structures, it was concluded that comprehensive studies of alternative methods
to reduce flood hazards should be undertaken. Due to increasing pollution of
the rivers in the basin, the need for a study of measures required for
improving water quality became evident. Additionally, studies were needed to
find ways to accelerate economic development in the least developed regions of
the  basin.   And  two  small  pilot  irrigation  plants  were  conceived  as
substitutes for the previous large scale multipurpose dam type projects.
2.03     In the towns of Titovo Uzice and Cacak, infrastructure had not kept
pace with growth, which had resulted in inadequate public utility services.
Water supplies were intermittent and only a minor portion of the population
was covered by sewerage systems with the effluents being discharged untreated
into the rivers.
2.04     Thus,  it was agreed that the project for the development of the
Morava River basin would include: (i) studies to develop economic alternatives
to high cost dams for flood control, for water quality improvement and for
economic development; (ii) expanded water supply and sewerage facilities for
the towns of Titovo Uzice and Cacak; and (iii) two small scale pilot
irrigation components.
Project Preparation
2.05     Project preparation was undertaken by six different entities (i) the
Republic Water Fund (RWF) and subsequently RWCI for the Vrutci Dam (at Titovo
Uzice) and the Flood Hazard Adjustment and Water Quality Studies; (ii) Bioktos
for the Titovo Uzice water supply and sewerage systems; (iii) Vodovod for the
Cacak water supply, sewerage and storm drainage systems; (iv) the Serbian Fund
for Underdeveloped Regions (SFUR) for the Regional Development Study; tv) the
Milosevac Farmers Cooperative for the Milosevac pilot irrigation sub-project;
and (vii) the Aleksinac Agro-Industrial Kombinat for the Aleksinac pilot
irrigation sub-project.



-3-
2.06     Local  consulting  firms  were  appointed  for  the  preparation  of
feasibility studies and preliminary engineering   These studies provided the
basis for project appraisal.
2.07     The time between Government's request for Bank financing and Board
presentation was about four years. This covered the gradual evolution of the
project concept and the need for the evaluation of technically complex
alternatives.  The project preparation entities performed comparatively well
and the consultant assignments were executed satisfactorily.
2.08     The Bank's contributions  during project preparation were:  (i) it
provided a vehicle - studies of alternative flood control methodology - which
avoided unrealistic investments in dams that would not have resolved  the
flooding problem; (ii) it provided a study for stimulating economic activity
in the least developed regions of the river basin; and (iii) recommended
financial cost recovery policies.
Proiect Obiectives
2.09     The  project  objectives  of  developing  low-cost  alternative  flood
control programs, providing a proposal to accelerate economic development in
the least developed areas, and developing safe and continuous water supply as
well as expanding sewerage services for Titovo Uzice and Cacak were achieved.
Project Description
2.10     The main components of the project were:
(a)  Flood Control, Water Resource Planning and Management:
i)   studies to develop lower-cost flood control programs such as
river diversion and dredging, land use zoning, modified building
codes  amongst  others;  and  early  warning  systems  for major
flooding;
(ii)    study to develop a model action program to improve water quality
in part of the Zapadna Morava watershed, as a pilot scheme for
the entire Morava River Basin; and
(iii)    study of ways to accelerate economic development in three of the
least developed regions i.e. Prokupulje, Leskovac and Vranje.
(b) Water supply and sewerage systems for Titovo Uzice including:
(i)    a concrete arch dam -' (70 mr high) on the Djetinja River at
Vrutci site, 12 km upstream of Titovo Uzice;
The dam was also designed for flood control, maintenance of minimum
river flow and other related purposes.



-4-
(ii)    raw water pipeline and water treatment plant; transmission and
distribution mains; pumping stations and reservoirs;
(iii)    sewerage system; and
(iv)    engineering design for a future sewage treatment plant.
(c) Water supply, sewerage and storm drainage systems for Cacak including:
(i)    wellfield development 2 km upstream of Cacak; collector pipeline
and reservoir; pumping station; transmission and distribution
mains; and balancing reservoirs;
(ii)    sewerage system and pumping stations;
(iii)    storm drains to alleviate local flooding; and
(iv)    engineering design for a future sewage treatment plant.
(d)  Two small pilot irrigation schemes, drawing supplies directly from
rivers or other sources.
The project was scheduled to be completed by December 31, 1979.
Loan Covenants and Conditions for Effectiveness
2.11     A loan agreement was entered into between the Bank and the RWF with
project agreements between the Bank and Bioktos, Vodovod, Milosevac and
Aleksinac. Subsidiary loan agreements were concluded between the RWF and the
other entities.
2.12     The maj6r covenants refered to: (i) the employment of consultants for
studies, engineering design and construction supervision; (ii) the provision
of necessary funds; (iii) cost sharing and operational pattern for the Vrutci
dam; (iv) auditing of accounts; and (v) tariff increases for cost recovery.
The financial covenants for Titovo Uzice and Cacak are discussed further in
Chapter V which deals with "Financial Performance."
2.13     The special conditions of effectiveness referred to the execution of
related project and subsidiary  loan agreements.   The  loan covenants  were
comprehensive,   and   adequately   covered   the   requirements   for   project
implementation and subsequent operations.   All covenants were substantially
complied with.

III. PROJECT INPLEMENrATION AND COST
Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01     The loan was declared effective on November 3, 1976 or about five
months after signature.
3.02     Local consulting firms were engaged at an  early stage  for final
engineering, preparation of tender documents and construction supervision.
The project start-up was timely.
Institutional Changes
3.03     The RWF was principally a financing and resource allocation agency.
As anticipated during appraisal, and allowed for in project documentation, the
Serbian Assembly passed legislation in 1975 calling for a fundamental reform
of the management of the Republic's water resources. This resulted in the
abolishment of RWF and the establishment of the RWCI and eight Water
Communities of Interest on a regional basis.
3.04     The  Water  Conmunities  function  as  independent  bodies  and  are
responsible for financial and technical matters in water resources allocation,
use and development.  The RWCI performs a coordinating role and provides
assistance in policy and regulatory matters as well as inter-regional
financing. The institutional changes were appropriate to sectoral development.
Revisions to the Scope of Work
3.05     Except for the Vrutci dam, only minor changes were made to the
appraised project package. Some redesign was undertaken and revisions were
made in storage tank capacities and lengths of water distribution mains and
sewer  collectors,  all  with  Bank  concurrence.   These  changes  raised  no
technical  issues  and  had  no  effect  on  the  cost  estimates.   Additional
excavation due to rock fractures on the right abutment of the Vrutci dam did
affect the cost of that component.
Implementation Schedule
3.06     A   zomparison   between   appraisal   estimates   and   the   actual
implementation of major project components (para. 2.10) is shown on Chart 1
and is sumanarized below.
3.07     Comments  on  the  flood  control,  Water  Resources  Planning  and
Management are:
(i) the Regional Economic Development study was completed as scheduled;
and
(ii) the implementation of the Flood Control and Water Quality studies was
more complicated than originally envisaged and the clearing process



-6-
was time consuming.  The studies were completed at the end of 1982,
about three years behind schedule.
3.08     Comments on the Vrutci dam are:
(i)  the construction works started about one year behind schedule because
of prolonged final engineering;
(ii) the dam was completed in mid-1984 and water impoundment has started,
i.e. with a four-year delay;
(iii) numerous problems were encountered during the execution of the
construction works.  These include: (a) delays in the submission of
detailed engineering drawings for various components; (b) poorer rock
foundation than envisaged, which necessitated complementary soil
surveys  and  more  extensive  rock  excavations;   (c)  inadequate
facilities for concrete making at initiation of construction; and (d)
unsatisfactory construction management in the early stage; and
(iv) delays  in  land  expropriation  (impounded  area)  and  in  tenants
relocation; the latter activity is expected to be completed in May
1984.
3.09     Comments on the Titovo Uzice water supply and sewerage systems are:
(i)  the raw water pipeline was completed at the end of 1980 but, because
of the delays in the Vrutci dam, the connection to the dam was only
finalized in late 1983;
(ii) treatment works, rese    rs and transmission mains were completed in
1980, or about one 3. .r behind schedule, and additional water for
treatment was temporarily pumped from an existing small impcuwL-dent;
and
(iii) the extensions to the water distribution and sewage networks were
rephased and finalized three years behind schedule at the end of
1982; this was mainly due to financial constraints;
3.10     Comments on the Cacak water supply and sewerage systems are:
(i)  the water production facilities were commissioned with only a slight
delay;
(ii) a major portion of the water distribution and sewage networks were
completed on schedule; the works were slightly delayed in some areas
resulting from town planning delays; and
(iii) the storm drains were completed with minor delays.
3.11     Comments on the pilot irrigation schemes are:



-7-
(i)  the  construction  of  the  Aleksinac  pilot  irrigation  system  was
completed in 1981, three years behind schedule, mainly because of
system  redesign,  procurement  and  construction  difficulties  and
inexperienced project management; and
(ii) the Milosevac pilot irrigation system faced the same difficilties as
Aleksinac and because of a procurement issue (para. 3.14 (iii)) the
deep well pumps have only recently been delivered with commissioning
expected by mid-1984.
Reporting
3.12     The  reporting  system  consisted  of  quarterly  and  annual  reports
utilizing key indicators as agreed upon.   All  reports were submitted on a
fairly regular basis.
Procurement
3.13     Consulting  firms  prepared  the  tender  and  contract  documents  and
performed  tender  evaluation.   This  was  done  on  a  timely  basis.   Bank
guidelines for procurement were followed throughout the construction period;
most  of  the  contracts  were  awarded  to  local  bidders.   Only one case of
misprocurement occurred in which, under ICB procedures, the contract for
submersible pumps for the Milosevac pilot irrigation scheme was awarded to a
foreign supplier. Due to internal problems, the import license was not issued
and the matter reverted to LCB procedures.   The Bank did not finance the
eventual acquisition.
3.14     Procurement of consultant services was acceptable to the Bank.  The
foreign consultant involvement was minor, being limited to the Flood Control
and Water Quality studies and the review panel for the Vrutci dam.
Project Costs
3.15     Projected and actual costs in Dinar and U.S. dollar equivalents are
shown in Annex 1, Tables 1 to 3, and are summarized below:

-8-
3.16     An analysis of the costs indicates that (i) the cost increases in
Dinar are significantly higher than in US$ because of the very high local
inflation coupled with Dinar devaluation; and (ii) the major cost increase can
be attributed to the Vrutci dam and to additional price increase caused by the
extended project implementation period.
3.17     The Vrutci dam is the largest project component.  An analysis of its
cost (in US$) indicates that: (i) its estimated and actual costs represent 27Z
and 32X respectively of total project costs; and (ii) its cost increased 71Z
over the estimate.  The increased cost is attributed to:  (i) substantially
higher inflation for a longer period of time than that estimated; (ii) delays
in construction at the outset due to weakness in contractor's management; and
(iii) additional excavation of the right abutment due to rock fracture.

3.19     Projected and actual Bank loan disbursements are shown in the Basic
Data, page (ii).  The disbursements started 6 months later and continued 24
months longer than projected.   The actual disbursement period was about 8
years.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers and the Borrower and
Project Executing Agencies
3.20     The consulting firms for the Flood Hazard Adjustment, Water Quality
and Regional Development Studies performed very well and submitted high
quality reports. The consultant works for final engineering and construction
supervision for the water supply and sewerage facilities was very satisfactory
regarding Cacak, but contributed in part to the delay experienced at Titovo
Uzice.
3.21     The quality of works was generally good and most of  the  testing
results  were  initially  approved.   RWCI  and  the  other  project  executing
agencies performed well overall.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Introduction
4.01     The areas addressed in the evaluation of the operational performance
are: (i) achievements resulting from the flood, water resource, and regional
development studies; (ii) achievements in improved water supply and sewerage
services; and (iii) the impact of the pilot irrigation schemes.
Flood Control and Water Quality Studies
4.02     The immediate impact of the Flood Control Study are:
(i) a number of dams initially proposed to be executed could not be
economically justified and were deleted from the Five-Year plan;
(ii) flood warning systems have been established, and urban planning has
taken into account recommendations made in the study for 20 communes;
the flood insurance system has been amended; and
(iii) investments to be made under the present five year plan are mainly
based on the study.
4.03     The immediate impact of the Water Quality study is:
(i) the study was prepared for a limited geographical area but its
results and recommendations are being applied on a wider basis; and
(ii) the design of four proposed sewage treatment works has been based on
findings of the study.
4.04     These studies are very comprehensive and well prepared, and have been
well received by all concerned authorities.  They could also be used as a
basis for similar studies to be undertaken in other regions and Republics.
Regional Development Study
4.05     The Regional Development study was well prepared and served as a
basis for the Morava Regional Development II project, which is partly financed
by Bank Loan 1951-YU of US$87 million.
Titovo Uzice Water Supply and Sewage Systems
4.06     An evaluation of the Titovo Uzice Water Supply and Sewerage project
component (Annex I, Table 5) may be sunmiarized as follows:
(i) the Vrutci dam will provide a reliable water supply source for the
foreseeable future;



-10-
(ii) the projected population increase was over-estimated by about 13% in
1983;
(iii) the percentage of population served by the water supply system has
increased from 62% (1976) to 91% (1983);
(iv) the percentage of population served by the sewerage system has
increased from 43% (1976) to 71% (1983) as compared to an appraisal
estimate of 88%; and
(v)  water production has been between 10% and 14% lower than forecast
most likely the result of the slowdown in economic development which
occurred beginning in 1979.
4.07     The  delay  in the Vrutci  dam necessitated  the construction of a
temporary pumping station at the existing Velika Brana dam. This has entailed
significantly higher pumping costs.  Water metering is still unsatisfactory
and the level of unaccounted-for water might be largely related to metering
inaccuracy. The Vrutci dam serves multi-purposes and water allocation as a
base for cost distribution has been decided upon.
4.08     With  the  project  completed and the major  investments undertaken
Bioktos will concentrate its future efforts on the extension of the water
distribution and sewerage systems and on the improvement of water metering.
Cacak Water Supply and Sewerage Systems
4.09     The original proposal for water source development (the Semedraz dam)
was changed to infiltration wells along the Zapadna Morava river based upon
economic considerations  .  This solution will be sufficient to about 1986.
The yield of the wells corresponds approximately to initial expectations. A
study was undertaken under the project for the next stage water source
development with a reconmmendation to use and treat the river water for which
the construction works are scheduled to commence by 1985.
4.10     An evaluation of achievements made under the Cacak water supply and
sewerage project component (Annex I, Table 5) is summarized below:
(i)  the percentage of population served by the water supply system in
1983 was 72% as compared to the appraisal estimate of 91%; however,
the estimated and actual number of people served would be about
equal; population not served by the project is scattered, living in
fringe  areas  and  relying  on  private wells.   The  percentage  of
population served by the sewerage system in 1982 is 57% as compared
to the appraisal estimate of 84%; the actual number of people served
is only about 7,000 less than estimated; and
(ii) actual and estimated water production has been in comparatively close
agreement; and the actual per capita water consumption in 1983 was
154 l/d as compared to estimated 162 l/d.

4.11     The  urban   environmental  conditions  have  improved  through  the
sewerage collection system with sewage discharge now located further
down-stream from the populated areas.
Pilot Irrigation Plants
4.12     The Aleksinac pilot irrigation plant began operation in 1982.  It has
enabled two harvests per year instead of one and has encouraged a modification
of the cropping pattern. During certain periods of the year silty water has
created some problems in the sprinkler irrigation system, and for certain
crops. The land consolidation under the project has been completed, and a
follow-up covering 8,000 ha has started.
4.13     In Milosevac the land consolidation has been completed but since the
irrigation system is not yet operational the benefits cannot be assessed. The
water supply is based on groundwater and there is no silt problem.
4.14     The  Secretariat  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Water  Economy  is
implementing a monitoring program and has established reference data for two
years of "dry farming", which will continue during five years of "wet
farming". Data is not available to reach definitive conclusions of the impact
of the pilot irrigation schemes, but the initial results seem to be promising
and follow-up should be continued.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Introduction
5.01     This chapter reviews  the financial performance  of the  operating
entities of the two water supply and sewage systems - Bioktos and Vodovod -
and  the  financing  plan  for  the  RWCI.  Detailed  comparative  financial
statements are attached in Annex 2, Table 1, 2, 3, and 4 for Bioktos, Tables
5, 6, 7 and 8 for Vodovod, and Table 9 for RWCI.
"Bioktos" - Titovo Uzice
Financial Performance
5.02     Bioktos is an umbrella organization providing a variety of municipal
services consisting of watcrc supply and sewerage (the project divisions of
Bioktos), and maintenance of parks, cemeteries, street cleaning, and solid
waste collection and disposal, and City markets, (non-project divisions).
5.03     The principal elements of its financial performance are analyzed as
follows:
(i) Water and sewerage billable volumes were 25Z and 35Z respectively
less than volumes forecast at appraisal although the number of
connections exceeded (water) and approximated (sewerage) appraisal
forecasts. Bioktos' management attributes the lower volumes to the
reduced rate of economic development and escalating inflation that
occurred from 1979 forwar-d. Although supply from the Vrutci dam will
only become available durinz the last half of 1984, the temporary
system in use has been adequate for current supply purposes.
(ii) Tariff adjustments  were  made annually.   In current prices, 1982
average tariffs approximated appraisal forecasts but in constant
prices the 1982 average tariffs were about 50S of the level
forecast.  The primary  reasons for this  result  from  the  tariff
approval process which approved only the previous year's inflation in
the current year - thus creating a one year lag. Since inflation was
increasing annually during the construction period, the lag became
more accentuated as time went on.
(iii) Bioktos' operating costs per m3 in constant prices increased by 95S
(through 1982) for water supply and by 54X for sewerage while
appraisal forecast (excluding costs attributable to the operation of
the Vrutci dam from 1980 onward) were expected to decline. Higher
than estimated, unaccounted-for water is a contributing factor to the
increased  cost.   The  operational  cost  should  decline with  the
coumissioning of the Vrutci dam which will provide water by gravity
flow whereas the present water supply is pumped. Nonetheless, the
reduction would be relatively small since energy costs in 1982 were
only 11% of total operating costs.

water supply and wastewater works which came entirely from Social Funds.
2/ The investment cost of the Vrutci dam to the end of 1982 was transferred
from RWCI records to those of Bioktos (D644.0) together with the RWCI
investment contribution  (D584.8).  The difference between the two were
funds supplied by the Commune of Titovo Uzice and are included in the line
item "Social Funds". Since the dam did not form part of the Titovo Uzice
appraisal sources and application of funds, its cost, the investment
transfer,  and   the  difference  were  eliminated  in  calculating  the
percentages. The final cost of the Vrutci Dam (para. 5.13) of Din 914.4
million includes 1983 and 1984 expenditures which will be transferred to
Bioktos.



-14-
5.05     Strict  comparability  between  appraisal  and  actual  is  difficult
because operating and maintenance costs of th.e Vrutci dam after 1980 are
included in appraisal data. Ncnetheless the major changes from appraisal are
the following:
(i) actual project investment was appr.aximately 65% higher than appraisal
forecasts (in US$) which results from 61% of the investment having
occurred in the firsL 4-1/2 years of the project period when local
inflation was far in excess of estimated, but before devaluation of
the dinar was initiated; and
(ii) the Mutual Reserve Loans projected at appraisal to generate 25% of
requirements were not utilized since they were considered to be too
expensive by the authorities.  Instead, the commune of Titovo Uzice
provided almost all funds not generated from the Bank loan through
self-imposed taxes.  As a result, actual debt service was about 25%
of that projected at appraisal.
Financial Covenants
5.06     The major financial covenants in the Project Agreement are as follows:
(i)  Section 4.02 required annual audits of the financial statements and
supplemental letter 3, dated June 14, 1976, specified the special
audit group of the Social Accounting Service which was set-up with
Bank assistance in 1975 to audit Bank financed projects.  By the end
of 1976, when this requirement was to come into force, the special
audit group was more than fully occupied with existing Bank loans and
was  unable  to  accommodate  this  loan's  requirement.    Bioktos'
statements were however subjected to the normal annual audit by the
Social Accounting Service, and the results of the audits were recast
into international format by the implementing agency.  In 1982, the
Special Audit Group was able to provide statements which reflected
the same data presented by Bioktos. Thus, the substance and content
of the requirement were fully met.
(ii) Section 4.03 (and also Section 4.03 of the Loan Agreement) required
an agreement between Bioktos and RWCI regarding the sharing of
operations and maintenance costs as well as amortization of the
capital cost of the Vrutci dam.  A study to that effect will be
completed with the recommendations put into effect by June 30, 1984
in time for the commissioning of the dam.
(iii) Section 4.04 required that:
(a) revenues from the project entities (water supply and sewerage
only) should be sufficient to cover all operating costs,
excluding depreciation, full debt service, adequate increases to
working capital, contributions to reserve and other authorized
funds, and provide 20% of 1981 investment funds and 30%
thereafter (both dates are after appraised project completion);
and



-15-
(b) for Bioktos non-project divisions a similar revenue covenant was
formulated;
It is not possible to assess separately the compliance of Bioktos'
project   and   non-project   divisions   without   making   arbitrary
allocations of financial data. However, on an overall basis, Bioktos
did meet the requirements for all years from 1977 through 1981,
though it fell short of the goal in 1982 primarily because of tariff
and operating cost problems (para. 5.03 ii and iii); and
(iv) Section 4.05 was a debt limitation covenant which did not come into
force since Bioktos' debt service cover was greater than the 1.5
limitation.
'"odovod" - Cacak
Financial Performance
5.07     Unlike Bioktos', Vodovod's services are limited to provision of water
supply, collection of sewage and stormwater drainage which were all project
related.   The  principal  elements  of  its  financial  performance  can  be
summarized as follows:
(i)  actual  connections  for  water  and  sewerage  exceeded  appraisal
forecasts  by  71  and  10%  re.pectively;  however  volumes  sold  or
col.ected during the implementation period were 171  (water supply)
and 21X (sewage surcharge) below appraisal fz*ecastz; Cacak's
management believes that the lower sales volumes could be partially
attributed to stagnation in the economy from 1979 forward;
(ii) appraisal tariffs for the period were projected to increase 672 in
constant prices in order to provide partial financing of proposed
large post-project  investments.   Actual tariffs stayed at the 1975
constant price level throughout the period primarily because the
tariffs approved in the early years of construction exceeded local
inflation while subsequent price controls negated those gains; and
3
(iii) Vodovod mane-ed to reduce its constant price operating costs per m3
in both water at._ sewerage despite unaccounted-for water in excess of
that projected.

the project implementation period of 1976-1982 are compared in the table below:

5.09     Analysis  of  the  changes  between  appraisal  and  actual  are  the
following:
(i)  at appraisal, about Din 250.0 million of post-project  investments
which were to have been financed by local loans of Din 150.0 million,
Commune contributions of Din 32.8 million, other contributions of Din
13.2 million and internal cash generation of Din 54.0 million have
been postponed because present facilities permitted rephasing of the
next facility expansion; and
' ~   Includes 1983 investments of Din. 33.5 million, Bank disbursements of
Din. 8.4 million, and Semedraz contributions of Din. 25.1 million.



-17-
(ii) the increase to project cost, resulting from higher than antici-
pated  internal  inflation  was  fully  provided  through  increased
contributions from the Semedraz Fund, and through higher local funds
from the Bank loan as a result of currency devaluation.
Financial Covenants
5.10     There were three financial covenants in the Vodovod Project Agreement:
(i) Section 4.02 required that its annual financial statements be
audited, and submitted to the Bank. The same comment applies here as
was given in para. 5.07 for Bioktos;
(ii) Section 4.03 required that its annual revenues would provide
sufficient   funds  to  cover  operations,  maintenance  and  admin-
istrative  costs   (excluding  depreciation),   full   debt   service,
increases to working capital, contributions to reserve and other
authorized funds, and following project completion, 30% of the
average three-year future investment costs.  This was complied with
in all years except 1982; and
(iii) Section 4.04, a limitation on debt for non-project purposes with
which Vodovod complied.

5.12     The funding requirements increased by 193Z over appraisal primarily due
to delays in implementing the Vrutci Dam.  The municipality of Titovo Uzice,
increased its percentage contribution of total funds required to 27Z of the cost
of the dam - approximately in line with its eventual use of the dam water
supply.   The Serbian Republic provided most of the additional funds required
from its annual budget. Despite the effects of accelerating internal inflation
and devaluation of the dinar, RWCI arranged for the timely generation of funds,
and none of the construction delays of any of the RWCI components resulted from
lack of funding.

VI.  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01     The institutional objective of establishing the Republic and regional
water management authorities has been achieved.
6.02     Under   the   project,   RWCI   was   directly   responsible  for  the
implementation of the consultant studies and for the construction of the
Vrutci  dam.   It  has  established  a  small  but very competent staff with
requisite specializations and has adjusted well to a rapidly increasing work
load.
6.03     Bioktos and Vodovod were well established at project preparation and
their organizational structures have not changed nor has their staffing
pattern.   Through  the  exposure  to the execution of a rather complicated
project their planning, design and construction supervision capability has
improved.



-20-
VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
7.01     The Bank established a good rapport and working relationship with the
Borrower (RWCI) and the other project implementing agencies.  The Bank is
considered to have played a major role in reducing planned cost-intensive dam
structures, development of studies for low-cost flood control measures and
economic  development,  in  project  identification  and  preparation  and  its
supervision  has  been  useful.   The  Borrower,  Bioktos  and  Vodovod  are
appreciative of Bank support and advice.



-21-
VIII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
8.01     The main objectives of the project were:
(i)  to demonstrate the reduced cost of flood control measures coupared
with the high cost of the official multiple dam construction
program.   This was accomplished  through  the flood hazard studies
which are now being reviewed by other Republics for adaptation;
(ii) to provide a basis for actions to be taken for economic development
in the least developed regions as well as pollution control measures
to improve water quality. The economic study served as the basis for
Loan 1951-YU, the Morava Regional Development II Project; and
(iii) to  reduce  the  health  hazards  associated  with  intemittent  water
service by providing adequate water supply and sewerage services to
the towns of Titovo Uzice and Cacak.
8.02     All the required objectives of the pFoject have been achieved.

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
9.01          The following conclusions can be reached:
Mi)  the   project  was   technically  well  conceived  and  represented
reasonable-cost solutions, para. 2.04;
(ii) the major objectives have been achieved, para 2.09;
(iii) the Republic and regional water management authorities serve their
purposes  well  and  provide  a  sound  basis  for  further  sector
development, paras 6.02 and 6.03;
(iv) a new pattern has been set on the approach to flood and water quality
control and monitoring, paras. 4.02 and 4.03;
(v)  the  recommendations  in  the Regional  development  study are being
implemented through a follow-up project para. 4.05; and
(vi) the water supply and sewerage services in Titovo Uzice and Cacak have
been improved, paras. 4.06 - 4.11.

Quality Studies was not fully assessed.
