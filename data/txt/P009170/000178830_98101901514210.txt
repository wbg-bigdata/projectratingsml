APPRAISAL OF
MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Morava River basin in Serbia covers 12% of Yugoslavia's area and
contains an estimated population of 3.6 million. Water-related problems have
always thwarted the region's economic development. In the past the main problem
was the repeated flooding of agricultural lands. This flooding continues, and
as the population is increasingly urbanized and industrialized (mostly in the
river valleys) the flood hazard has increased. At the same time problems of
urban water supply and water pollution have grown enormously.
ii.       Serbian water planners began focussing on such problems basin-wide
in 1958 and by 1965 had produced a master plan for the regulation of the Morava
River flows. Mechanisms were created to generate funds and build structures
to implement this plan, but the results of the programs of the first ten years
have been disappointing. It is now appreciated that water resource planning
must be improved by revising the economic methodology and by broadening the
planning objectives so that physical systems to control flows are not the only
programs considered. At the same time the institutional arrangements for man-
aging water resources are being substantially altered in accordance with
Yugoslavia's 1974 constitution and the principle of decentralized decision-
making. Under creation now is the Morava Region Water Community of Interest,
a socio-political body with the mandate to manage the water resources for the
benefit of the region.
iii.      The proposed project is fairly complex because it is intended to
support Serbian initiatives to improve the planning and management of water re-
sources in the Morava region, while also helping to provide badly needed water
and wastewater facilities for two small, industrialized towns. The research
component includes three action-oriented studies (adjustments to flood hazards,
water quality improvement and regional development) plus two irrigation pilot
projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of low cost supplementary irrigation.
The water supply and wastewater systems will be substantially improved in the
towns of Titovo Uzice and Cacak, where industrial water demands exceed those
for domestic use and where the number of people to be served will increase by
70% during the project period.
iv.       The project costs are estimated to total US$51.4 million equivalent,
with an estimated foreign exchange component of US$16.2 million. Interest dur-
ing construction on the proposed Bank loan of US$20.0 million would add a fur-
ther US$4.5 million in foreign exchange costs. Thus, the proposed loan would
be equivalent to 97% of the project's foreign exchange requirements including



- ii -
the interest during construction. The various components of the project would
be implemented by six different beneficiaries. The Serbian Water Fund would
be the borrower and would onlend portions of the Bank loan on Bank terms to all
other beneficiaries. All remaining project financing would be provided by the
various beneficiaries.
v.        Some 91% of the project expenditures relate to expansions of the water
supply, wastewater and stormwater systems in Titovo Uzice and Cacak, which are
expected to be constructed during the period 1976-1979.
vi.       All procurement would be in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines.
Advance contracting on certain critical elements of the water supply systems
may result in the Bank being asked to finance retroactively up to US$1.0 million
equivalent of approved contract expenditures. Force account is appropriate for
certain works, whose value should not exceed US$4.0 million equivalent.
vii.      It is expected that the Morava Region Water Community of Interest,
after it is created and staffed, will replace the Serbian Water Fund, in which
case it will assume all the existing responsibilities and obligations of the
Fund, including the role of Borrower of the Bank loan.
viii.     The project is technically and economically sound.  The research com-
ponent should aid considerably in the economic development of the Morava region.
The infrastructure components for the towns of Titovo Uzice and Cacak are the
least cost solution to meet realistic objectives and will make significant im-
provements in the public health and environment of these towns. The consumers
who will benefit from the water supply systems, industrial and domestic, are
presently paying water tariffs which are too low. Water charges will be in-
creased substantially, to approach the long run marginal cost for water in
each town, permitting each town to finance a reasonable proportion of the fa-
cilities required for the project and for future expansion of their water sup-
ply and wastewater systems.
ix.       On the basis of agreements reached during negotiations, the project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$20 million to the Serbian Water Fund for a
period of 20 years, including 4-1/2 years of grace, with onlending of portions
of the loan to the beneficiaries outlined in the report.



APPRAISAL OF
MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has
requested a Bank loan to help finance a project to improve the management of
water resources in the Morava River basin in the Socialist Republic of Serbia
and to expand and supply the wastewater systems in the towns of Titovo Uzice
and Cacak.
1.02      Economic development in the Morava River basin has always been im-
peded by water resources problems, of which the most obvious has been recur-
ring floods. A master plan prepared in 1965 proposed a technical solution to
these problems which called for a massive construction program to build 106
dams and many hundreds of kilometers of dykes, river training and anti-
erosion works. The proposed first stage of this master plan, including 18
dams, was to be implemented in the 20-year period 1966-1985.
1.03      The Government first requested Bank assistance for the project in
1972 when it sought financing for eight independent sub-projects, comprising
seven multipurpose dams and water supply facilities for a small town to be
supplied by a dam already under construction. Extensive reviews of the plan-
ning procedures and proposed project components have been carried out by a
series of Bank missions, aided by staff from the FAO cooperative program and
consultants. The various missions have consistently reported that economic
development in the Morava region is indeed retarded by a wide range of water-
related problems; that water resources planning has focused exclusively on in-
dependent structures to regulate flows; and that economic considerations have
been negleced. Annex 1 provides a chronology of the development of the pres-
ent project. Because most of the project components originally proposed were
uneconomic or incomplete, the project definition has evolved considerably as a
consequence of the appraisal process.
1.04      This report, written mainly by Messrs. Grover and Jones (with as-
sistance from Mr. Hodges on Annexes 7, 8 and 9 and Mr. Laeyendecker on Annexes
34 and 35) is based on information obtained by the various missions, from the
Serbian authorities (particularly the Morava River Corporation and the Serbian
Water Fund), from the communal authorities in Titovo Uzice and Cacak, and from
their engineering consultants (Energoprojekt and Jaroslav Cerni Institute,
both of Belgrade). A list of reports and documents providing background
information on the proposed project is provided in Annex 2.

II. THE MORAVA REGION AND ITS WATER RESOURCES
The Region
2.01      The Morava River drainage basin shown on Map 11603 covers 38,000 sq
km, an area which is 20% larger than Belgium and four times the area of Cyprus.
81% of the Morava watershed is in central Serbia. The 1975 population in the
Morava watershed is estimated at 3.6 million, with 85% in Serbia proper (i.e.
excluding the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina). An estimated 60%
of the population is still rural, engaged mainly in small-scale agriculture in
the private sector. Due to the generally mountainous terrain, the habitable
valleys are relatively densely populated and the hills and mountains sparsely
so. The less developed areas are in the upstream end of the catchment, where
arable land is very limited and employment opportunities likewise. More de-
tailed information on the region is provided in Annex 3..
2.02      The towns in the region, which are relatively small (Nis, the largest,
has some 200,000 residents) continue to expand as the population becomes more
urbanized. Certain rural communes are losing population in absolute terms.
In accordance with the Yugoslav policy of decentralization of industry, almost
all towns have industrial plants (machinery, metal goods, textiles, leather,
pulp and paper, food and tobacco processing, etc.) including several which are
quite large (e.g. automobile plant-at Kragujevac, copper and aluminum process-
ing plant near Titovo Uzice). Many mining operations exist throughout the
area (lignite, lead, magnesium and chrome).
2.03      Transportation links have been strengthened to facilitate economic
development, partly with the assistance of previous Bank loans. The Belgrade-
Bar railway is now operational between Belgrade and Titovo Uzice and main
lines serve most towns in the region. Good highways exist in the main valleys,
including the European highways from Yugoslavia to Greece and to Bulgaria and
Turkey. However, the secondary road system is weak and many of the mountainous
areas are poorly served. The Morava River system is not presently used for
shipping but the Greek and Yugoslav Governments have recently been discussing
the possibility of making the Morava and Vardar-Axios river systems navigable,
to create a waterway between the Danube and the Aegean Sea at Salonika. Such
a development, which presently seems remote, would have a major impact on the
Morava region.
Water Resources and Regional Development
2.04      The Morava River, the dominant physical feature in the region, is a
large perennial river. Mean annual precipitation over the basin is 735 mm
and the river's average annual discharge into the Danube is 255 m3/second.
There are many water-related problems in the basin, most of which are due to
the variations in stream flow. The catchment is predominately hilly and
mountainous and the few dams existing and under construction (Map 11603) pro-
vide relatively little reservoir storage. Accordingly, river flows are highly



- 3 -
dependent on seasonal precipitation and snowmelt. Flooding and erosion are
perennial problems caused by too much water, but at other times low flows are
responsible for another category of problems: limited water for domestic and
industrial water supplies, irrigation, waste dilution and navigation.
2.05      Flood hazards and recurring flood damages, which have always had a
major impact on development in the Morava region, have become even more signif-
icant in modern times. An estimated 2,880 km2 of valley bottom lands, repres-
enting the best agricultural land as well as most of the towns and economic in-
frastructure, are exposed to flooding. Between 1920 and 1965, a total of 36
floods of varying intensity were recorded in the basin, 20 of which lasted for
more than 30 days. More recent floods have had admittedly imprecise estimates
of flood damages as follows: 1965 - US$61 million; 1969 - US$27 million; 1970 -
US$39 million. Approximately 60% of the damages are suffered by agriculture.
The average area flooded annually in the basin has been estimated at 1,400 km2
with damages of the order of US$14 million annually. Local floods in the
springtime are frequently aggravated by ice jams, when the northern flowing
peak discharges are temporarily dammed by masses of river ice.
2.06      Two categories of problems result from the soil erosion which take
place in the basin during periods of intense precipitation. An estimated 60%
of the river basin is liable to severe erosion (due to slopes, soil types, etc.)
and some 4,800 km2 have been badly eroded. Such erosion removes high quality
topsoil and decreases the agricultural potential of the land. Its deposition
in the river system as sediment -also concerns the planners since such sediment-
ation reduces channel capacities, thus increasing the potential flood hazard.
Reservoir siltation is a particular concern in the Djerdap hydropower and ship-
lock complex on the Danube, (about 150 km downstream of its junction with the
Morava) whose backwater extends to Belgrade and increases water levels at the
mouth of the Morava by up to 3 meters. Under the Djerdap agreement between
Yugoslavia and Romania, a special fund of Din 500 million (US$27.8 million)
was established for the construction of projects in Yugoslavia which would re-
duce sedimentation in the Djerdap reservoir.
2.07      Irrigation in the Morava region has been limited.  Only 20,000 ha are
irrigated, compared to an estimated 700,000 ha which have potential for irriga-
tion.l/ There are several reasons for this lack of irrigation development.
Moderate precipitation permits rainfed agriculture, giving the farmers only
modest incentives to turn to more intensive irrigation. However the hot, dry
summers restrict cultivation under rainfed conditions to grain crops, while
more remunerative crops such as sugar beets, forage crops, fruits and vege-
tables give either low returns or cannot be grown at all. Sector organization
has been poor, with the private farmers receiving little assistance from the
1/ Irrigation of some 24,000 ha in the Ibar project (partially financed
by Bank Loan 777-YU) will depend on the Gazivode reservoir now under con-
struction (Map 11603).



- 4 -
government. Large-scale irrigation schemes have not been possible because
of the unreliable river flows, which are lowest in the summer month periods of
peak water demands. In this region the type of irrigation system likely to be
most economic is a low cost system providing water for supplementary irriga-
tion, but previous planning for irrigation development was based on high cost
schemes involving large dams and long canals.
2.08      Soil Drainage is a related problem in low lying agricultural lands,
aggravated by the tight soils in these valley plains. An estimated 90,000 ha
throughout the basin have drainage problems, with groundwater and surface
water each accounting for about 50% of the problem.
2.09      Since most of the urban centers are in the river valleys, water
supply for people and industry depends on the river flows or groundwater in
alluvial aquifers. In the past, there was little problem with respect to
quantity, but increasing urbanization has frequently exceeded the capacity of
local water supply systems to meet growing demands. This same urbanization
(and also changed agricultural practices) have contributed to recent and
severe degradation in the water quality of the rivers throughout much of the
region. Wastewater treatment is the exception rather than the rule and the
dilution capability of the rivers in low flow periods (generally coinciding
with periods of maximum water use) is so limited that many sections of the
river can hardly sustain fish. Since this polluted water is the principal
source for downstream communities, the public health implications are obvious.
This sector is discussed in more detail in paras. 2.21 to 2.23.
2.10      There is no large scale hydropower development in the Morava re-
gion. At present some 20 small plants have a total installed capacity of
85 Mw. The hydroelectric power potential of the region is estimated to
total approximately 7,000 Gwh/year, of which only about 5% is presently
exploited.
Water Resources Planning and Management
2.11      Only recently have systematic attempts been made to analyze and
propose solutions for the water-related problems affecting development in
the Morava region. In 1958, the Serbian Assembly created the Directorate
for the Regulation of the Morava Basin. This group focussed mainly on the
flooding problem, proposing its solution through regulation of river flows.
A large number of related engineering studies I/ throughout the basin cul-
minated in 1965 in a master plan for the phased development of a river
regulation program. Subsequently, the Serbian Assembly approved the 20-year
construction program, the first stage of the plan implementation. The main
elements in the master plan and recommended first stage can be summarized
as follows:
1/ Carried out principally by the Jaroslav Cerni Institute for Development
of Water Resources, a Belgrade enterprise specializing in hydraulic
analysis and planning.

2.12      Hundreds of kilometers of flow regulation works had already been con-
structed throughout the river valleys by 1965 (see Annex 3) but the master plan
sparked an ambitious program to increase efforts to regulate flows. A devast-
ating flood in May, 1965 provided a timely incentive to construct the recom-
mended projects in the Morava region.
2.13      The Serbian Water Fund (SWF) was created in 1965 to generate re-
sources for these works and to deal with similar problems in other river basins
(details in Annexes 4 and 31). In 1967, the Serbian Assembly passed the Law on
Waters which was intended, among other things, to rationalize the use of water
resources and improve water quality. Also in 1967, the Morava River Corpora-
tion (MRC) was created to implement the master plan. Since 1972, MRC has been
a consortium of some 10 independent "water economy enterprises," one of which
(Velika Morava Enterprise) was the planning group and the others were con-
struction enterprises.
2.14      In the ten years following the completion of the master plan, the
progress in water management throughout the basin has been much less than
originally envisaged. Water-related problems continue to frustrate economic
development. Of the 18 dams proposed in the first stage program, only three
are under construction. 1/ Better progress has been achieved on other struc-
tures, as described in Annex 3. Lack of funds has been one obvious constraint.
2.15      The 1965 master plan was a commendable attempt, the first ever, to
systematically analyze the water resources problems throughout the Morava
region. Unfortunately, it concentrated entirely on structural measures to
regulate flow, ignoring other aspects of river basin management which would be
expected in a more comprehensive plan. It was virtually devoid of any meaning-
ful economic analysis. There is little evidence that least cost solutions have
been determined for each proposed structure. Benefit measurement was exceed-
ingly weak (partly because system analysis was lacking) and no account has
been taken of the dynamics of the proposed construction program. The plan
gives no guidance to decision makers as to the optimum staging of facility
construction.
2.16      Concerning multi-purpose reservoirs, the concept of the plan seems
to have been to build the dams for flow regulation and later on perhaps find
1/   Gazivode (in Ibar project, assisted by Bank Loan 777-YU), Bovan and
Celije. See Map 11603.

some other productive uses for the stored water. 1/ When such reservoirs
were proposed, the plans included the dam but excluded facilities required to
benefit from the water to be stored: water supply systems, irrigation sys-
tems or hydroelectric power plants. By concentrating exclusively on flow
regulation, several activities related to river flows were only partially
dealt with (those above, also water quality control and soil conservation
practices), while other water-related sectors were completedly ignored (e.g.
water supply from groundwater, fisheries, recreation and wildlife).
2.17      The 1965 master plan for the Morava River basin was little more than
a physical plan to reduce flooding and erosion and to improve river water qual-
ity by augmenting low flows. There was no consideration whatsoever of alter-
native non-structural solutions. Improved flood forecasting or flood plain
zoning were not considered as a means to reduce flood hazards. Water quality
improvement through process changes and/or appropriate treatment of domestic
and industrial wastes (rather than dilution) was ignored. Improved land-use
practices to reduce erosion and pollution from agricultural areas were sim-
ilarly ignored.
2.18      These planning deficiencies have been accompanied by difficulties in
implementation which are in part a consequence of the Yugoslav decentralization
of decision-making. Water resources management is nominally the responsibility
of the Serbian Secretary for Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy, 2/ but
individual enterprises (industrial, power or agricultural) and communes have
a great deal of independence when spending funds on water-related activities
to benefit themselves. At the same time it is extremely difficult for such
relatively autonomous interest groups to collaborate together for regional or
multipurpose projects. MRC was designated as the enterprise for detailed plan-
ning and implementation of the 1965 master plan and its regional construction
enterprises have been active in constructing and maintaining local flow re-
gulation facilities. However, the finances for the program are provided by
SWF whose investment plans are approved annually by the Serbia Assembly.
In these circumstances, the MRC planners have not had a major decision-
making role in water resources projects in the Morava region.
2.19      In 1975 the Serbian Assembly passed new legislation calling for a
fundamental reform of the management of the Republic's water resources. In
accordance with the 1974 constitution of Yugoslavia, Serbia's new Law on
Water Management calls for the establishment of three regional "communities
of interest" to coordinate water resource development for the benefit of all
users and producers in each region. The Morava Region Water Community of
Interest (MRWCI) will be responsible for the largest region, including the
1/   This is the actual situation for the Bovan and Celije reservoirs now
under construction.
2/   The Federal Government and other republics each have a separate
Secretariat for Water Economy, rather than including these functions
in a larger Secretariat, as in Serbia.



Pcinja and Dragovishtitsa drainage basins in southern Serbia (Map 11603).
MRWCI will be basically a self-managed socio-economic organization, free to
undertake its responsibilities as it sees fit. Appropriate expert groups or
technical organizations may be engaged for specific functions. A Republican
Water Community of Interest is also to be established as a co-ordinating body.
Present legislation calls for the establishment of MRWCI and the Republic
Water Community of Interest by June 30, 1976 and for the automatic dissolu-
tion of SWF on that date. However, the Executive Council of Serbia has now
decided that the legislation should be amended to provide additional time for
establishing MRWCI and to allow the concurrent existence of both MRWCI and
SWF, so as to permit an orderly transfer of responsibilities. The necessary
amending legislation has been presented to the Serbian Legislative Assembly
and is expected to be passed promptly. Further information is provided in
Annex 3.
2.20      In 1973 the UNDP agreed to finance a two-year project called
"Computer Control of the Water Resources Systems in the Morava River Basin".
This project is mainly concerned with models to store and manipulate flow and
water quality data. The Velika Morava Enterprise, the planning branch of MRC,
is designated as the responsible agency but most counterpart staff are being
provided by local consultants (principally the Mihailo Pupin Institute of
Belgrade).
Water Supply and Wastewater Sector
2.21      In the Morava region, as throughout Yugoslavia, the responsibility
for water supply and wastewater disposal rests with the communes. Traditional-
ly the towns and villages relied on groundwater (springs and wells) to provide
abundant supplies of high quality water. Surface waters were ample to carry
away any wastes which did not infiltrate into the ground. But increased
urbanization and industrialization, particularly in the past twenty years, have
seriously strained the modest facilities in the urban areas and at the present
time water shortages and increasingly polluted rivers and groundwater are com-
mon throughout most of Serbia. In addition to the recent rapid growth in
demand for such services, the present problems are due to several factors:
(a) most towns are small and lack the technical expertise to plan
and implement the infrastructure necessary to cope with growth;
(b) the awareness of the consequences and costs of water pollution,
particularly that caused by industries, is relatively recent.
Thus insufficient attention has been paid to investments for
pollution control, since they have been regarded as unproductive;
(c) local communes have made few attempts to consider regional solu-
tions, particularly for wastewater disposal, where most of the
pollution affects other communities downstream;
(d) lack of capital has retarded efforts to construct adequate
facilities.



- 8-
2.22      In many communes the capital scarcity is being partially overcome by
self-imposed taxing schemes which generate some of the funds necessary to build
water supply and wastewater systems. Unfortunately, the physical situation
usually gets quite bad before the saving campaign starts. Since several years
of savings are generally required to finance any significant construction pro-
gram, delays in providing improved infrastructure result. High rates of in-
flation in recent years have also reduced the motivation for accumulating local-
ly saved funds and depleted their real value. Nevertheless, such financial
self-reliance is imperative, since republican sources of capital (particularly
SWF) are unavailable except for flow regulation facilities. This capital con-
straint distorts decision-making so that communities become anxious to have
dams built in their locality, financed mainly by SWF, rather than seek more
economic solutions such as groundwater sources which would have to be financed
entirely locally. For similar reasons, the communes hope their water quality
problems can be solved by low flow augmentation from SWF-financed dams rather
than from local treatment facilities which they must finance themselves.
2.23      Serbian planners have advised that the primary infrastructure com-
ponent regarding economic development in the Morava region at this time is de-
pendable supplies of water for the people and industries in the urban areas.
Accordingly, the Secretariat for Town Planning, Housing and Communal Affairs
has engaged consultants (Jaroslav Cerni Institute) to review water supply re-
quirements and water quality problems throughout Serbia to the year 2000 and
to prepare a program for water supply and wastewater disposal facilities.
This predominately technical study is scheduled for completion in 1976.
Water Supply and Wastewater Situation in Titovo Uzice and Cacak
2.24      The town of Titovo Uzice has an estimated 1975 population of 46,000
including nearby Sevojno, site of a large copper and aluminum processing com-
plex. Population is presently growing at about 4.5% annually and rapid in-
dustrial growth is expected to continue, aided by the new Belgrade-Bar rail-
way which is already operational between the town and Belgrade. Titovo
Uzice is situated in the steep valley of the Djetinja River in the headwaters
of the Zapadna Morava (see Map 11639). The water supply situation for people
and industry is very bad. Water from local springs and wells is supplied by
the communal enterprise, Bioktos, which also manages wastewater disposal and
several other communal services (see Annex 18). Only 55% of the population
are connected to the system, 1/ shortages are significant and growing, and
the lack of safe water supplies has caused epidemics. 2/ Total system pro-
duction in 1974 averaged only 125 liters/second and 55% of the water sales
were to commercial and industrial consumers. The public water supply system
1/   Those not connected, including all residents in the upper levels of the
town, must rely on 15 public taps or local springs and wells.
2/   In 1974 some 2,000 people were affected and several hundred hospitalized
by a diarrheal epidemic.

has so little capacity that five industries have built their own supplies,
pumping more than twice as much water as Bioktos produced in 1974. The
source for the industrial supplies is the small and polluted Djetinja River,
whose low flow is less than the total water supply abstracted by Bioktos and
the town's industries. Thus a drought period would produce calamitous results.
The present water supply system is shown on Map 11637 and described in Annex 5.
2.25      A network of separate and combined sewers removes wastewater from
65% of the Titovo Uzice premises connected to the Bioktos water system. All
sewers discharge directly into the Djetinja River without treatment. At
Sevojno an industrial waste treatment plant has been constructed but is not
yet operational. Other industries, including textile, metal and leather
factories, discharge untreated wastes directly into the river, which has no
dissolved oxygen during low flow periods and therefore cannot support fish
life. The present wastewater disposal system is shown on Map 11638 and
described in Annex 5.
2.26      The town of Cacak has an estimated 1975 population of 44,000 which
is increasing at about 4.8% annually. The town is a traditional agricultural
center, sited on the Zapadna Morava where the valley, about 3 km wide, has
emerged from an upstream gorge. Local shallow wells have always been the
town's water source but the alluvial aquifer has become increasingly polluted
as urbanization and industrialization have proceeded. 1/ The water and waste-
water systems are the responsibility of the communal enterprise Vodovod. The
piped water supply, which first began operating in 1951 to serve a local in-
dustry, has grown gradually and now serves an estimated 60% of the population
from a series of wells recharged by river water pumped into infiltration
basins. There have been no shortages in the system since 1973, but limited
source capacity had caused shortages and delayed system expansion in earlier
years. Industrial and commercial consumers accounted for 62% of water sales
in 1974 but the town's largest water user, a pulp and paper factory, pumps its
supplies directly from the river. The town's bottling factory is expanding to
become a brewery which is expected to begin operating (and require substantial
supplies of treated water) in 1976. The present water supply system is shown
on Map 11640 and described in Annex 6.
2.27      Cacak has separate sanitary and storm drainage sewers, for which
Vodovod is responsible also. 55% of the consumers with water connections are
connected to the sewers, the remainder using septic tanks or pit privies. The
pulp and paper factory and the bottling plant discharge their untreated wastes
directly into the river. Vodovod's sanitary sewers flow to a site some 2 km
downstream of the town, where they enter the river without treatment.  The
outfall is located at the site of a proposed treatment plant. The wastewater
facilities are shown on Map 11641 and are described in Annex 6.
1/   Water quality tests of some 400 wells in the town indicated that
99% were bacteriologically contaminated.

III. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The project objectives are to:
(a)  improve the planning and management of water resources within
the Morava region, in order to assist Serbian authorities to
accelerate economic development, particularly in the least
developed areas in the region;
(b)  demonstrate the feasibility of low cost irrigation systems;
(c)  provide safe and reliable water supplies to meet the realistic
demands of some 90% of the population in the towns of Titovo
Uzice and Cacak by 1980, and also to provide adequate supplies
of treated and untreated water for industries and other com-
mercial enterprises in each town; and
(d)  extend the sewer networks in the two towns where necessary to
remove wastewater, and also to make plans for its subsequent
treatment.
Description
3.02      The main components of the project are described in detail in annexes
and can be summarized as follows:
(a) Research activities:
(i) construction, operation and monitoring of pilot irrigation
schemes covering approximately 400 ha in Milosevac area and 200
ha in Aleksinac, to demonstrate the feasibility and economics of
low cost supplemental irrigation systems (Map 11603 and Annexes
34 and 35);
(ii) study of measures to adjust to the flood hazards through-
out the basin (Annex 7);
(iii)  study to develop an action program to improve water quality
in part of the Zapadna Morava watershed, as a pilot project
for the entire basin (Annex 8);
(iv) study of ways to accelerate economic development in three of
the least developed regions in the Morava basin: Prokupulje,
Leskovac and Vranje (Map 11603 and Annex 9); and
(v) staff training program for MRWCI.

Vrutci site, 12 km upstream of Titovo Uzice (Map 11639);
(ii) Raw water pipeline and water treatment plant; transmis-
sion and distribution pipelines within town; pumping sta-
tion and reservoirs (Map 11637);
(iii) Sanitary sewers, including collector, leading to site of the
proposed wastewater treatment plant (Map 11638), whose con-
struction is not included in the project since it is un-
likely to begin before 1979; and
(iv) Engineering services, including final design for the future
wastewater treatment plant.
(c) Water supply and wastewater disposal systems for the town of Cacak
(Annex 11) including:
(i) Wellfield development 2 km upstream of Cacak; collector
pipeline and balancing reservoir; pumping station; trans-
mission and distribution pipelines within town; and dis-
tribution reservoirs (Map 11640);
(ii) Sanitary sewers and pumping stations to convey sewage to
site of proposed treatment plant (Map 11641), whose construc-
tion is not included in the project since it is unlikely
to begin before 1979;
(iii) Storm drains to alleviate local flooding (Map 11641); and
(iv) Engineering services, including final design for the future
wastewater treatment plant.
Status of Engineering
3.03      Feasibility studies and preliminary designs have been carried out
and final design is proceeding for all elements of the project by Yugoslav
consultants (Energoprojekt for the irrigation pilot projects and Cacak facil-
ities; Jaroslav Cerni Institute for the Vrutci dam and Titovo Uzice facilities).

3.05      The cost estimates for the research component were prepared by the
mission, following discussion of concepts and cost factors with the appro-
priate Yugoslav authorities. Cost estimates for the Titovo Uzice and Cacak
systems are based on the estimates of the consultants, taking account of
recent contracts for similar works in Yugoslavia. Physical contingencies
have been provided as follows:  25% for the Vrutci dam 1/, 10% for water
pipelines and 15% for all other items.  The project costs are expressed in
prices prevailing at the end of 1975, with provision for the price increases
during the project construction period as follows: 14% for 1976 and 12% an-
nually in the years 1977-79. 2/ With these provisions for physical contingen-
cies and price increases during the construction period the cost estimates are
reasonable.
Project Financing and Implementation Responsibility
3.06      The proposed loan of US$20.0 million would represent 38.9% of the
project costs and would be equivalent to 97% of the estimated foreign exchange
requirements of the project (comprising US$16.2 million in project costs and
US$4.5 million in interest during construction on a Bank loan of US$20.0 mil-
lion).
3.07      The Serbian Government has proposed that the proposed Bank loan be
utilized by the various organizations responsible for implementing individual
components of the project. As noted in para 2.19, institutional arrangements
within the water resources sector in Serbia are in a transitional state. The
water law enacted in July 1975 provides for the establishment of the new
socio-economic entity, the Morava Region Water Community of Interest (M4RWCI)
to manage water resources in the proposed project area.  However, pending the
establishment of MRWCI, which is not expected to become fully staffed and op-
erational before 1977, it has been agreed that SWF will be the borrower of the
proposed loan, with portions on-lent on Bank terms to other beneficiaries.
3.08      The comprehensive nature of the new Law on Waters (Annex 3) demon-
strates the commitment of the Republic to implement workable arrangements for
water resources management. In addition, it is clear that the Republic has
been prepared to discontinue arrangements which have proved unsatisfactory
(e.g. reliance upon MRC) and to implement improvements. It is therefore ex-
pected that the Serbian Government will carefully monitor the new institutional
arrangements to ensure that they will be effective in practice, or to determine
whether further modifications are required. In these circumstances there seems
no reason why these arrangements should not be effective, and MRWCI operate in
1/   Actual cost for this arch dam will depend to a large extent on the foun-
dation conditions, which cannot be completely known at this stage.
2/   These projections of future price increases are the same as the Bank's
general estimate of increases in local and foreign costs for civil
works, which predominate in this project.



- 14 -
the manner envisaged by the law. MRWCI should therefore be competent, in due
course, to take over the Bank loan obligations initially proposed for SWF.
During negotiations agreement was reached that, at the time of the transfer
of project responsibilities, SWF and MRWCI will enter into arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank under which the obligations of SWF under the loan
agreement will be assumed by MRWCI. In particular, it has been agreed that
MRWCI will have been duly established with full authority to assume the ob-
ligations of SWF under the loan agreement; that it will have access to ade-
quate financial resources; and that a qualified and experienced manager and
staff have been appointed. Agreement was also obtained from SWF and the
Republic of Serbia that no legal or administrative action will be taken which
would prevent the continued execution of the project to the satisfaction of
the Bank.

ries would be responsible follows, along with the proposed sources of finance

3.10      The loan amounts proposed to be allocated 1/ to project beneficia-
ries would be as follows:
US$ Thousand
Serbian Water Fund                                            6,460

Milosevac Farmers Cooperative                                    315
Aleksinac Agrokombinat                                           214
TOTAL                                                   20,000
3.11      SWF has agreed to relend major portions of the loan to Bioktos and
Vodovod on Bank terms by way of subsidiary loan agreements acceptable to the
Bank. Suitable arrangements will also be made by SWF to provide the agreed
portions of the loan to SFUR and the enterprises implementing the irrigation
pilot projects. During negotiations agreement was obtained that each benefi-
ciary will provide or be provided with all funds necessary to carry out the
project elements for which it is responsible. For the project components to
be undertaken by "Bioktos" and "Vodovod" respectively, these funds are to be
provided under local bank guarantees or by the Communes. For the remaining
project components the funds will either be provided by the Republic, or the
Republic will cause such funds to be provided from other sources.
Implementation of Irrigation Component
3.12      Construction, operation and maintenance of both pilot projects will
be undertaken by local bodies. In Milosevac, where land consolidation has al-
ready been carried out at the initiative of the farmers, the construction and
operation of the pilot irrigation project would be undertaken by the Milosevac
Farmers Cooperative (which has existed since 1902). In Aleksinac land conso-
lidation has not taken place yet (making the operation of an irrigation system
difficult if not unfeasible), and the institutional arrangements are more com-
plex. The private farmers are not well organized, except that they are part
of the Commune and sell their produce to the local agribusiness, Aleksinac
Agrokombinat, which provides technical support. Benefits will accrue locally
from these small-scale irrigation projects, but their primary objective is to
demonstrate the feasibility, organization, economics and channeling of credit
for this low cost supplementary irrigation, which is novel in this part of
Yugoslavia, so that the system might be considered for irrigation of the
many hundreds of thousands of hectares of irrigable land in the valleys of
the Morava region (para 2.07). The local communities have neither the moti-
vation nor the resources to monitor the project results and make the informa-
tion available to other agricultural interests in Yugoslavia. To achieve
this demonstration will require the assistance of the Republic of Serbia,
specifically the Secretariat for Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy.
1/  At the suggestion of the Serbian Government, the proposed loan would be
allocated as a constant percentage of the estimated cost of all project
components. This percentage, 38.9%, represents the proportion of the
total project costs (US$51.4 million) financed by the proposed Bank loan
(US$20.0 million).



- 17 -
3.13      During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Milosevac Farm-
ers Cooperative and Aleksinac Agrokombinat with respect to their respective
pilot irrigation projects that each will:
(a) engage qualified and experienced consultants to prepare the
final design and construction supervision of their respec-
tive irrigation systems;
(b) undertake a program of land consolidation or adjustment of farm
boundaries within the project area by December 31, 1977;
(c) construct, operate and maintain the systems efficiently; and
(d) collaborate with the Republic of Serbia in the monitoring of
results of the project.
In addition, assurances were obtained that Aleksinac Commune will:
(a) make adequate arrangements for the implementation of the
project by Aleksinac Agrokombinat; and
(b) authorize Aleksinac Agrokombinat to undertake the program
of land consolidation or adjustment of farm boundaries within
the project area.
Assurances were also obtained that the Republic of Serbia will:
(a) monitor, analyze and evaluate the results of the two irrigation
projects for five years according to guidelines agreed with the
Bank (Annexes 34 and 35);
(b) make available counterpart funds to the Milosevac Cooperative and
Aleksinac Agrokombinat, through Beogradska Banka, to permit con-
struction of works, provide working capital to cover operation
and maintenance pending receipt of crop sale revenues and provide
agricultural credit sufficient to cover the capital outlay of
farmers to convert to other crops.
Implementation of Research Component
3.14      The three proposed studies are specifically designed to meet the
project objective of improving the planning and management of water resources
to accelerate economic development in the region. In each case the draft out-
lines for the studies were prepared by the Serbian authorities and discussed
with the Bank mission. The revised draft outline for each study is provided
in annexes. Their objectives can be summarized as follows:



- 18 -
Study 1:   Adjustments to Flood Hazards (Annex 7)
- to provide recommendations for action for the miti-
gation of property damage, improvement of land use
and protection of life in the Morava River Basin,
by evaluating both structural and non-structural
adjustments to flood hazards.
Study 2:   Water Quality (Annex 8)
- to develop an action program to improve the quality of
water in the Zapadna River basin to the legal standards
designated for the river and its tributaries.
Study 3:   Regional Economic Development (Annex 9)
- to determine programs and projects to stimulate economic
development so that the Serbian Fund for Underdeveloped
Regions (SFUR) will be able to make better decisions in
its allocation of resources in the underdeveloped
regions of Prokuplje, Leskovac and Vranje in southern
Serbia (Map 11603).
3.15      SWF will be responsible for Studies 1 and 2 and SFUR for Study 3.
Special groups of consultants will be required to carry out each study. Dur-
ing negotiations agreements were obtained that SWF and SFUR will engage quali-
fied and experienced consultants by September 1, 1976 to undertake each study
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The studies are expected to
require the following periods for completion:
Study 1   -   30 months
Study 2   -   18 months
Study 3   -   12 months
Implementation of Project Facilities for Titovo Uzice
3.16      All previous planning and the final designs now underway for the
Vrutci dam have been prepared by the Jaroslav Cerni Institute, Yugoslav con-
sultants who have limited experience in the implementation (as opposed to
planning) of large projects. Agreement was obtained from SWF during nego-
tiations that suitably qualified and experienced consultants will be retained
by June 30, 1976 to assist in procurement and construction supervision of the
dam, paying particular attention to project management.
3.17      The town of Titovo Uzice is located in the narrow valley approxi-
mately 12 km downstream of the 70 m high, thin concrete arch dam at Vrutci.
Because of the complexity and importance of this dam, the following agree-
ments were obtained from SWF during negotiations:



- 19 -
(a)  a panel of highly qualified and internationally experienced
engineers will be engaged by June 30, 1976 to provide inde-
pendent expert advice during the construction period; 1/
(b)  as a precautionary measure, suitably qualified and experienced
consultants (perhaps the dam designers) will be engaged by
January 1, 1977 to determine the hydraulic consequences
downstream in the event of a catastrophic collapse of the dam.
On the basis of this analysis the consultants should recommend
an action program for monitoring possible causes of downstream
flooding and for activating an appropriate warning system, such
program to be prepared not later than December 31, 1977;
(c)  after the dam is built, suitably qualified and experienced con-
sultants will be engaged to inspect the dam at least once every
three years to ensure that operation and maintenance procedures
are satisfactory.
3.18      Before construction of the Vrutci dam can begin, approvals are re-
quired from Yugoslav authorities responsible for the hydraulic, sanitary and
structural aspects of the design. Officials from SWF and the Commune of Titovo
Uzice advised that the necessary services were underway and that all approvals
would be received before the proposed commencement of construction in October,
1976.
3.19      The reservoir to be created by the Vrutci dam will flood an area of
some 235 ha, within the Commune of Titovo Uzice, and require the relocation
of 26 households. Agreement was obtained from SWF during negotiations that
this land will be acquired and the residents relocated in a timely manner so
that project construction and reservoir filling will not be delayed.
3.20      The Vrutci reservoir is intended to be operated to serve multiple
purposes: supply of water for treatment and distribution in Titovo Uzice;
release of flows for downstream abstraction by industries (particularly at
Sevojno); augmentation of low flows for enhancement of river water quality;
and storing of flood flows. As detailed operating rules have not yet been
prepared, agreement was obtained from SWF during negotiations that such
operating rules will be prepared before December 31, 1978 for review by
Bioktos and the Bank.
1/   The panel could comprise two engineers:  an expert in arch dam design
and an expert in the construction of thin arch dams. This panel would
visit the site and review the final design prior to construction.
Thereafter, the panel would visit the site at approximately annual
intervals, or more frequently if requested by SWF.



- 20 -
3.21      Bioktos has been assisted by Jaroslav Cerni Institute in prelim-
inary planning for the water supply and wastewater systems serving Titovo
Uzice. Recently, Bioktos has strengthened its technical staff for project
implementation but further assistance from consulants will be required.
During negotiations agreement was obtained from Bioktos that qualified and
experienced consultants will be hired by September 30, 1976 on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank to assist in final design, procurement and
construction supervision of the water supply and wastewater systems serving
Titovo Uzice, and also to prepare the final designs for the wastewater treat-
ment plant.
3.22      The pipeline from the Vrutci dam to the treatment plant in Titovo
Uzice (Map 11639) would follow the alignment of the abandoned railway to
Sarajevo and Bioktos has already secured the right to use this land. Dur-
ing negotiations, agreement was obtained from Bioktos that other land needed
for project elements (treatment plant, reservoirs, pumping stations, etc.)
will be acquired without causing delays to the project.
3.23      The Vrutci dam is expected to take 2-1/2 years to construct and the
associated water supply facilities are expected to begin operating at the end
of 1979. Temporary facilities are expected to augment the water supply some-
what in the interim period. The project will be implemented in accordance
with the construction schedule shown in Annex 13, augmented by a list of
critical actions with responsibilities and deadlines agreed. Agreement was
obtained from Bioktos and SWF that no project or development would be carried
out for Titovo Uzice which would adversely affect the carrying out of the
project.
Implementation of Project Facilities for Cacak
3.24      Previously Vodovod was responsible for water supply and wastewater
facilities but not for storm drainage, which was the responsibility of another
communal enterprise in Cacak. Early in 1976, however, the Commune of Cacak
gave Vodovod complete responsibility for storm drainage, including appropriate
financial support (para. 4.21).
3.25      Preliminary designs for most project facilities in Cacak have been
carried out for Vodovod by Energoprojekt consultants, but separate consultants
(Hidroprojekt, also of Belgrade) iave been engaged by the local water economy
enterprise associated with MRC for final designs of certain water supply facil-
ities. 1/ During negotiations, agreement was obtained that Vodovod will be
given exclusive responsibility before September 1, 1976 for all Cacak facili-
ties in the project to be financed by the proposed Bank loan. Agreement was
1/   Presumably because these facilities were related to the Semedraz dam
(whose construction has been postponed), for which MRC would have been
responsible.



- 21 -
also obtained that qualified and experienced consultants will be engaged by
September 30, 1976 to assist Vodovod in final designs, procurement and con-
struction supervision of the project facilities, and also for the final
design of the wastewater treatment plant.
3.26      The groundwater source to be developed in the unpolluted Parmenac
aquifer upstream of Cacak has an estimated capacity of 200 to 250 liters/
second. Together with the existing source, this should meet Cacak's require-
ments until about 1984. (Future water requirements are outlined in Annex 29).
Thereafter, additional water will be required. Several possible sources have
been identified, including the Semedraz dam (Map 11639). In order to deter-
mine the optimum development program of additional sources, Vodovod should
undertake a system planning study of future demands and alternative sources,
as already proposed by the Bank. Annex 15 contains a draft outline of the
proposed study. During negotiations, agreement was obtained that qualified
and experienced consultants will be engaged by Vodovod by December 31, 1976
to complete this study on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank within
18 months of the date of the Loan Agreement. Agreement was also obtained
from Vodovod and SWF that no additional source facilities for Cacak would be
undertaken prior to the completion of this study.
3.27      The groundwater facilities to augment Cacak's water supplies are ex-
pected to begin operating in 1976. Water supply and sewerage networks will be
extended gradually through the project period 1976-79. Vodovod will implement
the project in accordance with the construction schedule shown in Annex 14,
augmented by a list of critical actions with responsibilities and deadlines
agreed. Agreement was obtained from Vodovod and SWF that no project or devel-
opment would be carried out for Cacak which would adversely affect the carry-
ing out of the project.
Training
3.28      Provision is made in the project for training future staff or expert
groups engaged by MRWCI but no formal program can be agreed upon at this stage.
During negotiations, agreement was obtained that MRWCI will formulate a program
for staff training for review by the Bank by June 1, 1977 and that the agreed
training program will be implemented thereafter. For the other beneficiaries
project implementation with the assistance of consultants will provide useful
practical training and no other training program is recommended.
Procurement
3.29      'Equipment and materials contracts estimated to cost more than
US$100,000 would be awarded after international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with Bank Guidelines. For the purpose of bid comparison, qualified
domestic manufacturers of these goods will be given a margin of preference of
15% or customs duties, whichever is lower. Civil works contracts estimated to
cost more than US$500,000 will be awarded after ICB. The other equipment sup-
ply and civil works contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bid-
ding advertised locally, in accordance with local procedures which are acceptable.



- 22 -
Local contractors are expected to win contracts for most of the construction
work in the towns of Titovo Uzice and Cacak but Bioktos and Vodovod may carry
out minor works by force account (such as renovations and modifications to
existing facilities or installing new pipes) using presently available staff
and equipment. The total value of such works carried out by force account
would be limited to US$4.0 million (8% of the project cost).
3.30      In order to avert increasing water shortages in Titovo Uzice and
Cacak, the responsible agencies have proceeded to advance contracting of
critical contracts so that full advantage can be taken of the construction
season in 1976. Contracts for equipment for treatment and pumping facilities
and for the supply and installation of water (and associated sewer) lines re-
quired in 1976 would be awarded according to procedures outlined in para. 3.29.
Retroactive financing of up to US$1 million is recommended.
Disbursements
3.31      The loan would be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures and 35% of contracts won locally 1/
for all civil works and equipment contracts for the Vrutci dam
and the Titovo Uzice, Cacak, Milosevac and Aleksinac facilities
from January 1, 1976;
(b) 100% of the costs of foreign consultants and 35% of the cost
of local consultants from January 1, 1976;
(c) 100% of foreign training costs for MRWCI staff.
(d) 100% of interest and other charges on the Bank loan.
The percentages would be modified, if necessary, for each beneficiary during
the course of the project to ensure that each beneficiary would receive the
portion of the Bank loan allocated to it in accordance with the table on page
15. Estimated quarterly disbursements for each project beneficiary and con-
solidated for the total loan are shown in Annex 16. Savings, if any, could
be used to finance additional eligible items needed for the project if this
is found justified by the Bank. Otherwise they would be cancelled.
Monitoring Criteria
3.32     Periodic progress reports would be required from the consultants re-
sponsible for each of the three studies (Annexes 7, 8 and 9). Quarterly
reports on construction progress for the Vrutci dam will be received from
SWF. Quarterly progress reports according to the draft format of Annex 17
will be received from the communal water and wastewater agencies, Bioktos in
1/   Including disbursements of up to US$1.4 million on force account work
for Titovo Uzice and Cacak.



- 23 -
Titovo Uzice and Vodovod in Cacak. Quarterly progress reports on the con-
struction of the irrigation pilot projects will be received from the responsi-
ble local enterprises. Subsequently the Serbian Government will submit an
annual report based on the agreed monitoring program.
Environmental Aspects
3.33      The most obvious environmental aspects of the project will be the
improved aesthetic and public health standards in the towns of Titovo Uzice
and Cacak, due to the improved water supply facilities and sewers. The proj-
ect also includes the final design of the wastewater treatment plants which
will be built subsequently to improve water quality in the river system, but
until they are built the wastewater will continue to enter the river without
treatment, as at present. The major difference in the short term will be that
such discharges will take place downstream of each town so that river water
quality within each town should be noticeably improved. A negative environ-
mental aspect of the project will be the inundation of some 235 ha by the
reservoir of the Vrutci dam.
IV. THE BORROWER AND OTHER BENEFICIARIES AND THEIR FINANCES
General
4.01      Although the project is wholly concerned with various aspects of de-
velopment of the Morava River Basin it embraces activity which is to be the
concern of six different entities, as indicated in paragraph 3.09, which shows
how much of the Bank loan is to be allocated to each project component and the
sources and amounts of additional funds. For the towns of Titovo Uzice and
Cacak, project components form part of a construction program for the enter-
prises (Bioktos and Vodovod respectively) operating water and wastewater
services with revenues derived from charges to consumers. Cacak will also be
responsible. for construction of a stormwater system. SWF will be responsible
for construction of the Vrutci dam, and for the flood hazard and water quality
studies. The regional development study will be financed by the Bank loan and
by a grant from SFUR. The separate administrative and financial arrangements
for SWF, Bioktos, Vodovod and SFUR are discussed briefly below and in more
detail in various annexes.
Serbian Water Fund
4.02      The organization and administration of SWF are described in Annex 4
and its financial situation is explained in Annex 31. As indicated, SWF has
been established to collect and administer funds on behalf of the Republic for
various aspects of river basin development. Although SWF has assigned to it
certain direct sources of revenue related to water usage, the majority of its



- 24 -
present and proposed future funds will come either from the assignment by the
Republic of taxes not related to water usage (e.g. a proportion of sales taxes)
or from direct contributions voted periodically by the Republican assembly.
SWF cannot, therefore, be regarded as an autonomous organization in the sense
usually meant. However, its status is appropriate to its present role in river
basin management, where it is financing many projects which could not reasonably
be expected to be revenue earning (e.g. flood control, river training, sedi-
mentation control, river basin studies, etc.).
4.03      If SWF (and its successor, MRWCI) is to fulfill its responsibilities
to administer the project it will need to make adequate arrangements for the
construction and operation of the Vrutci dam and reservoir (paras. 3.16 to 3.20)
and to carry out the studies (para. 3.14). In addition, agreement was obtained
during negotiations that SWF will establish and maintain, in consultation with
the Bank, adequate accounting arrangements to:
(a) record and control the borrowing of funds from the Bank and the
re-lending of funds to other enterprises and agencies concerned
with the project; and
(b) record and control all financial transactions relative to the
construction, operation, maintenance and administration of the
Vrutci dam and reservoir, including the charging of appropriate
proportions of cost to other participating enterprises and
agencies.
4.04      The project components which are to be the direct responsibility of
SWF will be financed by the Bank loan and by grants from the funds of SWF, with
a contribution by Titovo Uzice Commune to cover 30% of the construction costs
of the Vrutci dam (Annex 31). During negotiations, agreement was obtained that
the Commune of Titovo Uzice will make the necessary arrangements with SWF to
provide its contribution towards the construction costs of the Vrutci dam, in
accordance with an agreed time schedule.
4.05      The Vrutci reservoir is intended to serve multiple purposes.  In
conjunction with a study of reservoir operating rules (para. 3.20) it will be
necessary to determine the share of benefits attributable to the Bioktos water
supply system, so as to ensure that water consumers in Titovo Uzice pay charges
which appropriately cover such benefits. Agreement was therefore obtained that
SWF and Bioktos will enter into arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the
annual payment by Bioktos to SWF of an appropriate share of the annual costs
of the Vrutci reservoir, including an appropriate share of the amortization of
capital costs (Annexes 23 and 32).
4.06      A related question concerns the raw water which the industrial enter-
prises pump directly from the Djetinja River, since the Vrutci reservoir will
be operated to augment low flows for this purpose. Under present arrangements
each industrial enterprise pays a relatively small tax to SWF for the extraction



- 25 -
of this water (Din 0.1/m3). SWF intends to review its policy and practice
concerning water charges to users benefitting from regulated streamflows and
has agreed to carry out a study of alternatives for assessing more realistic
charges. This study, which will be based on the study of reservoir operating
rules referred to in para. 4.05, will be completed and sent to the Bank for
comment by December 31, 1978.
Bioktos - Titovo Uzice
4.07      The organization and administration of Bioktos is described in de-
tail in Annex 18, where an organization chart is provided. Annexes 22 to 24
give details of Bioktos' past and forecast financial statmements and its fi-
nancial situation is described in Annex 32.
4.08      Bioktos is responsible for the water and wastewater systems of the
Commune, as well as for certain other municipal services. These other serv-
ices accounted for some 40% Bioktos net income in 1974 (Annex 22) and include
street cleaning, refuse collection, septic tank emptying, storm drainage,
a market, a flower shop and funeral service. Each of these services is sup-
ported either by its own revenues or by contributions from the Commune.
Bioktos at present has two service departments, one for technical services,
and the other for finance and administration. The administration of Bioktos
is satisfactory, although some re-organization may take place.
4.09      Adequate billing and accounting arrangements exist and financial
statements can be produced in sufficient detail to enable the financial re-
sults of water and wastewater activities to be presented separately from
those of the other municipal services. Agreement was obtained during nego-
tiations that this separation of accounting arrangements will continue.
4.10      Annex 32 indicates that the services carried out by Bioktos, other
than water and wastewater services, have in the past operated on a self-
sufficient basis without aversely affecting water and wastewater activities.
During negotiations agreement was obtained that Bioktos and the Commune will
undertake to ensure that charges will be made by, or other appropriate reve-
nues provided to, the various services of Bioktos, other than water and
wastewater services, so as to ensure that in future:
(a) total revenues for such services are sufficient to cover all
expenses of operation, maintenance, depreciation and interest
charges on such services; and
(b) internal generation of funds by such services at all times is
adequate to meet all necessary requirements for funds, includ-
ing, but not restricted to, debt service, contributions, in-
vestments and capital expenditure, except where external funds
are specifically provided.



- 26 -
4.11      Bioktos' basic financial problem has been a lack of access to capital
finance to enable it to significantly expand and improve its water and waste-
water systems. Water tariffs have been adequate to cover no more than opera-
tion and maintenance expenses and to contribute towards a modest program of ex-
pansion. Until January 1975, there were no separate wastewater tariffs. The
present level of debt is low and is being repaid over relatively short periods
at low interest rates.
4.12      Bioktos is now faced with an urgent need for a much greater system
of expansion than hitherto. Because significant loan finance is not available,
the Commune of Titovo Uzice has decided to raise a large proportion of the
necessary funds by contributions from various communal funds and by the estab-
lishment of various arrangements for contributions from the personal incomes
of workers and from the earnings of business enterprises. These funds, together
with the Bank loan, are expected to be sufficient to meet the major part of
the funds requirements of Bioktos during the period from 1976 to 1980 and to
make a contribution to SWF towards the construction costs of Vrutci dam.
4.13      Bioktos' financing plan for the period 1976 - 1980 (Annex 32) shows
total funds requirements for the period estimated at Din 456.6 million (US$25.4
million). Din 130.7 million (US$7.3 million), about 29%, is estimated to come
from the Bank loan, Din 198.7 million (US$11.0 million), about 43%, from the
special funds allocated by the Commune and Din 41.3 million (US$2.3 million),
about 9%, from internal sources of Bioktos. Other funds will come from rela-
tively minor loans and from contributions from business enterprises. This
still leaves a shortage of Din 65.2 million (US$3.6 million) which, as ex-
plained in Annex 32, relates mainly to the proposed construction of waste-
water treatment facilities outside the project. This shortage is assumed to
be covered by local loans. However, since about Din. 18.0 million represents
presently unsecured finance for the project, agreement has been obtained that
this sum be secured, along with other components of the financing plan, to the
satisfaction of the Bank, as a condition of loan effectiveness. Bioktos and
the Commune have indicated their intention that financing of the wastewater
treatment works will be provided in due course, to enable construction to be-
gin promptly after the completion of the final designs included in the project.
4.14      Agreement was reached during negotiations that Bioktos will obtain
a satisfactory guarantee from a Yugoslav Bank to cover cost over-runs for the
project, in accordance with Yugoslav practice. Since the responsibility for
the administration of most local financing sources is that of the Commune of
Titovo Uzice, agreement was also obtained during negotiations that the Commune
will be responsible for:
(a) making all necessary arrangements to provide or secure the
funds for Bioktos' project facilities construction not
available from other sources; and



- 27 -
(b) providing or securing any additional funds necessary to meet
Bioktos' costs in excess of present estimates.
4.15      Construction of the project and of the other capital investments
will necessitate very large increases in water and wastewater tariffs in
Titovo Uzice. Such increases will be necessary to meet increased operating
costs of more sophisticated systems, to cover interest costs on new loans and
to facilitate a contribution from internal funds towards construction require-
ments. In addition, by 1980, Bioktos will need to reach a situation where its
revenues will cover an appropriate share of the operating costs of the Vrutci
reservoir. In 1981, sufficient funds will be needed to meet greatly increased
debt service requirements. If the present shortage of capital finance continues
into the future, Bioktos will also need to make provision for internal funds to
finance a significant proportion of its investment program beyond 1980.
4.16      For these objectives to be achieved, tariff increases of 50% will be
necessary on July 1, 1976 and again on July 1, 1977 followed by annual increases
of 40% in 1978, 1979 and 1980, as explained in Annex 32.
4.17      During negotiations, agreement was obtained from Bioktos (with the
concurrence of the Commune) that it will:
(a)  no later than July 1, in each year from 1976 to 1980 implement
water and wastewater tariffs not less than those proposed in
Annex 24, or implement such other combination of tariffs as
will generate at least equal revenues; and
(b)  in 1981 and in each subsequent year, implement such tariffs as
will provide for:
(i) expenses of operation and maintenance (excluding
depreciation);
(ii)  debt service;
(iii) adequate increases in working capital;
(iv)  contributions to reserves and other authorized funds;
and
(v) a contribution from internal funds towards a three-
year average of capital investment requirements amount-
ing to not less than 20% in 1981 and not less than 30%
in each subsequent year. 1/
1/   The three-year average to include the capital investment requirements of
the year in question and the preceding and subsequent years.



- 28 -
4.18      If such tariffs are implemented, the water service will earn a rate
of return on revalued 1/ net fixed assets in excess of about 3.5% in 1980 and
over 6% in subsequent years until 1984. For the water and wastewater services
together, the rate of return will be 3.4% in 1980 and 5.0% in 1981. From 1982
to 1984 the overall rates of return would be in excess of 4%. These various
rates of return, on revalued net fixed assets in operation, are reasonable in
view of the fact that internal funds generation will be adequate and that a
large proportion of the fixed assets will have been financed by contributions
from consumers, enterprises, and the commune, (implying increased local
taxation), at considerable financial sacrifice.
4.19      The debt:equity ratio of Bioktos would peak at 41:59 in 1979,
falling thereafter to 32:68 by 1984. Debt service coverage would range from
1.2 times in 1978 to about 1.5 times in the years 1981 to 1984, but these
figures can only be indicative because of the uncertainty of the terms and
availability of future loan funds. Furthermore in the years 1976 to 1981 the
calculation includes interest assumed capitalised by lenders. If this in-
terest were excluded from the calculation, the ratio would exceed 1.5 times
in every year. Agreement was obtained during negotiations that Bioktos will
not raise further loans beyond the project period without the concurrence of
the Bank, unless its net cash earnings before depreciation and interest exceed
1.5 times its debt service in any future year, including debt service on the
amount to be borrowed.
Vodovod-Cacak
4.20      The organization and administration of Vodovod is described in de-
tail in Annex 19, where an organization chart is provided. Annexes 25 to 27
give details of Vodovod's past and forecast financial statements and its fi-
nancial situation is described in Annex 33.
4.21      Vodovod is responsible for the water and wastewater system of the
Commune and has recently become responsible for the town's stormwater system.
Water and wastewater network construction has been carried out largely by
Vodovod's own workforce.
4.22      Vodovod's billing arrangements and its general accounting system are
satisfactory. However, financial planning is weak (Annex 20), and the ac-
counting system does not at present provide for adequate analysis of costs of
the network construction program for comparison against charges made to the
Commune and to potential customers. A prolonged illness of the present head
of the finance and administration department has contributed towards a lack of
leadership. Consideration has been given by Vodovod to a re-organization with

from 1975 to 1984 as explained in Annex 23.



- 29 -
the intention of closer association with the Water Management Organization of
Cacak 1/ but no final decisions have been taken, pending further discussions.
4.23      During negotiations, agreement was obtained that Vodovod will, in
consultation with the Bank:
(a) appoint a suitably qualified finance director; and
(b) implement, by July 30, 1977, modifications in its accounting
procedures so as to facilitate adequate separation of costs
between construction activities and normal operation and
maintenance.
Agreement was also obtained that Vodovod will seek Bank comments prior to any
proposed reorganization, including possible association with any other enter-
prise or organisation.
4.24      Vodovod's basic financial problem has been a lack of access to capi-
tal finance to enable it to significantly expand and improve its water and
wastewater systems. Water tariffs have been adequate to cover no more than
operation and maintenance and to contribute towards a modest expansion program.
Wastewater tariffs have not, until 1975, been adequate to cover operation and
maintenance of the wastewater system. A program of network expansion has been
financed in part by contributions from the Commune and from potential consumers.
However, finance has not generally been available for the necessary development
of new sources of supply and the related treatment, transmission and storage
facilities.
4.25      In anticipation of the construction of the Semedraz dam, which was
expected to be the next source to augment the town's water supply, the resi-
dents of Cacak established, by referendum in 1972, a Semedraz Fund. This
fund accumulated contributions from the earnings of workers and enterprises
towards the town's expected share of the dam construction costs. However,
as explained in Annex 30, the immediate construction of the Semedraz dam is
not the least cost solution to supplying Cacak's water demands. The Commune
of Cacak has accordingly decided to allocate resources from the Semedraz
Fund towards the cost of works included in the proposed Bank-financed project.
4.26      Vodovod's financing plan for the period 1976-1980, relative to water
and wastewater operations, is given and explained in Annex 33. This shows
total funds requirements for the period amounting to Din 340.6 million (US$18.9
million). The Bank loan of Din 84.9 million (US$4.7 million) will finance
about 25% of requirements. The Semedraz Fund is expected to provide Din 124.6
million (US$6.9 million), about 37% of the total, and internal funds of Vodovod
Din 77.0 million (US$4.3 million), about 23%. The remaining finance will come
from relatively minor contributions from consumers and enterprises and from
local loans. The local loan of Din 25 million relates to the construction of
1/   An enterprise which forms part of the Morava River Corporation (para.
2.13.

the wastewater treatment plant, following the project. Vodovod and the Commune
have indicated their intention that financing of these works will be provided,
in due course, to enable construction to begin promptly after the completion
of the final designs included in the project.
4.27      Agreement was reached during negotiations that Vodovod will obtain
a satisfactory guarantee from a Yugoslav bank to cover cost over runs for the
project, in accordance with normal Yugoslav practice. Since the responsibility
for the administration of most local financing sources is that of the Commune
of Cacak, agreement was also obtained during the negotiations that the Commune
will be responsible for:
(a)  making all necessary arrangements to provide or secure the
funds for the construction of Vodovod's water and wastewater
facilities which are not available from other sources; and
(b)  providing or securing any additional funds necessary to meet
costs in excess of present estimates.
4.28      A financing plan for the storm drainage system, for the period 1976-
1980, is given and explained in Annex 33. This shows that of the total re-
quirements for funds of Din 41.7 million (US$2.3 million) the Bank loan is
estimated to provide Din 15.0 million (US$0.8 million) with the remainder
amounting to Din 26.7 million (US$1.5 million) expected to come from the Com-
munal Development Fund or general Commune revenues.
4.29      The bank guarantee referred to in para. 4.27 will also cover cost
overruns for the stormwater project component. In addition, during negotia-
tions agreement was obtained that the Commune will be responsible for:
(a)  making all necessary arrangements to provide or secure the
finances for the construction of the storm drainage facili-
ties which are not available from other sources;
(b)  providing or securing any additional funds necessary to meet
costs in excess of present estimates; and
(c)  reimbursing Vodovod promptly and in full for all expenses in-
curred in operating, maintaining and administering the storm
drainage facilities and for meeting all related debt service
obligations, all on the basis of separate accounts for the
stormwater service to be maintained by Vodovod.
4.30      The project will be the first stage of an expected ongoing invest-
ment program for Vodovod. Investments subsequent to the project are likely
to include wastewater treatment facilities and also construction related to
an additional source of supply, dependent upon the studies referred to in



- 31 -
paragraph 3.26. 1/ For Vodovod to remain financially viable in these circum-
stances, progressive increases in water and wastewater tariffs will be neces-
sary. These increases will enable Vodovod to meet increased operating costs
of more sophisticated systems, to cover interest costs on new loans and to
facilitate a contribution from internal funds towards construction require-
ments. Also, from 1981 onwards, considerably increased debt service require-
ments will have to be met. If the present shortage of capital finance con-
tinues into the future, Vodovod will also need to make provision for internal
funds to finance a reasonable proportion of its investment program beyond
1980.
4.31      For these objectives to be achieved, tariff increases of 20% will
be necessary no later than July 1, 1976 with similar 20% increases annually
until 1979. Thereafter annual increases of about 15% are likely to be neces-
sary, although this will depend upon circumstances not precisely definable
at this time.
4.32      During negotiations, agreement was obtained from Vodovod (with the
concurrence of the Commune) that it will:
(a)  no later than July 1, in each year from 1976 to 1979, imple-
ment water and wastewater tariffs not less than those pro-
posed in Annex 27, or implement such other combination of
tariffs as will generate at least equal revenues; and
(b)  in 1980 and in each subsequent year, implement such tariffs
as will provide for:
(i) expenses of operation and maintenance (excluding
depreciation);
(ii) debt service;
(iii) adequate increases in working capital;
(iv) contributions to reserves and other authorized
funds; and
(v)  a contribution from internal funds towards a three-
year average of capital investment requirements
amounting to not less than 30% 2/.

facilities.

the year in question and the preceding and subsequent years.



- 32 -
4.33      If such tariffs are implemented, the water service will earn a rate
of return on revalued 1/ net fixed assets in excess of about 9.2% in 1980,
falling to 5.6% in 1984 when the Semedraz reservoir is assumed to start opera-
tions. For water and wastewater services together, the rate of return will be
6.7% in 1980 falling to about 4% in 1984. These various rates of return, on
revalued net fixed assets in operation, are reasonable in view of the fact that
internal funds generation will be adequate and that a large proportion of the
fixed asset costs will have been financed by contributions from consumers,
enterprises and the commune (implying increased local taxes) at considerable
financial sacrifice.
4.34      The debt:equity ratio of Vodovod will rise to 39:61 by 1983, falling
to 35:65 in 1984. Debt service coverage will be 4.2 times in 1980, falling to
1.6 times by 1984, but this figure can only be indicative, because of the un-
certainty of the terms and availability of future loan funds. Agreement was
obtained during negotiations that Vodovod will not raise further loans beyond
the project period without the concurrence of the Bank, unless its net cash
earnings before depreciation and interest exceed 1.5 times its debt service in
any future year, including debt service on the amount to be borrowed.
Serbian Fund for Underdeveloped Regions
4.35      The Serbian Fund for Underdeveloped Regions (SFUR) was established
by law in 1970 to provide finance, in the form of loans and grants, for devel-
opment projects in regions of Serbia which are legally designated by the
Assembly of Serbia to be underdeveloped. The role and operations of SFUR are
further described in Annex 20.
4.36      Financial transactions and accounting arrangements for SFUR are
handled by a 3-man staff with considerable assistance from the Bank of Belgrade.
The financing, administrative and accounting arrangements for the study of
underdeveloped regions included in the project would seem to present no special
difficulties. Agreement was obtained from SWF during negotiations that adequate
accounting arrangements will be established by SFUR to ensure separate identi-
cation of relevant project costs, and the related sources of finance.
Audit
4.37      The audit arrangements for Bioktos-Titovo Uzice and Vodovod-Cacak
have been discussed in Annexes 18 and 19. The other participants in the proj-
ect, even though they may have somewhat different accounting procedures, must
still follow the regulations and controls established by the Social Accounting
Service (SAS) and prepare required annual financial statements. The procedures
established by SAS for accounting for capital works projects are strict, and
should provide adequate safeguards for the acquisition and disbursement of
funds.
1/   Fixed assets have been shown in financial forecasts as annually revalued
from 1975 to 1984 as explained in Annex 26.



- 33 -
4.38      During negotiations, agreement was obtained that Bioktos and Vodovod
will prepare annual financial statements, and have such statements audited by
SAS in a manner acceptable to the Bank, and that beginning with the financial
year 1976, or such other later year as shall be agreed between the enterprises
and the Bank, such audits shall be carried out by the special audit group of
SAS, which is currently being established with the assistance of consultants.
The audited financial statements should be submitted to the Bank within four
months of the close of each fiscal year.
4.39      Agreement was further obtained that all other participants in the
project would prepare separate annual financial statements for project activi-
ties in a manner acceptable to the Bank, that such statements will be audited
by SAS, and that they will be submitted to the Bank within four months
of the close of each fiscal year.
V. JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The project is complex with several quite different components, each
of which merits evaluation separately. A major objective of the project is to
improve the planning and management of water resources within the Morava re-
gion, a region containing some of the least developed areas in Serbia, where
economic development is increasingly jeopardized by water-related problems.
Research Component
5.02      Preliminary information indicates that the pilot irrigation projects
at Milosevac and Alesinac would be economically viable, providing rates of re-
turn of approximately 20% (details in Annexes 34 and 35). There is consider-
able potential for such schemes elsewhere in the valley lands of the Morava
region, where most of the land is owned by private farmers, whom the Govern-
ment wish to support and encourage. Accordingly, the main benefit expected
from these pilot projcts is the demonstration to farmers and agricultural
planners throughout Serbia that low cost supplementary irrrigation schemes
are technically feasible and economically viable. This could lead to sub-
stantial benefits to small scale farmers throughout Serbia in future.
5.03      The benefits of the three studies in the project, though unquanti-
fiable, are expected to be substantial. In the next five years SWF plans
to spend some Din 1,760 million (US$98 million) on flow regulation structures
in the Morava region (Annex 31). Decisions concerning these investments would
undoubtedly be improved if the recommendations for action were available from
the studies concerning adjustments to flood hazards and water quality improve-
ment, which together will cost less than 3% of the proposed five year invest-
ment program.
5.04      The regional development study is designed to assist Serbian plan-
ners in their efforts to formulate action programs to accelerate development
in the lesser developed parts of Serbia. To this end SFUR invested approxi-
mately Din 1,000 million (US$56 million) in the four years 1971-74, on



- 34 -
projects whose total cost was approximately four times this amount (Annex 20).
Similar financial assistance is expected to continue in future. As a result
of the proposed regional economic development study, such assistance will be
directed more effectively towards economically attractive projects.
Project Facilities for Titovo Uzice and Cacak
5.05      Some 91% of the project costs are for water supply and wastewater
facilities for people and industries in the towns of Titovo Uzice and Cacak.
In both towns existing facilities are inadequate, with only 60% of the
residents supplied by the water systems (intermittently in Titovo Uzice).
Water-related diseases are common. The project objectives outlined in para.
3.01 include augmenting the water supply systems to serve industries and 90%
of the population by 1980.
5.06      Demand estimates have been prepared separately for each town.  In
both towns the industrial and commercial requirements for treated water exceed
the domestic demands. Economic activity and the welfare of the residents of
Titovo Uzice are already in jeopardy because the existing water systems are
taking more water from the Djetinja River than the historic low flows. For
Titovo Uzice the estimate future requirements for treated water are outlined
in Annex 28. Additional supplies of untreated water for industrial processes,
whose total demands exceed those for treated water and are supplied by pumping
from the river, must also be assured, as explained in Annex 30. For Cacak,
the estimated future requirements for treated water are outlined in Annex 29.
Only one industry in Cacak (pulp and paper factory) uses untreated water and
river flows are ample for all its future requirements.
5.07      For each town, the project facilities are the least cost solution to
meeting the project objectives, as discussed in detail in Annex 30. For Titovo
Uzice, the Vrutci dam will provide water more economically than a groundwater
source or an alternative river development involving a dam and hydropower
plant. For Cacak, construction of the groundwater source in the project will
augment the system capacity more economically than the previously proposed
Semedraz dam, but additional water will have to be provided within the next
ten years.
5.08      Conventional economic analysis of the recommended investments for
each town does not produce meaningful information because of the difficulty
in quantifying the project benefits. Because of present water quality prob-
lems and shortages of supply, the project water systems in each town will
produce public health and environmental benefits which are real but not quan-
tifiable. The proposed wastewater systems will enhance these benefits. Such
benefits include reduction in illness and associated treatment costs, in-
creased worker productivity, improvements in the aesthetics of the towns and
their rivers and decreased costs for septic tank cleaning.
5.09      The water supply systems will supply more water to commercial enter-
prises than to people and for both categories of consumer the present water
charges underestimate the value of the water, since they are considerably



- 35 -
below the average incremental cost. In Titovo Uzice an additional methodolo-
gical complication arises because the Vrutci dam, in addition to supplying the
treated water system, will also produce various other benefits which cannot be
readily quantified (reduction of flood damages and low flow augmentation for
abstraction by industries and for enhancement of water quality).
5.10      As explained in detail in Annex 30, internal rates of return for
the water supply facilities for each town are predictably very low (negative
for Titovo Uzice and 3.9% for Cacak) if existing tariffs are used as the sole
measure of project benefits. A more meaningful part of the economic analy-
sis is the estimation of the average incremental cost 1/ of water in each
town. Because of the problem of cash requirements, proposed tariffs have
been determined largely on financial grounds. However, economic analysis
provides additional criteria by which to judge the suitability of the pro-
posed tariff policies to the different economic circumstances relating to
water supply requirements in each of the two communities.
5.11      In Titovo Uzice, the Vrutci dam will provide a source which is ex-
pected to meet the town's water requirements for approximately 25 years ahead.
The associated costs are relatively large in the immediate future and relative-
ly small thereafter, giving an average incremental cost of Din 14.5/m3 (US$0.81/
m3) which is more than six times the highest tariff presently charged. For fi-
nancial as well as economic reasons the tariffs will have to be increased sub-
stantially in the near future, by some 3-1/2 times (in constant prices) by
1980 (Annex 24). By that time, however, the Vrutci system will be in opera-
tion and average incremental costs for additional supplies will probably be
less than prevailing tariffs, as explained in Annex 30. On economic grounds,
therefore, it might be reasonable to consider reducing tariffs after 1980.
5.12      In Cacak, the situation is quite different.  A relatively inexpen-
sive groundwater source of limited capacity is included in the project but is
only a medium term solution to meeting the projected increases in water demands.
The next appropriate source is unknown at this stage, hence the recommended
system development study of Annex 15.  The most expensive subsequent source
appears to be the Semedraz dam, and on this basis the average incremental cost
for water in Cacak (Annex 30) could be as high as Din 9.9/m 3(US$0.55/m3), al-
most triple the highest present water charge. This indicates a need for sub-
stantial tariff increases in Cacak, although the determination of the average
incremental cost needs to be made accurately, following the systsem devel-
opment study. For financial reasons the water tariffs in Cacak are expected
to increase continuously each year, approximately doubling (in constant terms)
by 1984 (Annex 27). This tariff strategy, which increases charges so they
approach the average incremental cost of water, is economically sound.
1/   The average incremental cost is the average unit cost of producing incre-
mental volumes of water in future, determined by discounting to the
present the estimated future increments of water production and their
associated costs. The calculations in this report, shown in detail in
Annex 30, use an annual discount rate of 10%.

APPRAISAL OF MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CHRONOLOGY OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
May 1972             -  Federal Government requests Bank to consider lending
for Morava project.
July 1972            -  Initial documentation on Morava project ("blue books")
sent to Bank by Yugoslav Investment Bank. The proposed
project comprised seven multipurpose dams (Semedraz,
Gradina-Stapari, Selova, Konculj, Gradina Moravica,
Odorvci, and Vlasotince) and water supply facilities
for the small town of Aleksinac, to be supplied by the
Bovan dam already under construction (Map 11603).
December 1972        -  Desk review of documentation completed by Bank staff
(O'Sullivan).
March 1973           -  Yugoslav delegation (Mr. Petrovic of Morava River Cor-
poration and Messrs. Cirovic and Melentijevic of Ener-
goprojekt Consultants) visits Bank to explain components
of proposed project. Following meeting with Bank staff,
an outline of the data required for further project
analysis provided to MRC.
May 1973             -  Reconnaisance mission visits Yugoslavia (Mr. ffrench-
Mullen of Bank and Miss Eid of FAO/CP).
September 1973       -  Identification mission spends approximately three weeks
in Yugoslavia reviewing proposed project components and
additional information prepared by MRC ("white books").
Mission comprised of Bank staff members Yoon, O'Sullivan
and Nwaneri; Miss Eid of FAO/CP; and consultants McKee
and Ringenoldus. Issues paper finalized by mission
October 19, 1973, concludes that master planning and
project formulation apparently based on the philosophy
of "build dams and see how they can be used".
April 1974           -  Bank advises MRC of mission conclusion and notes that
two sub-projects (Gradina-Stapari or Vrutci, and
Semedraz dams, plus associated water supply and waste-
water systems) appear most suitable for bank financing.

June 1974            -  Pre-appraisal mission spends one week in Yugoslavia
(Bank staff Grover, O'Sullivan, Jones and Heidhues
and Miss Eid of FAO/CP). Mission proposed that project
to be appraised should include dams, water supply and
wastewater systems for towns of Titovo Uzice and Cacak;
studies re flooding, pollution control and regional
development; and pilot irrigation project. Detailed
outline of information required prior to appraisal
provided to MRC.
September 1974       -  MRC advises the Bank that Executive Council of Serbia
concurs with project as proposed by pre-appraisal mis-
sion and that information requested is under prepara-
tion.
November 1974        -  Preparation mission (Mr. Grover) visits Belgrade brief-
ly to review progress of MRC. Information for ap-
praisal not available.
December 1974        -  FAO/CP mission visits Yugoslavia to assist in prepara-
tion of pilot irrigation project component (Messrs.
Snelson, Loizides and Heurtas).
January 1975         -  Preparation mission (Messrs. Grover and Jones) visit
Yugoslavia briefly. MRC provides part of information
requested in June 1974 and assures mission that re-
maining information will be available within a month.
February-March 1975 -  Large appraisal mission spends approximately one month
in Yugoslavia. Mission members comprise Bank staff
Grover (sanitary engineer and mission leader), Jones
(financial analyst), O'Sullivan and Laeyendecker (ir-
rigation engineers), Nwaneri (Economist), and Kimura
(Young Professional); consultants, Hodges (water
management), Leroy (dam designer), and Sullivan (fi-
nancial analyst). Mission concludes that Vrutci dam
is appropriate solution for Titovo Uzice problems
but that Semedraz dam is not the least cost solution
for Cacak.
May 1975             -  Mission returns to Yugoslavia to seek agreement on
project definition, using groundwater source for Cacak
instead of Semedraz dam. Mission comprises Messrs. Grover,
Jones, Allison (groundwater specialist), and Cuellar
(sanitary engineer).

APPRAISAL OF
MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
THE MORAVA REGION AND ITS WATER RESOURCES
A. PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
Location
1.        The Morava River, a tributary of the River Danube, joins the Danube
from the right bank some 60 km downstream of Belgrade. The confluence of
the Danube and Morava Rivers is situated within the controlled backwater of
the important Yugoslav/Rumanian hydropower-navigation complex at Djerdap,
situated some 200 km downstream of Belgrade.
2.        The drainage area of river covers about 38,000 km2, representing
some 14% of the area of Yugoslavia, making the Morava basin the second largest
in Yugoslavia after that of the- Sava. The mainstem of the Morava River, the
Velika (Great) Morava, is fed by two main tributaries, the Zapadna (West)
Morava and the Juzna (South) Morava, each with a drainage area of some 15,500
sq. km. Tributaries of secondary importance are the Ibar (catchment area
7,985 km2) on the Zapadna Morava, and the Nisava (3,890 km2) and Toplica
(2,174 km2) on the Juzna Morava. The catchment area lies within the following
political jurisdictions:
Yugoslavia                                 km2           % of Total
Serbia proper                          30,657             80.7
Kosovo                                  5,830             15.4
Montenegro                                390              1.0
Macedonia                                  45              0.1
Sub-Total                            36,922             97.2
Bulgaria                                  1,044              2.8
Total                                37,966            100.0



ANNEX 3
Page 2
In Serbia proper (excluding the autonomous provinces) the Morava watershed
drains 5S% of the land area.
Topography and Soils
3.        The topography of the river basin is generally very irregular.
Much of the area is mountainous with narrow valleys formed by river channels.
The height above sea level varies from 67 m at the confluence with the Danube
to 2,400 m in the southwestern part of the basin. 11% of the catchment area
lies beneath the 200 m contour while some 56% is at an elevation greater than
500 m. The valleys of the South and West Morava are some 3-5 km wide while
parts of the valley of the Great Morava upstream of the Danube flood plain
are up to 10 km wide. Some 35% of the soils in the river basin are considered
suitable for agriculture.
Climate
4.        The basin is subject to a number of complex climatological influen-
ces from the Black and Adriatic Seas in the east and west and the Panonian
lowlands in the north. Generally temperatures are higher in the southern
parts of the basin than in the north. Mean annual temperature is about 1loC
while extremes fall below -300C and rise above +350C. Tne hottest month is
July and the coldest January.
Hydrology
5.        Distribution of precipitation is irregular in time and place but is
generally higher in the eastern and western parts of the basin than in the
south and center. The mean annual precipitation, falling as rain and snow,
is 775 mm in the West Morava basin and 705 mm in the South and Great Morava
basin. Some 25% of the annual total falls in May and June and 40% during
the vegetative period April-September, although rainfall in July and August
is below the annual montilly mean. In the mountainous parts of the basin snow
covers the ground for up to 200 days of the year with a depth of snow of up
to 130 cm, while in lowlands and hills, snowcover may last up to 80 days.
Periods of rain lasting more than 10 days occur every two to three years
while droughts of up to 50 days are not uncommon.
6.        The mean annual flow volume entering the Danube from the Morava
River is about 8 billion m3, of which some 3.7 billion m3 is contributed by
the Zapadna Morava, 3.3 billion m3, by the Juzna Morava and 1.0 billion m3 by
the Great Morava catchment area itself. Among the secondary tributaries the
Ibar is.the most important (1.8 billion m3), followed by the Nisava (0.9 bil-
lion m3) and the Toplica (0.5 billion m3). Peak flood discharges in the
Morava River in an average year and estimated flood peaks with a 2% probabi-
lity of occurrence are given in the following table:



ANNEX 3
Page 3
Flood in         Flood with 2%
Average Year        Probability
(-- m3/sec ----            --)
Velika Morava                           1,500               3,000
Zapadna Morava                            800               1,900
Zuzna Morava                              700               1,600
Corresponding figures for droughts are not available.
7.        Major floods in the main river are more frequent in the late winter
and early spring, but, locally, flooding can occur during a large part of any
year due to local storms. For example, peak annual discharges measures at the
Kormijani station 1/ in the Juzna Morava drainage area between 1924 and 1965
occurred on nine different months of the year during the 42-year period. There
were no peak flood flows recorded from August through October in any year at
this gauging station.
8.        Minor channels are regularly frozen in winter.  Drifting ice is fre-
quently carried by the river in the late winter and early spring.
B. SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
Population
9.        In 1975 2/ there were about 3.6 million people living in the
Yugoslav portion of the Morava River Basin, which was about 16% of the total
population of Yugoslavia. Approximately 85% of the basin population live in
the 81% of the basin within Serbia proper and comprise an estimated 55% of
the population of Serbia proper (5.5 million). The main population increases
are taking place in the urban centers. Some of the predominantly rural com-
munes showed a decline in population between 1961 and 1971. It is estimated
that about 60% of the population in the Morava Basin is still rural, however.
The most important communities are Nis, which has about 200,000 inhabitants,
and Pristina, Kragujevac, Kraljevo, Krusevac, and Lescovac each with over
100,000. Due to the generally mountainous terrain, the habitable valleys of
the basin are relatively densely populated and the hills and mountains sparse-
ly so.
1/   Area controlled by the station is 1,017 km2.
T/   Estimated from 1961 and 1971 census data.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
Economic Activities
10.       The two most important economic sectors in the Morava basin are
agriculture (with forestry) and industry (with mining). Some 1.2 million
ha are cultivated, or under pasture, and another 1.2 million ha are under
forest. On arable land cereals dominate, particularly wheat and maize. Pro-
duction of industrial crops and vegetables is limited but fodder crops are
relatively important, as well as vineyards and orchards. Only about 10% of
the forest area is in high forest. Nearly all the agriculture is rainfed.
However, small scale irrigation does occur on about 20,000 ha providing sup-
plemental water in the summer, mainly for vegetables. The largest irrigation
scheme is upstream of Cacak where some 3,100 ha of orchards are supplied by
unregulated flows diverted from the Zapadna Morava.
11.       The most important industries are mining and metal industries, tex-
tiles, and food processing. The heavier industries are situated more in the
Zapadna Morava basin. Kragujevac has a large automobile manufacturing indus-
try and Sevojno (near Titovo Uzice) has a large metallurgical refinery, ex-
pected to produce annually by 1985 some 100,000 tons of copper and copper
alloys and 70,000 tons of aluminium and aluminium alloys. Textiles and food
processing are important in Nis and Lescovac and a number of other towns. All
towns of any size have important manufacturing industries which make signi-
ficant demands on the water supply and cause pollution.
C. WATER RESOURCES PLANNING
12.       In order to take action aginst the perpetual problem of floods in
the Morava basin, the Serbian Government created the Directorate for the
Regulation of the Morava Basin in 1958. This public sector organization fo-
cussed exclusively on the regulation of the river, mainly through dykes. Lit-
tle had been accomplished when the severe floods of 1963 struck the basin. By
1965, the Directorate, aided considerably by engineering consultants (parti-
cularly the Jaroslav Cerni Institute of Belgrade) completed a master plan for
water control.  In that same year, another major flood struck.
13.       By the year the master plan was completed, a large amount of flood
regulation works had already been implemented in local areas throughout the
basin. By 1965, some 441 km of dykes and 242 km of river regulation works had
been built, affording some protection to 55,000 ha of farmlands and urban
areas. A further 120 sq km were protected from runoff from local torrents by
20 km of interceptor drainage canals. Erosion control measues (check weirs



ANNEX 3
Page 5
on torrents, afforestation, etc.) had been carried out to reduce erosion
over some 300 km2. Soil drainage systems had been installed to lower ground-
water levels in some 11,000 ha in the Velika Morava valley.
14.       In 1966, the Assembly of Serbia approved a 20-year construction
program (1966-1985) based on the master plan. The 20-year program was sub-
sequently given the force of law in 1971.
15.       A summary of the structures foreseen by the long term master plan
and the 20-year development program is as follows:
Master Plan   20-Year Program
Item                                  (1965)         (1966-1985)
Dams                                   106               18
Dikes                                1,800 km           223 km
River Regulation                       900 km           234 km
Erosion Control                      4,800 km2        1,566 km2
16.       Very large reservoirs on main branches of the river would be neces-
sary to have a major impact in storing flood waters, but these have not been
proposed in the master plan for the good reason that such reservoirs would
inundate a large proportion of the productive and urbanized land. The social
and economic costs of such disruption would exceed the possible benefits.
Instead, the plan proposes a large number of relatively small multipurpose
reservoirs on smaller tributaries and in the headwaters. However, comprehen-
sive planning for each reservoir has not been carried out. Where dams have
been designed, insufficient attention has been paid to related systems neces-
sary to utilize the reservoirs (power, irrigation, urban water supply, etc.)
and there is evidence that reservoir sizes have not been optimized for their
multipurpose role. The concept seems to have been to have the reservoirs
built and then determine how best to utilize them. This is the de facto
situation with two reservoirs now under construction (Bovan and Celije; see
Map 11603).
17.       The 1965 master plan was prepared primarily as a reaction to reduce
problems caused by flooding. At the same time, however, construction of the
Djerdap hydro-electric and navigation complex was commencing on the Danube,
about 200 km downstream of Belgrade. Following negotiations between Yugoslavia
and Rumania a fund of Din 500 million (US$29.4 m) was established for the con-
struction of projects in Yugoslavia which would prevent sedimentation of the
Djerdap reservoir (and thus reduce dredging expenses). This fund was apparent-
ly set up without detailed analysis of the economics of alternative solutions
to maintaining navigation in the Djerdap reservoir backwater. Its existence
spurred Yugoslav planners, particularly those in the Morava basin, to plan
projects which could help to reduce downstream sedimentation, since funding



ANNEX 3
Page 6
for a component of the costs of such projects was assured. 1/ Also the
ability of reservoirs to augment low flows in the river system was regarded
as an important water quality benefit. However, realistic plans to control
pollution at source have not yet been made.
18.       The master plan concentrated on structures to regulate flows for
flood control, pollution control and sediment detention because government
funds (Serbian Water Fund and the Djerdap Fund) were available, albeit on a
limited scale, for implementation of such projects. However, water resources
projects which would produce benefits in other sectors (e.g. irrigation,
hydro-electric power, water supply) were not planned in detail, since under
the Yugoslav system, they are the responsibilities of the investors who
require them. Specific benefits in these other sectors, (i.e. in addition to
the flood control and sediment retention) were not evaluated in detail.
19.       Economic analysis has been lacking in previous planning efforts.
There is little evidence that least cost solutions have been sought to meet
explicitly defined problems. No economic rationale is presented for the pro-
posed development and phasing of the master plan. Benefit estimates have as-
sumed that at a certain future time, all proposed projects will be in existen-
ce: no account has been taken of the dynamics of a program based on implemen-
tation of projects in order of priority.
20.       The planning of water resources development in the Morava basin has
been fragmented because of the limited perspective and authority of the river
planners. Water users for irrigation, power or water supply, have had very
little to do with the planning process. They have made their own plans inde-
pendently. They are also required to finance their projects without govern-
ment assistance. Capital limitations are perhaps a primary reason, even more
important than inadequate planning, for inadequate water supply and waste-
water systems (including pollution control facilities) throughout the basin.
21.       Although ten years have passed since the 20-year program was ap-
proved by the Serbian government, little progress has been made in imple-
menting the recommended projects. Of 18 dams only three are under construc-
tion: Gazivode, with World Bank assistance; also Celije and Bovan, on which
progress has been very poor. Somewhat better progress has been made on other
structures as follows:
580 km of dykes constructed;
250 km of river channel improvements completed;
86,100 ha protected by erosion control works.
1/   For the multipurpose water project based on the Gazivode dam on the Ibar
River, in Kosovo, which the Bank agreed to finance in 1971 (Loan 777-YU),
the Djerdap fund contributed Din 70 million (US$4.1 million). The Djerdap
fund began making commitments in 1966. All available funds are expected
to be committed by 1976.

D. LEGISLATIVE AND INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
22.       The Serbian Water Fund (SWF) was established by Serbian legislation
in 1965 to provide funds for implementing the master plan. Further informa-
tion on SWF is provided in Annex 4.
23.       The Federal Water Law of 1965 was essentially enabling legislation
for the preparation and implementation of water control plans for the rivers
of Yugoslavia. A complementary law was passed by the Assembly of Serbia in
1967.
24.       In 1967, the Morava River Corporation (MRC) was created to imple-
ment the 1965 master plan and 20-year program. MRC was basically the exten-
sion of the previous Directorate for the Regulation of the Morava basin (para
12). In 1972, the organizational arrangements were modified. MRC became a
consortium of several independent "water economy enterprises" 1/ throughout
the basin. Nine such regional enterprises are responsible for construction
and also maintenance of water control structures (dykes, channel improvements
and erosion control measures). These are basically contracting organizations.
25.       One of the MRC enterprises, the Velika Morava Enterprise, is the
Belgrade-based planning group which acts as a service organization to the
other enterprises in MRC. Key staff in the Velika Morava Enterprise have been
involved with water resources plans from the time the 1965 master plan was
under preparation. This group is also the designated Yugoslav counterpart for
the ongoing UNDP project "Computer Control of the Water Resources Systems in
the Morava River Basin" which got underway in October, 1974.
26.       The Serbian authorities have become aware that the 1965 master plan
is imperfect and that institutional arrangements to manage water resources
1/   A water management organization (water economy enterprise) is established
in an area covering one or more communes, for the purpose of acting as the
executing agency for construction, operation and maintenance of facilities
(dykes, dams, river training works, etc.), concerned with water utilization
within river basins. The supply of water for domestic and commercial pur-
poses is largely outside the jurisdiction of these bodies and is normally
the responsibility of communal enterprises (e.g. Cacak Vodovod and Titovo
Uzice Bioktos). Water management organizations can compete against other
contractors for construction work financed by the Serbian Water Fund. They
may also undertake engineering and other studies. In addition to carrying
out works from public funds, these organizations carry out contractual
work from time to time for other enterprises and communities, for which
they make charges on an economic basis.

need to be improved. World Bank assistance to finance eight projects 1/
comprising the 1973-1978 phase of the 20-year program was requested in 1972.
This request led to subsequent missions which eventually defined the first
project for Bank assistance. An outline of Bank involvement in the project
is provided in Annex 1.
27.       In July, 1975, the Serbian Assembly passed a new Water Law.  In
accordance with the Yugoslav Constitution of 1974, self-managing "communities
of interest" are to be created for three water regions in Serbia:
(a) Danube River basin (including Mlava, Peka and Timoka water-
sheds) in east of Serbia;
(b) Sava River basin (including the Drina watershed) in west of
Serbia;
(c) Morava River basin (including Pcinja and Dragovishtitsa Rivers)
in central and southern Serbia.
As previously noted (para 2) the Morava basin itself accounts for the largest
part of the terriory of Serbia proper.
28.       According to Article 21 of the 1975 Water Law, the Regional water
communities of interest are established "in order to settle the following
community problems and solve questions of profits:
(1)  establish policies for the promotion of the water
condition in the given water region;
(2) establish grounds for the water management basis in
the water region;
(3) establish a program and plans for water retention and
development of the water condition in the given water
region, in accordance with water management principles
for the water region;
(4) ensuring the retention and development of the water con-
ditions and the basic water supply in the water region;
1/   These projects included seven dams (Semedraz, Vrutci, Konculj,
Vlasotince, Selova, Odorovce and Gradina) plus water supply systems
for the towns of Cacak, Titovo Uzice and Aleksinac.



ANNEX 3
Page 9
(5) the establishment of a network of water flowing (rivers)
and still (lakes) in the water region;
(6) ensuring the construction, reconstruction and erection of
protective and other water management installations important
to the water region and to flood and ice control;
(7) ensuring the protection of water from pollution;
(8) ensuring the safe-keeping of water resources;
(9) ensuring studies (work) on water management problems, water
management balance, expenditures, etc.;
(10) implementation of other transactions established by this law
and the self-governing agreement formulated in the principles
of the water management cooperative of the water region.
The relevant water management cooperative in a water region may enter into
an agreement with the appropriate organizations and agencies to achieve indi-
vidual transactions within the framework of the activities of this coopera-
tive."
29.       Also to be created under the 1975 Water Law is a republican water
community of interest, which will coordinate activities of regional communi-
ties of interest, establish republican policies, deal with other republics,
promote research, etc.
30.       The water communities of interest are to be established by local com-
mittees, according to the new law, during 1976.
31.       It is understood that the functions of the Republican Water Fund and
the Velika Morava Enterprise of MRC will be taken over by the to-be-created
water communities of interest.

SERBIAN WATER FUND
Organization and Administration
A. BACKGROUND
1.        The Serbian Water Fund (SWF) was established in its present form
in 1965 by Republican legislation for the purpose of raising, controlling
and disbursing funds for the construction, reconstruction and maintenance of
various structures for flood protection, river regulation and protection from
soil erosion. Its operations are concerned with six separate river basin
areas in Serbia 1/, one of which (by far the largest) is Morava. During the
period from 1967 to 1970 it financed mainly dykes and river training struc-
tures. During the last five years it has turned its activity, also, to dam
construction. It is financing the construction of two dams (Celije and Bovan)
and also a program of studies for the construction of other dams, among them
Vrutci and Semedraz, for the towns of Titovo Uzice and Cacak respectively.
B. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
2.        SWF has a management committee of 19, of which 6 are nominated by
the Executive Council of Serbia and the remainder by various water enter-
prises concerned with its activity. The committee has a chairman and also
a full-time director, appointed by the Executive Council, who is a member of
the committee ex-officio. SWF has a full time staff of only 10-12 people who
are technical, economic, accounting, legal and administrative specialists con-
cerned with the disbursemrent of its funds and does not itself carry out
operation or construction work. It is intended that this staff will be some-
what enlarged to handle the proposed project.
3.        SWF prepares annual and five-yearly work plans which are submitted
to the Republican Assembly for approval. General supervision of the work of
SWF is carried out by the Republican Executive Council.

4.        SWF's main operations are carried out by making contracts with
various water management organizations, either for planning or construction
work. A considerable amount of work in the past has been carried out under
annual contracts between SWF and the Morava River Corporation (MRC), a legal
entity comprising a water management organization specialising in planning
(Velike Morava) and eleven other water management organizations which carry
out construction and maintenance operations (See Also Annex 3).
5.        The financial aspects of the operations of SWF are discussed in

TITOVO UZICE - EXISTING WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER FACILITIES
A. Background
1.        Titovo Uzice is a historic town situated in the valley of the
Djetinja River, a main tributary of the Zapadna Morava (see Map 11640). Some 5
km downstream from Titovo Uzice is the small town of Sevojno, the location of
the very large copper and aluminum processing industry. The combined popul-
ation of the two towns was estimated to total some 46,000 in 1975, of which
about 10% lived in Sevojno.
2.         The urban population in this region has grown rapidly in the post-
war era, as evidenced by the following previous population figures for the
town of Titovo Uzice (excluding Sevojno).
Year                     1921       1931       1937       1961       1971
Population                     4,894      7,485     8,300    20,060    34,312
Average Annual Growth
Rate During Period                4.3%        1.8%      3.7%      5.5%
The combined populations of Titovo Uzice and Sevojno increased between the
census years 1961 and 1971 from 23,933 to 38,162, for an average annual growth
rate of 4.8%.
3.        Recent growth has been due to the rapid industrialization in the
towns (nearly half of the working population is employed by the metallurgical
industry at Sevojno). This growth has also been influenced considerably by the
town's location on improved transportation links, specifically the Belgrade-Bar
railroad (financed under Bank Loan 531-YU) and the Belgrade-Dubrovnik highway.
4.        Until recent times the town was small, with little industry, and the
population relied upon local wells and springs for their water supplies. The
design of a modern water supply system began in 1931 by an engineering pro-
fessor born locally. The Ministry of Civil Engineering of the Kingdom of
Yugoslavia began construction of the recommended system in 1937 and the first
public supply began to operate in 1938. Details of the system are provided
subsequently.
5.        The enterprise responsible for water supply and wastewater disposal
in the commune is "BIOKTOS", an enterprise formed by the merger of several
local agencies in 1966. Bioktos is also responsible for other local services,
(storm drainage, markets, parks, landscaping, garbage removal, funeral service -
see Annex 18).



ANNEX 5
Page 2
6.        Some sewers were built during the Turkish period but most are rela-
tively new. The present practice of Bioktos is to construct sanitary sewers
to serve properties as the water distribution network is extended.
7.        At Titovo Uzice the valley of the Djetinja River is narrow with
steep sides (see Map 11637). Because space is limited, the population density
is high (400 persons/ha in the central area) with many high-rise buildings
built and planned.
8.        Bioktos has been unable to provide water supply and wastewater facil-
ities to keep up with rapid urban growth. Only half the population are con-
nected to the present water supply system (see Annex 28) and the sources are
inadequate to supply the demands of those already connected. Water is con-
stantly rationed, the pressure in the system is frequently very low, and there
is a constant danger that polluted groundwater can enter the water distribu-
tion system. In summer periods, when demands are highest and water availabil-
ity the lowest, priority is given to supplying water to key industries so the
water shortages for the population are severe.
9.        Those not connected to the water system rely on inadequate local
springs and wells or carry water to their buildings from 15 public taps on the
Bioktos system. None of the residences in the high level zone in the town are
presently served by the water supply network.
10.       Surface water and groundwater are heavily polluted by industrial and
domestic wastewater. There are no treatment facilities and all sewers dis-
charge directly to the river (see Map 11638), causing severe aesthetic as well
as public health problems. An estimated 46% of the population are connected
to public sewers. The remainder use septic tanks (24%) or discharge wastes
directly into the ground (30%).
11.       Industrial develcpment is constrained and gastro-intestinal problems
are common because of the poor water supply. In September 1974, a diarrheal
epidemic 1/ which affectd some 2,000 people, of whom several hundred are
hospitalized, was blamed on the water supply system.
12.       Five industries in the area have built their own water supply syste
which pump water directly from the increasingly polluted Djetinja River.  In
1974 their combined water consumption was estimated to average 230 liters/
second, almost twice the volume of treated water produced by Bioktos (see
Annex 28). By far the largest private system is that of the metallurgical
industry at Sevojno, which has its own river intake and treatment plant
with a capacity of 250 liters/second. These facilities at Sevojno were
built recently because Bioktos was unable to provide the water needed for
industrial expansion.

ANNEX 5
Page 3
13.       The unregulated flow of the Djetinja River is estimated to average
3.7 m3/second at Titovo Uzice but low flows can drop to 300 liters/second -
which is less than the present combined abstraction by Bioktos and the indus-
tries with private supplies. If supplies are to increase to meet the present
and growing demands of the town and its industries, the need for additional
firm supplies is obvious.
14.       Although all wastewater entering the river presently is untreated,
the largest polluter (the metallurgical industry at Sevojno) has almost com-
pleted construction of a wastewater treatment plant. The reported objectives
of the plant are to recover metals as well as to reduce water pollution. The
chemical treatment process is expected to be operational in 1976. In the
meantime, plant wastewater is apparently neutralized by lime before release
into the river.
B.   Bioktos Water Supply Facilities
15.       The present water supply system is depicted on Map 11637.  The ori-
ginal source for the town's water supply system was spring at Zivkovica which
has been in use since 1938. Water is pumped from the spring into a small
treatment plant (capacity 40 liters/second) where rapid sand filtration is
followed by chlorination.
16.       In 1948, a second source was developed, the small spring at Cebica,
from which water can be pumped to the Zivkovica treatment plant or supplied
by gravity to the line serving Sevojno.
17.       As water demands increased, and shortages accordingly, Bioktos con-
structed temporary facilities at Turica, upstream of Titovo Uzice. Two in-
filtration basins and three wells at this site began operating in 1974. Water
from wells is chlorinated and pumped to the network from a temporary pumping
station. The aquifer yield of approximately 80 1/s is augmented by the
surface water pumped into the infiltration basins from the Djetinja River
and its tributary Volujac. However, nearly 50% of the water pumped into the
basins is lost by seepage, and the Turica source rarely reaches its full
capacity of 120 1/s.
18.       Water from Zivkovica flows by gravity to Sevojno, to the lower sec-
tions of Titovo Uzice and to consumers in between. Water from the Turica
source is pumped to medium level zones in Titovo Uzice. There are four small
distribution reservoirs as follows:

Total                 2,700 m3
19.       Reservoir storage in the system totals only 34% of the average 1974
daily consumption.
20.       In addition to the treated water pumping station at the Turica
source, a small pumping station at the Dovoje reservoir lifts water to the
Kapetanovina reservoir for the higher level distribution system. Charac-
teristics of these pumping facilities are as follows:

21.       The distribution network consisted of a total of 56.6 km of pipes
in December 1974, as follows:

ANNEX 5

22.       This summary illustrates the weaknesses in the present distribution
system. Some 55% of the pipes are less than 100 mm in diameter and the largest
pipe in the system is only 300 mm. In the five years 1970-74 only 7.1 km of
distribution pipes (60 to 150 mm) were added to the system, since Bioktos has
been more concerned with source problems than expansion of the distribution
system.
23.       In 1974 there were a total of 3,593 connections to the water supply
system, including 15 public taps for residents in the high level zone which
is not served by the distribution network. All connections are metered.
C. Water Quality Control
24.       The present production of potable water at the Turica source is
theoretically illegal because the groundwater recharge system has not been
approved by the Republican Health Institute. Turbidity, color and organic
substances in the river water at Turica are normally reduced to an accept-
able level by the infiltration basins, but occasionally an excessive number
of coliform is detected in the treated water. Raw water is tested once a
week, and treated water twice a week, by the Institute for Health Protection,
a bacteriological research center commonly owned by the commune of Titovo
Uzice and nine other neighboring communes. Where the results of such tests
prove unsatisfactory, first the amount of chlorine is increased, and if that
does not solve the problem, the intake from the river is temporarily closed.
25.       One of the Bioktos technicians is specifically assigned  to the duty
of inspecting the river (upstream of Turica) constantly. She not only checks
polluters of the river (such as the people who dump garbage or wash their
cars in the river) but also takes random samples of the water to test and
make sure that it meets the standard set forth by the Republic Law.
D. Bioktos Wastewater Facilities
26.       The wastewater system in Titovo Uzice is quite simple.  The area
served by the sewer network is limited (see Map 11638) and in 1974 the
number of sewer connections (2,328) was some 65% of the number of water
connections. There is no wastewater treatment plant, and the sewage col-
lected by the network is directly discharged into the river. Many of the
existing sewers are combined, carrying storm drainage as well as domestic
and industrial wastewater. The sewer network was as follows at the end
of 1974:

CACAK - EXISTING WATER SUPPLY
WASTEWATER AND STORM DRAINAGE FACILITIES
A.   Background
1.        Cacak is situated on the banks of the Zapadna Morava River where the
valley bottom is flat and about 3 km wide (see Map 11640). The 1975 population
of the town is estimated at 44,000. Annual precipitation averages 720 mm.
2.        For centuries the residents of Cacak have relied on shallow wells to
provide their water. Hundreds of these wells, dug by hand (generally not
deeper than 5 m) in the alluvial aquifer, are equipped with hand pumps.
3.        The system of private- wells becomes increasingly inadequate, for two
main reasons:
(a) Output of individual wells is limited. Industrialization and
increasing density of urban settlement patterns limit the use
of such private wells. Pump tests by hydrogeologists 1/ in
test wells upstream of Cacak, where the aquifer characteristics
are the best available locally, indicated that the maximum
possible yield of 300 mm diameter wells would be about 20
lit/sec. each (1,728 m3/day for 24-hour pumping).
(b)  Water quality is bad.  The groundwater is increasingly polluted.
Water quality tests of some 400 wells in town have indicated that
99% are bacteriologically contaminated. Pollution in the shal-
low aquifer is caused by town wastewater (most buildings are
not sewered) and possibly by the pollution in the Zapadna Morava
River which meanders through the permeable alluvium in the valley.
4.        Work on the first piped water supply began in 1951, mainly to serve
the Sloboda industrial enterprise at the south-west edge of the town. Two
wells were built in the Beljina region near the river to supply the industry,
and a third was built the next year for the town. A pumping station, pressure
main, reservoir and distribution line were then built to begin supplying water

to the town. Only water surplus to industrial requirements was supplied to
Cacak, and only to the small portion of the town near the industry. The ini-
tial capacity of the system was about 1,000 m3/day.
5.        In 1964 eight new wells with a capacity of 9,500 m3/day were con-
structed at the Beljina source and the old wells were abandoned. Even these
new wells proved insufficient to supply the growing demands of the town and
its industry. Two more wells were dug in 1967/68.
6.        In July 19.73 a new water supply source began operating at the
Beljina site, based on wells recharged by river water, to augment existing
facilities there. This systen is described in detail subsequently.
7.        The distribution system has grown slowly, starting from the
Beljina source. Demand for water has always exceeded the capacity of the
system. In allocating scarce water, Vodovod has given priority to indus-
trial and commercial consumers 1/, since domestic consumers (particularly
in the outlying areas of town) can continue to exist on private wells.
8.        From the outset Vodovod constructed separate sewers to remove
wastewater from the areas served by the water supply system.
9.        Cacak was inundated by the flood on the Western Morava in 1965.
Since then, dikes have been built to protect the town and the river channel
improved and stabilized through the center of town. The construction of
storm drains in the center of town has proceeded slowly, under the respons-
ibility of another communal enterprise.
B.   Water Supply
10.       Existing public water supply facilities and area served are shown
in Map 11640. The proportion of the town's population served by the system
has increased with the growth of the distribution network. A summary of the
networks built from 1954 to 1974 is provided in Tables 1 and 4 at the end
of this annex.
11.       All of Cacak's publicly supplied water is pumped from wells at
Beljina but the yield of this alluvial aquifer is entirely dependent on flows
in the adjacent Zapadna Morava River. The aquifer is very shallow, with ex-
tremely limited storage, so its yield drops with the river level. Hydro-
geological investigations in the area indicate that some 75% of water pumped
from wells near the river is effectively river water, filtered through the
sands and gravels of the aquifer.
1/   In 1974 some 62% of Vodovod's water sales were to commercial and
industrial consumers. See Annex 29 for further details.



ANNEX 6

12.       The capacity of the wells at Vodovod's Beljina site was limited so
an entirely new system was constructed there and began operating in 1973, con-
sisting of five new wells and four recharge basins and a treated water pumping
station. Raw water is pumped from an intake in the Western Morava to the re-
charge basins through a pump station with the following characteristics:
Number of pumps    -   3
Capacity per pump  -   100 liters/second
Pumping Head        -   8 m to 10 m
Total Installed Power -   55 kw
13.       The recharge basins are about 3 m deep and surrounded by embank-
ments.  Three basins are 1,500 m2 each while the fourth is 4,500 m2.  About
1.5 m of fine grained river sand lies on the top of the natural alluvium and
acts as a slow-sand filter. Every few months, the basins are taken out of
service and cleaned, removing accumulated sediment and about 2 cm of sand.
14.       By the end of 1975 there were a total of 20 wells at the Beljina
site as follows:
-    8 wells, 200 mm diameter, drilled in 1964 along river bank.
These wells have no pumps. The water flows by gravity through
a collection pipeline connecting the series of wells to the
sump at the pump station.
-    I sump well at pumping station (1964).
-    2 wells (KI and K2), 3 m diameter, dug in 1967/68.
-    9 dug wells, 3 m diameter (5 in 1973 and 4 in 1975) for use
with recharge basins.
Vertical pumps in the large diameter dug wells have the same characteristics:
capacity 20 liters/second; head 10 m; and power 5.5 kw.
15.       All water is chlorinated before being delivered to the distribution
system.
16.       The pumping system which drives water collected from the wells to
the Beljina reservoir consists of two adjacent pumping stations, the original
one and the one completed in 1973. Features of these pumping stations are as
follows:

Capacity per pump (1/s)             100-160           40-50
Pumping Head (m)                     70-90             70-90
Installed power (kw)                2 x 160           3 x 55
17.       Water is pumped through 0.8 km of 400 mm diameter pipeline to two
buried concrete reservoirs above Beljina (water level range 308 m to 312 m)
with capacities of 470 m3 and 1,050 m3. This total reservoir capacity of
1,520 m3 represents only 3.4 hour's storage for the 1974 average daily con-
sumption of 10,674 m3.
18.       The capacity of the Beljina system is nominally 200 liters/second,
in accordance with the operating capacity of the treated water pumps and the
pipeline to the reservoir.
19.       In 1974 Cacak had a total of 42 km of distribution pipes (Table 1),
built continuously over a period 1954-1974 (Table 4). An estimated 60% of the
population was served by the system. There were a total of 5,275 connections
to the Vodovod system in 1974, all of which were metered.  Domestic sales
reportedly accounted for only 38% of the average total sales of 124 liters/
second (see Annex 29). The accuracy of Vodovod's water production and sales
figures are suspect, however, because sales were reported to be in excess of
98% of water production for the three years 1972-1974.
C.   Wastewater
20.       The existing sanitary sewer network is shown on Map 11641.  An out-
line of the 43 km of sewers is provided in Table 2 and the history of system
construction in Table 4.
21.       The river flows from west to east through the town and most waste-
water flows by gravity to the discharge point on the right bank some 2.5 km
downstream of the town center. There is no treatment.
22.       Wastewater flows from the sewers serving the left (north) bank are
pumped through pipes suspended on the railway bridge. The only pumping sta-
tion in the system has two pumps, each capable of discharging 40 liters/
second against a head of 12.5 m.
23.       At the end of 1974 there were 2,866 sewer connections, or 54% of the
number of water connections. Frequently a property would have several water
connections and only one sewer connection, so it is probable that approxi-
mately 80% of the properties connected to the water supply system are also
connected to the wastewater system. The remaining water consumers use either

septic tanks or pit privies, which Vodovod empties with its tanker truck.
Large industries (e.g. paper mill and bottling factory) discharge their wastes
directly to the river.
D.   Storm Drainage
24.       Storm drains are shown on Map 11641 and described in Tables 3 and 4.
The main areas drained are the built-up areas on the right bank.
25.       Because the storm drainage network is hardly developed in most
areas, and because the town is quite flat, the greater part of the storm
runoff percolates into the alluvium.

APPRAISAL OF
MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
STUDY 1: ADJUSTMENTS TO FLOOD HAZARDS
OUTLINE
A.   BACKGROUND
The Morava River drains a watershed of some 38,000 km2, of which
about 81% (including all downstream sections of the main tributaries) is in
Serbia proper. 1/
In 1965, a master plan was completed for the regulation of the
Morava River. This plan recommended a number of structural measures to re-
duce flooding including:
106 large reservoirs;
-   about 1,800 km of dikes;
about 900 km of river channel improvements.
By 1975, construction of three of the proposed dams was underway
(Gazivode, Bovan and Celije) and many kilometers of new dikes and river
channel improvements had been completed. The 1965 master plan is becoming
less relevant because land use patterns in the basin have changed and addi-
tional hydrologic and meteorologic data are now available. Furthermore,
there is an increased appreciation of the need to justify all proposed in-
vestments economically. Therefore, a revised program of measures to adjust
to the flood hazard needs to be prepared.

Under UNDP auspices a two-year project titled "Computer Control of
the Water Resources Systems in the Morava River Basin" is currently underway.
Project objectives include development of a data base and of models for the
simulation of hydrologic and hydraulic processes. Accordingly, models,
methodology and trained staff should be available to improve water resources
planning in the Morava basin.
B.   STUDY OBJECTIVES
The study would develop a comprehensive system of adjustments to
the flood hazard for the mitigation of property damage, improvement of land
use and the protection of life in the Morava River Basin.
The proposed study is intended to review the flood problem with a
much broader approach than before, i.e. by evaluating both structural and non-
structural adjustments to flood hazards throughout the basin. An outline of
alternative adjustments is provided in Attachment 1. Control of river flows
and levels will be only one aspect of the study, which will make maximum use
of data and engineering designs collected during the previous planning exer-
cise, as well as additional information which has become available subse-
quently.
This study is intended to provided recommendations for action which
can be implemented by the appropriate authorities in Serbia proper.
C.   SCOPE OF WORK
The substantive elements of the flood adjustment study are outlined
hereafter:
(a) Analysis of flood frequencies
Analyze flood frequencies by stage, duration and extent during the
past fifty years (or more if reliable records permit) for the Velika Morava,
and major tributaries such as the Juzna Morava, Zapadna Morava, Ibar, Nisava
and Toplica.
This hydrologic analysis should determine the flood flows expected
along various reaches of the river channel at return frequencies of 1%, 2%, 4%
and 10%. Hydrometeorological conditions should be analyzed only to the extent
necessary to complete this analysis of flood frequencies.
(b) Review and evaluation of programs for non-structural alternatives
A number of non-structural alternatives exist (see Attachment 1)
and should be considered. The study should review and evaluate three such
alternatives in detail. Each evaluation should include recommendations for
any improvements; which may be required.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
(1) Flood forecasting and warning system
The Hydrometeorological Service of Serbia apparently
operates such a system at present. The details of this system
should be reviewed along with the measures used to utilize
such information, particularly emergency measures organiza-
tions in the communes. Can more effective predictions of
flooding be made? Can the information be communicated more
efficiently? Are organizations sufficiently prepared to
execute emergency action to protect lives and minimize
damage to moveable property?
(ii) Flood proofing
Although an effective flood warning system will enable
action to be taken to protect or rescue moveable property,
flood proofing is required to minimize damage to fixed
assets. Literature is available on this subject but a well-
organized program of public education and possibly some com-
pulsory requirements are needed to put such a program into
effect.
Flood proofing is particularly necessary in areas pro-
tected by dikes. No land lying behind protective embankments
can be assumed to be immune from flood damage. In fact, when
dikes are breeched or overtopped, the damage to property is
usually greater than expected because of the false sense of
security occasioned by the existence of dikes and the conse-
quent level of development that takes place as a result.
(iii) Flood insurance
Because no amount of work by man to control or adjust to
floods can guarantee absolute protection, a program of compul-
sory, comprehensive flood insurance should be investigated
to see if such a scheme would be economically feasible and
beneficial in the Morava Basin. All properties, urban and
rural (including crops and livestock) that lie within reach
of a flood level of I in 50 year frequency should be consi-
dered. As with flood proofing, insurance is particularly
valuable in areas lying behind dikes. When dikes are breeched
or overtopped, damage is always extensive but because such
damages do not normally occur throughout a basin at any one
time (i.e., the degre of flooding varies from one part of a
basin to another from year to year) it is possible through an
insurance program to share the risk over a large number of
people and enterprises.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
(c) Review status of existing dikes
Carry out a detailed investigation of the existing embankments or
dikes to determine their exact capability to protect land in terms of flood
recurrence intervals. As more and more dikes are built over time the actual
flood crests are accentuated because of the containment of the flow within
the embankments, so that new estimates of the effective protection of the
existing dikes is needed from time to time. However this study should focus
exclusively on the types existing or under construction at the time of the
study.
(d) Mapping of flood-prone lands
Map the lands susceptible to flooding at return frequencies of 1%,
2%, 4% and 10% on the 1:25,000 topographic maps. The mapping will include
the location and description of all existing dikes with a code to indicate
the level of protection afforded by each section of the dikes. The mapping
of flood boundaries will take the existing dikes and other features such as
road and railways embankments into account. Subsequently the flood boundaries
should be presented on maps of a more suitable scale (e.g. 1:100,000.)
(e) Evaluation of probable annual damage functions
Evaluate the potential damage that would occur during inundation at
each of the recurrence intervals mentioned in (d) above. Standard methods are
to be used so that flood damages are estimated consistently.   Estimates will
be required for farm and non-farm lands and will be based on the mapping of
flood susceptibility which will record land use, i.e. cultivated land, orchards
and vineyards, pasture, forest, farm homesteads, urban residential, commercial
and industrial lands, transportation routes, parks and recreational lands and
other. Annual damage functions should be developed for the various kinds of
rural and urban lands and for types of properties and other assets.
(f) Identification and analysis of feasible alternatives
Identify the range of alternative solutions to reducing the flood
hazard which are applicable to local problems, both non-structural and struc-
tural, with emphasis on combinations of measures likely to provide least-
cost solutions. Preliminary designs of all possible alternatives are re-
quired so that realistic cost estimates can be prepared.
Where reservoirs appear to be appropriate for storing flood flows,
the study should explore the possibility of multipurpose design and opera-
tion of such reservoirs. First identify the reservoir storage volumes and
locations needed to reduce flood peaks by various amounts. Next the study
should determine the technical and economic feasibility of providing such
storage capacities. Eventually a series of feasible alternative reservoirs
should be identified, which may include some or all of the reservoir sites
which have been studied previously.



ANNEX 7
Page 5
For multipurpose reservoirs the complete water resources system (in-
cluding facilities to utilize water for other objectives) needs to be con-
sidered, including estimated benefits, costs and construction phasing.
(g) Evaluation of alternative programs
Evaluate the various alternatives and combinations of alternatives
to make adjustments to the flood hazard throughout the Morava basin. Be-
cause they require litte expenditure, non-structural solutions should be
utilized wherever possible.
The benefits of each program need to be analyzed thoroughly, with
particular attention paid to the dynamics of the' estimated benefits. Avoid-
ance of flood damages should be determined for existing land use patterns,
but future benefits can also include the enhanced future use of lands pro-
tected from floods by the proposed solution. 1/
Rigorous economic analysis is required for each alternative program
of investments. This requires an estimate of total costs in each year (capi-
tal plus operating and maintenance) along with the associated estimated annual
benefits. Future streams of costs and benefits should be discounted to the
present, using discount rates of 8%, 12% and 16%, so that the present value
of the costs and benefits of each alternative program can be compared.
For comparison purposes, one of the alternatives which should be
identified and evaluated is the provisional construction program of the
Serbian Water Fund for dykes and reservoirs in future years.
(h) Institutional Analysis
Specific attention should be paid to the institutional aspects of
the situation. The responsibilities and effectiveness of all agencies and
authorities presently involved in dealing with flooding should be evaluated.
Specific recommendations should be made for improvements in the institutional
aspects of all adjustments to flood hazards.
1/   In dealing with agricultural land, it is essential to guard against a
tendency to exaggerate the annual costs, particularly because the es-
timated recurrence interval for damage to standing crops is less than
that for other flood damage frequencies, as crops are only on the land
for part of the year. The risk of a flood occurring during the crop
season is less than the computed recurrence interval on an annual
basis. Flooding of agricultural lands during non-crop seasons also
causes other consequences which should be explored. Deposition of
silt contributes to soil fertility, whereas deposition of sand can
have the opposite effect.



ANNEX 7
Page 6
(i) Recommendations
The study should conclude with a recommended program for action.
Additional programs for implementing or strengthening non-structural solutions
should be recommended if necessary to ensure that suitable operational plans
exist for:
(i) forecasting excessive precipitation and runoff;
(ii) warning the populace as far in advance as possible of
a flood threat; and
(iii) executing emergency action to protect lives and minimize damage
to moveable property.
Priorities should be assigned to each recommended investment for
structural solutions, based on the estimated benefit/cost ratio, in a phased
investment program. Alternative investment programs should be presented,
ranked and discussed.
Based on the preceding economic analysis of costs and benefits,
priorities should be assigned to each recommended investment for structural
solutions. Realistic recommendations for investment are expected, taking
account of the availability of funds and the need to phase all investment
programs.
The report should name an existing or proposed agency (or agencies)
to be responsible for each action recommended.
D.   MANAGEMENT OF STUDY
(a) Responsibility
The Serbian Water Fund will be responsible for carrying out
the study. A firm of consultants will be engaged to complete the
study under the control of the Water Fund. From time to time dur-
ing the study period the Water Fund will obtain independent expert
advice from specialist advisors engaged either by the consultants
themselves or directly by the Water Fund.
(b) Timing
The study is expected to be completed within 30 months of
its commencement.
(c) Reports
The following reports are to be provided by the consultants:
(i) Inception Report



ANNEX 7
Page 7
Within 30 days of commencement of study, the consultants
should indicate in detail their proposed program and staffing
to carry out all phases of the study.
(ii) Quarterly Progress Reports
Every three months, the consultants should prepare a
brief report covering:
-    activities during past three months and comparison
of performance with planned program,
-    planned activities during remaining period, par-
ticularly next three months,
-    outline of any problems or changed circumstances
likely to affect results of study,
-    any recommended revisions to overall work plan.
(iii)  Interim Report
When elements (a) through (e) of the study have been
completed (approximately 18 months after the commencement),
the consultants should summarize their findings on these
matters in an interim report. At this stage, feasible
alternative solutions should be listed (element (f) of
study.)
(iv)   Draft Final Report
On completion of the study, the consultants should
prepare their draft final report. Recommendations should
be summarized separately. This draft report should be
published within 27 months of the commencement of the
study.
(v)  Final Report
Yugoslav decision-makers will be given a period of
approximately 60 days to provide their formal comments on
the draft final report. Thereafter, the consultants will
consider these comments and prepare the final report, which
is to be completed within 30 months of the commencement of
the study.
For the inception, progress and interim reports, the
consultants should provide fifteen copies in Serbian and
five in English. Twenty copies of the draft final report



ANNEX 7
Page 8
should be prepared in Serbian and five in English. The
final report should be prepared in sufficient number for
widespread distribution throughout the Morava basin so
that the recommended solutions can be well understood by
relevant decision-makers. Approximately 150 copies of
the final report should be prepared in Serbian and
approximately 20 in English.
(d) Coordination
At the same time as this study on adjustments to flood hazards
is proceeding, the Republic Water Fund will also be managing a study
of possible measures to reduce water pollution in that part of the
Zapadna Morava River basin which is upstream of Kraljevo. The
Water Fund will be responsible for ensuring that these two studies
are coordinated in parallel, with copies of all reports being made
available to both study groups, and meetings between the groups
arranged as appropriate.
It is important that both study groups use the same data and
deal with compatible sections of the river basin in their analyses.
The possible use of multipurpose reservoirs for water quality
improvement and flood control will have to be considered in each
study and evaluated in economic terms.

MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
STUDY 2: WATER QUALITY IN THE ZAPADNA MORAVA REGION
OUTLINE
A.   BACKGROUND
In spite of various laws and regulations 1/ concerning water quality
control, pollution of the streams and rivers in the Morava River basin is in-
creasing. An outline of the relevant legislation is included in Attachment 1.
The Serbian Water Law of 1967 stated that wastewater treatment facilities
would have to be installed by 1975 at the latest (Article 103) in order to
preserve the quality of water in various parts of the river system (categor-
ized in the 1968 Edict) to prescribed standards (defined in the 1967 Edict).
In 1975, the Serbian Assembly adopted a revised Law on Water Manage-
ment. In accordance with the Yugoslav Constitution of 1974, self-managed com-
munities of interest are to be established for the management of water re-
soures. In addition to the Republican Water Community of Interest, similar
regional communities are to be established for three river basins, of which
the largest is the Morava basin (including the Pcinja and Dragovishtitsa
Rivers). Under this law the categorization of water courses is issued by the
Executive Council of the Serbian Assembly (Article 163) and communities of in-
terest are to take measures to protect water quality (Articles 164-183).
With increasing urbanization and industrialization throughout the
river basin, the quantities of water utilized and liquid wastes produced have
been increasing. The wastewater treatment facilities necessary to preserve
receiving water standards have generally not been installed. In consequence
the water quality continues to deteriorate, to the detriment of all water
users.
The Serbian Government is determined to arrest the deterioration in
water quality and to improve the management of this vital resource. It is
recognized, however, that water quality control is an extremely complicated
process, involving sophisticated technology, economic analysis and institu-
tional arrangements. To assist in preparing an action program throughout
Serbia, the Government proposes to study the practical difficulties of water
quality management in the Morava River basin.
1/   As used in this note, regulation means orders (edicts) issued under
the Water Law.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
Because of the manpower time and costs involved in a detailed study
of water quality for a complete river basin the size of the Morava, a pilot
project only is recommended.
For this study, the Zapadna Morava River basin, upstream from the
town of Kraljevo where the Ibar River joins the Western Morava 1/, has been
chosen for a number of reasons:
(a) Significant sections of the river system are known to be in-
creasingly polluted from a variety of industrial sources (some
50 plants) as well as from domestic wastes and runoff from
agricultural land.
(b) More data are available concerning the physical system of the
Western Morava basin than in other parts of the Morava watershed.
Modelling of this watershed is already proceeding under a UNDP
project 2/.
(c) The town of Cacak, in the downstream section of this reach of the
river, relies on the Zapadna Morava as the basic source of water
for urban water supply system, using wells very close to the
river, in an aquifer directly recharged by river water. Accord-
ingly, there is considerable concern to improve the quality of
water in the river as soon as possible.
(d) Comprehensive wastewater systems are to be built for the towns
of Titovo Uzice and Cacak. Monitoring of the ambient water
quality in the river will assist in determining the appropriate
degree of treatment to be provided by wastewater treatment
facilities of each town.
B.   STUDY OBJECTIVE
To develop an action program, with cost estimates, to improve the
quality of the water in the Zapadna Morava basin to the legal standards de-
signated for the river and its tributaries.
Detailed Objectives
(a) To determine by surveys and analyses the existing quality of river
water at representative sampling stations, in order to provide a
benchmark against which to measure progress toward the goal.
1/   The catchment area of this part of the river system covers some 4,700 km



ANNEX 8
Page 3
(b) To consider alternative technical solutions and associated costs
to reduce existing pollution, in accordance with the water qual-
ity laws and regulations in existence, through the reduction
of waste discharges, by means of in-plant process changes
and/or waste treatment systems.
(c) To determine and implement economically sound proposals for
achieving a substantial improvement in water quality through an
initial reduction in pollutant discharge from major point
source polluters.
(d) To recommend programs, as well as regulations to ensure that
all new developments incorporate pollution control measures in
their plans.
(e) As a final stage in the study, to make recommendations aimed at
improving the institutional aspects of water quality management
throughout the entire Morava basin, including perhaps improve-
ment in existing laws and regulations.
C.   SCOPE OF WORK
I.   Surveys
There will be two concurrent surveys, one to investigate the sources
of pollution, the other to determine the present status of the receiving
waters.
(a) Survey of Ambient Water Quality in Streams
1.   Establish best locations of sampling stations to give a balanced
picture of water quality conditions in the main river and its
tributaries upstream of the town of Kraljevo. The sampling sta-
tions should be selected in the light of existing water quality
classifications of the river. (New sampling points will supple-
ment the regular stations of the Hydrometeorological Service of
Serbia). Before such surveys are planned, all existing studies
and data must be thoroughly reviewed and evaluated.
2.   Institute a systematic sampling and analysis program to extend
throughout one full year to derive information during all seasons
and at low, high and intermediate flows of the river and streams.
A draft outline 1/ of the water quality parameters to be analyzed
is provided in Attachment 2. A provisional assessment of the
consequences of pollution on biota in the river system should
also be undertaken.
1/   Consultants making proposals to undertake this study should be requested
to specify which parameters they think should be measured.



ANNEX 8
Page 4
(b) Survey of Pollution Sources
1.   Locate and identify all significant point and non-point sources
of pollution in the sub-basin: domestic, industrial, commercial,
agricultural, etc.
2.   Prepare and carry out a sampling program to provide appropriate
information on the quality and quantity of important point source
polluters. This effluent sampling and analysis program should
be completed within the first six months of the study. Estimates
should also be made of the nature and magnitude of non-point
sources of pollution, based on appropriate analyses.
3.   Survey all existing wastewater treatment plants to determine the
type of treatment, effectiveness, level of management of the
plants, and the volume and content of the effluents from the
plants after treatment. Determine the fluctuations in effluent
constitution and loading over time. Also the frequency of fail-
ure of the treatment plants or systems.
II. Action Program for Pollution Abatement
(a) For each main river section in the basin, the present water quality,
as determined by surveys, should be compared to the legal water
quality standards prescribed in existing regulations. Differences
between the actual and specified water qualities should be assessed
and a determination of the causes for these variations made in the
light of the information provided by the pollution source survey.
(b) Where river water quality is unacceptable because of existing
pollution, alternative technical solutions to reduce the waste
discharges from each significant point-source polluter should be
studied. Industrial process changes should be considered as well
as alternative "end of the pipe" waste treatment facilities, for
a range of pollutant reductions. The possibility of regional
plants to treat waste from a number of major polluters should be
investigated. Estimates of capital and operating costs should be
prepared for each alternative technical solution, including any
benefits from reclamation of materials in industrial wastes.
(c) The water quality analyses and study of major point sources of
pollution are likely to indicate that significant improvements in
water quality can be made if the largest polluters reduce their
pollutant discharges significantly. It is also expected that the
greatest part of the pollutants from each source can be removed
fairly economically, but that incremental levels of removal be-
come increasingly expensive. Accordingly, the initial step in
improving river water quality should be to require the larger
polluters to reduce their waste discharges considerably. The



ANNEX 8
Page 5
initial reduction to be achieved in pollution loadings from each
major source should be proposed on the basis of the incremental
cost information gained from the above analyses. The actual per-
centage of this initial reduction of pollutant discharge may vary
from source to source depending on the relative costs of pollution
abatement at each source.
(d) Where non-point sources of pollution are significant a program to
reduce such pollution should be recommended.
(e) Alternative pollution abatement programs for the Zapadna Morava
basin should be recommended on the basis of steps (a) to (d) above.
Then a compliance schedule should be negotiated with each major
point source polluter in accordance with existing regulations to
achieve the initial reduction of loadings specified by this study.
The compliance schedule should have a specific timetable and should
be agreed by each major polluter in a legally binding document.
(f) The consequences on water quality of implementing this initial
stage in the pollution abatement program should be estimated,
including the rate at which the water quality is expected to
improve.
(g) To ensure that all new developments (industries, commercial en-
terprises, agricultural operations, residential developments,
etc.) in the basin do not cause a deterioration in water quality,
appropriate pollution abatement programs (including any necessary
regulations) should be defined and implemented.   Standards for
future waste treatment plants should be specified.
(h) Prepare cost estimates (capital costs and recurring costs) for
the recommended initial stage in the pollution abatement program.
Prepare the financing plan required for the implementation of
the program.
(i)  Recommend a monitoring and surveillance system to ensure com-
pliance with the pollution abatement program. Ambient water
quality should be surveyed in streams approximately every six
months, in accordance with the surveys undertaken in the
first six months of this study. Effluents from major polluters
should be analyzed each time the river quality is surveyed, as
well as more frequently to check compliance with the pollution
abatement program.
III. Institutional and Management Aspects
(a) It is likely that the implementation of the action program will
be inhibited by institutional problems. Furthermore, the con-
tinuing efforts to achieve satisfactory levels of water quality



ANNEX 8
Page 6
in the river basin will require constant attention. Accordingly a
comprehensive analysis should be provided of the existing legal
and institutional arrangements concerning water quality management
in the Zapadna Morava basin. If water quality levels differ from
those prescribed by Serbian laws and regulations the reasons for
these discrepancies should be analyzed and described.
(b) Various methods to improve the management of the river water
quality should be considered. The study should assess and provide
recommendations on alternatives including:
(i) Rigid enforcement of existing laws including application of
penalties for non-compliance.   Alternatively, more strin-
gent penalties may be required;
(ii) At present the Serbian Water Fund receives a fee for each
cubic meter of wastewater discharged into the river system.
This fee system could be transformed into an effluent charge
system and this possibility should be assessed.  In such a
system each polluter is charged for the wastewater discharged
into the river on the basis of the pollution loadings entering
the river. Each polluter can then choose the least cost solution
from his point of view: either increasingly expensive treatment
facilities can be added by the polluter or he can choose to pay
the effluent disposal charge. These charges may be increased
over time to direct polluters to reduce effluent discharges to
desirable levels from the point of view of river water quality.
(iii) The provision of financial assistance by the Serbian Water
Fund or the Morava Region Water Community of Interest for the
construction of wastewater treatment facilities should be
studied. Loans made at appropriate interest rates may be
helpful in achieving the desirable water quality standards.
The proceeds of the effluent charge system can be a useful
source of funds for the construction of treatment facilties.
(c) This pilot study deals only with the Zapadna Morava basin but the
Government wishes to improve water quality management throughout the
entire Morava basin and all of Serbia. The report should include a
series of specific recommendations for a comprehensive action program,
based on the experiences gained in this pilot study, for improved
water quality management throughout Serbia. Each recommended action
should be directed to an existing or proposed agency (or agencies)
in Serbia.



ANNEX 8
Page 7
(d) Based on the experience gained during the study, the report should
evaluate existing water quality laws and regulations from many
points of view including the following:
(i) How suitable are the existing water quality laws and regula-
tions in relation to the various sectoral water uses (agriculture
fisheries, forestry, wildlife, industry, domestic commercial,
recreation tourism, mining, energy, navigation, etc.?) Are the
prescribed levels of water quality satisfactory?
(ii) What changes in the existing laws and regulations might be
appropriate and how should such changes be determined? Is
implementation of the initial stage program for pollution
abatement recommended in the study likely to be successful in
improving river quality to acceptable levels in the Western
Morava? If not what additional steps, including effluent dis-
charge fees, should be taken?
(iii) Are further studies needed prior to the implementation of a
satisfactory pollution control program in the Zapadna Morava
River?
D.   MANAGEMENT OF STUDY
(a) Responsibility
The Serbian Water Fund will be responsible for carrying out the
study. Consultants will be engaged to complete the study under the
control of the Water Fund.
(b) Timing
The study is expected to be completed within 18 months of its
commencement.
(c) Reports
The following reports are to be provided by the consultants:
(i) Inception Report
Within 30 days of commencement of the study, the con-
sultants should indicate in detail their proposed program
and staffing to carry out all phases of the study. Details
should be provided of planned surveys of pollution sources
and ambient water quality in streams.



ANNEX 8
Page 8
(ii) Quarterly Progress Reports
Every three months the consultants should prepare a
brief report covering
-    activities during the past three months and comparison
of performance with planned program;
-    planned activities during remaining period of study in
particular activities during next three months;
-    outline of any problems or changed circumstances likely
to affect results of study;
-    any recommended revisions to study work program.
(iii) Draft Final Report
The draft final report should be prepared within 16 months of
the study commencement. One volume should summarize the re-
sults of the study and all recommendations.
All water quality and effluent analysis carried out during
the study should be summarized for presentation in the report,
probably in supplementary volumes.
(iv) Final Report
Yugoslav decision makers will be given a period of approxi-
mately 40 days to provide their formal comments on the draft
report. Thereafter the consultants will consider these comments
and prepare their final report, which is to be completed within
18 months of the commencement of the study.
Fifteen copies of the inception and progress reports should be
provided in Serbian and five in English. Approximately 50 copies
of the final report should be provided in Serbian and approxi-
mately 10 in English.
(d) Coordination
At the same time as this study on water quality is proceeding,
the Republic Water Fund will also be managing a study of adjustments
to the flood hazards throughout the entire Morava River basin.
The Water Fund will be responsible for ensuring that these two
studies are coordinated in parallel, with copies of all reports being
made available to both study groups, and meetings between the
groups arranged as appropriate.



ANNEX 8
Page 9
It is important that both study groups use the same data and
deal with compatible sections of the river basin in their analyses.
The possible use of multipurpose reservoirs for flood control
and water quality improvement will have to be considered in each
study and evaluated in economic terms.

STUDY 3: REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Outline
A.   BACKGROUND
For planning purposes, Serbia proper (excluding Kosovo and Vojvodina)
has been divided into 16 regions outside of Belgrade, each of which comprises
a collection of contiguous communes. Economic standards vary considerably be-
tween regions and the Government of Serbia intends to assist those regions which
are less developed. In 1970, the Serbian Fund for Underdeveloped Regions (SFUR)
was created to provide loan capital at low interest rates to industries that
locate or expand in regions designated as underdeveloped. Further information
on SFUR is provided in Annex 20.
The 1975 population of Serbia proper is approximately 5.4 million,
of which 1.3 million are in Belgrade, with the remaining 4.1 million in the 16
regions. The Morava River basin (Map 11603) drains 55% of the land area of
Serbia proper, an area containing a 1975 population of approximately 3.1 mil-
lion. The most underdeveloped regions in Serbia are in the Morava River Basin.
SFUR wishes to improve its efforts at accelerating economic develop-
ment in the underdeveloped regions and accordingly intends to have pilot studies
undertaken in three contiguous regions in southern Serbia which are among the
least developed in the Republic. The Prokupulje, Leskovac and Vranje regions
(see Map 11603) are in the mountainous headwaters of the Juzna Morava River as
well as the Pcinja River (which flows south into Macedonia) and the Dragvoshtitsa
River (which flows east into Bulgaria). The three regions cover 16% of the area
of Serbia proper and contain 12% of the population. Statistical information
concerning the three regions is as follows:

B.   STUDY OBJECTIVES
The purpose of the study is to determine programs and projects to
stimulate economic development so that SFUR will be able to make better deci-
sions in its allocation of resources in underdeveloped regions. The study will
be undertaken by three teams, one in each region, in order that an in-depth
understanding of the situation in each will be obtained. Attention will be paid
to the interrelationships among the three regions and between them and the
economies of Serbia and Yugoslavia as a whole.
The detailed objectives of the study in each region are as follows:
(1) To identify, define and analyze the constraints on social and
economic development.
(2) To identify and describe the opportunities for social and eco-
nomic development.
(3) To identify and describe specific investment opportunities for
projects and programs.
(4) To correlate potential economic development in each region with
neighboring regions and with the national economy.
(5) To make recommendations for new policies, programs and projects
in all sectors of the economy in the regions.
(6) To determine the degree to which development is limited by water-
related problems.

D.   MANAGEMENT OF STUDY,
The study will be managed by SFUR, with technical assistance from the
Serbian Institute for Social Planning. A full time project manager with an
assistant will be required, either from the Institute or employed especially
for the study. A single group of consultants will undertake the study by
placing a small professional team in each region who will work under the
overall guidance of the project manager.



ANNEX 9
Page 6
Although the majority of the study will depend on existing statistics
and on data available locally from communal and industrial sources, some field
work will be necessary, especially in the rural areas. Hence, the necessity
to have the teams carry out their work in the regional centers to minimize the
time and cost of travel. Working in the region also enhances the understanding
of the internal social and economic forces that characterize the region.
The accompanying chart (Appendix 1) shows the work stages involved in
carrying out the study.
For the first group of study topics in the project outline (Scope of
Work, items I, II, III, IV, V and VI) it will be necessary to carry out the work
in three stages:
Stage 1   Gather all the existing information relevant to these topics
and assess the completeness and reliability of the data;
Stage 2   Decide on a minimum program of surveys and investigations to
fill such gaps as can be satisfied within a short term. (No
major studies should be attempted under this project. If lack
of information is a serious restriction for any particular
sector or situation it should be dealt with as one of the
requirements for future attention and thus will become a
recommendation in the final report.) Carry out the program
of collecting the essential new information to complete the
available data for the analysis of the economy of the region;
Stage 3   Carry out the appropriate economic, social and geographic
analyses of each sector of the economy, of land usage, of
social and economic infrastructure, of the characteristics
and life of the people, and their attitudes and aspirations.
Note that the beginning of stage 3 does not have to await completion
of all of the data gathering. Sector studies can get under way as soon as
enough data is at hand. Of course, the act of assessing existing data and
collecting new information is an intimate part of the whole process. The sep-
arations described herein and shown on the diagram are for purposes of clarify-
ing the elements of the study; the whole study process is a continuum.
The study outline may give the impression of considerable overlap,
for example between IV A.(1) and VI (a). However, the approach is quite dif-
ferent even though much of the data used will be common. In IV A(1), the ap-
proach is to the economics of the agriculture sector, production and marketing,
inputs and outputs, prices, transportation, imports and exports, agribusiness,
etc. In VI (a), the approach is to the social and economic aspects of the
farm as a production and business entity and the intimate relationship between
the farm itself and the family that operates it. This approach deals with many
of the same parameters as in the agriculture sector study but from the point of
view of the farm instead of the region or commune. Special attention will be



ANNEX 9
Page 7
given to the urban/industrial situation. The role of the main urban center
(Vranje, Lescovac, Prokuplje) in each region, the hierarchy of urban centers,
and the relationship of these centers with the large regional center of Nis
will be assessed.
Stage four encompasses the work outlined in part VII of the outline
and is a crucial part of the study. Here the study teams must come to grips
with the underlying causes of the low incomes, slow growth and other symptoms
of economic and social distress. The question that must be answered is, why
have these regions, or certain communes in them, not progressed as rapidly
or as far as other parts of Serbia and Yugoslavia? Some of the answers are
to be found in such consideration as: weak institutional arrangements, lack
of investment capital, paucity of skilled labor or entrepreneurial ability,
lack of raw materials, inadequate supplies of water of the right quantity
and quality, high transportation costs, lack of suitable land, etc.
A significant number of valuable conclusions and recommendations
should stem from the work at this stage, many of which should be susceptible
to early action particularly by government because many constraints on de-
velopment tend to be found in a lack of adequate infrastructure.
Stage five (part VIII of the outline) is closely linked with the
work of stage four because projections and forecasts must, of course, be
based on the present situation and the past trends that have led to it.
Firstly, it is essential to make simple ten-year projections of past
trends to understand where the economy would go if no overt interventions
took place, and to show the implications of that course of events in the
future. Secondly, a number of forecasts, or a range of forecasts, for a
longer period are required based on identified new opportunities for develop-
ment and the removal of some or all of the problems that have been hampering
development in the recent past. Because not all constraints will disappear,
nor all opportunities be realized, overly optimistic forecasts are unwarranted
although it is useful to give a rough estimate of the maximum rate of devel-
opment that would be possible if that were the case. An interim report is
required after stage five has been completed.
Finally (part ix), it is necessary to draw rational conclusions from
the study which in turn lead to a series of recommendations; the most important
task in the study. A study of this type should generate not less than fifty
recommendations for each region although there may well be more than one hundred.
Some will be common to all three regions, others will be unique to one.
Progress reports wil be prepared after each of the first three stages.
As well as recording the progress of the work in relation to the schedule these
reports should also contain a summary of the findings to date. After stages
four and five, which should be completed at about the same time, an interim



ANNEX 9
Page 8
report on the main conclusions and recommendations will be prepared so that
implementation of priority projects can begin. Reporting on any major diffi-
culties in the performance of the work should not await the issuance of the
regular reports, but be dealt with at the time the difficulty is encountered
in order to avoid delay to the study as a whole.
The final report should consist of two parts:
Part One - description of the region, its geographic, social
and economic aspects, and the findings of all phases
of the study. The documentation must be complete
because (the report will become a basic reference work
for many years to come. The data and analyses can be
contained in appendix volumes as required.
Part Two - arguments leading to the conclusions, the conclusions
themselves, and the recommendations for action which
are derived from them. The recommendations will cover
all of the matters mentioned in Section IX of the study
outline and others that will become evident during the
course of the study.
In many cases the conclusions and recommendations will include alter-
native solutions or proposals and the consequences of following each possible al-
ternative, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of them, should be care-
fully explained.
Wherever clear courses of action are indicated, implementation pro-
cedures, along with estimates of time and cost should be proposed. Distinctions
should be drawn between specific action projects, long term programs, and the
need for more studies and investigations. In the last case, only those further
studies that will lead to action projects should be stressed.
A Word of Warning
At the conclusion of the regional economic development study, those
concerned may well be carried away by enthusiasm in making predictions and
recommendations. It is well to remember that all of the constraints will not
be removed, nor all of the opportunities realized. Furthermore, Yugoslavia
and the Republic of Serbia will undergo a certain rate of overall growth.
It would be unrealistic and unwise to attribute a disproportionate share of
that growth to the regions under study. The best that can be hoped for, as
a result of the study effort, is for a moderate increase in the proportion
of investment and growth in these regions in the coming years, if it is the
wish of the government to make special efforts to effect such an increase
in the share of the overall growth.
In other words it will require overt action on the part of the gov-
ernment to cause additional investment to be made in the less developed re-
gions, particularly in those sectors of the economy in which direct financial
rewards will not accrue to the investors.

APPRAISAL OF
MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
TITOVO UZICE - PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.        The project component to serve Titovo Uzice consists of three dis-
tinct facilities - the Vrutci dam and reservoir, and the water supply and
wastewater systems for the town. Each is described subsequently.
Vrutci Dam and Reservoir
2.        The Vrutci damsite is on the Djetinja River, 12 km upstream and to
the west of Titovo Uzice, as shown on Map 11639. A double curvature concrete
arch dam has been designed by experienced Yugoslav consultants (Jaroslav Cerni
Institute) after extensive investigations to determine the best site. An ex-
tensive grout curtain is proposed in the limestone foundation.
3.        Technical features of the dam are as follows:
Height above river bed                        -    70 m
Volume of dam (including foundation trench) - 50,000 m3
Length of crest                               - 240 m
Width of crest (at center)                    - 3 m
Elevation of crest                            - 630 m (above sea level)
Spillway design flood                         - 450 m3/sec
Return period of spillway design flood        - 10,000 years
Type of spillway                              - Ungated overflow (in
middle of dam crest)
Spillway crest length                         - 50.4 m
Spillway crest elevation                      - 627 m (above sea level)
Spillway capacity                             - 450 m3/sec (for reser-
voir level of 629.75 m)



ANNEX 10
Page 2
Bottom outlet arrangements                  - Two sets of two Howell
Bunger valves (1,200 mm
diameter each) at ele-
vations 575 m and 590 m.
Total capacity 102m3/sec.
Raw water intakes                           - 600 mm diameter valves
at four locations on up-
stream side of dam (eleva-
tions 590, 599, 608 and
616).
4.        The reservoir to be created by the Vrutci dam will flood a land area
of some 235 ha and require the relocation of 26 households.
5.        The reservoir's use will be governed by the following hydrologic para-
meters and dam features:
Catchment area                               - 160 km2
Average annual inflow                        - 1.87 m3/sec or 58.9 mil-
lion m3/year
Normal top water level                       - 627 m (above sea level)
Minimum water level                          - 590 m (above sea level)
Total live storage                           - 47.5 million m3
Total storage (including dead storage)       - 53.0 million m3
The hydrologic analysis for the reservoir is based on eleven rain-gauging sta-
tions in the catchment, some of which provide data from 1926 (except for the
period 1939-1946). Inflows at the damsite have been estimated on the basis of
data from these precipitation stations within the catchment, correlated to a
stream gauging station at Gorobilje, some 20 km downstream of Titovo Uzicije.
River flows have been recorded at this gauging station, whose catchment is
500 km2, since 1922. A stream gauging station was installed some 4 km down-
stream of the Vrutci damsite to improve the hydrologic analysis during the
final stages of project planning.
6.        Two sets of bottom outlet valves will release water for downstream
users of raw water and for flow augmentations as well as to evacuate the
reservoir if appropriate to provide storage for anticipated flood inflows.
Water for the town of Titovo Uzice will be drawn from the reservoir through
an intake with openings at four different levels (the draw-off level being
chosen to provide the best quality water, depending on reservoir water levels
and water temperature).



ANNEX 10
Page 3
7.        The reservoir is intended to be operated to serve multiple objectives:
water supply for the treated water system in town; flow regulation for the in-
dustrial water system at Sevojno, which will pump water directly from the
river; low flow augmentation to improve water quality; flood control; and pre-
vention of sedimentation of downstream reservoirs. Although realistic operat-
ing rules required for the optimum allocation of reservoir storage to meet
these objectives have not yet been prepared, the consultants have tentatively
proposed that the reservoir storage will be allocated as follows:
(million m3)    (M)
1.   Potable water supply for Titovo
Uzice and Sevojno                                 18.2          34
2.   Industrial raw water supply                        8.25         16
3.   Retention of 50 year flood                         12.8         24
4.   Retention of silt                                  5.5          10
5.   Low flow augmentation                              8.25         16
(Guaranteed minimum flow:  350 l/s)
Total                        53.00        100
Such simplistic allocations cannot form the basis for determining cost alloc-
ations for the reservoir, which can only be made after a suitable set of-
operating rules is prepared.
8.        The reliable yield of the Vrutci reservoir is provisionally esti-
mated at 1,100 1/sec. (compared to the average reservoir inflow of 1,870
1/sec.). These releases would supply water both to the town's treated water
supply system and to the industry at Sevjno via the Djetinja River. Esti-
mates of the town's future requirements for treated water are provided in
Annex 28 and those of industry for untreated water are outlined in Annex 30.
It is likely that the Vrutci reservoir will be able to supply these combined
requirements until at least the year 2000, but further study will be needed
on this point.
9.        When additional supplies of water are required for Titovo Uzice,
they can be provided by augmenting the inflows to the Vrutci reservoir. This
can be accomplished by diverting flows from the Susica River, which presently
joins the Djetinja River some 4 km. downstream of the Vrutci site (Map 11639).
A diversion structure will be required on the Susica River some 4 km upstream
of the junction with the Djetinja. The diversion system will involve a tunnel
approximately 3 km. long. The catchment area of the Susica River at the di-
version site is approximately equal to that at the Vrutci site so the yield
of the Vrutci reservoir should be increased by approximately 100% on comple-
tion of this relatively inexpensive diversion.



ANNEX 10
Page 4
Water Supply System
10.       Water would flow from the Vrutci reservoir by gravity to the pro-
posed treatment plant at Cerovica, on the western edge of Titovo Uzice.
Treated water would flow from there to the lower levels of town by gravity
and to the higher levels through existing and proposed pumping facilities.
The water supply system is shown on Map 11637.
11.       A welded steel pipeline (660 mm diameter, 11.8 km long) with an es-
timated capacity of 800 liters/second would convey untreated water to the
treatment plant. Cathodic protection measures would be installed to prevent
corrosion. This pipeline would generally follow the abandoned alignment of
the narrow-gauge railway to Sarajevo which previously ran from Titovo Uzice
up the Djetinja River valley (the Vrutci dam axis is at the 25th tunnel from
the town).  This railway alignment would ultimately serve as the permanent
access road between the town and the damsite. In 1974, the commune of Titovo
Uzice arranged for a tunnel to be built (at a cost of Din 2.2 million) along
this abandoned railway alignment at the point where it is crossed by the new
Belgrade-Bar railway, in order to avoid the higher costs which would have
been required if the tunnel had not been constructed then.
12.       Some 2 km -tpstream of the town (see map 11637) is a 22 m high masonry
dam, Velika Brana, with a heavily silted reservoir whose capacity is estimated
at 400,000 m3 (too small to regulate flows effectively). Built many years ago
for the local production of hydro-electric energy, its power facilities were
abandoned by the electricity authorities in 1974. It would be technically
feasible to use the large Vrutci reservoir for flow regulation and to pump
water from the downstream Velika Brana reservoir to the treatment plant but
Bioktos decided instead to pipe the water from the upstream Vrutci reservoir
to the plant, for two reasons:
(a) gravity flow from Vrutci would eliminate the expenses of build-
ing and operating a pumping station; and
(b) water quality in the Vrutci reservoir is expected to be consid-
erably better than at Velika Brana.
13.       The construction of the Vrutci dam is not expected to be completed
before 1979. Bioktos expects to connect the Velika Brana reservoir to the
main pipeline from Vrutci, since such an inexpensive connection could be
useful in two possible ways:
(a) temporary source of additional water to the temporary infilra-
tion basins at Turica (Annex 5), pending completion of the
Vrutci scheme and treatment plant; and
(b) security, in the event that the pipeline between Vrutici and
Velika Brana is damaged in future. Water from Velika Brana
could supply Titovo Uzice in such a situation, either by
emergency pumping to the new treatment plant or by connec-
tion to the Turica infiltration basins (which in future are
likely to become only a standby source).

14.       The proposed treatment plant will be sited on the Cerovica hill, at
the approximate elevation of 500 m. A conventional surface water treatment
plant is proposed, comprising pre-chlorination, floculation, sedimentation,
rapid sand filtration and post-chlorination. In the first phase, the civil
works will be built for a capacity of 600 liters/second but equipment will
only be installed for a first stage plant capacity of 400 liters/second.
Eight filters in two groups will be equipped in the first stage.
15.       Treated water storage at the plant will consist of three compart-
ments of 1,300 m3 each, giving storage for 2.7 hours at the plant's first
stage capacity of 400 liters/second.
16.       An integral part of the Cerovica plant will be a pumping station
to lift water to the high level distribution zone. Two pumps will be in-
stalled, each with the following characteristics:
Power                           -  75 kw
Flow                             -  67 liters/second
Head                             -  72 m
17.       The high level distribution zone is the part of the town above ele-
vation 450 m. There is virtually no service in this area at present and in
future the consumption is expected to be relatively small.
18.       The medium level of the distribution system, between elevation 400 m
and 450 m, is the zone of highest consumption. Water would reach consumers in
this zone by gravity from the treatment plant.
19.       The low level distribution zone serves consumers below elevation
400 m, on the eastern side of Titovo uzice (Krcagovo) and at Sevojno.
20.       Additional reservoirs to be built in the project are as follows:

21.       In addition to the pumping facilities at the Cerovica plant, two
pumping stations are required to supply high level reservoirs as follows:
Capacity (l/s)  Head (m)
Zabucje /2                             6            63

22.       Transmission and distribution pipelines to be installed by Bioktos
in the period 1976-1979 are included in the project. The main transmission
line would run from the Cerovica treatment plant through Titovo Uzice and along
the Djetinja valley to the Sevojno reservoir, a total length of 10.5 km, as
follows:
Length (km)              8.9           1.1            0.5
Diameter (mm)            450           500            600
23.       The remaining pipelines expected to be installed during the project
period can be summarized as follows:

Wastewater System
24.       The objective of the proposed wastewater system is the construction
of a comprehensive network of separate sewers to lead all wastewater to a treat-
ment plant where the valley opens out east of Sevojno (downstream of the town)
(see map 11638). The site has been agreed but the design of the treatment plant
is not prepared so the construction of the plant is not expected to commence
until about 1979. The project includes the final design of the treatment plant
but does not include its construction.
25.       The principal element in the wastewater system is a collector sewer
which would follow the north shore of the Djetinja River. All sewers which
presently discharge directly to the river would be intercepted and the new net-
works would be designed to feed into this collector. Pending the construction
of the treatment plant, the collector would discharge into the river downstream
of the Sevojno plant industrial water intake.
26.       The project includes all sewers to be constructed by Bioktos in the
period 1976-1979, estimated as follows:
Diameter (m)      Length (km)
Main Collector:                     800/1,050           1.8

APPRAISAL OF
MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
CACAK - PROJECT DESCRIPTION
WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM
1.        The present water supply system and the proposed project facilities
are shown on Map 11640.
2.        The source facilities to be developed consist of a series of 16 wells
of 1 m diameter, 100 m apart, in the aquifer at Parmenac, on the left bank of
the Zapadna Morava River, about 2 km upstream of the existing source at Beljina.
The proposed wells would be located in a line parallel to and about 100 m from
the river, on the river side of an existing levee built to protect adjacent
farmlands from periodic flooding. The wells will be designed for protection
from flooding.
3.        Test drilling indicates that the alluvium depth varies from 3 m to
7 m and overlay impervious clays. The aquifer is very shallow, 2 to 3 m, and
highly dependent on the water level in the nearby river.
4.        Directly downstream of the wellfield is a weir across the river which
can be used to regulate flows into a downstream irrigation system. Water
levels in the river, and hence in the aquifer at the wellfield, are approxi-
mately 0.5 m higher when flows are regulated by the weir. The capacity of
the 16 wells is estimated to total about 200 liters/second, rising to perhaps
250 liters/second with flow regulation at the weir. This compares to average
river flows at the site of some 30 m3/second, and minimum recorded flow of
3.8 m3/second.
5.        The project will include detailed testing and analysis of the per-
formance and capacity of the wellfield, in terms of water quality as well as
quantity, as a part of an economic evaluation of alternative future sources
to meet Cacak's growing water requirements. Terms of reference for this study
are attached as Annex 15.
6.        A collector pipeline would convey water pumped from each well to
the existing Beljina site, crossing the Zapadna Morava River upstream of the
irrigation weir. The pipeline will supply a ground level balancing reservoir
with a capacity of 500 m3.
7.        A new pumping station will be constructed at Beljina with the follow-
ing characteristics:



ANNEX 11
Page 2
No. of pumps                      - 3
Capacity per pump                 - 200 liters/second
Head                              - 60 to 70 m
Power                             - 3 x 220 kw
8.        Water from the expanded Beljin pumping facilities would flow both
to storage facilities on the nearby hillside and directly into the distribu-
tion system of the town. Detailed designs for the transmission and distribu-
tion pipelines will be completed by the consultants during the project period.
An outline of the 43 km of pipelines which are expected to be built during the
project period 1976-1979 follows:
Diameter (mm)         100            150            200           500
Length (km)            24             16            1.4           2.3
9.        Two storage reservoirs are to be constructed, one near the existing
Beljina reservoir on the south side of Cacak (capacity 3,000 m3) and the other
on the north side of the town (capacity 2,000 m3).
10.       Pump operations in the new welifield will be controlled from the new
pumping station. The operation of the main pumps in turn depend on reservoir
levels. Accordingly, control system cables will be installed to link wells and
reservoirs to the pumping station.
WASTEWATER SYSTEM
11.       The project will strengthen and extend the network of sanitary sewers
already in existence. During the project period 1976-1979, the following sewers
are expected to be constructed:
Diameter (mm)                     Length (km)
200                              34.2
250                               2.2
300                               1.0
350                               1.2
400                               0.4
600                               1.0
800                               1.4
Total                    41.4
12.       The sewer system, as illustrated on Map 11641, presently terminates
in an outfall on the south shore of the Zapadna Morava River about 2 km east
(and downstream) of Cacak. It is proposed to construct a wastewater treatment



ANNEX 11
Page 3
plant near this point. However, the design of the treatment plant has not been
completed, so construction is unlikely to begin until about 1979. The project
includes the final design of the treatment plant but does not include its con-
struction.
13.       Major industrial polluters (pulp and paper mill, bottling factory
and future brewery) will have their wastes collected by an interceptor sewer
to be constructed along the south shore of the river. The final design of
the treatment plant will include studies to determine what pre-treatment will
be required before these industrial wastes can be treated at Vodovod's future
plant.
14.       Cacak is a relatively flat town so not all of the wastewater can
flow to the treatment plant site by gravity. The single wastewater pumping
station which already exists will have to be expanded and four additional
pumping stations will be built as part of the project. All will be rela-
tively small and will operate automatically.
STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM
15.       Heavy rains cause local flooding problems in certain areas where
storm drains have not yet been built. Two major drains, one on either side
of the river, are to be built to alleviate this problem, as illustrated on Map
11641. Each will discharge into the river. The storm drains to be built in
the project period 1976-1979 are estimated as follows:
Diameter (mm)               Length (km)
250                        0.2
300                        0.7
350                        0.6
400                        1.7
450                        0.4
500                        1.9
600                        2.1

CACAK VODOVOD
WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT STUDY
Objective
The study is intended to provide authorities in Cacak and Serbia with
information on which to make decisions concerning the development of future water
sources for Cacak.
Scope of Work
(a) To prepare realistic projections of future water demands and
associated production requirements in Cacak, including factors
for peak day and peak month.
(b) To determine the reliable present and future capacity of ground-
water sources at Beljina (existing) and Parmenac (under devel-
opment) and to assess the quality of water from both sources.
(c) To study alternative future systems to meet the estimated water
requirements of Cacak.
(d) To prepare an economic analysis of alternative future systems,
and to make preliminary recommendations concerning the next
source to be developed for Cacak, based on this economic
analysis.
Procedures
Vodovod should engage engineering consultants for this study, which
is to be completed by June 30, 1977.
(a) Water Demands
Estimates of future water demand will be based on a detailed
study of existing Vodovod consumers and on realistic projec-
tions of future industrial development in Cacak. Demands of
domestic, commercial and industrial consumers, and associated
peak factors, should be estimated separately. Particular at-
tention should be given to individual industries which are
potential large users of water.



ANNEX 15
Page 2
(b) Groundwater Source Capacity
The determination of the capacity of the groundwater sources,
particularly at Parmenac, will require considerable data to
be collected and analyzed. River flows and water levels at
the Parmenac weir should be recorded continuously.
Water levels, in all production wells and observation points
should be recorded daily. If original test holes were properly
covered and constructed with screened and slotted sections in
the gravel layer, they would be suitable as observation points.
Otherwise, about one dozen new observation wells, in two lines
of six wells spaced at about 100 meter intervals, should be in-
stalled. The first line should be about halfway between the
production wells and the river; the second line approximately
parallel and near to the edge of the river.
Water quantities pumped from each well should be recorded daily.
A master meter should be installed to record continuously the
total discharge from all wells.
Rainfall and temperature should be recorded at a site within
the wellfield to determine whether or not rainfall affects well
performance and to provide data concerning the possibility of
groundwater recharge (spreading basins).
Water quality should be analyzed weekly, both in the river and
in representative wells (including observation wells), to deter-
mine the degree and effectiveness of treatment from the natural
filtration process in the aquifer. Chemical water quality para-
meters of significance should be identified early in the program
and given special attention.
Consideration needs to be given to possible ways to increase the
Parmenac wellfield capacity after the initial wells are con-
structed. Additional wells is one possibility. Groundwater re-
charge is another (as at the Beljina source).
An alternative worth considering is to increase the production
at each well by some system of infiltration galleries, such as
gravel-filled ditches or porous pipes in the saturated aquifer,
which would drain into the production well.
In order to analyze such an alternative thoroughly it will be
necessary to test the system. Therefore, Vodovod should con-
sider the installation of one or more systems to increase well
yields in the original construction of the well field. Each
experimental well should have an individual meter to determine
its output accurately.



ANNEX 15
Page 3
(c)  Study of Alternative Future Sources
The technical feasibility of alternative future sources needs
to be studied and estimates of capital and operating costs
prepared. Different sources require different systems of pump-
ing, treatment and transmission facilities, so the entire sys-
tem expansion needs to be studied for each feasible source al-
ternative. The sources to be studied should include, but not
be limited to, the following:
(i) additional development of the Parmenac source through
more wells and/or groundwater recharge;
(ii) treatment of water pumped directly from the Zapadna
Morava River upstream from Cacak;
(iii) development of new groundwater sources to serve Cacak;
(iv) Semedraz dam.
(d)  Economic Analysis of Alternatives
In considering any possible future source which can provide
benefits in addition to those for urban water suppply (such as a
reservoir with flood retention or low flow augmentation capacity),
all additional costs and benefits should be realistically esti-
mated. Such multipurpose aspects of the water supply facility
should be properly considered in the economic analysis of alter-
natives.
For each alternative future system, estimated incremental
capital and operating costs should be totalled for each year.
The present value of all future costs for each alternative should
be determined for various discount rates (8%, 10% and 12%). The
most economic alternative is the one providing the lowest present
value of all future incremental costs at the appropriate discount
rate.

MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
BIOKTOS - TITOVO UZICE COMMUNAL ENTERPRISE
Organization and Administration
A. BACKGROUND
!.        Bioktos - Titovo Uzice Communal Enterprise will be a significant
beneficiary from the project. Bioktos is an Organization of Associated Labour
controlled by its workers who direct the enterprise through a Workers Council.
At present, Bioktos is not divided into separate Basic Organizations of Asso-
ciated Labour, although this may possibly occur as its activities expand.
Bioktos is not entirely autonomous because the Commune (inter alia):
(a) approves Bioktos Self-Management Agreements and any changes
therein;
(b) approves all changes in tariffs;
(c) may order Bioktos to carry out appropriate public works
at the expense of the Commune;
(d) acts as co-ordinator of various local enterprises, including
Bioktos, for the general economic and social well-being of
the area; and
(e) establishes and supervises various communal funds for the
construction of public works, including water supply and/or
wastewater systems.
B. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
2.        Bioktos is responsible for water supply and wastewater facilities
throughout the commune. At present, such networks only exist within the
towns of Titovo Uzice and Sevojno.
3.        In addition to the water and wastewater service, Bioktos operates
the town's street cleaning and refuse collection service (including septic
tanks emptying), storm drainage, a municipal market for small farmers and
a parks service incorporating a flower shop and funeral services. Each of
these services is supported either by its own revenues or by constributions
from the Commune.



ANNEX 18
Page 2
4.        There are also two service departments, one for technical and
engineering services and the oher for finance and administrative services.
These departments provide common services for the operating departments of
Bioktos, and the technical and engineering departments may also do work, for
a fee, for outside parties.
5.        Bioktos organization chart is shown as part of this Annex.  There
are currently about 180 employees of Bioktos of which about 40 are directly
employed in the water and wastewater department. A further 10 staff are
employed in the technical and engineering department and 26 in the finance and
administration department; both departments providing common services to
Bioktos. The remaining staff are directly employed on the municipal services
(street cleaning, refuse collection, markets, parks, etc.). The major propor-
tion of the work of the technical and engineering department is devoted
to the water and wastewater system. Network extensions are carried out by
contract, with Bioktos staff providing only supervision.
6.        Bioktos is capably managed by a managing director reporting to a
workers' council. There seems to be good co-operation with the communal
authorities. Technical and financial planning seem good. There is some
degree of overlapping of functions between operating and service departments
and Bioktos is considering certain reorganizations to improve the situation.
A likely possibility is that a large part of the technical and engineering
department will transfer to the water and wastewater department.
C. ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT
7.        Financial records are kept according to the standard prescribed by
the Social Accounting Service. The accounting system of Bioktos enables it to
routinely allocate costs among its various operations and also to appropriately
allocate the overheads attributable to the two service departments. According-
ly, the enterprise can present separate income statements and fixed asset
records for water, wastewater and other services and can produce complete
financial statements along lines familiar to the Bank. Water meters are read
and billings made monthly. Since January 1975, water consumption has been
used as the basis for wastewater charges. Prior to that date there were no
separate charges for wastewater.
8.        As with all Yugoslav enterprises, annual inspection is carried
out by the Social Accounting Service. In co-operation with the Bank, and with
the assistance of foreign consultants, the Social Accounting Service is in the
process of establishing and expanding a special group which will eventually
audit all enterprises handling Bank projects to a standard acceptable to the
Bank. It will be several years before the Social Accounting Service will have
the staff to perform all such audits, but as soon as practicable it is expected
that the accounts of Bioktos will be subject to these arrangements.

MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
VODOVOD CACAK - WATER AND WASTEWATER ENTERPRISE
Organization and Administration
A. BACKGROUND
1.        Vodovod - Cacak Water and Wastewater Enterprise will be a significant
beneficiary from the project. As with other enterprises in Yugoslavia, Vodovod
is an Organization of Associated Labour controlled by its workers, who direct
the enterprise through its Workers' Council. At present Vodovod is not di-
vided into separate Basic Organizations of Associated Labour, although this may
possibly occur as its activities expand. Vodovod is not entirely autonomous,
because the Commune of Cacak (inter alia):
(a) approves Vodovod's Self-Management Agreement and any changes
therein;
(b) approves all changes in Vodovod's tariffs;
(c) may order Vodovod to carry out appropriate public works at the
expense of the Commune;
(d)  acts as co-ordinator of various local enterprises, including
Vodovod, for the general economic and social well-being of
the area; and
(e) establishes and supervises various communal funds for the con-
struction of public works, including water supply and/or waste-
water systems.
B. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
2.        Vodovod is responsible for the water supply and wastewater facili-
ties throughout the Commune, which at present exist only within the town.
Vodovod provides a service to empty clogged cesspits, and operates one tanker
for this purpose.



ANNEX 19
Page 2
3.        The Commune has decided that Vodovod will take over the operation
of the town's stormwater system, at present operated by another communal
enterprise. When the system is taken over by Vodovod it will continue, as now,
to be financed by communal taxes and not from water and wastewater charges.
Separate accounts will be kept.  The inclusion of the stormwater system in the
proposed project is based on the assumption that, Vodovod will have taken over
responsibility for this service, before June 30, 1976.
4.        Vodovod's organization chart is shown as part of this Annex.  Staff
currently number just over 100, about half of which are directly concerned
with the maintenance and construction of networks. Network construction is
currently carried out largely by Vodovod's own workforce.
5.        Vodovod is controlled by a managing director reporting to the
workers' council. Overall management capability does not give an impression
of being very dynamic and most decisions of any importance are taken by the
Commune, rather than by Vodovod itself. Medium to long-term planning seems
weak in both technical and financial matters. However, working with its
consultants (Energoproject), Vodovod has demonstrated some inovative ability
in meeting problems of immediate water demand and it has a significant ongoing
network construction program, which it intends to continue.
6.        Consideration has been given to a re-organization of Vodovod, with
the intention of closer association with the Water Management Organization of
Cacak, an affiliate of the Morava River Corporation. Outline proposals have
been discussed with Bank staff, but will require further review and analysis
before any firm arrangements are made.
7.        Financial management has been confined to basic book-keeping, with
little or no emphasis on forward planning, except for securing cash for the
immediate program of network construction. This construction has, in the
past, been financed in shares of approximately one-third each by the citizens
being connected; the commune and Vodovod itself. The accounting for these
connections is based entirely on estimates, with no apparent ex-post calcula-
tions for comparison. Thus, once charges are billed to consumers and to the
Commune there is no further control to check how the charges relate to costs.
Furthermore, the estimated costs and revenues (including Vodovod's share) have
been included in the income statements, causing distortions in the calculations
of net income. (These have been corrected in the financial statements shown
in Annex 25).
8.        The head of the finance and administration department is apparently
very ill and has not been working for several months. This naturally leaves
the department without proper leadership, a matter which will require atten-
tion if improvements are to be made.



ANNEX 19
Page 3
C. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS
9.        Financial records are kept according to the standard prescribed by
the Social Accounting Service. There are no detailed allocations between the
water and wastewater services. However, financial information derived from
the accounting system is adequate, with certain adjustments, to produce finan-
cial statements along lines familiar to the Bank. Less adequate is statis-
tical information related to water sales, numbers of connections etc., where
considerable inconsistencies exist between the accounting records and the in-
formation provided by the technical staff. This makes technical and finan-
cial planning difficult. Furthermore, some improvements should be possible
in the cost-accounting system, to deal more adequately with problems such as
that related to network extensions referred to in paragraph 3 above.
10.       Billings are monthly, based on bi-monthly meter readings and the
post office assists as a collection agency for the payment of bills. Waste-
water charges are based on metered water consumption, including metering of
private water supplies for which Vodovod makes no water charge, but where the
premises are connected to the wastewater system.
11.       As with all Yugoslav enterprises, annual inspection is carried out
by the Social Accounting Service.  In co-operation with the Bank, and with
the assistance of foreign consultants, the Social Accounting Service is in
the process of establishing and expanding a special unit which will eventual-
ly audit all enterprises handling Bank projects to a standard acceptable to
the Bank. It will be several years before the Social Accounting Service will
have the staff to perform all such audits, but as soon as practicable, it is
expected that the accounts of Vodovod will be subject to these arrangements.

APPRAISAL OF
MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
SERBIAN FUND FOR UNDERDEVELOPED REGIONS
1.        The Serbian Fund for Underdeveloped Region (SFUR) was created
in 1970 to provide financial incentives for industrial development in regions
of Serbia which are designated as underdeveloped. Each Region, of which there
are sixteen in Serbia proper outside of Belgrade, includes a number of commu-
nes. Regions are designated as underdeveloped if they fall below the Serbian
average for a number of criteria, including per capita income, value of retail
sales per capita, percentage of labour force that is-employed, budget of the
commune, etc. The Republican Institute for Social Planning provides guidance
to the Assembly, which formally designates which regions are underdeveloped
and are therefore eligible for assistance from SFUR.
2.        The initial capatilization of SFUR was Din. 500 million (US$29
million) but this has subsequently been tripled to Din. 1,500 million (US$88
million). The resources of SFUR comprise compulsory loans from business
enterprises 1/ and the repayment of previous loans for development projects.
Annual receipts from compulsory loans are presently of the order of Din. 400
million (US$24 million).
3.        SFUR resources are made available as grants or loans for projects
to benefit the underdeveloped regions. Grants, representing about 5% of
SFUR past commitments, are provided for studies. The greater part of the
funds are lent for industrial development on fairly easy terms: 4% interest
and 15 year repayment period.
4.        In the period 1971-74, SFUR made loans totalling approximately
Din. 1,000 million (US$59 million) for the construction, extension or re-
construction of some 200 projects throughout Serbia's underdeveloped regions.
Since SFUR loans typically fund 25% of project costs, the total cost of these
projects would have been of the order of Din. 4,000 million (US$235 million).
5.        Administration of SFUR's activities is undertaken by a 3-man staff
which is physically located in and assisted considerably by Beogradska Banka
(Bank of Belgrade). Approximately 30 staff members of Beogradska Banka are
engaged in these activities.
1/   According to legislation creating SFUR, all economic organizations in
Serbia proper (including banks) must contribute 0.5% of their gross
income to SFUR. These funds are supposed to be repaid to the organi-
zations eventually.

MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Accounting Systems of
Bioktos (Titovo Uzice) and Vodovod (Cacak) Communal Enterprises
1.        Each organization uses the chart of accounts and financial state-
ment reporting forms used by all Yugoslav organizations. They have adopted
the double entry system of accounts and accrue income and expenditure at the
end of the accounting period. The concept of profit (Dohodak) differs from
that understood in other countries in that it is derived before deduction of
expenditure for salaries and wages, interest on debt, insurance premiums,
legal and contractual liabilities. These expenditures are treated as appro-
priations of profit. Nevertheless, the form of accounts used is readily
adapted to the form of presentation which is normally followed by the Bank
when appraising public utility projects.
2.        The appropriation of profit is aimed first to meet the organiza-
tion's social obligations, both legal and contractual, before meeting obliga-
tions to the employee for salary, housing, training and recreation. There are
social obligations within the Yugoslav socialist system which require each
basic organization to contribute to the cost of education at schools and
universities; the Federal Fund for Underdeveloped Regions; and, loans to
community funds; other enterprises, and Government institutions. After
meeting the above obligation, which are analogue to operating expenses and
taxes, some of the remaining income is distributed to a legal reserve fund and
a collective consumption fund, with the balance retained in a business fund.
The reserve fund is separately invested by the enterprise, and the collective
consumption fund is separately administered by the workers, as a kind of
trust fund, for common social and recreational purposes.
3.        Salaries are based on social agreements reviewed annually by the
Republican Government, the Chamber of Commerce and the unions. Rates of pay
are set for each category of worker within each industry. The agreements take
into account the need for sufficient funds to maintain the living standards
of the workers and to provide sufficient funds for expanding output.
4.        Assets are not considered to belong to an organization but rather
to be assigned to an organization for their management and control. They
are, however, accounted for on a basis similar to ownership. Depreciation
is charged against fixed assets in a similar manner to that used in other
countries. Depreciation funds may be used first to meet debt service require-
ments, then to finance modernization or replacement of fixed assets, to meet
social obligations, and the remainder may be used to finance new construc-
tion.



ANNEX 21
Page 2
5.        Currently, recorded depreciation charges may comprise a number of
different factors:
(a) minimum rates prescribed by Yugoslav law;
(b) increases over minimum rates to allow for extra-shift workings
and for other adjustments where minimum rates are considered low;
(c) increases to allow for inflation - as prescribed by Yugoslav law
or at the option of the enterprise; and
(d) arbitrary increases where determined by the management and/or
workers' assemblies, to increase retained earnings.
Only items (a) and (b) conform to present generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples. Item (c) reflects both prudence and the increasing trend towards infla-
tion-accounting requirements. The present method does, however, cause distor-
tions because, hitherto, gross assets have not been concurrently revalued with
increased depreciation charges.
6.        Until now, revaluation of fixed assets has been carried out on an ad
hoc basis under rules prescribed by the Social Accounting Service (SAS), and
usually to reflect, in the past, exchange rate adjustments rather than infla-
tion. The latest general revaluation took place in 1971. Under a recently
published set of regulations in July 1975, provision is made for the annual
revaluation of fixed assets. Revaluation is apparently to be compulsory where
inflation has exceeded 10% in any year and otherwise voluntary (thus, the
voluntary nature of the lower revaluations could still cause inconsistencies)
based on statistical indices promulgated by the Federal Government.
7.        All cash and payments of accounts are regulated and supervised by
SAS who are also responsible for auditing in Yugoslavia. Each organization
has its own account (referred to as the Giro Account) at the local bank.
All business funds, reserve funds etc. are maintained at this bank and all
payments are verified by the SAS before checks are sent.
8.        The detailed accounting methods and procedures are not prescribed
(with the exception of the chart of accounts and reporting forms para 1) and
thus each organization is free to develop its own internal systems and apply
accounting procedures as it sees fit. Financial statements are prepared
quarterly and closed off about the 20th of the following month. Annual ac-
counts are closed off about January 31 and are required to be submitted to
the SAS by the end of February.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL FORECASTS
A. GENERAL
1.        Provision has been made in capital and operating costs for infla-
tion from January 1975. Inflation in operating costs has been assumed at the
following rates.
1975     1976      1977     1978      1979     1980-1984
Capital Costs           16%       14%      12%       12%      12%         10%
Operating Costs         20%       16%      13%       10%       8%          7%
2.        Operating expenses and fixed asset costs for the separate services
of Bioktos are either specifically identified from the accounts or, where this
is not possible, allocated on a reasonable basis. Apart from an allocation of
annual expenses, all transactions relative to the Vrutci dam have been ex-
cluded, since it is assumed to be constructed, managed and operated by the
Serbian Water Fund.
B. INCOME STATEMENTS
Revenues
3.        The tariffs assumed for water supply and wastewater services are
shown in Annex 24. Connection fees are at present nominal. Bioktos staff
have indicated that these, however, are assumed to be considerably increased
from 1978 onwards and have assumed Din. 2,000 per connection in that year,
rising in later years. Revenues for other services are based on estimates
of Bioktos staff.
Operating Expenses
4.        Salaries and wages reflect detailed forecasts of staff requirements
prepared by Bioktos, with allowances for inflation. Other operating expenses
reflect similar forecasts of various operating requirements including salaries
allocated from common services departments. Expenses for chemicals reflect



ANNEX 23
Page 2
the starting up of part of the water treatment works in 1978. Power expenses
also reflect the introduction of various pumping facilities. Taxes and con-
tributions are based on Bioktos estimates. Provision has been made in water
income statements from 1980 onwards for an appropriate share of the annual
expenses of the Vrutci Dam. These are based on an assumption that 70% of
the annual expenses and capital recovery costs I/ will be charged to Bioktos
by the Serbian Water Fund. Operating costs of services other than water and
wastewater are based on estimates of Bioktos staff.
Depreciation
5.        As indicated in Annex 21 depreciation charges during the last few
years have been somewhat inconsistent. The financial forecasts assume rates
of 2.5% per annum on revalued gross fixed assets for water and wastewater
services and 7% per annum for other services, rates which seem reasonable,
particularly in the light of the new requirements on revaluation of fixed
assets.
Interest
6.        Interest relating to project loans has been charged to construction
until the end of 1979. Interest has also been charged to construction until
the end of 1981 on loans relating to the construction of the proposed waste-
water treatment plant.
Distribution of New Income
7.        Contributions to the Collective Consumption Fund are voted an-
nually by the Workers. Minimum Reserve Fund contributions are based on for-
mulae prescribed by the Social Accounting Service. Forecasts are based on
estimates of Bioktos staff.
Collective Consumption Fund
8.        Transactions of the Fund have been excluded from Bioktos financial
statements as they are separately administered and have no bearing on opera-
tions.
C. FUNDS FLOW STATEMENTS
Borrowing
9.   (a)  IBRD - Din. 130.7 million (US$7.3 million equivalent) for
20 years including a grace period of 4-1/2 years, interest
at 8.5% per annum and a commitment charge of 0.75% per
annum on the undisbursed balance;
1/   Capital recovery costs calculated as a 50-year annuity at 10% in-
terest with price escalation to cover inflation from 1980 onwards.



ANNEX 23
Page 3
(b) Belgrade Bank - Din. 8 million (US$0.44 million equivalent)
for 15 years, with interest at 3% per annum;
(c) Mutual Reserve Fund - Din. 0.5 million for other services
for 10 years with interest at 5% per annum; and
(d) Local loans from unspecified sources for 15 years with
interest at 10% per annum, of annual amounts as follows:
1978  -  Din. 47.2 million
1979  -  Din. 18 million
1981  -  Din. 48 million
1982  -  Din. 12.5 million
1983  -  Din. 15.4 million
1984  -  Din. 10.6 million
Capital Contributions
10. (a) Special Funds - Din. 218.8 million towards the project from
various sources arranged by the Commune (described in Annex 32)
as follows:
1976  -  Din. 26.8 million
1977  -  Din. 68.1 million
1978  -  Din. 37.1 million
1979  -  Din. 34.0 million
1980  -  Din. 32.7 million
(b)  System extensions costing about Din. 10 million constructed by
individual communities and handed over to Bioktos for operation
and maintenance.
(c) Communal and Enterprise contributions of relatively minor
amounts towards the capital expenditure requirements of
"other" services.
Bank Overdrafts
11.       Short-term bank finance of Din. 5.0 million is estimated at the end
of 1979, to be repaid from funds available in 1980. Interest at 10% p.a. has
been included in the income statement.

D. BALANCE SHEET
Fixed Assets
12.       Fixed assets allow for project expenditures and for construction of
wastewater treatment facilities in 1979-81 (Din. 84.6 million). Provision is
also made for assumed ongoing water and wastewater network construction and for
minor extensions and improvements for other services. Fixed assets have been
annually revalued from January 1, 1975 using inflation factors shown in Section
A (above). This is based on recently published legal requirements (Annex 21)
and assumes, for the sake of consistency, that Bioktos will exercise its dis-
cretion to revalue its fixed assets every year, whether or not inflation
exceeds 10%.
Long Term Investments
13.       Long term investments relate to founders capital investments in
local banks and loans for underdeveloped regions which are obligatory under
Yugoslav law. Forecasts are based on Bioktos staff estimates.
Current Assets and Current Liabilities
14.       Accounts receivable have been projected on the basis on about 2-1/2
months' revenue. Inventories have been gradually reduced from about 12 months
consumption of materials and chemicals in 1975 to about 6 months consumption
by 1981. Short term investments represent accumulated construction funds,
assumed liquidated in 1975. Payables have been increased in proportion to
cash operating expenses.

Vodovod-Cacak Water and Wastewater Enterprise
Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A. GENERAL
1.        Provision has been made in capital and operating costs for infla-
tion from January 1975, at the following rates:
1975      1976      1977       1978      1979       1980-1984
Capital Costs     16%        14%       12%        12%       12%         10%
Operating Costs   20%        16%       13%        10%        8%           7%
2.        Operating expenses and fixed asset costs for the separate services
of water supply and wastewater disposal are either specifically identified
from the accounts or, where this is not possible, allocated on an arbitrary
but reasonable basis. Stormwater activity has been excluded, since it will
not be operated on a revenue-earning basis and has not yet been taken over by
Vodovod.
B. INCOME STATEMENTS
Revenues
3.        The tariffs assumed for water and wastewater services are shown in
Annex 27. Connection fees are charged on the basis of individual estimates
of costs. Forecasts of income from connection fees is therefore based on
an average and related to numbers of connections with appropriate allowances
for inflation.
Operation Expenses
4.        Salaries and wages and most other operating expenses reflect a
growth rate of 5% plus allowances for inflation. Power costs are based on
engineering estimates provided by Vodovod. Taxes and contributions are based
on Vodovod estimates. Provision has been included in "Other" in the 1984



ANNEX 26
Page 2
water income statement for an appropriate share of the annual expenses of
the Semedraz Dam - Din. 19 million. This is based on an assumption that
about 70% of annual expenses and capital recovery costs will be charged to
Vodovod by the Serbian Water Fund.
Depreciation
5.        As indicated in Annex 21 depreciation charges during the last few
years have been somewhat inconsistent. The financial forecasts assume rates
of 4.7% on existing revalued gross fixed assets and 3.0% per annum on new re-
valued gross fixed assets for water. For wastewater, 2.9% on existing gross
fixed assets and 2.5% per annum for new fixed assets is assumed. These rates
seem reasonable, particularly in the light of the new requirements on revalu-
ation of fixed assets.
Network Construction
6.        In the absence of detailed cost records, (See Annex 26) deductions
have been made from operating costs of the estimated costs of water and waste-
water network construction, carried out by force account. These costs, which
were estimated by the mission, are reflected in the fixed asset accounts.
Interest
7.        Interest on the Bank loan has been charged to construction until the
end of 1979. Interest has also been charged to construction until the end of
1981 on loans relating to the construction of the proposed wastewater treat-
ment plant.
Distribution of Net Income
8.        Contributions to the Collective Consumption Fund are voted annually
by the workers. Minimum Reserve Fund Contributions are based on formulae
prescribed by the Social Accounting Service. Forecasts are based on esti-
mates of Vodovod's staff.
Collective Consumption Fund
9.        Transactions of the Fund have been excluded from Vodovod's finan-
cial statements as they are separately administered and have no bearing on
operations.

ANNEX 26
Page 4
Consumer Contributions
12.       Consumer contributions towards non-project network construction in
annual amounts are indicated in the forecast, On the basis of information
from Vodovod, no such contributions are forecast for projct years.
Bank Overdrafts
13.       Short-term bank finance of Din. 2.0 million was estimated at the
end of 1975, to be recovered from funds available in 1976, Interest at 9%
per annum has been included in the income statement.
D. BALANCE SHEET
Fixed Assets
14.       Fixed assets allow for project expenditurep, contruction of waste-
water treatment facilities in 1979-81 (Din. 121.8 million) and construction
of water transmission and treatment facilities in 1982r,83 (Din. 225 million).
The water transmission and treatment facilities assume construction of
Semedraz Dam by the Serbian Water Fund (or MRWCI), to beg8n supplies in 1984.
Provision is also made for assumed ongoing water and wastewater network
construction and the acquisition of small equipment for both services. Fixed
assets have been annually revalued from January 1, 1975 using inflation
factors shown in Section A (above). This is based on recently published legal
requirements (Annex 21) and assumes, for the sake of consistency, that Vodovod
will exercise its discretion to revalue its fixed assets every year, whether
or not inflation exceeds 10%.
Long-Term Investments
15.       Long-term investments relate to founders investments in the capital
of local banks and loans for underdeveloped regions which are obligatory under
Yugoslav law. Forecasts are based on Vodovod staff estimates,
Current Assets and Current Liabilities
15.       Accounts receivable have been projected on the basis of about 3-1/2
months' revenue in 1975 reducing to about 2-1/2 months' revenue by 1981. In-
ventories have been increased in proportion to the use of materials. Short-
term investments represents cash contributions deposited with SAS in advance
of (and as a legal condition of commencing) network copstruction. They have
been increased relative to the size of each year's network construction program.
Accounts payable represent about 3 months cash operating expenses plus network
construction expenses.

APPRAISAL OF
MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
1.        The project is complex, with many different components and several
different beneficiaries. The total project is evaluated by considering indi-
vidual components separately.
2.        The research components of the project (studies, irrigation pilot
project and training) are not amenable to conventional economic evaluation be-
cause of the difficulty of quantifying their potential benefits.
3.        The benefits of the wastewater facilities to be constructed in the
project present similar evaluation problems. However these facilities are the
least cost solution to removing liquid wastes from the towns of Titovo Uzice
and Cacak and their removal will clearly benefit the towns. The environment
will be improved and the risk of disease reduced. But these benefits cannot
be quantified.
4.        The project components which are the most expensive and which merit
the most attention are those for water supply in the two towns. Each is dis-
cussed separately.
B.   Water Supply Facilities for Titovo Uzice
I.   Objectives
5.        The main objectives of these project facilities is to augment the
supply of water and extend the distribution system for people and industries
in Titovo Uzice.
6.        Estimates of the town's future requirements for treated water are
provided in Annex 28. In 1974, there were severe water shortages in the town.
Nevertheless, in that year, 55% of the water sales were to commercial and
industrial consumers. In future, it is estimated that domestic water sales
will be approximately equal to the sales of treated water to industries and
commercial enterprises.
7.        At the present time, however, the largest water users in Titovo
Uzice are the five industries which pump water directly from the Djetinja
River (located on Map 11637). Whereas, Bioktos produced an average of 125



ANNEX 30
Page 2
liters/second in 1974, these industries pumped an estimated 223 liters/second,l/
almost twice as much. The largest existing water supply plant in Titovo Uzice
is that of the copper and aluminum refinery at Sevojno, whose water supply
facilities 2/ were built because Bioktos was unable to provide an adequate
supply to the industry.
8.        Four of the five industries with small private systems would appar-
ently prefer to buy treated water from Bioktos because of the deterioration in
the quality of river water but the Sevojno complex, the largest industrial
water user, will continue to use its newly constructed facilities. Estimates
of the future requirements for untreated water of the Sevojno industrial com-
plex have been provided by the Morava River Corporation. These estimates can
be compared to the estimates for treated water production (Annex 28) as follows:

9.        For comparison, the average flow of the Djetinja River at Titovo
Uzice is about 5,000 liters/second but flows have been as low as 340 liters/
second. The treated water system of Titovo Uzize (described in Annex 5) de-
pends on inflows to the Djetinja River to recharge the aquifer which is its
source. The total of the water produced by Bioktos for the treated water

system and pumped by industries in Titovo Uzice totalled some 355 liters/
second in 1974, indicating that the reliable yield of the source has already
been exceeded and that a period of prolonged low flows would have a signif-
icant and adverse impact on the town. It is not possible to evaluate these
adverse effects.
II.   Least Cost Solution
10.       Possible sources which could augment the water supply to Titovo
Uzice include:
(a) Regulation of Djetinja River flows
(b) Groundwater
(c) Diversion of surface water from another watershed
Each of these alternatives is discussed hereafter.
11.       BeginniTig in 1971, four different Yugoslav consultants 1/ prepared
preliminary proposals for a dam to regulate flows on the Djetinja River for
the benefit of Titovo Uzice. Several different types of dams were proposed
and several possible damsites considered. The Jaroslav Cerni Institute was
assigned the task of preparing final designs for the dam. Following exten-
sive field investigations the Vrutci Dam describe4 in Annex 10 was recom-
mended, along with transmission and treatment facilities, as the least cost
solution to supplying the towns' needs. (No pumping is required except to
distribute treated water to the high level zopes in Titovo Uzice.) The es-
timated cost of the Vrutci dam and associated water supply system (exclud-
ing the distribution network) totals some Din 300 million (US$16.7 million)
in 1975 prices. (Details in Annex 12).
12.       Groundwater studies in the Titovo Uzice area have indicated that
there is no potential water source which remains to be exploited. This is
reasonable, since the region is in the hilly headwaters of the Zapadna
Morava system and most precipitation drains quickly away from the steeply
sloping catchments.  Accordingly, local water planners did not pursue the
matter of groundwater availability from more distant sources.
13.       The appraisal mission observed the existence of a potential ground-
water source approximately 25 km downstream (east) from Titovo Uzice, where
the Djetinja River meets two others, the Moravica and the Skrapez, at the
formal origin of the Zapadna Morava (Map 11639). An accumulation of alluvial
sediment in this valley plain provides a very shallow aquifer (depth 3 to 5 m)
covering an area of 80 to 100 ha which depends entirely on flows in the three
perennial rivers meeting at this location. The town of Pozega uses this
aquifer as its water supply source and it is almost certain that the aquifer
could yield enough water to meet the requirements of Titovo Uzice for treated
and untreated (industrial water).

14.       Preliminary calculations by the mission indicated that initial de-
velopment of this well field with a capacity of 300 liters/second would require
a large number of wells, collecting reservoir, two pumping stations, 1/ power
supply and control system, and 28 km of pipeline. The cost of this system
would be of the order of Din 175 million (US$9.7 million) in 1975 prices with
annual pumping charges of about Din 5 million. Design and construction of the
system would take 2 to 3 years. The existing Turica facilities in Titovo
Uzice have a theoretical capacity of 120 liters/second (Annex 5), which, with
an additional 300 liters/second from Pozega, would only be able to meet peak
day demands for treated water until about 1987 (assuming a daily peak/average
ratio of 1:3). At that time, the Pozega system would have to be duplicated at
similar expense (or very much earlier if it were to be used to provide indus-
trial supplies to Sevojno). The costs of building and operating this ground-
water alternative have a higher present value than that for the Vrutci scheme
(at discount rates of 10% and 15%) and would be much less attractive to
Titovo Uzice on other non-economic considerations, such as reliability,
security, etc. Accordingly, this alternative was rejected.
15.       The third alternative was to divert water to Titovo Uzice from
another watershed. For many years, Serbian water planners had been consider-
ing using the waters of the Rzav River for a multipurpose project based on the
Roge Dam, which would be located some 15 km southeast of Titovo Uzice on a
relatively large tributary to the Moravica River (Map 11639). Flows at the
Roge damsite average some 6.0 m3/second and a rockfill dam (volume 2.0 mil-
lion m3) has been proposed to create a reservoir with storage totalling 162
million m3. The Roge scheme would be used to generate hydro power (about 60
Gwh annually from a 30 Mw plant) by diverting flows through a power tunnel
1.2 km long which would discharge into the Djetinja River some 11 km down-
stream of Titovo Uzice. Water diverted in such a power tunnel could obviously
be used to supply water to Titovo Uzice.
16.       Early in 1975, the costs of the Roge scheme, excluding price in-
creases, were estimated as follows:
Din (million)      US$ (million)
Dam                              400               22.2
Power Tunnel                      90                5.0
Power Station                    210               11.7
Total                      700               38.9
1/   The Pozega aquifer level is approximately 300 m, whereas medium level
reservoirs in Titovo Uzice are as high as 475 m (Annex 5). In addi-
tion, the friction losses in the 28 km pipeline (600 m diameter) would
account for about 60 km, giving a total pumping head of approximately
235 meters.



ANNEX 30
Page 5
A further Din 150 million (US$8.3 million) would be required to treat the
water and convey it from the power tunnel to Titovo Uzice.
17.       Although the Roge dam is included in the proposed Serbian develop-
ment plan for 1976-80, the implementation of this large multipurpose scheme
depends on the collaboration of the power sector (to whom the scheme is of
marginal interest) and communities who might benefit from it. Attempts at
developing Roge as a regional water system began as early as 1970 (under the
auspices of the Serbian Secretariat for Town Planning, Housing and Communal
Affairs) but so far no consensus has been possible. Accordingly, it seems
unlikely that this large and expensive scheme will proceed in the near
future. For these reasons. it is concluded that the Roge scheme is not
only more expensive but also a more uncertain source to meet the pressing
water supply needs of Titovo Uzice than the Vrutci scheme.
18.       In conclusion, development of the Vrutci scheme is regarded as the
least cost solution to supply Titovo Uzice's water requirements.
III.    Project Benefits and Water Tariffs
19.       The costs of the Vrutci dam and associated water supply facilities
have been estimated (Annex 12). The Vrutci reservoir itself is intended to
serve multiple functions and it has not been possible to quantify all their
benefits. These include:
(a) supply of water for treatment and distribution to people and
industries in Titovo Uzice. A minimum estimate of this benefit
is the value the consumers are willing to pay. The present
water supply system with its constant water shortages, cannot
meet all of the present demands. The greater part of the
treated water from the system is supplied to industries (55%
of total water sales in 1974). Present water tariffs are
relatively low: Din 1.50/m3 (US$0.08/m3) for domestic con-
sumers and Din 2.30/m3 (US$0.13/m3) for industrial and commer-
cial consumers, giving a weighted average tariff of about
Din 1.94/m3 (US$0.11/m3).
(b) supply of river water through reservoir operations to augment
periodic low flows and permit industries to pump increasing
amounts of water for private systems (paras 7-9). This ben-
efit is difficult to measure for two reasons:
(i) the incremental volumes of water to be provided by
releases from the reservoir (over and above the natural
flows of the Djetinja River in Titovo Uzice) would de-
pend on variable hydrologic conditions. These incre-
mental volumes have not been determined and no analysis
has been made of the probability of future droughts and
associated shortages likely to be incurred as industrial
demands increase;



ANNEX 30
Page 6
(ii) there is no presently acceptable metehod of estimating
the value of these incremental flows from the Vrutci re-
servoirs. Presumably the metallurgical complex at Sevojno
would have to be shut down for extended periods if such
water were unavailable, at economic costs which are unknown.
(c) Augmentation of low flows by reservoir releases to improve water
quality in the Djetinja River. Such water quality improvement
would benefit industrial water users, improve the aesthetics of
the town areas near the river (including a swimming area in the
river) and permit more fish to survive in the river. Such ben-
efits, although quite tangible, are not easily quantifiable.
(d) Storing of flood flows. The relatively small reservoir will cer-
tainly be capable of retaining or at least retarding minor floods.
However, any major flood would quickly pass through the reservoir.
The flood control benefits of the reservoir have not been analyzed
in detail but are believed to be relatively small compared to the
water supply benefits.
20.       Because of the inability to provide a complete estimate of project
benefits from the dam it is not possible to present a meaningful rate of re-
turn analysis on the Vrutci dam. If, however, the only benefits considered
are those for incremental sales of treated water, and if these sales are
valued at the weighted average of present tariffs (Din 1.94/m3) the investment
costs associated with the water supply component of the project. 1/ including
the Vrutci dam, would produce a negative internal rate of return. This provides
little useful information since only one benefit (treated water supply) has
been considered and since this benefit is valued in terms of present tariffs
which are admittedly too low.
21.       Water tariffs in Titovo Uzice will have to be increased substantial-
ly on financial grounds, in order to generate cash to pay for the water supply
system (and the future wastewater treatment facilities). As indicated in
Annex 24, water rates are expected to increase by a total of 269% by 1980
(in constant terms). Even if the weighted average of the projected 1980 water
tariffs (Din 6.98/m3) is used to evaluate the benefits from treated water
supply, the rate of return would still be negative. If incremental treated
water sales were valued at the long run marginal cost for water (para 23), the
water supply investments (including the Vrutci dam) would produce an internal
rate of return of 10.0%.
22.       The Vrutci dam and associated facilities can provide Titovo Uzice
with a reliable supply of water, for its treated water system and for
1/   In this calculation relatively minor capital costs associated with the
continuing growth of the distribution system have been included, since
they are requiired to realize the benefits of the extra water supplied
by the Vrutci scheme.



ANNEX 30

industries, of approximately 1,100 liters/second. 1/ This should meet total
water demands for at least the next 25 years. 2/  Subsequently, the yield of
the Vrutci reservoir can be increased further by diverting flows into it from
the Susica River by means of a minor diversion system, including a tunnel some 3
km long, which could cost of the order of Din 150 million (US$8.3 million).
This means that the relatively large investment required for the Vrutci scheme
will provide water supply capacity for Titovo Uzice which is unlikey to be fully
utilized until the 21st century. Thereafter, the capacity of the Vrutci scheme
can be further augmented by diversion from the Susica River.
23.       The average incremental cost for water supply for Titovo Uzice has
been calculated on the following assumptions:
(a) all costs of the Vrutci dam are charged to water supply;
(b) only treated water volumes are considered (due to the diffi-
culties discussed in para. 11).
On this basis, which obviously overstates the costs of water supply, the aver-
age incremental cost of water is estimated at Din 14.5/m3 (US$0.81/m3), using
a discount rate of 10%. Details are provided in Table 1.
24.       The weighted average of the present water tariffs is only about
13% of the estimated average incremental cost of water, but should reach 49%
of this value by 1980. By that time, however, the expensive project facil-
ities would already have been built and the average incremental cost of water
will have fallen to Din 4.7/m3 (US$0.26/m3), using the previous methodology
but discounting future incremental sales of treated water and associated
costs to 1980. This calculation slightly understates the average incremental
costs in 1980 because the costs of additional facilities required beyond the
year 2000 to augment the capacity of the Vrutci system (Susica diversion and
probably additional transmission and treatment facilities for Titovo Uzice)
have not been included. Their capacity, cost and timing are uncertain but
if they were all to be built in the year 2001 at a total cost (in 1975 prices)
of Din 200 million (US$11.1 million), the 1980 average incremental cost of water
would rise to Din 5.9 m/3 (US$0.33/m3).
1/   Compared to the average inflow to the Vrutci reservoir of 1,870 liters/
second. The dependable supply of water can be estimated more accurate-
ly only after detailed operating rules are prepared, which will be done
before project construction is completed.
2/   Although the total water demand for 1995 is estimated at 1,105 liters/
second, it must be remembered that some of this water to be pumped by
the Sevojno industry will consist of unregulated flows from tributa-
ries which enter the Djetinja River below the Vrutci dam - see Map 11639.



ANNEX 30
Page 8
25.       The foregoing indicates that the 1980 water tarifs, which are to be
more than triple the current tariffs in constant prices (Annex 24), may at
that time exceed the average incremental cost for water. If the current tariff
structure is maintained, for example, commercial and industrial water consumers
in 1980 would be charged Din 14.20/m3 (US$0.79/m3) in current prices, equiv-
alent to Din 8.49/m3 (US$0.47) in 1975 prices. This means that it might be
possible to lower tariffs at that time on economic grounds.
C.   Water Supply Facilities for Cacak
I.   Objective
26.       The project facilities are intended to augment the supply of water
supplies and extend the distribution system for people and industries in Cacak.
27.       Estimates of water supply requirements are provided in Annex 29.
Traditionally, the residents of Cacak have relied on local wells for their
supply, but increasing urbanization and industrialization have caused the
groundwater sources to be increasingly polluted and inadequatre to meet in-
dustrial demands. The estimated 60% of the population who were connected to
the system in 1974 suffered no shortages. As the distribution system is ex-
tended to reach an increasing proportion of the growing population, the per
capita domestic demands are not expected to increase significantly.
28.       Industrial and commercial water sales were 160% of domestic sales
in 1974 and are expected to continue to predominate in Cacak. Estimating such
future demands is very difficult because they depend on the future pattern of
industrial and commercial activities. In Cacak, the largest industrial con-
sumer of treated water is expected to be the brewery, which is due to com-
mence operations in 1976 and which will require a peak supply of 70 liters/
second. The estimates of future industrial water demands presented in
Annex 29 are believed to be reasonable and reflect on known plans for in-
dustrial development in Cacak.
II.   Least Cost Alternative
29.       Cacak is fortunate to be sited on a perennial river (Zapadna Morava)
which provides the primary source of groundwater in the shallow alluvial aquifer
in the vicinity of the town. The average annual flow in the river exceeds 30
m3/second and the lowest recorded monthly flow averaged 3.8 m3/second (Sept-
ember 1956). A probability analysis of hydrologic data indicates that the
lowest flow expected in 100 years would be 2.5 m3/second. For comparison,
Vodovod produced an average of 0.13 m3/second in 1974 and is unlikely to
require as much as 2.0 m3/second in the next 25 years.
30.       Unfortunately, the water in the Zapadna Morava is increasingly
polluted. There are virtually no wastewater treatment facilities in the
towns upstream of Cacak (Map 11639) and there are many polluting industries,



AN4NEX 30
Page 9
particularly in Titovo Uzice. Cacak presently relies on groundwater sources
at Beljina (Annex 6) but the site is limited and production capacity cannot
be expanded there.
31.       There are basically three alternative sources of additional water
for Cacak:
(a) New surface water source, to provide less polluted water;
(b) Pumping and treating water from Zapadna Morava River (with-
out storage); and
(c)  New groundwater source.
32.       Serbian water planners were convinced that Cacak's future water needs
should be supplied from a new surface water source, the Dicina River, which is
a tributary to the Zapadna Morava downstream of Cacak (Map 11639). Runoff from
this relatively small watershed is limited and irregular 1/ so a storage reser-
voir would be required. The Semedraz dam was proposed primarily to supply water
for Cacak. It could also be operated to augment low flows and to reduce flood
discharges.
33.       Preliminary engineering, was completed for the Semedraz dam in 1972
by Yugoslav consultants (Energoprojekt) who have also prepared preliminary
designs for the associated water supply facilities: treatment plant, pumping
station and 12 km pipeline to Cacak.
33.       The cost estimate for these facilities, which would take approximately
three years to construct, is estimated as follows in end-1975 prices:
Din (million)   US$ (million)
Semedraz Dam                                210               11.7
Pump Station                                   8               0.4
Pipeline to Cacak                             75               4.2
Treatment Plant (450 l/s)                     43               2.4
Total                                    336              18.7
1/   Average annual inflow at Semedraz reservoir site estimated at 1,540 liters/
second. The proposed 46 m high rockfill dam would provide a reservoir with
a total storage capacity of some 33 million m3, which could produce a reli-
able yield of about 750 liters/second.



ANNEX 30
Page 10
34.       The possibility of direct abstractions from the Zapadna Morava River
was never seriously considered by Serbian authorities because of their concern
for water quality. It is certain that treatment of the river water to produce
safe water for Cacak would be feasible but this would have to be confirmed by
extensive analyses of the water and consideration of appropriate treatment
facilities. The technology, however, would not likely be more complex than
aLready required for treatment of badly polluted rivers in other parts of the
world (e.g. Mississippi River at New Orleans or Rhine River at Rotterdam).
35.       It is probable that a period of about four years would be required
to design and build the necessary plant, which could be located upstream of
Cacak. The cost for a plant with an initial capacity of 450 liters/second
(as proposed for the Semedraz plant) would likely be of the order of Din 60-
80 million (US$3.3-$4.4 million) and an associated pumping station would cost
about as much as the one proposed for the Semedraz scheme (Din 8 million or
US$0.4 million).
36.       The third alternative, and the one selected for the project because
it is the least cost solution, is the development of additional groundwater
sources. A good site at Parmenac, some 2 km upstream of the existing Beljina
source, was investigated in 1970/71. More extensive investigations were com-
pleted late in 1975.
37.       Preliminary results indicated that 15 to 20 wells at the Parmenac
site could yield 200 to 250 liters/second at a cost (end-1975 prices) of ap-
proximately Din 20 million (US$1.1 million). Local authorities did not favor
this solution initially because of the limited capacity of the well field
(only about one-third of the capacity of the Semedraz scheme) and because
of concern for the quality of the water in the wells, which would be di-
rectly influenced by water in the adjacent Zapadna Morava River.
38.       It was decided to proceed with the development of this groundwater
scheme as a interim source for Cacak which could be built quickly (less than
two years) and cheaply. At the same time, however, local authorities wish
to finalize plans for subsequent source developments. If the Parmenac
source can yield only 200 liters/second, system capacity will be increased
to at least 400 liters/second (based on the nominal capacity of the Beljina
source of 200 liters/second). Allowing for a daily peak/average ratio 1/
of 1.3, groundwater sources with a total capacity of 400 liters/second would
be sufficient to meet peak day requirements until about 1984, based on the
projections of Annex 29.
39.       The proposed system development study of Annex 15, which should be
coompleted by the end of 1977, would permit Serbian decision-makers to
1/   In 1975, peak daily production (September 16) was 26% higher than the
estimated average daily production of 145 liters/second.



ANNEX 30

determine the next appropriate source to be developed to augment the water
supply for Cacak.
III.   Project Benefits and Water Tariffs
40.       Water supply benefits are traditionally difficult to quantify, both
in physical and in monetary terms. The existing source can supply most demands
so the additional sources will be required only in peak periods at first. All
of the new capacity should be utilized in peak periods by about 1984 but it
will not be utilized 100% of the time until the minimum seasonal demands ex-
ceed the total capacity of the two sources, which is not expected to happen
until after 1990. Distribution facilities are similarly incremental to the
existing system.
41.       A minimum value of the additional water supplies is the amount which
the consumers are willing to pay. Present water tariffs for industrial and
commercial consumers are more than double those for domestic consumers (Din
3.35/m3 vs. Din 1.41/m3, or US$0.19/m3 vs. US$0.08/m3). Water sales to indus-
trial and commercial consumers represented 62% of Vodovod's total sales in 1974
and are expected to account for between 60% and 65% of total sales in the fore-
seeable future (Annex 29).  If incremental water sales due to the project are  --
valued at the weighted average of the present tariff (Din 2.60/m3 or US$0.14/m3,
the projected investments for water supply yields an internal rate of return of
3.9%.
42.       This rate of return simply demonstrates that water tariffs in Cacak
are too low. For financial reasons, Vodovod is expected to double its tariffs
in real terms over the next ten years (Annex 27). Using a weighted average
tariff of Din 5.03/m3, the anticipated 1984 tariff expressed in constant 1975
prices, the internal rate of return rises to 11.7%.
43.       The average incremental cost of water can be calculated if assump-
tions are made concerning future source development for Cacak. The most ex-
pensive next alternative would be to build the Semedraz system. If this system
were built to begin operating in 1984, the average incremental cost of water
for Cacak wold be approximately Din 9.9/m3 (US$0.55/m3), using a discount
rate of 10% (Table 2).  The rate of return on the water supply facilities in
the present project would rise to 21.6% if incremental water sales were valued
at the average incremental cost for water.
44.       By 1984, the commercial and industrial tariffs for water are esti-
mated to be Din 6.4/m3 (US$0.36/m3) in constant prices if the present tariff
structure is maintained. This indicates that the proposed tariff policies
for Cacak are economically sound, since future tariffs will approach the
average incremental cost for water.

MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SERBIAN WATER FUND
Financial Situation
A.   Past and Present Financial Situation
1.        Details of the organization and administration of SWF are given in
Annex 4. This indicates that SWF acts as an agency of the Republican Govern-
ment for the administration of public funds for the purposes of various river
regulation activities. Certain sources of revenue have been assigned for the
exclusive use of SWF, in the form of taxes or contributions from various types
of users of river water. These taxes and contributions are as follows:
(a) from power companies for utilization of water;
(b) from other users of raw water;
(c) from users of drinking water (added to water bills as a
sales tax);
(d) from organizations discharging pollutants into rivers; and
(e) from persons or enterprises licensed to extract sand and
gravel from river beds.
During the period 1971-1975 receipts from these sources for the
Morava basin amounted to about Din 55 million 1/ (US$3.1 million).
2.        During the years 1974 and 1975 additional funds were made available
by the allocation to the Fund of part of the proceeds of a Republican retail
tax, estimated at about Din 95 million (US$5.3 million) for the two-year
period. For 1975, a one-time distribution of part of the development funds
hitherto held by commercial banks will produce about Din 28 million (US$1.6
million). In addition to its regular funds, the Water Fund has received,
during the past five years, about Din 235 million (US$13.1 million) from the
Republican budget. A further Din 273 million (US$15.2 million) has so far
come from a fund established during the construction of the Djerdap Dam (see
Annex 3), a joint hydro-power project of Yugoslavia and Romania on the Danube
(Map 11603), for the construction of upstream works, particularly dams, which
are supposed to prevent downstream sedimentation which would be detrimental
to the hydro-power operations. Sources of SWF funds for the period 1971-1975
can be summarized as follows:
1/   Including Din 15 million for agricultural activities in 1971 only.

3.        During the period 1965-1970, about Din 210 million (US$11.6 million)
was disbursed by SWF for flow regulation projects in the Morava region. This
is expected to rise to an estimated Din 720 million (US$40.0 million) for the
period 1971-1975 including approximately Din 75 million on maintenance and
approximately Din 624 on new construction of dykes and river regulation
structures.
4.        Detailed plans are still being formulated by SWF for the period
1976-1980, but preliminary estimates show Morava regional requirements for the
period amounting to about Din 1,760 million (US$97.8 million) to be funded as
follows:

5.        No details, other than a forecast allocation between maintenance (17%)
and new construction investment (83%), are available about proposed expenditures.
Total investment expenditure of about Din. 1450 million (US$80.6 million) is ex-
pected to include the contribution towards the Vrutci dam, estimated at Din 120
million (US$6.7 million) and towards the water quality and flood control studies,
estimated at Din 33.7 million (US$1.9 million).

7.        It is proposed that Din 115.6 million (US$6.4 million) of the Bank
loan be allocated to these project components, to cover 38.9% of project costs.
30% of the balance of requirements for Vrutci Dam will come from Titovo Uzice
(Din51.5 million) and 70% from SWF (Din 120.1 million). SWF will also provide
a contribution of Din 33.7 million (US$1.9 million) towards the studies.
8.        Excluded from the table in paragraph 6 are several project components
which will be undertaken by entities other than SWF and for which SWF will on-
lend an appropriate portion of the Bank loan. Also excluded from this table
is the training program for MRWCI, which is not expected to be implemented
until SWF hands over its responsibilities to the MRWCI. The following table
gives a forecast of the estimated funds requirements for the construction and
implementation phase of these remaining project components, showing the
sources from which they are expected to be met. These components cover the
regional development studies, pilot irrigation projects and the tMRWCI training
program.

C.   Future Operations
9.        The 1975 Serbian Water Law (Annex 3) provides for the establishment
of three water basin Water Communities of Interest one of which is for the
Morava Basin (MRWCI). It is expected that shortly after these new bodies are
established, SWF will cease to operate as a separate organization. Its
functions and financial resources are expected to be appropriately distributed
among the new bodies.
10.       Upon completion, it is expected that the Vrutci dam will be managed,
operated and maintained by SWF (or its successor, MRWCI). Separate accounts
will be kept for such dam operations. Because the Vrutci reservoir is in-
tended to serve multiple purposes an appropriate share of the annual costs,
including a capital recovery factor, will be charged to Bioktos based upon a
calculation of the share of benefits attributed to Bioktos water supply system.
The annual payment should relate to costs of operation, maintenance and admin-
istration together with the recovery of capital costs on an annuity basis at
an appropriate rate of interest. In calculating the recovery of capital
costs, credit should be given for the 30% contribution by the Commune towards
construction costs. A study to determine the appropriate share of costs
chargeable to Bioktos will be carried out in conjunction with the formulation
of reservoir operating rules. Pending the establishment of such arrangements,
this report assumes that 70% of the annual costs of the dam will be charged to
Bioktos, after an adjustment for the capital contribution to be provided by
the Commune.

MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
BIOKTOS - TITOVO UZICE COMMUNAL ENTERPRISE
Financial Situation
A.   Past Performance and Present Position
1.        Consideration of the finances of Bioktos cannot be made without
regard for those activities of the organization other than for water and
wastewater services (Annex 18). However, each of these other activities
have their own sources of revenue, either from charges or from the Commune.
These services, which together accounted for some 40% of Bioktos' net income
in 1974 (Annex 22) are expected to continue to operate on a self-sufficient
basis without adversely affecting water and wastewater facilities 1/.
2.        On its combined water and wastewater operations Bioktos earned a
rate of return of almost 12% in 1972, falling to 9% by 1974. No charges were
levied for the wastewater service until January, 1975 and therefore losses
were made on this service for each of, the three years in question. Overall,
for all services, Bioktos made a rate of return in excess of 10% for each of
the three years.
3.        In January 1975 a wastewater tariff was introduced.  On November 1,
1975 the water tariffs were increased by 25% (domestic) and 15% (commercial).
In 1975, the combined water and wastewater services were expected to earn a
rate of return of about 4.8%.
4.        From 1972 to 1975 domestic water sales increased by about 15% and
commercial sales by about 20%. Revenues from water and wastewater services
increased by about 77%. Receivables have been at about 2-3 months revenues.
5.        Long-term debt fell from Din 3.4 million in 1972 to Din 2.7 mil-
lion in 1974. The outstanding debt at the end of 1975 is estimated at Din
2.25 million comprising 15 loans with an average outstanding repayment
period of just over 6 years and an average interest rate of about 3.8%.
1/   On the basis of figures provided by Bioktos, services other than water
and wastewater collectively earned, or are estimated to earn, a rate
of return in excess of 10% for every year from 1972 to 1984 with all
funds requirements covered either from internal sources, or from
business enterprises and the Commune, except in 1976, when a specific
loan is to be arranged to finance certain capital expenditures.



ANNEX 32
Page 2
6.        After allowing for increases in short-term investments pending their
use for project purposes, Bioktos financed, from internal sources, 71% of its
capital expenditure requirements in 1972, 84% in 1973 and 34% in 1974. Debt
service coverage was 8.7 times in 1972 falling to 6.0 times in 1974.
Financing Plan 1976-1980
7.        The following table shows Bioktos' estimated total funds require-
ments for the period of project construction (1976-1980) 1/ and the sources
from which they will be met. Neither Annex 22 nor this financing plan takes
account of the construction of the Vrutci dam, because this is to be the re-
sponsibility of the SWF.
1/   Project construction is estimated to be completed by the end of 1979
but Bank loan disbursements are anticipated to continue into 1980.

ANNEX 32
Page 4
8.        It is proposed that Din 130.7 million (US$7.3 million) of the Bank
loan be allocated to this project component, which would cover about 38.9%
of project costs. The remainder of Bioktos investment requirements would
be financed from sources within Yugoslavia.
9.        In the absence of significant loan finance from within Yugoslavia,
the Commune of Titovo Uzice has set out to marshall various sources of funds
for the project within its own jurisdiction. The General Assembly of the
Commune of Titovo Uzice has passed a series of resolutions on the project,
including the identification of various local sources of funds to be allocated
towards project construction costs. Some of these funds are available immedi-
ately but others will be built up from future contributions. They have been
allocated towards project costs by years on the basis of Bioktos' estimates.
The proposed funds are as follows:
Din (millions)
1.  Personal taxes                                      27.3
2.  Housing fund taxes                                 123.0
3.  Levies on business enterprises                      75.0
4.  Former Communal Investment Fund                     10.5
5.  Former Communal Housing Fund                        10.0
6.  Other                                                4.3
250.1
10.       After allowing for a Din 51.5 million contribution towards the con-
struction costs of the Vrutci dam (Annex 31) the remaining Din 198.6 million
is available for the investment program of Bioktos. In addition, arrangements
have been made for a loan of Din 8.0 million from the Belgrade Bank. System
extensions costing about Din 10 million are being constructed by individual
communities and will be handed over to Bioktos, on completion, for operation
and maintenance. Minor contributions are also expected from the Commune and
from business enterprises, mainly towards investment for services other than
water and wastewater.
11.       After allowing for debt service, compulsory investments and contri-
butions to the Collective Consumption Fund, internal funds are estimated to
finance Din 41.3 million (US$2.3 million) or about 9% of Bioktos total funds
requirements.
12.       The local loans of Din 65.2 million represent two separate loans,
one for Din 47.2 million (US$2.6 million) in 1978 and another for Din 18.0
million (US$1.0 million) in 1979. Both are from, as yet, unidentified sources
and could be followed by several others, as described below (para 21). The
major part of the first of the above loans conceptually represents short term
financing pending the availability of the local contributions described above.
If related only to project expenditures all but Din 18 million could be re-
paid out of such contributions in 1979 or 1980. However, Bioktos is expected
in 1979 to begin the construction of a wastewater treatment works, outside the



ANNEX 32
Page 5
project, estimated to cost Din 84.6 million (US$4.7 million). COnsequently,
the whole of the Din 47.2 million (US$2.6 million) loan must be rolled over
(i.e. treated as a longer term loan) with a further Din 18.0 million (US$1.0
million) raised in 1979. As explained below (para 21) other financing may
ultimately replace these projected local loans. In any event, Din 18.0
million of the first loan represents project financing still to be secured.
Tariffs
13.       On November 1, 1975 Bioktos increased its water tariffs to Din 1.50
per m3 (domestic) and Din 2.30 per m3 (commercial). Its wastewater tariffs,
introduced in January 1975, were expected to remain at Din 0.20 per m3 (domes-
tic) and Din 0.30 per m3 (commercial).
14.       Further large tariff increases will be necessary if Bioktos is to
meet operational requirements and ultimately to contribute towards its invest-
ment program. A proposed schedule of tariffs is indicated in Annex 24.
Selected estimates of tariffs, 1/ expressed both in current prices and in 1975
constant prices are as follows:
Water (Din per m3)   Wastewater (Din per m3)
Domestic  Commercial   Domestic   Commercial
Current Prices
1975                             1.50         2.30         0.20         0.30
1980                             9.25        14.20         1.25         1.85
1984                            10.60        16.30         1.65         2.40
1975 Constant Prices 1/
1975                             1.50         2.30         0.20         0.30
1980                             5.55         8.52         0.75         1.11
1984                             4.85         7.45         0.75         1.09
15.       For water, a tariff increase of 50% is proposed from July 1, 1976
with a further increase of 50% from July 1, 1977.  Annual increases of 40% are
proposed in each of the following three years until 1980, bringing tariffs to
about 6.2 times their present levels (about 3.7 times in 1975 constant prices).
Thereafter until 1984, tariffs, have been assumed to increase by 3.5% per
annum, half the estimated inflation rate.
1/   Combined water and wastewater tariffs in 1980 would be equivalent (in
January 1976 constant prices) to US$0.33 per m3 (domestic) and UTSS0.50
per m3 (commercial). Comparable figures for minimum proposed 1980
tariffs in Sarajevo (at 1976 prices) would be US$0.22 per m3 (domestic)
and US$0.43 per m3 (commercial). A Washington area utility (WSSC) cur-
rently charges a combined domestic tariff of US$0.29 per m3, and in
Tunisia, the present tariff for water supply only is US$0.15 per m3.



ANNEX 32
Page 6
16.       Similar tariff increases are proposed for wastewater services until
1980. Thereafter annual increases of 7% are assumed until 1984, to keep pace
with inflation. By 1984 wastewater tariffs will be about 8.3 times their pre-
sent low levels (about 3.7 times in 1975 constant prices). Although the
increases for wastewater tariffs have been assumed as broadly the same as for
water in the period 1976-1980, Bioktos may wish to adjust the differentials to
meet changing circumstances.
17.       On the water service, a rate of return of about 6.6% will be earned
by 1979, falling to about 3.6% in 1980, and thereafter remaining at or about
7% until 1984. On the wastewater service, rates of return will fall from 4.4%
in 1977 to below 1% after 1981, reflecting tariffs covering only operating
costs and depreciation (in 1975 and 1976, low rate bases give exceptionally
large rates of return). For the water and wastewater services together, a
rate of return of about 3.4% will be earned by 1980 and 4.1% by 1984.
18.       Bioktos' present commercial tariff is about 1.5 times its domestic
tariff, on equity, rather than economic grounds. This differential between
commercial and domestic tariff is a common practice in Yugoslavia as elsewhere.
The proposed future tariffs assume that these differentials are retained.  How-
ever, the financial forecasts (Annex 22) indicate what would be an average
tariff for each year, with the differentials eliminated.
19.       The rates of return proposed are reasonable, in view of the fact that
they are calculated on the basis of revalued net fixed assets (Annex 23). Fur-
thermore, well over half the capital finance for the project will have been
provided in advance by the town's population at some sacrifice, by way of in-
creased communal taxation and contributions from personal earnings and earnings
of enterprises. It is expected that such contributions will need to continue,
but at a reducing level, to finance Bioktos' further development program, in-
cluding wastewater treatment facilities.
Future Performance
20.       Bioktos' main concern is to raise adequate capital finance for its
ongoing investment program, of which the project forms the most significant
part. After 1980 it is conceivable that Bioktos could become increasingly
self-sufficient, since further massive investment is unlikely in the years
immediately following the project. Whether such a situation will materialize
depends upon the outcome of a number of uncertainties which cannot be resolved
at this time. These include the nature and timing of future investments but,
more significantly, the source and terms of external finance needed, in addi-
tion to that already committed for the project. The most likely source of
external finance, if any, would be additional contributions from compulsory
local savings, as at present. However, for illustrative purposes, on a more
conservative basis, Bioktos is assumed to raise additional capital finance
from 1980 onwards by a program of annual borrowing, for all its funds require-
ments not met internally, with interest at 10% and repayment over 15 years.



ANNEX 32
Page 7
21.       Because of the projected gradual increase in tariffs from the
present date until 1980, and because of the very large construction expendi-
tures predicted during the same period, the contribution for internal funds
towards construction costs is expected to be no more than about 10%. How-
ever, on the basis of the above assumptions, Bioktos, can be expected to
meet from internal sources 10% of its investment requirements in 1981, and
between 40% and 50% in following years. Since internally generated funds
are significantly influenced by debt charges and because of the uncertainty
of the terms and availability of future capital sources, it is conceivable
that Bioktos may become, and indeed may need to remain, largely financially
self-sufficient, financing a significant capital expenditures beyond 1980
from internal sources. It is also possible that tariffs may not need to be
increased significantly from 1980. With inflation, this would mean a reduc-
tion in 1975 constant prices which would be consistent with the reduced
long-run marginal cost as explained in Annex 30.
22.       In 1980 the financial statements show negative transfers to the
business fund, reflecting the large increment in operating costs as the
project comes into operation. The sum involved is a mere 1.5% of revenues and
is not, therefore, material, particularly in view of the uncertainty about the
allocation of reservoir costs and about the terms of financing for the waste-
water treatment works.

MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
VODOVOD - CACAK WATER AND WASTEWATER ENTERPRISE
Financial Situation
WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS
A.   Past and Present Financial Situation
1.        A meaningful review of Vodovod's past performance and present posi-
ton is constrained by the lack of adequate accounting information to determine
the costs of network construction work carried out by force account, as ex-
plained in Annex 19. Such construction has been assertedly financed in shares
of approximately one-third each by the Commune of Cacak, by consumer contribu-
tions and by internal funds of Vodovod. It is apparent from discussions with
Vodovod staff that the engineering estimates include a provision for adminis-
trative overheads but it is not possible to discern whether this includes a
profit element. In the absence of adequate cost information, Vodovod's past
and esimated future operating expenses have been adjusted by the deduction of
total engineering estimates as costs of network construction.
2.        Despite the fluctuating level of network construction activity from
year to year, overall staff costs and other expenses do not change so abruptly.
This is because, during slack construction periods, more staff and resources are
diverted to routine (or catch-up) operation and maintenance. Consequently, the
relatively high overall rates of return for 1973 and 1974 are not as meaningful
as where all resources are employed solely for operation and maintenance.
3.        A consequence of this situation, has been an apparent disproportionate
increase in operating expenses during 1975, when network construction was esti-
mated to be about 25% less than in the previous two years. Vodovod appears,
therefore, to have relied over-much on receipts from network construction in-
stead of raising additional revenues from increasing tariffs, a practice no
doubt encouraged by communal and governmental restrictions on price increases.
Tariffs were increased by about 16% from July 1, 1975, which was expected to
result in a small increase in retained earnings. However it was estimated that
Vodovod needed to raise short-term bank finance to cover a cash shortage of
the order of Din 2 million. During 1975, internal funds were expected to fi-
nance only about 20% of network construction costs.



ANNEX 33
Page 2
4.        From 1972 to 1975 there was an estimated 50% increase in domestic
water sales and a 67% increase for commercial and industrial water. Revenues
from water sales and wastewater charges during the same period are estimated
to have increased by about 3.3 times.
5.        Vodovod has raised several loans during the past 3 years, but its
debt/equity ratio is predicted at only 13:87 by the end of 1975, with debt
service coverage exceeding 4.0 times during that year. There were 4 separate
loans outstanding at the end of 1974 amounting to Din. 7.2 million with an
average interest rate of about 4.75% and an average repayment period of just
under 12 years.
6.        Receivables have, since 1972, fluctuated around 3 months' sales and
at the end of 1975 was about 3-1/2 months' sales. Vodovod is understood to
practice fairly rigorous cut-off procedures on overdue accounts.
B. Financing Plan
7.        The following table shows Vodovod's estimated total funds require-
ments for the period of project construction (1976-1980) 1/ and the sources
from which they will be met. Neither Annex 25 nor this financing plan takes
account of stormwater activities, which will be dealt with separately.
1/   Project construction is estimated to be completed by the end of 1979
but Bank loan disbursements are anticipated to continue into 1980.

ANNEX 33
Page 4
8.        It is proposed that Din 83.7 million (US$4.7 million) of the Bank
loan be allocated to this project component, which would cover about 38.9% of
project costs. The remainder of Vodovod's investment requirements would be
financed from sources within Yugoslavia.
9.        In the absence of significant loan finance from within Yugoslavia
and in anticipation of the intention (now postponed) to participate in the
financing of the Semedraz Dam and to construct the related transmission and
treatment facilities, the citizens of Cacak, in a referendumn in 1973, voted
to establish a "Semedraz Fund" to be financed by voluntary deductions from
personal incomes and by contributions from business enterprises. Latest esti-
mates by the Commune of Cacak indicate that Din. 124.6 million (US$6.9 million)
would be available from this fund to finance the project.
10.       In adition to the Semedraz Fund, the Commune operates a more general
development fund, not exclusively for water services. Based on estimates of
the Commune, and after allowing for contributions towards the stormwater system,
it is anticipated that Din. 13.2 million (US$0.7 million) would be available
for the water and wastewater components of the project.
11.       According to Vodovod, it is not intended to require consumer contri-
butions towards network construction under the project. None have, therefore,
been allowed for during the years 1976-1979. However, it seems inconsistent
with previous practice, and with the assumed resumption of contributions in
1980, not to require them during the project construction period.  Consumer
contributions (Din. 5.3 million) and direct contributions from the Commune
(Din. 10.6 million) are based on the assumption that network construction in
1980 (after the project) will be financed broadly as at present, with about 25%
participation by consumer contributions and about 50% from the Commune.
12.       After allowing for debt service, compulsory investments and contribu-
tions to the Collective Consumption Fund, internal funds are estimated to fi-
nance Din. 77.0 million or about 23% of Vodovods total funds requirements.
13.       After completion of the project, Vodovod will still have a heavy
investment program to finance, including a wastewater treatment works to be
constructed during the years 1979-1981. The local loan of Din. 25 million is
the first of several loans, from as yet unidentified sources, which may be
needed to finance the major proportion of Vodovod's post-project investments
if other finance is not available.
C. Tariffs
14.       In July 1975, Vodovod raised its water tariffs by about 16% to
Din 1.4 per m3 (domestic) and Din 3.35 per m3 (commercial). Wastewater tariffs
were raised to Din 0.35 per m3 (dorestic) aLnd Dli. 0.7o per m3 (commercial).
Further increases will be necessary in the future, if Vodovod is to meet opera-
rlonal requirements, earn a reasonable rate of return and contribute towards
its investment program.



ANNEX 33
Page 5
15.       A proposed schedule of tariffs is indicated in Annex 27.  Selected
estimates of tariffs, expressed both in current prices, and in 1975 constant
prices are as follows:
Water (Din per m3)      Wastewater (Din per m3)
Domestic    Commercial   Domestic    Commercial
Current Prices
1975                         1.41           3.35        0.35          0.70
1980                         3.35           8.00        0.85          1.65
1984                         5.90           13.95       1.45          2.90
1975 Constant Prices I/
1975                        1.41            3.35       0.35          0.70
1980                        2.00           4.73        0.51          0.98
1984                        2.72           6.46        0.67          1.33
16.       Tariff increases of 20% annually are proposed from July 1, 1976 until
July 1, 1979.  Increases of about 15% per annum will be necessary thereafter
until the Semedraz Dam is assumed to come into operation in 1984. By 1980,
tariffs are estimated to be about 2.5 times their present levels (an increase
of about 45% in 1975 constant prices) and by 1984, about 4 times present
levels (about double in 1975 constant prices).
17.       Wastewater tariff increases are proposed of the same magnitude as
those for water. It should be recognized, however, that Vodovod might wish
to adjust the differentials between the two services to meet changing circum-
stances.
18.       On the basis of present estimates, the proposed tariffs would allow
for water operations to earn rates of return on revalued net fixed assets in
operation rising from 5.3% in 1976 to 9.2% in 1980. Rates of return would rise
further to 12.6% by 1982, falling to 5.6% in 1984 during the assumed first year
of operation of the Semedraz Dam. Wastewater tariffs will enable Vodovod to
cover all expenses of operation, maintenance and depreciation for the waste-
water service.
1/   Combined water and wastewater tariffs in 1980 would be equivalent (in
January 1976 constant prices to (US$0.13 per m3 (domestic) and US$0.30
per m3 (commercial). Comparable figures for minimum proposed 1980
tariffs in Sarajevo (at 1976 prices) would be US$0.22 per m3 (domestic)
and US$0.43 per m3 (commercial). A Washington area utility (WSSC) cur-
rently charges a combined domestic tariff of US$0.29 per m3, and in
Tunisia, the present tariff for water supply only is US$0.15 per m3.



ANNEX 33
Page 6
19.       When Vodovod's total operations are considered, the combined effect
of the various tariffs will be to permit a rate of return on revalued net
fixed assets rising to exceed 5% by 1979 and to exceed 6% from 1980 to 1983.
In 1984 the return would fall to about 4%.
20.       Vodovod's present commercial tariff is about 2-1/2 times its domes-
tic tariff. For wastewater, the commercial tariff is twice the domestic tariff.
Whilst this may be appropriate on grounds of equity apparent to either the
Commune or to Vodovod, there is not necessarily any substantial economic justi-
fication for the differential. However, this is a common practice in Yugoslavia,
as elsewhere. Consequently, proposed future tariffs assume that the differen-
tials will remain as they are. However, the financial forecasts (Annex 25)
indicate what would be an average common tariff for each year with the differ-
entials between domestic and commercial tariffs eliminated.
21.       The rates of return proposed are reasonable, in view of the fact
that they are calculated on the basis of revalued net fixed assets (Annex 26).
Furthermore, apart from the Bank loan, all other capital finance for the proj-
ect will have been provided in advance by the town's population at some sacri-
fice, by way of increased communal taxation, contributions to the Semedraz Fund
and contributions to other communal development funds. It is expected that
such contributions and taxes will need to continue beyond the period of project
construction so as to assist in financing Vodovod's further development program,
including wastewater treatment facilities and aditional water supply sources in-
cluding, possibly, the Semedraz Dam.
D. Further Performance
22.       Vodovod's main concern is now, and will continue to be in the future,
that of raising adequate capital finance for its ongoing investment program.
Significant local loan finance seems unlikely and resort will probably continue
to be had to the forms of compulsory saving already referred to. For the period
of project construction, adequate funds are expected to be available to cover
Vodovod's requirements, as indicated in paragraph 7. However, there are no in-
dications of possible sources, terms and amounts of funds likely to become avail-
able for Vodovod's investment program after the project. 1/ Although compulsory
local savings continue to be the most likely possibility, regard must be paid
to the fact that, in the books of Vodovod, such funds would probably be interest-
free and non-returnable. Consequently, for illustrative purposes, Vodovod is
1/   SWF, not Vodovod, is assumed to be responsible for the construction of
the Semedraz dam (i.e. similar arrangements to Vrutci dam at Titovo-Uzice).
Vodovod's funds requirements therefore relate to associated construction
works (e.g. treatment and transmission).



ANNEX 33
Page 7
assumed to raise capital finance from 1980 onwards by a program of annual borrow-
ing, for all its funds requirements not met internally, with interest at 10% p.a.
and repayment over 15 years, thus presenting a more conservative view of its
future finances.
23.       Given these assumptions, Vodovod can be expected to meet from internal
sources 17% of its investment requirements in 1978, and 30% or more in 1979,
1980 and 1981. During the assumed construction period for the treatment and
transmission facilities for the Semedraz dam (1982 and 1983) the contributions
would fall to 22% in 1982 and 19% in 1983, rising again to 55% in 1984. Since
internally generated funds are significantly influenced by debt charges and
since debt finance on such a scale is improbable, actual performance is likely
to be different from that indicated. Much will depend upon the formulation of
Vodovod's investment program beyond the project period. This cannot be accu-
rately determined at this time because it will depend significantly upon the
results of the studies of Cacak's potential water demands and sources of
supply, as outlined in Annex 15. Decisions as to the timing of developments
following this study will be influenced by the availability of finance. The
above tariff proposals should, however, give Vodovod some flexibility of
choice, because they will, to some extent, reduce dependence upon outside fi-
nancing of uncertain availability and terms.
STORMWATER SYSTEM
E. General
24.       The above financing plan and related discussion of Vodovod's activi-
ties pays no regard to the Cacak stormwater system. This system has, until
now, been constructed, operated and maintained by another communal enterprise
and financed from general communal taxation. No details of present finances
are available. However, in the near future, responsibility for the service is
to be taken over by Vodovod. The service will continue to be financed from
communal sources and not by way of user charges. Vodovod would be required to
keep the accounts of the stormwater service separate from those of water and
wastewater activities.
25.       The following table gives a forecast of the estimated funds require-
ments for the construction phase of this project component, showing the sources
from which they are expected to be met:

to be financed by the Communal Development Fund. General communal revenues
are expected to finance interest charges, both during and following construc-
tion, to the extent not covered by the proposed IBRD loan. The Commune is
also expected to finance amortization payments, together with operation,
maintenance and administration costs, all of which would be reimbursed to
Vodovod on the basis of ascertained costs.

MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Milosevac Irrigation Pilot Project
A.   Background
1.        Irrigation is frequently considered as a cure-all for increasing
agricultural production in the lower valleys of the Morava River and its
main tributaries. The fluctuation in yields of the main field crops with
wet and dry summers, as well as the successful cultivation of high priced
vegetables in those scattered locations where irrigation is practised, have
impressed upon the farmers the beneficial effects of supplemental water for
improved crop growth. As a result, four large-scale irrigation projects
were constructed in Serbia with the purpose of providing supplemental irri-
gation for the typical existing cropping pattern in which maize and wheat
predominate. Under the prevailing climatic conditions, incremental yields
of these crops with irrigation are such (for maize US$200/ha and for wheat
US$208/ha) that a minimum irrigation investment of US$1,500/ha plus US$175/
ha year of operating cost cannot be justified.
2.        Thinking about irrigation was until now focused on relatively
large-scale schemes with high investments in infrastructure, long conveyance
systems running parallel to the river and thus irrigating only narrow strips
of land. The Cacak scheme is a case in point: it consists of a diversion
weir with a main canal to serve 10,000 ha and a distribution system for
5,000 ha, of which only 3,100 ha can be irrigated since the remaining 1,900
ha require levelling or sprinkling and farmers have not equipped their farms
for either. Full irrigation investment costs were originally to be recovered
from farmers over a ten year period, which has led in the early years, to a
large amount of default. Payment was thereafter required from the farmer re-
questing water. Depending on rainfall, the irrigation demand varies widely
and in order to recover costs, the actual payment has increased to over
US$25/ha per single irrigation, which is more than the grain crops can carry.
The dimension of the system - designed for cereals - is inadequate to convey
enough water for intensive vegetable production.
3.        There are several aspects of the irrigation problem for which new
approaches have to be developed:
(i) Irrigation development has to be low cost so that enough
incentive is left for farmers to irrigate.
(ii) A small-scale and flexible approach is required to allow
area development in line with the farmers' demand for



ANNEX 34
Page 2
water. Although cereals would remain included in the ro-
tation, the water would be mainly for intensive vegetable
production development, thus maximizing incremental bene-
fits.
(iii) Credit should be accessible to farmers (mainly groups of
farmers) so that they can finance irrigation equipment and
on-farm development and repayment should be in line with
farmers' increased net earnings from irrigation.
(iv) Special organizational arrangements would have to be devised
to operate these systems.
(v) Technical assistance would have to be provided to farmers
to support intensification of vegetable production.
4.        It appears that pump-lift from wells, or from the river if nearby,
would ideally fit this approach to irrigation development. A pioneer effort
is recommended in developing pump-lift by groups of farmers for irrigation
of vegetable crops along the river valleys wherever aquifers or river flow
will allow such development. There is no experience in Yugoslavia of pump-
lift irrigation by groups of farmers, although many farmers individually own
small pumps and have experience of pumping directly from the river, or from
shallow wells where the water table is directly connected to the river. The
approach would organize and extend the irrigation development which is actu-
ally taking place in a patchy manner and on a limited scale.
5.        Under the economic system prevailing in Yugoslavia, all benefi-
ciaries of investment for productive purposes have to repay full costs. The
funds for productive investments are normally supplied by the banking system.
This has also been applied to irrigatin and has been to a large extent the
cause of failure of modern irrigation systems in Yugoslavia. In the Cacak
case, the farmers were asked to repay all costs, including interest, in ten
years. There is increasing realization in Yugoslavia that there can be no
development of irrigation under these conditions. Even if the beneficiaries
are not to be subsidized, a repayment period in line with repayment capacity
of the farmers (and with the working life of the systems) is required, if
water is to be effectively utilized by them. In the densely populated less
developed parts of the Morava, the incremental income deriving from irriga-
tion, once operating costs are deducted, will be limited by the size of
holdings and the final income improvement for the farmer family would be
small. This should confirm that only high value crops would be meaningful
for development and they should be labor-intensive crops, in which private
farmers are at an advantage. Intensive vegetables and horticulture crops
are proposed for the pilot irrigation projects.



ANNEX 34

6.        The Serbian Republic is subsidizing banks wherever irrigation cred-
it to farm enterprises (social sector) is concerned. The subsidy amounts to
subtracting 3% from the actual interest rate and an additional 3% if the bank
agrees to give long-term repayment period for such credits (banks have so far
refused to have repayment periods of more than 10 years). On the other hand,
the Government also gives the farm enterprises themselves a subsidy of 3%.
Thus, in the case of an enterprise borrowing money for irrigation, when the
market rate is 10%, and repayment regarded as "long-term" the bank would re-
ceive a direct subsidy of 6% from the Republic. The enterprise would pay 4%
but would be reimbursed 3% giving an effective rate of only 1%. The avail-
ability of these facilities applies only to organized farming, i.e. the social
sector. A draft law under consideration would lead to considering spontaneous
groups of farmers formed for irrigation purposes as part of the social sector,
in which case these groups would also benefit from the subsidy. Although the
general atmosphere for agricultural development is tending to become more
favorable for small farmer development, it should be recognized that the com-
mercial banks are still the decision-makers in giving credit for irrigation
development. Unless pressure is put on banks to extend credit to small farmer
groups, it is not likely to occur spontaneously, as the banks' tendency will
be to prefer large loans and well-known and more reliable customers. Reduc-
tions in interest rates would further reduce incentives to make credit avail-
able to small farmers, as the cost of administering such credits would be
quite high compared to present dealings with such large entities as kombinats
and production cooperatives. The Government should make sure that the pilot
schemes proposal is given a fair chance to succeed, by making credit avail-
able to small farmers' groups who would carry out such a development.
B.   Project Description
7.        The village of Milosevac was selected as one of the two locations
for pilot irrigation schemes. The villagers have expressed an interest in
starting with irrigation, but their general expectation still goes in the
direction of improving yields of present field crops. The village offers
good prospects for the introduction of new techniques: it has an active co-
operative which dates back to 1902 and which has a permanent staff of one
university level agronomist, two agronomical technicians and two veterina-
rians. The village carried out a land consolidation program, reducing the
average number of parcels per farm from 13 to 5. Two pilot projects of 200
ha (net) each are proposed.
8.        Milosevac is located in the Commune of Velika Plana, in the lower
Velika Morava valley (see Map 11603). It has a population of 4,387, the aver-
age number per family is 4, the number of persons active in agriculture is
2,491 male, and 1,366 female. Salaried persons number 98. There is virtually
no unemployment in the area.



ANNEX 34

9.        Land ownership distribution in Milosevac is as follows:
Size of Farm (ha)                         % of Owners (households)
0 -  0.1                                         6
0.1 -  1.0                                        17
1.0 -  3.0                                        41
3.1 -  5.0                                        25
5.1 - 10.0                                        11
The average farm size is about 3 ha.
10.       Net irrigation requirements for proposed crops are indicated in
Annex 34, Table 1. They are based on plant water demands computed by the
Blaney and Criddle method, from which effective rainfall and available stored
soil moisture have been subtracted. Average annual net irrigation require-
ment amounts to 619,000 m3 per pilot unit of 200 ha. Peak net water require-
ment for the month of July, with the once in five years drought, would be
243,450 m3 in 31 days for 200 ha. With an overall efficiency of 73% and 20
hours of operation per day, this would correspond to a peak demand of 149
1/sec.
11.       The soils of the area consist of Class I fertile yellow brown clay
loams 6 to 11 m deep, overlying a gravel and sand aquifer 8 to 11 m thick.
Underneath the aquifer yellow loams are found. Permeability of the aquifer
is 3 to 4 x 10-1 cm/sec and for the upper and lower layers 1 x 10-5 to
1 x 10-6 cm/sec. Groundwater level is from 4 to 10 m below the surface, its
elevation depending on the Morava river water level. Pump tests indicate a
maximum yield from 35 to 40 1/sec.
12.       Per pilot area of 200 ha, the project would provide water supply
from six 20 m deep wells, each with a capacity of 25 1/sec. They would pump
into an underground loop of asbestos cement pipe (150 to 300 m diameter) with
a number of hydrants. Water would be supplied through meters into moveable
aluminum lines. Sprinkler pattern would be 12 x 18 m, the intensity 7.3 mm/
hr. Construction of the systems could be achieved in one year. Estimated
costs are indicated in Table 2.
C.   Prospects and Organization
13.       Present and two new proposed cropping patterns with present and ex-
pected yields under irrigation are indicated in Table 3. One proposed crop-
ping pattern would provide for intensive fodder production for livestock, with
some vegetable growing. Its rate of return would be 4.0%. The other crop-
ping pattern would emphasize vegetable growing next to field crops. Its rate
of return would be 22.8% and is therefore preferred. Cost streams for the two



ANNEX 34
Page 5
proposed patterns are indicated in Table 4. The proposed second cropping pat-
tern is still conservative; it is expected that the shift from cereals to
vegetables and fruits will be larger, making more profitable use of proposed
investments. The Cooperative in Milosevac would assist in marketing the pro-
duce. A farm cash flow is indicated in Annex 34, Table 5 assuming 38% Bank
financing.
14.       Organization and maintenance of the pilot schemes and securing of
commercial loans should be entrusted to the cooperative as the only organiza-
tion capable of handling such an operation. Although cheaper operating cost
could be achieved if farmers themselves would operate the system, they will be
too busy converting to new, more demanding crops and techniques. Therefore,
the cooperative will have to engage new personnel listed on Table 6. This per-
sonnel requirement appears overstaffed and it would be possible to achieve
advantages of scale enlargement when the pilot schemes prove successful.
D.   Monitoring Requirement
15.       It will be necessary to monitor the pilot schemes to obtain actual
information on economic performance over a number of years to serve similar
development where natural physical circumstances would allow the installation
of cheap irrigation systems. The Department of Agriculture would organize the
monitoring program for a five-year period after first irrigation, at which
time full development is expected. Annual reports would show the change in
cropping pattern and farm revenues. Accompanying supporting services would
assist the cooperative in the start-up of the system, in providing farmers
with extension services and in checking groundwater movement in the project
area throughout the year twice a month. Detailed monitoring arrangements
will be developed during the course of project implementation.

MORAVA REGION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Aleksinac Irrigation Pilot Project
1.        Aleksinac was selected as the location of a second pilot irrigation
project of 200 ha net because farmers practice primitive irrigation growing
vegetables in small basins supplied by very small pumps via garden hoses and
because the nearby Aleksinac Agrokombinat is the main support for supplying in-
puts and for purchasing the produce from individual small farmers. The pilot
area is located in the communities of Aleksinac commune (see Map 11603).
2.        Many of the holdings are too small to provide a full-time income and
the owners are part-time employed in the local industry. Ownership distribu-
tion in the selected area is as follows:
% of Owners (households)
Size of Farm (ha)                          Aleksinac        Boboviste
0 -  0.10                                45%               3%
0.11 -  1.0                                  21%             16%
1.1  -  3.0                                  29%             46%
3.1  - 10.0                                   5%             35%
3.        Soils are Class I fertile loams, somewhat lighter in texture than
those in Milosevac. An aquifer does exist but no pumping tests are available.
The cost estimate therefore is based on water pumping from the river, but at
the same time groundwater investigations are included during the first year.
If they are successful, the investment may be reduced somewhat by changing
from river to groundwater supply. For the rest, the same basic irrigation
system is proposed as for Milosevac. The cost estimate is indicated in Annex
34, Table 2. In view of the existing vegetable production only intensified
vegetable production could provide the incremental yields necessary to justify
the investment. A land consolidation will be carried out on the selected 200
ha pilot area to facilitate operation and layout of the irrigation system.
Cost streams are indicated in Annex 34, Table 4 and the expected rate of
return is 17.4%. Annex 35, Table 1 shows an estimate of the farm cash flow
assuming 38% financing by the World Bank.
4.        Operation and maintenance of the irrigation system would be en-
trusted to the Aleksinac Agrokombinat, which would have to engage the addi-
tional staff indicated in Annex 34, Table 5. Monitoring requirements would
be similar to those for the Milosevac schemes.
