DEFINITIONS
Crude Birth Rate                   Number of live births per year per 1,000
population.
Crude Death Rate                   Number of deaths per year per 1,000
population.
Rate of Natural Increase           Difference between crude birth and crude
death rates; usually expressed as a
percentage.

attributable to pregnancy, childbirth, or
its complications (i.e. within six weeks
following childbirth).
Life Expectancy                    Average number of years a child born in a
given year can expect to live if mortality
rates for each age/sex group remain the
same.
Contraceptive Prevalence Rate   The percentage of married women in the
reproductive ages who are using a modern
method of contraception at any given point
in time.

This report is the result of a joint appraisal mission that
visited Nairobi in October/November 1980. The mission consisted of
Mr. H. Diaz, World Bank, Chief of Mission; Messrs. E. Pratt, G. Clarkson,
H. Franckson, D. Radel, and B. Jenny (Consultant) World Bank; Mr. E.
Lauridsen, DANIDA; Mr. S. Silberstein, USAID; Mr. C. Walker, UK-ODA;
Mr. L. Remstrand (Consultant) SIDA; and Ms. Jane Bunnag (Consultant)
UNFPA. Mr. H. W. Messenger, Division Chief, Population, Health and
Nutrition Projects Department, World Bank, joined the mission for the final
week of its stay.






I. POPULATION, HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
A. Introduction
1.01       The population of Kenya was close to 16 million in mid-1980.  Its
current natural rate of increase--3.9% per annum--is the highest in the
world as well as the highest ever recorded for any country. Fertility
appears to have increased since the 1950s.  Health has improved remarkably
in the last three decades, as reflected by sharp declines in the crude
death rate and infant mortality and a correspondent sharp increase in life
expectancy. The combination of rising fertility and falling mortality has
resulted in explosive population growth. Because GDP increased at an
average annual rate of 6.6% in real terms over the period 1964-73, the
standard of living rose. The growth of GDP has slowed down since 1973,
however, and in the last two years it has grown more slowly than
population.
B. Population Size and Growth Rate
1.02       Table 1 below presents estimates of the crude birth rate, crude
death rate and rate of natural increase in Kenya since the late 1940s.  The
rates of natural increase in Table I are roughly equal to population growth
rates, since immigration and emigration have been negligible. The main
reason for the rising rate of population increase is the steep decline in
the death rate. The crude birth rate has increased only slightly since
1948.

C. Population Distribution and Density
1.03      Kenya is divided into eight provinces and 41 districts.  The
density of population by province according to the 1979 census is given in
Table 2 below.

1.04      Before colonization there were no towns in Kenya except the
coastal ports, and the great majority of Kenyans still live :in rural areas
(about 86% in 1979). The distribution of population chiefly reflects rain-
fall and soil fertility. There are three main concentrations of popula-
tion: one in the west, near Lake Victoria; another in the center, around
Nairobi; and a third, on the east coast (See Map IBRD 13969).
D. Fertility
1.05      Fertility in Kenya is high, was high in the past and appears to
be increasing. It is estimated that at the time of the 1948 census, the
total fertility rate was between 6.0 and 7.0.  The censuses of 1962 and
1969 indicate total fertility rates of 6.8 and 7.6 respectively.  The Kenya
World Fertility Survey indicated a total fertility rate of 8.1 for 1977-78,
higher than in any other country.
1.06      The Kenya World Fertility Survey also revealed wide differences
in fertility between urban and rural areas. Women in the two main metro-
politan areas, Nairobi and Mombasa, have a total fertility rate 2.5 lower
than that of rural women, while the total fertility of the non-metropolitan
urban sector is intermediate.
1.07      The relationship between education and total fertility is non-
linear. Women with one to four years of schooling are the most fertile,
those with no formal education slightly less fertile, while women with five
or more years of education are appreciably less fertile. Postponement of
marriage is the chief cause of the lower fertility of better educated
women.
1.08      Except in the case of Coast Province and the Mijilkenda tribe,
where fertility is relatively low, differences of fertility appear to be
the result of the "modernizing" influences of education and urbanization,
rather than cultural and behavioral differences due to tribal affiliation.

E. Mortality
1.09      Table 3 below shows the trends in the Crude Death Rate, the
Infant Mortality Rate, and Life Expectancy. Life expectancy has risen from
about 44 years in 1962 to about 53 years in 1979. Current life expectancy
estimates are 61 years for the world as a whole; 72 years for developed
countries; 57 years for less developed countries; and 49 years for Africa.

1979                 14                           87                   53
Source:  For 1948, 1962 and 1969, Population Censuses.  For 1979, CDR, from
1979 Population Census; Life Expectancy from U.S. Bureau of the
Census estimates; and IMR as estimated by Frank Mott from KWFS.
1.10      The dramatic fall in infant mortality shown in Table 3 leaves the
rate still more than four times higher than the average (20) for developed
countries, but well below the average for developing countries (110). In
Africa, Kenya is one of only eight countries (out of a total of 52) with an
infant mortality rate below 100. The decline in infant mortality reflects
the rise in the standard of living and the improvement in maternal and
child health (MCH) services.
F. Morbidity
1.11      Information on health status in Kenya is limited.  Table 4 below
presents countrywide data on the number and distribution of outpatient
cases at District Hospital level and below in 1978.

1.12      The prevalence of infection and infestation reflects t'he wide-
spread poverty in Kenya. Malaria, though absent at higher elevations, con-
tinues to be an important cause of morbidity and death.  While the table
does not show age breakdown for the different types of diseases, most of
the cases of respiratory infection, diarrhea and infestation are among
infants and young children.
G. Nutrition
1.13      A nutritional survey conducted by the Central Bureau of:
Statistics in 1977 indicates that, while the incidence of severe protein
energy malnutrition is rather low in Kenya, mild and moderate protein
energy malnutrition affects about a third of rural children.
1.14      There is also some evidence of malnutrition in adults.  A survey
conducted in 1977 concluded that 38% of road workers in Nyeri District
(Central Province) and 41% in Kwale District (Coast Province) had a weight-
for-height below 85% of internationally accepted standards.
H. Population Projections
1.15      It is difficult to project Kenya's future population.  It is to
be expected that the increase of fertility that has been proceeding for at
least twenty years (see para. 1.05) will in due course cease (if it has not
already done so), if for no other reason than because the biological limit
has been reached. A period of several years of constant fertility would
then probably follow, and finally the total fertility rate would start
falling as the result of such modernizing influences as urbanization,
education, and the improved status of women. This pattern has been
observed in other countries. However, the precise timing of these changes
cannot be predicted accurately.
1.16      For illustrative purposes, however, Table 5 below presents a
possible path of Kenya's population through the year 2000. This projection
assumes that a net reproduction rate equal to one (replacement level) would
be achieved by 2045, so that the population would finally stabilize at
about 108 million by 2150, when the average density would be 190 persons
per Km2.

1.17      The projection in Table 5 assumes that the total fertility rate
will decline slightly between 1980 and 1985, and thereafter more rapidly.



-5-
The projection assumes a very considerable expansion of the family planning
program. According to the Kenya World Fertility Survey, the Contraceptive
Use Rate-i.e., the percentage of currently married women in reproductive
ages using a modern method of contraception--was about 5% in 1977-78. A
CBR of 40 per thousand by the year 2000, as assumed in the above projec-
tion, would require a Contraceptive Use Rate of about 35%. Since the
number of eligible women in 2000 would be about twice as large as in 1980,
the number of contraceptive users in 2000 would therefore have to be about
fourteen times larger. Increases in the average age at marriage and in in-
duced abortion would mean that a smaller increase in the number of contra-
ceptive users would suffice. These are quite considerable behavioral
changes in a short period of time. Unless vigorously pursued by the nation
as a whole, they are unlikely to materialize.
I. Population Growth and Socio-Economic Developmentl/
1.18      The present very rapid population growth retards Kenya-s socio-
economic development in three main ways:
(i) By increasing pressure on land and other natural resources, and
thus tending to reduce output per capita;
(ii) By increasing unemployment; and
(iii) By requiring a greater proportion of public expenditure to be
devoted to meeting basic human needs.
1.19      Although Kenya is a large country, more than 80% of cultivable
land has a very limited potential on the basis of present technology. In
some areas, landlessness has emerged as a significant phenomenon; one study
estimates that 11% of rural households are landless. Attempts have also
been made to cultivate marginal lands without adequate safeguards, with the
consequences of degradation of soils and deforestation.
1.20      If fertility remained constant, the number of workers would rise
from 4.6 million in 1970 to 8.5 million in 1990 and to 12 million in 2000.
Modern sector employment absorbed only 17% of the total labor force in
1976; the rest worked in traditional agriculture and in the informal
sector. Roughly 30% of the total number of households in 1974 had incomes
which made them absolutely poor. If the Kenyan economy could not provide
gainful employment for all its workers during the past decade, when GDP was
growing at about 6.5% per annum, acceleration in the expansion of the labor
force (which would occur if fertility does not decline) is likely to
complicate the problem still further, especially since GDP is expected to
grow at only 4-5% per annum throughout the 1980s. Even with the declining
fertility assumptions of Table 5, the annual rate of growth of the labor
force would rise to about 4% in 1990-95 but it would then start to fall,
reaching about 3.6% in 1995-2000.
1.21      A third important consequence of rapid population growth is the
increased public expenditure required to meet basic needs for education,
health, water and housing. Altogether, government outlays on all these
services amounted to KL54 million (1970 prices) per year on the average
during 1970-75, or about 30% of total budget expenditures. It is estimated
that to provide these services for all by the year 2000, annual government
expenditure for these purposes would have to increase to about KL225

Kenya". Report No. 2775-KE, World Bank, 1980.



-6-
million (1970 prices) during 1995-2000, if fertility remains at its present
level. On the fertility assumptions of Table 5, the comparable figure
would be about KL187 million (1970 prices) per year, or aboul: 83% of the
expenditure if fertility remained unchanged. In either case,, these expen-
ditures would constitute a formidable budgetary burden, and :Lt is most
unlikely that the goal of providing basic needs services for all by the
year 2000 can be reached.
1.22      In summary, while substantial progress has been made in raising
the standards of living of the majority of Kenyans, this very success has
led to a rapid growth of population which seriously threatens to retard
further improvements in the standard of living. It is unlikely that during
the 1980s GDP will grow appreciably faster than population, so that there
will be very little increase of per capita income. This discouraging
prospect emphasizes the need to hasten a fall in fertility, a primary
objective of the proposed project.
II. RURAL HEALTH SERVICES
A. The Organization of Rural Health Services
2.01      The organization of rural health services is shown in Chart 1.
The MOH, where policy and administrative decisions are made, is at the
center. The civil service head of the Ministry is the Permanent Secretary,
and the professional branch is headed by the Director of Medical Services.
At the provincial level the Provincial Medical Officer is responsible for
all health services. In each district, health services are administered by
a District Medical Officer of Health.
2.02      In 1970 the central government took over rural health services,
which until then had been administered by local authorities, with a view to
reorganizing and standardizing them. The first steps in the development of
a systematic model for the provision of rural health services were taken in
1972, when the MOH introduced the concept of Rural Health Unit (RHU), a
geographically defined health administration unit within the district. The
country s 40 districts (i.e. excluding Nairobi district) werE subdivided
into 254 RHUs. The average population per RHU is presently about 54,000,
but there are wide variations. Each RHU was to have one of its health
facilities, preferably a Rural Health Center (RHC) or hospital, designated
as the RHU headquarters. Staff at RHU headquarters were to provide techni-
cal supervision and support to the staff of the other rural health
facilities2/ (RHFs) in their RHU and hold regular clinics in those RHFs.
The RHU headquarters was to serve as the immediate referral point for other
RHFs in the RHU. Six rural health training centers were established in the
mid-1970s to provide team training for RHU staff. To date the staff of
about 30% of all RHUs have received this team training.
2.03      The MOH is upgrading selected dispensaries into RHCs in order to
enable all RHUs to have a RHC or a hospital for headquarters. Presently,
57% of all RHUs have a RHC for headquarters, 23% a hospital, and the rest
have dispensaries. In the typical RHU, a RHC is the center cif a cluster of
several dispensaries which provide first contact outpatient curative
services and, in a few cases, maternal and child health (MCH) care and
family planning (FP).  In general dispensaries are heavily utilized.  A
1973/74 MOH survey found that the number of outpatients served per month in
2/ Comprises dispensaries, rural health centers and rural health
subcenters.



-7-
dispensaries varied from 150 to 9,000, with an average of about 2,200. A
dispensary is usually staffed by an Enrolled Community Nurse (ECN) and a
patient attendant, but in some areas dispensaries are often staffed by
patient attendants only.
2.04      RHCs provide dispensary-type services to the surrounding
population and also serve as referral points for dispensary patients. They
provide a wider range of outpatient curative services than dispensaries and
usually a full range of MCH/FP services. RHCs also provide limited
in-patient services; they have small maternity units (usually 12 beds) for
normal obstetrics, and a few observation beds where patients can be held
for a day or two to determine whether transfer to a hospital is necessary.
Health centers perform very limited minor surgery, all other surgical cases
being transferred to hospitals. Each RHC is headed by a Clinical Officer
(CO)--a paramedical trained for three and a half years to perform most of
the functions normally performed by physicians in developed countries. The
CO is assisted by several ECNs (the exact number depends on the population
served) and by one or two family health field educators (FHFEs)3/ Each
RHC is also supposed to have one public health technician and one
laboratory technician but there are as yet not enough of these technicians
to permit more than a few RHCs to attain a full complement of staff.
2.05      Outpatient RHC services, like those in dispensaries, are heavily
utilized on the average. The 1973/74 MOH survey (para. 2.03) found that
the number of outpatients served per month in RHCs varied between 300 and
18,000, with an average of about 5,000. RHC inpatient facilities, on the
other hand, appear to be very little utilized.  This is not surprising,
because RHCs lack the physicians and inpatient back-up services (e.g.
laboratories and blood banks, drug supplies) found in hospitals, so that it
makes sense for patients seeking inpatient care to bypass RHCs for the
district or mission hospitals.
2.06      The quality of outpatient services at RHCs and dispensaries could
be substantially improved.  Nurses lack diagnostic and prescribing skills
and overprescribing is widespread. RHCs that are also RHU headquarters
have not yet, for the most part, been able to give adequate support to
their satellite dispensaries.  Cos are usually too busy with curative work
at the RHCs to be able to spend much time visiting dispensaries. Lack of a
vehicle in good operating condition is often an added constraint. Neverthe-
less, those RHUs whose staff have undergone team training at Rural Health
Training Centers (para. 2.02), are trying to establish a routine of regular
visits to dispensaries by teams usually comprising the CO, one ECN, the
public health technician if one is available, and a FHFE. At present these
visits are made once a month at most, but to the extent that more staff and
vehicles can be provided they should be increased to about two or three a
month.
2.07      The main referral points for RHFs (i.e. dispensaries and RHCs)
are district hospitals, which provide a wider range of outpatient services,
as well as pediatric, medical, general surgical and obstetrical and gyneco-
logical inpatient services. District hospitals have heavy patient loads.
2.08      The District Medical Officer of Health and his supporting staff
are mostly preoccupied with the administration of the district hospital,
3/ A type of educational/motivational worker whose main task is to recruit
MCH and FP clients.



-8-
and pay inadequate attention to the administration of rural health centers
and dispensaries. A similar situation prevails at the provincial level,
which needs strengthening in the long-run to allow for greater
decentralization.
2.09      In Kenya an extensive network of non-governmental facilities also
provides health services. Out of a total of 1,204 RHFs in Kenya as of mid-
1980, 374 (31%) were operated by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
Most of these NGOs are affiliated with the Catholic and other Christian
churches. Mission hospitals provide about 30% of hospital beds in rural
areas. A subsidy to NGOs (amounting to about 4% of the total in FY80/81)
is included every year in the MOH's budget. Revenues from service fees and
drug charges currently finance about 75% of the recurrent costs of NGO RHFs
and mission hospitals.
B. Proposed Changes in the Organization of Public Rural Health Services
2.10      While continuing to pursue the implementation of the basic model
outlined in the previous section, the MOH is now seeking to improve the
organization of public rural health services in three ways:
(a) By organizing district-level teams to be solely ccncerned
with the supervision and support of rural health facilities;
(b) By providing two types of dispensaries instead of one and
adopting more clearcut criteria for the location cf RHFs; and
(c) By promoting (on an experimental basis) community-level health
care outside the formal MOH network but supported by MOH.
2.11      District Rural Health Management Teams.  The MOH intends to re-
organize the district headquarters into a Hospital Management Team and a
Rural Health Management Team. The Hospital Management Team will be com-
posed of the Medical Officer in charge, the Hospital Secretary, and the
Nursing Officer in charge. The Rural Health Management Team will be
composed of the district Public Health Nurse, Clinical Officer, Public
Health Officer, Nutrition Officer and Health Education Officer. The latter
team does not include any new posts, but many of the posts of Nutrition and
Health Education Officers are vacant. The creation of the new positions of
Medical Officer in charge and Hospital Secretary is expected to free the
District Medical Officer of Health from the day-to-day administration of
the district hospital, thus enabling him to provide guidance 1:o the Rural
Health Management Team, which will give its fulltime help to RHF staff.
2.12      RHF Design and Location.  Existing MOH dispensaries are not
standardized, as many of them were built before 1970, often bv self-help
groups. The MOH has a standard design for new dispensaries which with a
few minor adjustments would be adequate for dispensaries serv[ng popula-
tions of roughly between 4,000 and 8,000 people. The density of population
in many rural areas is increasing, so that it is not uncommon to find more
than 8,000 people living within a radius of about 4 miles from a dispen-
sary, which is considered to be in practice the maximum catchinent area of
such facilities. In such cases, it is more efficient to meet the increas-
ing demand by enlarging the existing dispensaries than by building new dis-
pensaries of the standard (or "type I") size.  The MOH is therefore design-
ing a "type II" dispensary capable of serving from 8,000 to 16,000 people.
The type II dispensaries will provide services similar to those now
provided in type I dispensaries, except that all type II dispensaries will
be expected to provide the full range of MCH and FP services all the time,



-9-
while type I dispensaries provide this full range only when two ECNs are on
duty.
2.13      Subject to financial and other constraints, the MOH will strive
to deploy RHFs according to the following pattern. In areas where concen-
trations of 8,000+ population are found within any given 4-mile radius
circle, a dispensary type II will be provided for any such circular area,
or for a smaller circular area if population within 4-mile radius circles
exceeded 16,000. If a dispensary already exists in the area in question,
it will be upgraded to a type II. RHCs will be counted as type II dispen-
saries for purposes of planning dispensary deployment. Dispensaries type I
will be provided in rural areas where between 4,000 and 8,000 people are
found within a 4-mile radius.  In areas with lower population densities the
long-run goal is to provide a dispensary type I wherever more than 1,000
people live within a 4-mile radius, but MOH will give a lower priority to
these dispensaries.
2.14      The present goal is to have one RHC for each RHU; in RHUs at pre-
sent without a RHC or a hospital this goal will be met by upgrading a suit-
able dispensary.  To minimize the wasteful duplication of services, the MOH
will take account of existing NGO RHFs when planning the geographical dis-
tribution of its own facilities.
2.15      Community-Based Health Care.  The MOH, sharing the now generally
accepted view that the effectiveness of formal public health services can
be enhanced by encouraging rural communities to take responsibility for
meeting some of their most basic health needs, has decided to promote small
experimental schemes of community-based health care.
2.16      The structure of Kenya's rural health services as modified in the
ways described in this section, is sound. The actual operations of the
rural health services, however, are affected by a variety of constraints,
which the MOH is seeking to remove. In Sections (C) to (E) below, specific
aspects of the operations of Kenya-s rural health services are analyzed and
their weaknesses and strengths identified.
C. Availability of Services
Accessibility
2.17      As of mid-1980, there were in Kenya 830 MOH RHFs; 182 health
centers, 37 health subcenters and 611 dispensaries. There were also 374
RHFs operated by NGOs, most of them Church-sponsored, of which 28 were
health centers, 7 health subcenters and 339 dispensaries. The ratio of
rural population to facilities by province ranges from 7,506 in Rift Valley
to 27,595 in Western Province, the average being about 11,300.
2.18      A better indication of accessibility is provided by the figures
in Table 6 below, which shows by province, the percentage distribution of
households (in rural areas) within given distances of a RHF. For the
country as a whole about 42% of households are within 4 km. of a RHF and
about 77% within 8 km, which is quite good by regional standards.  The per-
centage of households farther than 8 km. from a RHF ranges from 7.5% in
Central Province to 43.5% in Eastern Province. As might be expected, RHFs
are more accessible in the three densely populated provinces (Central,
Nyanza and Western) than in the three sparsely populated provinces (Coast,
Eastern and Rift Valley).

2.19       Staffing Norms and Shortfalls.  Table 7 below sets out the
current (for RHCs and dispensaries type 1) and planned (for dispensaries
type II) staffing norms for RHFs. Despite considerable efforts to train
staff during the last decade, substantial shortfalls of staff remain at
RHFs. For the two main categories, COs and ECNs, it is estimated that by
mid-1981 the shortfalls at MOH RHFs amounted to about 32% and 35%
respectively. For MOH hospitals, the corresponding figures are 14% and
30%. Mission health services also have substantial shortfalls of COs and
ECNs (54% and 34% respectively).  MOH RHFs also suffer from substantial
shortages of public health and laboratory technicians.

1/  Current norms, as revised in 1980.  Previously dispensaries type I had
a norm of one ECN and RHCs four ECNs. No Public Health Officers
were previously included in the RHC staffing norms.
2/  Planned.  For dispensaries type II serving populations in the upper
range of the 8,000 to 16,000 bracket the norm of three ECNs is likely
to prove too low.
2.20      Manpower Situation in 1985 and Beyond.  Projections of overall
supply and requirements of clinical officers and ECNs for all health
facilities (MOH and NGOs, hospitals and RHFs) indicate that by 1985 the CO
shortfall will be about the same as in mid-1981 (25%). For ECNs the short-
fall would drop to about 24%. This reduction will be due to the rapid
build-up of ECN schools in recent years. For other categories of staff at
RHFs (public health officers, public health technicians, laboratory
technicians) some narrowing of the gap between supply and need can be
expected during 1981-85, but shortfalls will remain substantial. For
example, by 1985 only one-third of RHCs will have a laboratory technician.
2.21       In the longer run, additional training capacity for both COs and
ECNs will be needed. Assuming that the present intake of students, and
rates of student attrition and manpower attrition (25% and 5% respectively
for COs, and 25% and 2.5% for ECNs), remain unchanged, the growth in the
number of COs would fall to about half of one percent towards the end of
the century (far below the population growth rate, which is unlikely to
fall below 3% by the year 2000).  The annual growth of the number of ECNs
wouid fall to about 2% in the late 1990s.
2.22       Qualitative Aspects of Manpower.  While Kenya's efforts to train
health manpower have been commendable, several deficiencies remain. The
curriculum for the training of COs is deficient in obstetrics and gyne-
cology and in MCH/FP. ECNs receive inadequate training in diagnosis,
prescription and family planning. Patient attendants do not receive any
training, although they are often left in charge of dispensaries. In-
service and refresher training for all RHF health staff has hitherto been



-12-
very limited.  The most effective current in-service training is theteam
training program for staff of RHCs, conducted at six Rural Health Training
Centers (para. 2.02).
Drug Supplies
2.23      The irregular availability of drugs at RHFs considerably affects
the quality of health care services. A MOH survey found that, on an
average, about 25% of public RHFs are closed on any given day because of
lack of drugs, which leads to suboptimal utilization of facilities.
Although some of the shortages are due to insufficient budgets, there is
evidence that a more equitable distribution of drugs at different levels of
the health system, a better match between needs and supply, emphasis on the
use of generic drugs, and the improved monitoring of supplies would all
help to make drugs more uniformly available at RHFs.
D. Support Systems
2.24      Transport.  Adequate transport is essential for outreach, super-
vision and technical support to RHCs and dispensaries, for maintaining the
flow of supplies, and the referral of patients in emergency.  For these
purposes, three or more 4-wheel drive vehicles are provided a: district
headquarters and one or two at each RHC. Dispensaries have not hitherto
been provided with any vehicles. The total fleet of the MOH amounts to
about 1,100 vehicles.
2.25      Although most RHCs have at least one vehicle in fair condition,
these vehicles are not always available to RHC staff for two reasons.
First, district health authorities tend to treat all vehicles as a pool at
their disposal irrespective of their intended purpose. Secondly,mainten-
ance procedures are cumbersome. All maintenance and repair oi vehicles is
contracted out to private workshops. District authorities carnot approve
local purchase orders for more than K.Sh. 4,000, and vehicles requiring
more expensive repairs have to be sent to the provincial level, which
causes considerable delay. Drivers are inadequately trained :.n good
driving habits and the routine care of vehicles. The MOH estimates that at
any given time some 30-40% of all vehicles in the MOH fleet are non-
operational, most of them in need of minor repairs only.
Maintenance of Buildings and Equipment
2.26      Although the Ministry of Works (MOW) is responsible for the main-
tenance of RHF buildings, the actual work is done by private contractors.
For this purpose the budget of the MOW contains a yearly allocation equiva-
lent to 2.5% of the estimated replacement value of all registered RHFs.
This arrangement works reasonably well. However, un-registered facilities
(mainly those constructed by self-help "harambee" groups) are not main-
tained by the MOW. The MOH is allocated K.Sh.50,000 per year per district
for minor repairs to unregistered facilities, which is insufficient.
2.27      The maintenance of equipment in RHFs is also inadequate.  It is
common to find facilities without water or electricity because pump and
generators have broken down and there is no one to repair them.  The same
is true of refrigerators, office machines, surgical instruments, and
laboratory equipment.  Equipment is often found which has never been used
because of original defects or because no one has been instructed in its
use. Although there is a large maintenance and repair workshop at Kenyatta



-13-
National Hospital, it is obviously impractical to use it for repairs of RHF
equipment. Several district and provincial hospitals also have small work-
shops that handle some of the repairs for RHFs, but more maintenance
capacity needs to be developed.
Health Information System
2.28      The rural health information system suffers from a number of
weaknesses. The processing of information is usually too late, and the
methods of analysis too inadequate, for it to be of any use for program
operations.  Many RHFs do not report regularly.  While morbidity patterns
are emphasized, reporting on preventive (i.e. immunization) and promotive
health activities is neglected. No information is collected on staff,
vehicles, or supplies at RHFs. Thus, in general, while good information is
maintained on patients and recipients of MCH and family planning services,
the analysis of data and feedback for operations is weak.
Research
2.29      The MOH has limited operational research capability, although it
has made a few studies (e.g., on problems of drug supply and the effective-
ness of the FHFEs). Outside the MOH, health research is conducted at the
University of Nairobi and at the Dutch-assisted Medical Research Center.
Liaison between these two institutions and the MOH is weak.
E. Government Health Spending Patterns and Priorities
2.30      Health was given high priority in the five-year Development Plan
1978/79-1982/83, which envisaged that the share of the MOH in total expend-
itures of ministries would increase from 6.3% in FY78/79 to 7.4% in
1982/83. Revised budget estimates for FY80/81, however, put the share of
MOH at 6.2%, and current forward budget projections indicate that it should
reach 6.8% by FY83/84.

2.31      Table 8 above shows the composition of the MOH budget.  The
budget figures for FY80/81 are consistent with the Five-Year Plan insofar
as the shares going to RHFs and to preventive and promotive services have
been increased, while the share going to District Hospitals has been
reduced. They are inconsistent with it, however, insofar as the share of
Central and Referral Services has been increased, while that of Training
has been reduced.  The bulk of category (4) in Table 8 is accounted for by
Kenyatta National Hospital and the Provincial Hospitals, which are very
heavily utilized, and thus tend to benefit from political pressure. It is
important, for reasons of equity and efficiency, that futura additions to
the MOH budget be largely directed towards rural health services and
preventive/promotive services.
2.32      At present the health services do not reach a lar1ge proportion of
the rural population. The extension and improvement in quality of preven-
tive rural health services would reduce the prevalence of communicable
diseases and of complications of pregnancy, with a correspoading reduction
of pressure on hospitals. On the curative side, simple treatment at the
local level can often reduce the severity and duration of illness (e.g.
malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea). The MOH policy of emphasizing rural
health services is sound and should continue to be encouraged as much as
possible by external assistance agencies.
F. External Assistance
2.33      In FY80/81, the MOH development budget amounted to about US$31
million. About 18% of it (US$5.5 million) was financed by axternal assist-
ance, most of which (96.7%) was earmarked for RHFs. The chief contributors
were SIDA and DANIDA (68%) and the European Economic Community and the
Government of the Netherlands (26%). The remaining 6% was contributed by
the Government of Germany and NORAD. The funds provided by the IDA-
assisted First Population Project were fully disbursed by April 1980.



-15-
G. Overall Assessment
2.34       Since MOH took over the administration of rural health services
in 1970, a good deal of progress has been made in developing a service
model adequate to Kenya's needs and in actually providing services in
accordance with this model. The model provides a sound basis for a further
expansion of services, the present scale of which has been made possible by
substantial training and construction programs in the 1970s. Shortfalls of
staff and drugs remain, however, and about a quarter of rural people live
more than 8 km. away from a RHF, which means that most of those people
would avail themselves of health services only in case of extreme emergen-
cies. Support services, such as transport, maintenance and data collection
and processing also suffer from various weaknesses.  The current develop-
ment plan proposes a substantial increase in the share of rural health
services in total MOII expenditure and there has been some shift in this di-
rection. External assistance agencies should continue to encourage this
shift by funding sound rural health projects. Even with further increases
in the share of MOH's budget going to rural health services, however, it
would be unrealistic to expect a rapid improvement in the rural health
situation in the near future if the present lag of GDP growth behind
population continues.
1IT. THE FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM
A. Introduction
3.01      By the standards of Sub-Saharan Africa, Kenyas FP program is
substantial.  An extensive (if incomplete) network of FP SDPs has been
created. A FP training system has been established. An elaborate FP
service statistics system has been set up, but not enough use is made of
the data for evaluation and feedback. Efforts to provide FP information
and education have been inadequate, and the proportion of eligible couples
practising contraception is very small. The 1977-78 Kenya World Fertility
Survey indicated that the great majority of people in Kenya desire very
large families. While political support for the program is increasing, it
is not likely to have much influence on family size norms in the short run.
Other changes that could be expected to influence these norms--higher
status of women, a shift of population towards urban areas and/or modern
sector occupations--are inextricably bound up with general economic growth
and will be slow in coming. In the short run, the only feasible interven-
tions would seem to be a greatly stepped-up program of informational and
educational activities, and improvements in the availability and quality of
FP services for those who have already decided to limit and/or space their
families.
B. Developments Before 1974
3.02      Voluntary associations began to promote FP in Nairobi and Mombasa
as early as 1955. In 1961, these associations formed the Family Planning
Association of Kenya. In 1966, the GOK announced that family planning
would become an integral part of maternal and child health services, and
set up a FP unit in the MOH.  Thus Kenya became the first country in Sub-
Saharan Africa to have a national family planning program. By 1973, part-
time FP services were being offered in about 300 out of 900 government and
non-government health facilities.



-16-
C. The Five-Year MCH/FP Plan, 1974-79
Origin and Characteristics
3.03      Early in 1971 the GOK requested the Bank's help in preparing a
five-year plan to strengthen the MOH-s FP program. Over the next two years
Bank missions helped the GOK to prepare a plan to ease the main constraints
on the expansion of the program, which were identified as:  (i) paucity of
adequately trained paramedical personnel; (ii) weak information and educa-
tion activities; and (iii) lack of a unit for planning, monitoring and
evaluating the program.
3.04      The goals of the five-year plan were a reduction in the popula-
tion growth rate (from about 3.3% to 3%) and an improvement (not
quantified) in the health of mothers and children. Specific plan com-
ponents included:  (a) the introduction of full-time MCH/FP services in 400
government health facilities, to be known as "MCH/FP service delivery
points"; (b) the introduction of 17 mobile teams to provide part-time
MCH/FP services at an additional 190 government health facilities; (c) the
establishment of eight ECN training schools and 30 associatecl rural health
centers (ECNs being the main dispensers of MCH/FP services); (d) in-service
FP training for 600 ECNs, 46 Public Health Nurses, 55 nursing tutors, and
the staff of the 17 mobile teams; (e) the introduction of a new category of
800 FHFEs and their supervisors; (f) the strengthening of the MOH,s capa-
city to produce health education materials; and (g) the establishment of a
central planning and support unit for the MCH/FP program, the National
Family Wlelfare Center (NFWC).
3.05      The total cost of the plan was estimated at US$38.8 million.  The
plan was to be financed in part by the GOK (32%), and in part by seven
external assistance agencies: IDA, UNFPA, SIDA, USAID, DANIDA, the Federal
Republic of Germany and ODA. The IDA credit of US$12 milliorn equivalent,
which financed mostly physical infrastructure, became effective in July
1974.
Implementation of the Five-Year Plan
3.06      In general, the execution of the plan proceeded as envisaged.  By
the end of 1979, 364 MCH/FP service delivery points had been established,
or about 90% of the target of 400. The 17 mobile teams were deployed in
1978, but have been hampered by logistical problems, and the MOH now
intends to phase them out. The numbers of health staff trained in FP con-
siderably exceeded the plan's targets.
3.07      In stimulating demand for FP, priority was to be given to person-
to-person education, provided by some 800 FHFEs, supported by an enlarged
mass communication effort. Half of the productive capacity cf the Health
Education Unit, which was to be strengthened, was to be devoted to FP in-
formation and education materials.
3.08      By the end of 1979, about 750 FHFEs were employed, some 150 by
the Family Planning Association of Kenya, and 600 by the MOH. However, the
performance of the FHFEs has been disappointing, especially in recruiting
FP clients. In 1978, the FHFEs recruited about 15-18 new FP acceptors per
year per FHFE. Each FHFE also recruited about 70 MCH clients in that year.
Several factors may have contributed to poor performance. Tihe fact that



-17-
FHFEs are not allowed to provide any services (not even resupplying oral
pills and condoms) reduces their prestige in the eyes of the public.  FHFEs
are regarded with misgivings by other health workers because their salaries
are about the same as those of much better trained staff.  This may result
in inadequate attention being paid to clients referred by FHFEs. The FHFEs
have received far less support than planned from mass communication activi-
ties and educational and communication materials.  Finally, the idea of
fertility limitation has still very limited acceptance in Kenya, and FP
activities therefore tend to be given lower priority by FHFEs than MCH
activities. The MOH has decided to freeze the number of FHFEs pending
further study of ways to improve their performance.
3.09       The NFWC was set up as planned to provide training, information
and education, research and evaluation, and to plan new services for the
expanded MCH/FP program, but it was hampered by gaps in its professional
staff. In particular, during the five-year plan period the Evaluation and
Research division never had a head, the head of the I&E division was also
the head of the Health Education Unit, and the Director of the NFWC had
several other responsibilities. A fulltime Deputy Director was in place,
but three persons held this position during the period. An executive
officer and an accountant were never appointed. The NFWC has also found it
difficult to obtain acceptance from the rest of the MOH.
3.10       Although it was intended that the NFWC should have a separate
Information and Education (I&E) division which would focus on FP educa-
tional activities, the MOH has treated it as part of the Health Education
Unit, with the result that much of its effort has been diverted from
routine MCH/FP activities to emergencies such as epidemics. The planned
professional input for the I&E division was inadequate and the division was
mainly occupied in training until mid-1979. The new facilities for the
Health Education Unit did not become operational until late 1979.
3.11       Nevertheless, in 1979 the I&E division produced about 30 minutes
of radio programs per week, conducted about 20 seminars attended by about
900 persons, held ten exhibitions, and prepared a considerable quantity of
I&E material. The division-s capability for programming and software
development needs to be strengthened, and it should cooperate more closely
with other agencies.
3.12       The Evaluation and Research division of the NFWC was intended to
monitor program progess and to recommend more effective approaches to
service delivery and demand creation.  In practice, it was expected to
collect service statistics, carry out special studies and pretest I&E
materials. Although a head was never appointed, it succeeded in setting up
a service statistics system and making several studies, including a review
of MCH/FP SDPs and an evaluation of FHFEs.
3.13       The five-year plan also included the establishment of a Popula-
tion Studies and Researchi Center at the University of Nairobi to support
the family planning program by conducting demographic research and training
and by helping the Evaluation and Research division of the NFWC to evaluate
the FP program.  The Center was established with a delay of about two
years.  Although it has built up a teaching capability and made a number of
studies, the Center does not work closely with MOH, and has therefore not
been influential in shaping FP policies.



-18-
Demographic Impact
3.14      In predicting a decline in the population growth rate from 3.3%
in 1974 to 3.0% by 1979, the five-year plan had assumed that the birth rate
would decline from 50 to 47 per thousand and the death rate would remain at
17 per thousand. Neither of these two assumptions materialized. The 1979
Census yielded an estimated CBR of 53 per thousand. Several factors may
have contributed to this increase in the CBR; improved healt:h, reduced lac-
tational amenorrhea, and some reduction in the incidence of polygamous
unions. On the other hand, improved health services and general socio-
economic development led to a reduction in the CDR to about 14 in 1979.
Thus, instead of a decline in the population growth rate, a significant in-
crease occurred that raised the rate to about 3.9% in 1979.
3.15      The number of FP first visitors grew from 53,500 in 1975 to
72,600 in 1977, but fell to 62,400 in 1978. In 1979 it was 62,800. Pre-
liminary figures for 1980 suggest a number close to the 1978 and 1979
figures. The reasons for the decline of performance in 1978, the first
since the program began, are not clear. A comparison of provincial and
district performance suggests that the decline was not localized. Except
in Nairobi, the number of first visitors declined almost everywhere.
MCH Performance
3.16      MCH performance has been much more encouraging.  The numbers of
first visits and revisits for antenatal and child welfare services have
been growing steadily. It is estimated that presently aboul: 65-70% of
pregnant women and about 55-60% of newborn children are being reached by
the program.
Lessons of the Five-Year MCH/FP Plan
3.17      In retrospect, it is clear that at the time of preparation and
appraisal of the Plan the Government's commitment to strengthening the FP
program was overestimated. The numerous problems affecting the establish-
ment and operation of the NFWC reflect this basic fact.
3.18      A second important point is that the Plan concentrated heavily on
the supply side of family planning.  However, available evidence (see
para. 3.20 below) clearly indicates that the main constraint: to expansion
of contraception in Kenya is the almost universal desire for large
families. Thus a greater emphasis on programs addressed at changing family
size norms is required.
3.19      Thirdly, the Plan relied excessively on the MOH as the vehicle to
achieve its objectives. Hence an opportunity was lost to tap the resources
of other Government agencies and the private, non-profit sector in pursuing
the Plan's MCH and FP goals. Such a broad involvement of organizations
other than MOH is especially important for the achievement of fertility
reduction objectives, which presupposes wide community cooperation and
support (in the context of a strictly voluntary program).



-19-
D. Constraints on the Expansion of the FP Program
Desire for Large Families
3.20      The Kenya World Fertility Survey (1977-78) indicated a strong
desire for large families. Only 17% of then married women stated that they
wanted no more children. Among those with six living children, only 25%
stated that they wanted no more; and even among those with eight children,
less than half (48%) wanted no more. The mean desired family size was 7.2,
which is three to four higher than the average desired family size reported
in similar surveys in 18 Asian and Latin American developing countries.
All this suggests that in Kenya the "unmet demand" for FP services is
probably low.
Limited Availability of FP Services
3.21      The availability and quality of FP services also affect the
acceptance and use rates.  This is especially true in rural areas.  Accord-
ing to the Kenya World Fertility Survey, travel times to a FP SDP were 68,
40 and 30 minutes for rural, urban and metropolitan residents respectively.
About 86% of MOH RHCs offer daily FP services and an additional 3%' offer
non-daily FP services. However, only 12% of MORl dispensaries offer daily
FP services. An additional 20% offer non-daily FP services, often only
once a week. Services in part-time FP dispensaries are usually provided by
mobile units and are not very reliable. Less than 1% of NGO RHFs offer
daily FP services. An additional 1% offer part-time FP services.
3.22      Since the oral pill is the most widely accepted method, a FP
client would have to visit a FP facility at least once every three months
for resupply. Even in RHFs offering daily FP services, frequently only one
nurse is trained to provide FP services, and she is on leave on the average
for four months in the year. Since other RHF staff have not hitherto been
allowed to resupply oral pills, the client cannot count on renewing her
supply when she needs to. Kenya-s rural health delivery system also con-
tinues to emphasize meeting curative demands, which take precedence over
preventive and promotive services, including MCH/FP. Problems of service
availability are compounded by a negative attitude on the part of health
field staff towards FP services--an attitude that mirrors the attitude of
the community at large.
E. Recommended Next Steps
3.23      The preceding analysis of constraints on the expansion of the FP
program implicitly defines the directions in which the program should move
in the next few years. On the demand side, there is an urgent need to
expand the scope and depth of FP information and education activities.
This is the only possible way of influencing family size norms in the short
run.
3.24       On the supply side, there are several possible interventions that
would considerably increase the availability and quality of FP services,
notably the extension of these services to the dispensary level. NGOs
operating RHFs should also be encouraged to provide FP services--even if
their scope has to be limited for doctrinal reasons. In all RHFs, staff
other than those ECNs that have undergone formal in-service FP training
should be allowed to provide some FP services (including supply of
non-medical contraceptives and resupply of orals) and trained on the job



-20-
for this purpose.  In time, community health workers could be trained to
perform similar duties in their communities.  The marginal cost of all
these extensions of FP services wou'ld be small because of l:he integration
of FP and health services in Kenya.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept, Objectives and Design
4.01      The proposed project would consist of two parts.  "Part A" would
set up a new interagency information and education program for the promo-
tion of the small family norm. "Part B" would strengthen rural health and
family planning services. The objectives of the project are twofold: (i)
to continue the efforts begun under the First Project to r,duce fertility;
and (ii) to improve the accessibility and quality of rural health services
to reduce further mortality and morbidity in rural areas. The project
would have a duration of three years, from July 1982 to June 1985, and it
would be the first phase of a six-year program appraised by the joint
appraisal mission. A second phase (project) would follow from July 1985 to
June 1988, after a re-appraisal in 1984. In the rest of the report, the
word "project will refer to the 1982-85 phase, unless otherwise indicated.
The word "program", on the other hand, will refer to the entire six-year
program.
4.02      Project Design and Fertility Objectives.  The typical pattern of
demographic transition proceeds in three stages. A stage of high fertility
and high mortality is followed by one of high fertility and much lower
mortality.  Finally, fertility also falls to a low level close to that of
mortality. Kenya is presently in the second phase. No sub-Saharan country
has reached the third. The timing of the transition from the second to the
third stage in Kenya cannot be accurately predicted, but it is reasonable
to assume that it could be hastened by means of population/FP programs of
the kind that have been successful in other countries.
4.03      The design of the FP components of the project is based on two
main premises. First, a large increase in contraceptive use will not occur
in Kenya until the average desired family size starts to fall from its pre-
sent very high level. To facilitate this decline, parents' awareness of
the benefits that would accrue to their families from limiting family size
needs to be enhanced. Since parental fertility decisions are also in-
fluenced by the general attitudes of society at large towards fertility, it
is also necessary to educate the general public on the nat:ure of the
population problem facing the country and its serious implications for
prospects of raising the standard of living. The MOH alone cannot do this.
The project would therefore include a new multi-media information and edu-
cation program to be conducted by a wide range of governmental and non-
governmental agencies.  Secondly, accessibility to family planning services
in rural areas is still well below its potential. The project would extend
the provision of FP services to all MOH RHFs and at the same time make them
more readily available by extending the range of MOH personnel allowed to
provide such services.  It would also create 30 MCH/FP SD?s in existing NGO
RHCs and dispensaries.
4.04      Forecasting the likely pace of expansion of the family planning
program over the next six years which might be expected to occur in view of
program interventions is very difficult, especially since FP performance
has been stalled in recent years (paragraph 3.15). Nevertheless, it would
not be unreasonable to expect an increase in the contraceptive prevalence



-21-
rate from about 5% now to between 10% and 17% by the end of 1987, depending
on the strength of the short-term effects of the program-s information and
education activities on average desired family size.  (For details, see
Annex 4). This would be reflected in a decline in the CBR from about 53
per thousand now to between 51 and 48 by 1987, approximately.
4.05      Project Design and Mortality/Morbidity Objectives.  With regard
to its health aspects, the project represents a phase of the implementation
of the present model of provision of rural health services described in
Section II.A, with the proposed changes explained in Section II.B. Project
health activities would be nationwide but concentrated in rural areas. The
main thrust of the project in its health aspects would be to consolidate
the existing network of RHFs through better staffing, improved drug
supplies, and physical upgrading of substandard facilities. These efforts
would result in a more efficient utilization of existing facilities and a
much enlarged service capacity. Consolidation of existing RHFs would also
be aided by the project's strengthening of support systems (maintenance,
transport and health information), and the planned reorganization and
strengthening of district-level management. Third, experimental community-
based health care schemes would be promoted as a potentially important,
cost-effective addition to the formal health system.  These schemes, if
successful, would be instrumental in promoting self-care, which makes good
economic sense given the disease pattern prevailing in Kenya (paragraph
1.11). Health education through the regular MOH rural services would also
be singled out for strengthening by the project for similar reasons.
Finally, the project would constitute a turning point in the history of
external assistance to the country-s health sector in that it would involve
a substantial component of assistance to NGOs, which play a vital role in
the provision of rural health services.
4.06      Although it can be expected that mortality and morbidity in rural
areas would be substantially lower with the project than it would be the
case otherwise, no attempt has been made to measure these differentials, in
view of limitations in data and the methodological difficulties of assess-
ing impact in the context of broad, multi-component projects such as this
one.
4.07      Interrelationships of Fertility and Health Objectives.  Reduc-
tions in fertility and reductions in morbidity/mortality are mutually rein-
forcing. Reductions in fertility through reduced average family size allow
for better care by households of the smaller number of children, thus re-
sulting in lower rates of infant and child mortality. Conversely, reducing
infant and child mortality allows parents to achieve their family-size
desires with fewer births. Moreover, it increases the expected return to
parents on investments in the quality of children, which tends to reduce
average desired family size (as more parents choose to invest in quality as
opposed to quantity).
4.08      Links Between Parts A and B.  Important links of complementarity
exist between Parts A and B of the proposed project. Both service and in-
formation programs are necessary if national population objectives are to
be met. Neither is adequate alone. Before people can practice family
planning they have to know that they have a choice in whether to have
another child or not, and that to exercise their right to choose not to
have more children is legitimate on religious or moral grounds.  Beyond
this they have to know how they can avoid pregnancy, where to find and how
to use the best methods for them, and what benefits they are likely to gain



-22-
by having fewer rather than more children. They also have to know that
their peers agree with their decisions and actions to avoid pregnancies.
And they need to be informed and reassured about the safety, effectiveness,
and reliability of the methods they choose.  Before they can practice
family planning successfully, they also have to have easy access to the
materials and services that are needed for effective contraception. Demand
without supply leads to personal and family frustrations and the loss of
opportunities to affect the rate of population growth.  Supply without
demand results in wasted resources. Both are required and they should be
in reasonable balance.
4.09      Project Design and Lessons of the 1974-79 MCH/FP Five-Year Plan.
It was pointed out above (paragraph 3.17) that, in preparing the Plan, the
Government's commitment to strengthening the FP program was civerestimated.
The question then arises as to whether this may not also turn out to be the
case for the proposed project. While this possibility cannot be ruled out
altogether, since the change of administration in 1979 there has been a
marked increase in public manifestations of support for efforts to teduce
the rate of population growth on the part of very senior Government
officials, as exemplified by the President's latest Independence Day speech
(June 1981). Government approval of plans for a high-profile population
information and education program such as the one contained in the proposed
project would have been unthinkable at the time of preparation of the
five-year Plan. Yet, strong political support for population control
measures has not yet spread widely throughout all layers of Government.
Thus some resistance to implementation of parts of the proposed project is
possible. This obstacle would not be unsurmountable as long as strong
support from the Office of the President continues to exist. In the longer
run, the activities of the proposed information and education program
should in themselves have an effect in spreading political support for FP
more widely. Other lessons from the Five-year Plan (paragraphs 3.18 and
3.19) have been taken into account in the design of the proposed project
(paragraphs 4.03 and 4.05).
4.10      Program Size.  At present, the rural health/FP services are
receiving piecemeal financing from several bilateral agencies, UNFPA and
UNICEF. The program would consolidate this financing, together with Bank
Group lending and domestic resources, into a comprehensive package for the
six-year period 1982-88 which would embody the bulk of all developmental
activities in the sector during that period. It would imply an increase in
real terms in the MOH's annual expenditure on rural health/Fl] services of
about 40% by FY87/88, compared with FY80/81. The program represents the
maximum developmental FP effort possible during the period. While the
Government and NGOs could possibly carry out a larger expansion of rural
health services in some areas than that now proposed, the program size had
to be limited to a level consistent with available financing and the
Government-s ability to sustain incremental recurrent costs.
B. Summary Project Composition
4.11      The items that would be financed under the project are summarized
below. (For further details, see Annex 1). The project's functional
components are described in paragraphs (4.12 to 4.83).
(a) Construction, furnishing and equipment of new
facilities consisting of one CO school and one ECN school,
one RHC, four Type I dispensaries, six staff housing units



-23-
for existing dispensaries, and six maintenance training
schools;
(b) Upgrading of 37 MOH Type I dispensaries to Type II, and
of three NGO nursing schools and three NGO RHCs;
(c)  Improvement of 25 substandard MOH dispensaries and 30
substandard NGO dispensaries and health centers;
(d) Provision of miscellaneous furniture and equipment;
(e) Vehicles, including four 30-seat buses, 49 sedans, 9
12-seat minibuses, 3 station wagons, 34 four-wheel-drive
cars, 1,200 bicycles, 152 motorcycles, 24 ambulances,
4 motorboats and six pick-ups;
(f) Salaries and allowances for about 2,000 incremental staff;
.(g) Sixteen man-years of advisory services; and
(h) Other miscellaneous incremental operating and maintenance
costs.
C. Detailed Project Description
Family Planning Demand Creation
4.12      Part A of the project consists of a new interagency, multimedia
information and education (I&E) program on population and FP matters.
Various analyses of the Kenyan population situation, including the Bank-s
1980 report on "Population and Development in Kenya" (No. 2775-KE), have
emphasized the need for a much broader and more intensive I&E program. The
1978 Kenya World Fertility Survey found that many women are still poorly
informed about family planning and the sources of services and advice. In
view of the very strong continuing socio-cultural support for high
fertility, however, the I&E task calls for much more than simply informing
potential users about services. An intensive, long-term effort is required
to change community and individual values and beliefs.
4.13      Constraints in present program.  The GOK has identified the
following constraints on the present I&E program:
(a)  Absence of any mechanisms for coordinating the I&E activities
of various ministries and NGOs;
(b)  Relative neglect of certain key audiences (especially men,
youth in schools, and professional and leadership groups);
(c)  Over-emphasis on the health aspects, and neglect of other
important aspects of family size/population growth;
(d)  Even within health institutions, the insufficient use of I&E
opportunities presented by "captive audiences" in clinics and
maternity wards;
(e)  Inadequate scope, quantity and pre-testing of I&E materials;
(f)  Limited use of radio and other mass media;
(g)  Insufficient use of extension workers outside the health sector
and of various non-formal education programs; and
(h)  Ineffective use of the schools for education in
population, family life, and health.
4.14      I&E Objectives.  The main objectives of the strengthened and
expanded I&E program would be:
(a)  To create a climate of opinion in favor of a strong population
program by making people at all levels of society aware of the
seriousness of the population problem;
(b)  To induce professional, religious, and other influential groups
to encourage the public to accept family planning;



-24-
(c)  To encourage couples to reduce their family size aspirations
and to practise effective family planning;
(d)  To provide potential and actual family planning users with
information about family planning;
(e)  To encourage medical and paramedical personnel to provide
effective family planning services; and
(f)  To prepare youth for responsible parenthood.
4.15       I&E Policy.  The detailed tactics to be followed by the I&E
program are to be worked out by a new coordinating council (paragraph 4.16
below). The following broad principles, however, have already been
endorsed by the GOK:
(a)  The expanded I&E program would be addressed to adull: men, youth
of both sexes, and leadership and professional groups, as well
as mothers and pregnant women;
(b)  The program will make use of agencies outside as weLl as inside
the health sector including NGOs.
(c)  To reach the desired variety of audiences, interpersonal communi-
cation will have to be supplemented by a multimedia approach;
(d)  Activities and materials will be based on the characteristics
of the intended audiences, and all materials will be thoroughly
pretested; and
(e)  The planning, management, and coordination of this ::nteragency
multimedia program will be assigned to a new body to be known
as the National Council on Population and Development.
4.16      The National Council on Population and Development.  The Cabinet
has approved the establishment of a National Council on Population and
Development, that will be set up for the purpose of coordinating efforts in
population information and education, including the programs under Part A
of the proposed project. The Council is to be located in the Office of the
Vice President and Ministry of Home Affairs.
4.17       The Council would consist primarily of representatives of
agencies participating in the program. The full Council would meet only a
few times a year, and most decisions would be taken on its behalf by a
five-member executive committee consisting of representatives of two
government departments, two NGOs and the head of the Council's Secretariat.
4.18       The day-to-day work of the Council would be performed by a
Secretariat staffed by about seven professional staff, three administrative
officers and accountants, and 17 secretaries and other support staff. The
staffing of the following positions with full-time personnel wthose
experience and qualifications are acceptable to IDA will be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Credit: Director, Financial Controller,
Administrative Officer and Accountant.
4.19       The Council will determine the scope and direction cf the I&E
program, approve its budgets, and coordinate and support the program. It
is expected, however, that as the political climate changes, the Council
will begin to focus attention on such other aspects of demand creation as
policies to upgrade the social status of women and pilot schemes of incen-
tives and disincentives to promote a reduction in desired family size.
4.20       Indicative Program for the First Year.  In selecting proposals
from among those submitted by potential implementing agencies, priority has
been given to activities that fill obvious gaps. The selected proposals



-25-
have been designated the "indicative program". To provide the Council with
some flexibility in the first year of the program, funds equivalent to 10%
of its estimated cost would be reserved for activities not in the indica-
tive program which it may appear desirable to add to the program in the
course of the year.  The proposed indicative program consists of 16
separate activities to be implemented by two ministries and six NGOs (for
details, see Annex 5).
4.21      Work plans for subsequent years.  Because the content of the I&E
program in later years can only be determined by evaluating its achieve-
ments in the earlier years, and because the Council has not yet come into
being, only the first year's work program has so far been planned in
detail. For each of the subsequent years, the Council'would draw up an
annual work plan and budget. An assurance has been obtained that the
government will submit the draft annual work plan for the approval of the
funding agencies supporting Part A, not later than March 31 of each year,
beginning with March 31, 1983, for the 1983/84 program.
4.22       In-school education.  Family planning education is to be included
in primary and secondary school curricula. The indicative program includes
curriculum preparation and teacher training by several NGOs which have
already made some progress in this area. The Kenya Institute of Education,
which prepares curricula for the Ministries of Basic and of Higher Educa-
tion, has agreed to organize this work.
4.23      Implementation.  In the light of the resources available or
likely to be available, the Council will consolidate proposals submitted by
the participating agencies into an annual plan, for approval by the financ-
ing agencies. The approved plan will then be translated into one-year
agreements with the individual agencies.
4.24      The Council will also commission such activities as training, re-
search, evaluation, and the preparation of I&E materials--particularly for
the mass media--that will enhance the overall program or meet the common
needs of two or more implementing agencies.
4.25       Funds for the Council's Secretariat and for implementing agencies
which are non-governmental will be included in the budget of the Office of
the Vice President and Ministry of Home Affairs. Based on the annual
agreements, funds would be transferred to the implementing agencies,
conditional upon satisfactory performance. For governmental implementing
agencies, funds would be included in their respective budgets. The
Council's Secretariat will prepare progress reports, reimbursement
applications and other documentation for the funding agencies.
Family Planning Services
4.26      The project would substantially increase the availability of FP
services in rural areas by increasing the number of RHFs offering FP
services and widening the range of RHF personnel trained to provide such
services.
4.27       Service Delivery Points (SDPs).  As of mid-1980, out of a total
of 830 MOH RHFs, 250 (156 RHCs, 21 health subcenters and 73 dispensaries)
offered daily FP services. A further 136 (five RHCs, three health sub-
centers and 128 dispensaries) offered part-time FP services, usually pro-
vided by mobile teams.  The remaining 444 MOH RHFs offered no FP services.



-26-
The project would help to convert an additional 300 existing MOH RHFs into
MCH/FP SDPs offering full FP services daily.  (It is planned that an
additional 300 MOH RHFs would be converted into full MCH/FP ';DPs during the
1985-88 phase, so that by the end of 1988 all MOH RHFs would be functioning
as full MCH/FP SDPs). In addition, about 30 NGO health centers and dispen-
saries would become MCH/FP SDPs under the project.
4.28      FP services in RHFs have hitherto been provided only by ECNs who
have received FP training. Other staff at RHFs, i.e. clinical officers,
FHFEs, patient attendants, and ECNs untrained in FP, will be now allowed to
supply non-clinical contraceptives (condoms, foams and jellies) and to re-
supply orals. The new policy would allow RHFs without an ECN fully trained
in FP to become limited SDPs able to supply non-clinical contraceptives and
to resupply orals until they can be assigned ECNs qualified to insert IUDs
and to prescribe and provide the initial supply of orals and thus become
full SDPs.
4.29      An assurance has been obtained that the MOH will prepare, not
later than December 31, 1982, a plan for the eventual conversion of all MOH
RHFs not presently functioning as MCH/FP SDPs into full SDPs, and for their
interim conversion into limited SDPs.
4.30      FP Training of ECNs and COs.  At present, although ECNs are res-
ponsible for FP services at RHFs, their basic training does not adequately
cover FP, and therefore needs to be supplemented by in-service FP instruc-
tion. The NFWC trains about 120 ECNs per year in FP. Under the project,
this would be increased to about 300 per year, which would be required to
staff the additional SDPs planned. Also, a new program for in-service FP
training of COs would be started by the NFWC. About 90 COs would be
trained per year for one week each. This would allow them tc prescribe
oral contraceptives and to supervise the FP services renderecl by ECNs more
effectively.
4.31      Training of Other Categories.  Patient attendants at RHFs, ECNs
who have not attended NFWC-s in-service FP courses, and FHFEs would receive
short-term on-the-job training in FP and would be allowed to re-supply
orals. This training would be conducted by district health staff. NFWC
would be responsible for planning and technical assistance.
4.32      Strengthening of the NFWC.  The project would make provision for
the required additional staff to carry out the NFWC-s enlarged training,
support of SDP development, and information and education functions.
The MOH has also decided to appoint a full-time Director of the NFWC. This
would enable the Deputy Director to double up as head of the Clinical
Services Division, which is presently vacant. The position of head of the
Training Division is also vacant, but the MOH is in the process of
identifying a suitable person to fill this position. The position of
Administrator, and that of head of the Information and Education Division,
which had remained vacant for a long time, have been recently filled.
4.33      Technical Assistance, Research and Evaluation and Eellowships.
The project would provide funds for about three man-years of short-term
management consultant services for the NFWC. It would also provide up to
about US$40,000 equivalent a year for one or two FP-related ciperations
research studies on topics proposed by the NFWC.  The MOH would set up an
Evaluation and Research Committee to select study topics and contractors in
connection with this and other research and evaluation financed by the pro-
ject. Study topics and proposed outlines recommended by the Committee
would be submitted to IDA for its approval. The project would provide



-27-
funds for attendance to short FP workshops in other developing countries
(e.g. India, Indonesia, South Korea) with longer experience of FP programs
by MOH staff to the extent of about six man-months.
Manpower, Drugs and Facilities
4.34       Strengthening of District Level Staff.  An important element of
the project would be the reorganization of the district-level management of
rural health services (paragraph 2.11). To develop managerial capabilities
at this level, and to facilitate implementation of the planned reorganiza-
tion, four itinerant Support and Training Teams would be deployed.
4.35       Staff for Rural Health Facilities.  The upgrading under the
project of 37 dispensaries Type I into dispensaries Type II (paragraph
4.11) would require the deployment of about 110 additional staff of ECNs,
patient attendants and other subordinate staff. In addition, the project
would include deployment of other additional staff for presently under-
staffed RHFs through 1984. The approximate numbers involved would be 44
COs, 496 ECNs, 15 Public Health Officers, 240 Public Health Technicians, 48
Lab Technicians, 48 statistical/general purpose clerks, and 260 subordinate
staff.  This would substantially reduce staff shortfalls at RHFs.
4.36       Present tools of personnel management do not permit a precise
count of staff of any given type allocated to the various types of facili-
ties. In order to remedy this deficiency, an assurance has been obtained
that the MOH will set up a system to show the number, type and posting by
specific facility of rural health staff not later than December 31, 1982.
4.37       New School for Clinical Officers.  As pointed out in paragraph
2.23 above, there is a need for additional capacity for the basic training
of COs. Under the project, a new school for COs with an intake of 65
students per year (165 seats) would be established in Western Province.
Even with this new school, the number of COs would be growing by only 1.5%
a year by the late 1990s--well below the projected population growth rate
of about 3%--assuming that attrition remains unchanged. It is therefore
important to try to reduce attrition.
4.38       New School for Enrolled Community Nurse.  The project would pro-
vide for a new ECN school with a yearly intake of 50 students per year (200
seats). This, however, would raise the annual rate of growth of the number
of ECNs by the end of the century by only one-tenth of one percentage point
(2.1% instead of 2.0%), assuming attrition remains unchanged. Clearly
then, more ECN schools will have to be established unless attrition
(especially student attrition) can be reduced, or the period of training
shortened.
4.39       An assurance has been obtained that the MOH will complete a study
of the causes of ECN and CO student attrition and possible remedies, and of
the feasibility of shortening ECN training, by December 31, 1982.
4.40       An assurance has been obtained that MOH will select thie locations
of the planned ECN and CO schools and engage qualified architects to
prepare the corresponding designs, detailed cost estimates, bid documents
and priced furniture and equipment lists and to suipervise construction, not
later than December 31, 1982.



-28-
4.41      Training of Patient Attendants.  The project would provide a one-
week training course for patient attendants at the district Jevel, concen-
trating on simple curative and MCH treatment.  The course wOuld be run by
MOH in cooperation with district staff and the African Medical and Research
Foundation. About 1,000 patient attendants would be trained during the
project period, or practically all patient attendants working at RHFs.
4.42      Training of ECN Trainers.  Many tutors at ECN schools are inade-
quately trained.  The Department of Advanced Nursing of tLil University of
Nairobi, in conjunction with the African Medical and Research Foundation,
has organized two-week refresher courses of diagnosis and prescription.
The project would provide for two similar courses to be held each year of
the project period, each with about 15 students, which would enable tutors
to update. their skills, not only in diagnosis and prescription, but also in
MCHI and FP.
4.43       Other Training Activities.  The project would provide for several
other types of training which are described in other sections of this
report: training of traditional birth attendants (Annex 5), inservice FP
training for ECNs, COs, patient attendants and FHFEs (paragraphs 4.30 and
4.31), refresher courses for FHFEs (paragraph 4.63), and courses in
diagnosis and prescription in connection with the new Drug Supply Program
(paragraph 4.46). Other important training activities not included in the
project, are associated with the Kenya Expanded Program of Immnunization4/
and the continuation of the RHC team training program (paragraph 2.02). To
assist in the design and coordination of the various inservice training
programs described above, the project would provide funds for two man-years
of consultant services.
4.44      Drug Supplies.  The irregular availability of drugs at RHFs and
its effects were mentioned in paragraph 2.23. The project would support a
new program to provide MOH RHFs with a steady supply of essential drugs
throughout the year. The MOH has drawn up standard lists of c[rugs for
health centers (47 items) and dispensaries (34 items) and estimated the
quantity of each drug required by each type of RHF per 1,000 attendances.
Drugs for each RHF would be prepackaged in sealed kits, which would be
resupplied on the basis of patient attendance reports. ContraLceptives will
continue to be supplied under a separate system. A new Drug Management
Unit in MOH will manage the new drug supply system.
4.45       Two districtwide pilot drug supply projects are well under way
and the initial results are encouraging.  It is expected that the system
would be extended to one-fourth of all districts by mid-1982, one-half by
mid-1983, three-fourths by mid-1984 and all districts by mid-1985. After
the prepackaged drugs have been delivered by the Central Medical Stores to
district headquarters, the new district Rural Health Management Teams
(paragraph 2.11 above) will be responsible for distribution, supervision,
reporting and forecasting needs.
4.46      The project includes a series of two-week courses (first course
and two refresher courses) in diagnosis and prescription for all COs, ECNs
and patient attendants in RHFs, and all COs and public health nurses at
4/  A comprehensive program to immunize children against tuberculosis,
poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and measles. The program
is being carried out with assistance from DANIDA. The proposed project
and the Expanded Program of Immunization would be mutually supportive.



-29-
district and provincial headquarters--a total of about 4,000 staff.  Train-
ing will be conducted at the Rural Health Training Centers with support
from the African Medical and Research Foundation. The Drug Management Unit
would monitor and evaluate the new system and take remedial action as
needed.
4.47      Although a great deal of thought and planning have gone into de-
signing the new drug supply system, two serious risks remain. First, there
is a danger that patients may bring pressure to bear on RHF staff to over-
prescribe drugs, with consequent shortages, or, if supplies are increased
accordingly, an excessive burden on the RHF budget. An assurance has been
obtained that MOH will carry out a study, on the basis of terms of
reference which will be agreed upon with IDA, SIDA and DANIDA, on the
options available for financing the expanding supply of drugs in government
facilities. Such study will be completd by June 30, 1984.
4.48      The second serious risk relates to the possibility that drug
shortages could occur in district hospitals while RHFs continue to be fully
supplied. In such a situation the District Medical Officer of Health might
well be under pressure to divert some of the supplies intended for RHFs to
the district hospital. The MOH would have to exercise close supervision to
prevent such diversion.
4.49      No diversion has occurred in the two pilot districts, but super-
vision in those districts has been more intensive than would be feasible on
a nationwide scale. On the other hand, there is some evidence of drug
overutilization in the pilot districts, which has led the MOH to increase
staff training and supervision for the program (relative to initial plans).
4.50      Rural Health Facilities.  The project construction program (MOH
facilities) would consist of the following:
(a) The improvement of about 25 substandard dispensaries Type I,
including the provision to each of three staff houses;
(b) The upgrading of about 37 dispensaries type I to type II in areas
where justified by density of population. Each would have four
staff houses;
(c) The construction of one RHC and four dispensaries type I in
selected high-priority unserved areas; and
(d) The provision of about six sets of staff houses for dispensaries
not covered by (a) or (b) above where the lack of staff housing
is a serious constraint to recruitment of ECNs.
The project would also include improvement of about 30 NCO dispensaries and
health centers (paragraph 4.78).
4.51      The proposed RHF construction program differs from the current
program in that (i) it shifts emphasis from RHCs to dispensaries, and (ii)
it goes further in relying on improvement and upgrading in preference to
new construction, which makes for a more efficient utilization of scarce
staff. The project's emphasis on dispensary upgrading and improving is
consistent with the planned extension of MCH and FP services below the RHC
level, at which these services are already well established in general.
4.52      Construction of RHFs is implemented by the MOW through private
contractors.  The MOH is responsible for planning of RHFs leading to iden-
tification of priority construction projects, for briefing the MOW's archi-
tects on each individual project, for reviewing the corresponding designs,



-30-
and on completion to ensure that facilities are furnished, equipped and
staffed on time.  The MOW produces the designs, carries out the bidding and
supervises the contractors. These arrangements work satisfactorily and
they would be maintained for construction of MOH RHFs under the proposed
project. Because of the need to complete the existing pipeline of RHFs,
there would be no construction of project-financed RHFs in 1982/83 and
1983/84.
4.53       In order to determine which RHFs are to be improved and upgraded,
and the location of new RHFs, the MOH would conduct a survey of existing
RHFs, and a mapping exercise using data from the 1979 Population Census.
Priority in determining project RHFs locations would be given to subloca-
tions which presently have less accessibility relative to the average, with
accessibility measured according to the parameters of the RHF model des-
cribed in paragraphs 2.12 to 2.14. An assurance has been obtained that the
results of the above survey and mapping exercise and the consequent
locational decisions will be submitted to IDA for comments, together with
the corresponding RHF preliminary designs and priced lists of furniture and
equipment, not later than December 31, 1982.
Support Systems
4.54      Transport for Rural Health Services.  The program would provide
one two-wheel drive sedan for the district rural health managEment teams
(paragraph 2.11) in each of Kenya's 41 districts except Nairobi and eight
sedans for supervision of rural health services from the provincial level.
It would also provide 47 ambulances with life-saving equipment to be
stationed at district and provincial hospitals.  At present rural patients
have to rely on ad-hoc arrangements to reach hospital in emergencies.
Although the program would not provide any cars for RHCs, most of which
have at least one car in fair condition, it would provide eight motorboats
with ambulance equipment, for eight RHCs located on the coast or the lake.
It would also provide about 210 motorcycles for public health technicians
stationed at RHCs and subcenters, who have to rely on public transport, and
about 2,400 bicycles for ECNs stationed at RHFs.  About one-half of all
these vehicles would be provided under the project; the rest would be
provided in the 1985-88 phase.
4.55      Maintenance.  The project would help to improve the maintenance
of MOH buildings, equipment and vehicles in rural areas (paragraphs 2.26
and 2.27), by (i) stepping up the maintenance program for unregistered
facilities, and (ii) setting up six maintenance training schools modelled
after the successful pilot project at Loitokitok District Hospital.
4.56       In each province one building inspector would be assigned full-
time to administer and supervise the maintenance program for unregistered
RHFs. Maintenance allocations in MOH's budget would be raised to a level
consonant with needs.  Each inspector would be provided with a four-wheel
drive vehicle to enable him to visit all unregistered RHFs in his province
regularly, and to supervise maintenance projects being carried out by
contractors.
4.57 The project would provide six maintenance training schools, each
attached to an existing Rural Health Training Center or District hospital.
Each school would be provided with workshops, an instruction room, storage,
a pick-up, and living quarters for four instructors and six students. Each
school would function as a maintenance unit for its district, and would
provide three types of training:



-31-
(a) Six maintenance technicians would be trained each year for
a full year in the maintenance and repair of health facilities
and equipment and, to a lesser extent, vehicles.  Upon gradua-
tion they would be employed by MOH at the district level, where
they would be responsible for repairs at the hospital and RHFs.
(b) Four 15-day courses a year, for 20 trainees, would be provided
for MOH drivers in: (i) driving and car maintenance; (ii) first
aid; and (iii) maintenance and minor repairs.  All MOH drivers
would have undergone this training by the end of three years.
(c) Rural health staff participating iQ team training courses
(paragraph 2.02) would receive three days of instruction in
the use of equipment, trouble-shooting and minor repairs.
4.58       An assurance has been obtained that, the government will select
the locations of the six maintenance training schools, and engage qualified
architects to prepare the corresponding designs, detailed cost estimates,
bid documents and priced furniture and equipment lists and to supervise
construction, not later than December 31, 1982.
4.59       Health Information System.  In April 1980 MOH created a Health
Information System by merging the Evaluation and Research division of NFWC
with the Vital Health Statistics Unit, the only two units in the MOI whose
primnary function was the systematic collection of data. It is intended
that the Health Information System, at present a pure information system,
should in due course undertake research and evaluation.
4.60       In addition to continuing to gather and process the types of in-
formation hitherto gathered by its two predecessor units, the Health
Information System will seek to gather information of a kind (e.g. the
physical status of health facilities, staffing patterns and qualifications,
number and state of repair of vehicles) not now readily available to the
MOH.  It will also produce an annual report on MQH activities.
4.61       To ensure coordination with other interested government depart-
ments and to provide a forum for drawing on experience available outside
MOH, a Health Information System Advisory Committee composed of representa-
tives of MOH, Central Bureau of Statistics, Registrar Generals Department,
and the University of Nairobi, will be created. The Health Information
System, once fully staffed, will have five sections: data analysis; evalu-
ation and research; documentatton and publication; adiministration; and com-
puter programming. Its field staff will include one senior statistical
officer and two statistical clerks in each district.
4.62       The project would support the consolidation of the Health
Information System through the funding of required additional staff,
training, fellowships, technical assistance, seminars for information
users, vehiicles and supplies. It would also provide funds for studies in
five areas: operations research; biomedical research; quality control of
the record system; 'knowledge, attitude and practice surveys; and impact
assessment. The allocation of these funds to specific studies, as well as
those earmarked for research and evaluation under other Part B project



-32-
components (paragraphs 4.33 and 4.74), would require the approval of an
Evaluation and Research Committee to be chaired by the Director of Medical
Services. This committee would also monitor the progress of the studies,
and have the power to suspend payments.  It would consist of serior staff
of interested government departments and the University of Naircbi.
4.63       Health Education.  The project would strengthen the existing pro-
gram of health education by:
(a)  Improving the use of existing resources by (i) completing
the staffing of the health education production unit Eo that
existing equipment and facilities can be adequately utilised;
(ii) posting HEOs to the Rural Health Training Centers to
ensure adequate attention to health education in rural health
team training; (iii) providing refresher and upgrading training
for HEOs and for FHFEs, inter alia in the skills necessary for
their new role in resupplying oral contraceptives;
(b)  Adapting health education to local cultures and languages instead
of relying too exclusively on centrally designed activities and
materials, by: (i) holding annual planning workshops with FHFEs
(at the district level) and HEOs (at the national level) to
assess and revise local health education activities; (ii) adding
HEOs to districts not yet covered and posting HEOs to provincial
MOH offices; and (iii) organizing health education prcgrams (in-
cluding radio) to be conducted by HEOs, FHFEs, and teams of
health workers, based on local circumstances and using local
languages and dialects; and
(c)  Introducing more efficient forms of communication by:  (i) using
radio programs to support the work of village health committees;
and (ii) making health education a part of the regular school
curriculum.
4.64       To permit decentralization, the Health Education Division's field
structure would be strengthened by establishing posts for: (a) seven pro-
vincial HEOs and (b) 41 district HEOs (many of which would be filled by
district-based HEOs already in the field). District HEOs would be respons-
ible for the technical supervision of FHFEs. An assurance has been
obtained that the MOH will establish the 48 field posts listed above by
June 30, 1983.
4.65       Production of materials would be carried out by the Health Educa-
tion Division-s production unit which would make any spare productive capa-
city available to meet the needs of other ministries and NGOs in Part A of
the project. To ensure the full utilization of this production unit, an
assurance has been obtained that the MOH will complete the interior of the
building it occupies, by December 31, 1982.
Experimental Community-Based Health Care
4.66      A key element of primary health care, or of any health care
system that attempts wide coverage at relatively low cost, is the use of
community health workers (CHVWs) with limited training to provide front-line
services and to refer patients to rural health facilities and hospitals.
At present, NCOs are undertaking 14 different projects in Kenya, making use
of CHWs. Most of these projects have been in operation for too short a
period to be properly evaluated. The present project would mark the begin-
ning of the MOH-s large-scale involvement in this potentially important
area where it would, however, respect the principle that communities served
by CHWs should play a decisive role in such schemes.



-33-
4.67       Characteristics of CHWs.  CHWs would be part-time employees of
the communities they serve, not of the GOK, and would be selected, paid and
directed by those communities. The CHW would work from his house in the
community.
4.68      Tasks.  Although the duties of CHWs would depend to some extent
on the local health situation, all would be expected to undertake the
treatment of common ailments (including oral rehydration), health educa-
tion, family planning counselling, motivation and client follow-up, the
administration of simple vaccines, and to take part in campaigns against
communicable diseases. They would not at first supply non-clinical
contraceptives or resupply oral contraceptives, although they may be
allowed to do so later (see paragraph 4.74 below).
4.69      Organization of the program.  The program would be organized at
three levels: KOH headquarters, districts, and communities. At the MOH
headquarters there would be a Conmunity-Based '.ealth Care Development Unit,
which would help to formulate policy, promote community-based health care
schemes, review and approve proposals for schemes to be funded from project
funds, set gui(lelines for CHW stipends, train staff of district Rural
Realth Management Teams in community-based health care, and monitor and
evaluate schemes. The Development Unit would be assisted by a Resource
Advisory Group fromn the Department of Community Medicine of the University
of Nairobi, the African Medical and Research Foundation and UNICEF, who
will provide technical assistance.
-T.7(     At the district level the Hlealth Sub-Committee of the District
Development Committee, working in close cooperation with the district Rural
Health MKanagement team, would be responsible for the promotion and follow-
up of community-based health care schemes. Interested communities would be
assisted to establish Community Health Committees which (with district
staff assistance) would prepare proposals for MOH funding. Once a scheme
is approved, the Community Health Committee would select the CHWs and would
be responsible for their administrative supervision and for their payment.
Technical supervision would be provided by RHFs, which would also distrib-
ute drugs and supplies to CHWs. This supervision would entail assistance
in community health activities as jell as on-the-job review of CHW's work.
District Development Committees would oversee the work of Community Health
Committees.
4.71      Training.  Training required for development of the CHW program
would be provided for the staff of district Rural Health Management Teams
and Development Comnmittees, RHU staff, CHW trainers, the CHWs themselves,
and members of Community Health Committees (for details see Annex 6).
4.72       Phasing.  There would be roughly one CHW to every 1,000 people.
The programn would be introduced gradually.  The aim would be to cover one
RHYI in each project year, for a total of six RHUs by 1988.  The average
population of a RHIU is about 54,000 (paragraph 2.02). Thus the program
might be expected to cover a population of about 400,000 people by 1988
(taking into account population growth), or about 2% of the total rural
population.  The program would be experimental, and would have to be
evaluated carefully (see paragraplh 4.74 below). The RHUs chosen would have
to be among those with the highest ratios of actual staff to norms, to
allow for adequate supervision of CHWs.



-34-
4.73      Equipment, Supplies and Stipends.  Each CHW would receive an
operational manual and a small case containing drugs, medical supplies and
information and education materials. These inputs would be provided
through the MOH. CHW stipends would be financed by the communities from
their own resources. The MOH, however, would provide the communities with
technical assistance regarding various techniques for raising those
resources. All incremental costs associated with the CHW program, except
CHW stipends, would be financed by the project during its durat:ion.
4.74      Evaluation.  MOH would conduct two evaluations of the CHW
program: one towards the end of 1983 and the other towards the end of
1985. The first of these evaluations would include a reassessrnent of the
feasibility of allowing CHWs to distribute and/or resupply contraceptives.
The project would provide funds for the first of these evaluations, includ-
ing three man-years of technical assistance, part of which could also be
used for general managerial assistance to the Development Unit.
4.75      Risks.  The CHW component carries two main risks.  First, as
experience elsewhere demonstrates, it is very difficult to establish
adequate linkages between the formal health services and community health
workers. This difficulty is compounded by the MOH's lack of experience in
this area. The proposed creation of a Resource Advisory Group and the pro-
vision of funds for technical assistance would reduce problems of organiza-
tion. Secondly, there is the risk that some of the communities may not be
able to pay CHWs regular stipends. Since the Government views the payment
of stipends by the communities as essential, the program would be confined
to communities which demonstrate their willingness to raise the necessary
funds. The Development Unit would provide technical assistance in this
respect.
Non-Governmental Organizations
4.76      The role of church-sponsored NGOs in the provision of rural
health services was mentioned in paragraph 2.09 above.  While quality of
the services varies, some are of a very high standard. All suffer from
some degree of shortage of staff, and very few of their dispensaries pro-
vide FP services. Unlike those of the MOH, NGO facilities rarely run out
of drugs and hence maintain service throughout the year. In general, the
services follow the lines laid down by the MOH. Like MOH facilities, many
NGO dispensaries and health centers require physical renovation and expan-
sion. The NGOs also have a long history of conducting nurse training pro-
grams in some of their hospitals.
4.77      The inclusion of NGOs in the project represents a big step
forward in the coordination of health services in rural areas. The NGOs
included in the project are coordinated by either the Kenya Catholic Secre-
tariat or the Protestant Churches Medical Association, and in the rest of
this section, they are accordingly simply described as "Catholic" or
"Protestant" as the case may be.
4.78      Expansion of MCH and FP Services.  The project would include up-
grading of about 30 NGO dispensaries and health centers into MCH and FP
SDPs. This represents about 8% of all NGO RHFs. The limitation to 30 RHFs
is not due to implementation constraints but rather to a financial con-
straint related to considerations of project balance. The Catholic SDPs
would instruct couples in natural methods of family planning, especially
the ovulation method. Protestant SDPs would provide the full range of FP
services.



-35-
4.79       ECN Training.  NGOs are converting their nursing schools into the
standard MOR type of ECN school. The project would assist in the conver-
sion of three such schools. Each of the schools would also be provided
with a rural health demonstration center for practical training. These
centers would be provided by upgrading existing rural health centers.
4.80       Outreach Services.  NGOs have successfallv provided regular
dispensary-type mobile services in communities without local health
services. The project would add six mobile clinics to existing (Catholic)
services. Outreach services would be further strengthened by the addition
of 12 ECNs to provide community-based health services.
4.81       Implementation.  The Kenya Catholic Secretariat and the Protest-
ant Churches Medical Association would be responsible for implementing
their parts of the Project.  A coordinator would be appointed within the
MOH's Core Project Unit to facilitate coordination between the two NGO
organizations and the MOH in project implementation.
4.82       An assurance has been obtained that the Kenya Catholic
Secretariat and the Protestant Churches Medical Association will, in
cooperation with MOH, determine the locations of the new 30 MCH/FP service
delivery points to be established, and of the three nursing schools and
three RHCs to be upgraded; and that the list of these locations will be
submitted to IDA for its review, together with the corresponding
preliminary type designs and priced lists of furniture and equipment, not
later than December 31, 1982.
Innovative Activities
4.83      A small portion (about 1.9%) of the total project cost would be
reserved for selected innovative activities not identified at appraisal
that would contribute to the extension of rural health and FP services.
The flexibility thus provided is especially desirable in the present case,
because the project would absorb practically all the external assistance
available for those services during the project period. An example of
activities that could be financed from this component is the extension of
MCH/FP services provided by non-Church NCOs. Another example would be a
critical study of the present nutritional situation and interventions. The
MOH would submit proposals to fund activities from this component to the
appropriate financing agency for its approval. It is suggested that pro-
posals be required to meet the following criteria: (i) relevance to
project objectives; (ii) cost-effectiveness; (iii) feasibility of adminis-
tration and evaluation; and (iv) innovativeness.
V. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
A. Cost
5.01       The total estimated base cost of the project is US$47.1 million
equivalent, at prices of November 1981. To this slhould be added, US$2.1
million of physical contingencies and US$11.8 milion of price contingen-
cies, for a total estimated project cost of US$61.0 million equivalent.
5.02       The foreign exchange component is estimnated at abouit 35% of total
project cost. Taxes and duties included in total project cost are esti-



-36-
mated at about US$3 million.  Capital costs for civil works, furniture,
equLipment and vehicles account for 39.4% of total base ccst, and opera-
tional and maintenance costs for 45.1% of total base cost. The remaining
15.5% is accounted for by Innovative Activities (Part B) and Unprogrammed
Funds (Part A), which cannot yet be divided between capital and operational
and meintenance costs. Table 9 below summarizes the protect cost estimates
by expenditure category. (Detailed cost estimates for the entire six-year
program are shown in Annex 1).
5.03      From a functional point of view, the largest share of project
funds (43.4%) is allocated to manpower, drugs and facilities. The popula-
tion/FP information and education activities of Part A account for 20.1% of
project base cost. Direct FP services input accounts for 4.5% of base
cost. The rest of the project funds are allocated to support systems
(20.0%), experimental community based health care (1.6%), NGOs (9.3%), and
innovative activities (1.9%).   A breakdown of project costs by functional
category is given in Table 10 below.
5.04      The estimated costs of construction and furniture are based on
November 1981 prices and experience under the first project. Cost esti-
mates for equipment and vehicles are also based on November 1981 prices.
Salaries and training costs are based on standard Government salary and
allowance scales as of October 1980, updated to November 1981 by using the
rate of increase in the domestic average consumer price index. Local
advisory services have been costed at an average of US$1,000 per man-month,
and foreign advisory services at US$5,000 per man-month (these figures
include all expenses).
5.05      The contingency allowance of US$13.9 million equivalent, repre-
senting 2 2.8% of total project costs, includes: (a) Physical contingen-
cies for unforeseen factors estimated at 15% of the base zost of civil
works, and 10% of the base cost of furniture and equipment; and (b) price
contingencies averaging 24.0% of base cost and physical contingencies.
Price contingencies for local costs were calculated on the assumption of a
13.0% inflation rate in 1981, 13% in 1982, 9% in 1983, and 8% annually
afterwards. Price contingencies for the foreign exchange component were
calculated on the assumption of an inflation rate of 9.0 :Eor 1981, 8.5% for
1982, 7.5% in 1983 and 6% annually afterwards.

B. Financing
5.06      Project Financing Plan.  A project financing plan is needed at the
present time for the 1982-85 project only: the financing plan for the 1985-88
project would be prepared subsequent to the corresponding appraisal mission in
mid-1984.  The financing of project costs (1982-85) would be shared as follows
(a detailed financing plan is given in Annexes 8 and 9):

5.07      The proposed Credit of US$23 million (SDR 20.5 million) to the Kenya
Government would beon standard IDA terms. The contributions of the remaining
external assistance agencies would be in the form of grants. Total foreign
financing would cover about 82% of net project cost, including 100% of foreign
exchange cost and about 71% of local expenditures.
5.08      Financing of Parts A and B items by IDA, SIDA, DANIDA, USAID, ODA,
UNICEF and UNFPA would be on a parallel basis (see Annexes 8 and 9 for details).
As a condition of credit effectiveness, the Government will make arrangements
satisfactory to the Association to obtain external assistance amounting to not
less than US$24.8 million equivalent. The specific Part A items to be financed
by each donor and government have been identified for the first project
year only (see Annex 8). For the second and third project years, the
determination of specific Part A items to be financed by each of the donors and
government will be made at the time of the review by donors of the corresponding
annual work plans, in consultation with the Council.
5.09       Part A expenditures associated with activities to be carried out by
the Secretariat of the National Council on Population and Development, or by
non-governmental organization, will be allocated to the budget of the Office of
the Vice President and Ministry of Home Affairs. Part A expenditures associated
with activities to be carried out by other government agencies will be allocated
to the budgets of those agencies. All Part B expenditures would be allocated to
the MOHIs budget. Expenditures related to the NGO component would appear in
MOH's budget as a grant to the NGOs, separate from the ongoing annual grant



-40-
already included in the MOH's budget.  The NGOs would retain title to project
assets beyond the project period, and would commit themselves to the adequate
maintenance and operation of those assets.
5.10      Fiscal Feasibility.  The bulk (about 80%) of project 2osts relate to
Part B and would have to be included in the MOH budget.  The total MOH budget
allocation for FY80/81 was about K.Sh. 1,046 million (of which 78.5%, or about
K.Sh. 821 million, was for recurrent expenditures). The GOK-s contribution to
annual Part B project expenditures would represent about 2.5% oE the total MOH-s
budget in FY80/81 on the average for 1982-84.
5.11      The increase in MOH-s operating and maintenance costs due to the pro-
gram would continue beyond the program period. Incremental ope;_ating and
maintenance costs arising from Part B program activities are es:imated at about
K.Sh. 125 million in FY87/88 (at 1981 prices). Most of these costs would recur
in subsequent years, when they would have to be met entirely from local funds.
An assessment of whether it would be realistic to expect that these costs could
be absorbed in the MOH's recurrent budget has been made based oln the following
assumptions: (a) Kenya's GNP grows in real terms at an average annual rate of
between 4 and 5% in the seven-year period 1980/81-1987/88; (b) :he share of the
total expenditures of all Ministries to GNP remains constant at the FY80/81
level; (c) the share of MOH's budget (development plus recurrent) in the total
expenditures of Ministries grows from 6.2% in FY80/81 to 6.8% in FY83/84 (as
assumed in the Fotward Budget 1981/82-1983/84) and remains consl:ant at that
level through FY87/88; and (d) the share of recurrent expenditures in the MOH's
budget remains constant at the FY80/81 level. Under these assumptions, the
MOH's recurrent budget would grow (at constant 1981 prices) froml K.Sh. 821
million in FY80/81 to between K.Sh. 1,178 million and K.Sh. 1,260 million in
FY87/88, depending on whether GNP grows at 4 or 5%. Thus, incremental opera-
tional and maintenance costs arising from the program in FY87/88 would represent
between 35 and 28% of the total increase in the MOH's recurrent budget in the
period. Relevant subvotes of the MOH's budget under which program expenditures
would be classified comprised 24.3% of MOH's recurrent budget in FY80/81. More-
over, other developmental activities in the period outside the program and under
these subvotes are expected to be of relatively minor magnitude. It can be then
concluded that under the above assumptions the program would imply a modest
shift in the composition of expenditures within the MOH's recurrent budget in
favor of rural health and preventive services. This shift is consistent with
the Government's stated policies and in the interest of the majclrity of the
country's population (paragraph 2.32).
5.12      Project Preparation Facility.  An advance of US$332,000 equivalent has
been granted by IDA to the GOK to finance certain expenditures rLecessary to com-
plete the preparation of the project. (For details see Annex 71.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation
6.01       There would be separate arrangements for the implementation of Parts A
and B of the project (See Chart 2). For Part A, the actual information and
education activities would be carried out by the participating a.gencies
(Ministries and NGOs). Coordination and monitoring, common support activities,
the preparation of overall annual workplans, procurement of goods for NGOs,
progress reports and reimbursement applications and the transfer of funds would
be carried out by the Secretariat of the National Council (paragraph 4.18),
whose chief executive would be appointed as Project Director, Part A, and would
report to the Permanent Secretary in the Office of the Vice President and



-41-
Ministry of Home Affairs.  Each of the participating government agencies would
procure its own goods and services. Part B of the project would be carried out
by the MOH, with the NGO component carried out jointly by MOH and the NGOs.
Details of the implementation of specific components of Part B are described in
Section IV.C. above and are summarized in Annex 2.
6.02      Although the MOH project components would be mainly carried out by
existing MOH units with appropriate strengthening through the project (e.g.
NFWC, Planning and Implementation Unit, Drug Management Unit, Health Education
Unit, Health Information System, district staff), or by a new ad hoc unit in the
case of the community-based health care component, a strong Core MOH Project
Unit would be appointed for (i) the monitoring and supervision of Part B
activities; (ii) keeping Part B project accounts; (iii) preparing Part B
disbursement applications; and (iv) preparing Part B progress reports for
donors. For the NGO component, functions (ii) and (iv) would be based on
information provided by NGO staff.
6.03      The head of the Core MOH Project Unit would also be Project Director,
Part B. Ideally he should be an experienced manager with sufficient seniority
to be able to deal effectively with the heads of participating MOH units and
NGOs. The Project Director, Part B would report to the Director of Medical
Services. Besides the director, the Core Staff would include twelve
professional-level staff plus several support staff.
6.04       The staffing of the following positions in the MOH's Core Project Unit
with full-time personnel whose experience and qualifications are acceptable to
IDA will be a condition of Credit effectiveness: Director, Financial Controller,
Senior Program Evaluator, Procurement Officer, and Administrative Secretary.
6.05      The implementation of Part B components would be overseen by a
Steering Committee comprised of the Permanent Secretary of MOH (Chairman), the
Director of Medical Services, the Chief Nursing Officer, the Deputy Secretary,
for Development in MOH, and the Director of the Core Project Unit (Secretary).
The Steering Committee would meet quarterly to review project progress and to
solve any problems of intra-ministerial coordination that may arise in the
course of project implementation.
6.06      As the MOH is about to embark on a new phase of building up its rural-
health services, the time seems propitious for an indepth review of the MOH-s
organizational structure and administrative procedures, especially as they may
affect project implementation. To this effect, the MOH has agreed to a compre-
hensive management study to be undertaken by independent consultants. The
study, to be financed by SIDA, is expected to start in early 1982. The final
report of the study would be discussed among the MOH, IDA and the donor agencies
participating in the proposed project.  An assurance has been obtained that the
MOH will prepare a timetable to implement those recommendations of the
consultants' report to which MOH, SIDA and IDA agree, not later than three
months after the completion of the final version of the consultants' report.
Implementation of these recommendations would be reviewed at the time of
appraisal of the 1985-88 project.
B. Procurement
6.07       Financing of Part A expenditures by IDA, USAID, ODA, and UNFPA would
be on a parallel basis. Specific items to be financed by government and
external financing agencies are known at this time for the first project year
only (see Annex 8).  Part A entails no civil works and the amount of hardware
(equipment and vehicles) to be procured annually would be small.  The
Secretariat of the National Council on Population and Development and each of



-42-
the participating agencies would procure their own goods and services, except
that goods for activities to be carried out by NGOs will be procured by the
Secretariat. Financing of Part B expenditures by IDA, SIDA, DINIDA, USAID,
UNICEF and ODA would also be on a parallel basis (see Annex 9). Procurement of
Part B goods and civil works would be carried out by MOH and the Central Tender
Board, including those goods and civil works associated with the NGO component.
6.08      For Parts A and B goods financed by IDA, the following procurement
procedures would be followed:
(a) Civil Works: The civil works to be financed by
IDA consist of small projects scattered throughcut
the country. Moreover, the bulk of these civil
works constitute upgrading and improvement rather
than new construction. Civil works contracts over
US$2 million would be let through international
competitive bidding. Contracts below US$2 million
would be awarded after local competitive bidding;
following government procedures, which are accept-
able to the Association. Procurement of civil
works would be based on bid packages, prepared in
such a way as to encourage competition. Packaging
would be subject to IDA-s approval. In remote
areas where insufficient competition and unreascon-
able prices would be likely to result from bid-
ding, the MOW's force account may be used, subject
to the prior approval of the Association.
(b) Vehicles and Equipment: Contracts above
US$100,000 equivalent would be let through inter-
national competitive bidding. Contracts below
US$100,000 equivalent, but in aggregate not
exceeding US$1,000,000, would be let through local
competitive bidding. Procurement of vehicles and
equipment would be based on bid packages, prepared
in such a way as to encourage competition.
Packaging would be subject to IDA's approval. For
small purchases up to US$50,000 equivalent each,
but in aggregate not exceeding US$500,000, prudent
shopping could be used, but at least three quota-
tions would have to be obtained.
(c) Furniture: Contracts for US$50,000 equivalent or
more would be let through local competitive bid-
ding, which proved appropriate in previous
experience. Appropriate packaging, subject to
IDA-s approval, would be conducted. For purchases
for less than US$50,000 equivalent, but in aggre-
gate not exceeding US$250,000, prudent shopping
could be used, but at least three quotations would
have to be obtained.
6.09      For items procured under international competitive bidding, oreference
may be accorded at GOK's request to local manufacturers of furniture and equlip-
ment at 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods, or the amount of customs duty
and other import taxes levied on a non-exempt importer, whichever is lower.
The procurement rules of paragraph 6.08 would apply to all of Parts A and B,
including the NGO components.



-43-
6.10       Contract Review.  All bidding packages for works estimated to cost
over US$80,000 equivalent and bidding packages for goods over US$50,000 equiva-
lent would be subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation
resulting in a coverage of about 95% of the total estimated value of works con-
tracts and about 88% of goods contracts.  The balance of contracts would be
subject to random post-review by the Bank after contract award.
C. Accounting, Auditing and Disbursements
Disbursements
6.11      Funds from the Credit account would be disbursed according to the
following schedule:

1/ The "Unallocated" figure was arrived at by taking 50% of total contingency
financing by IDA. The remaining 50% was included with the corresponding
expenditure categories.
6.12      Disbursements against categories 2(a), 2(b), 2(c) and 2(d) would be
fully documented. Disbursements against category 2(e) would be made against
statements of expenditure. For categories l(a) and (b), disbursements would be
fully documented. Disbursements against categories l(c) and (d) would be made
against statements of expenditure. An estimated time schedule of IDA
disbursements is given in Annex 3. The documentation for statements of
expenditure under categories I and 2 would not be submitted to IDA but would be
retained by the Borrower for inspection by supervision missions.
Accounts and Audit
6.13      Part A.  The Secretariat of the coordinating Council (para. 4.15) will
maintain separate detailed project accounts for expenditures incurred by the
Council itself and its Secretariat. The participating agencies (Ministries and
NGOs) will keep similar accounts for their corresponding project expenditures.
Summaries of these accounts will be submitted quarterly to the Secretariat,
which will use them to prepare consolidated project accounts for Part A. The
Secretariat's and the participating agencies- project accounts will be audited
by the Auditor General.
6.14      Part B.  The Core MOH Project Unit (para. 6.02) working in close co-
operation with the Accounting division and other relevant MOH units, will main-
tain separate detailed project accounts for all Part B expenditures except those
related to NCOs. The latter will maintain their own detailed project accounts
and will submit quarterly summaries to the Project Director--Part B. MOH and
NGO project accounts will be audited by the Auditor General.
Financial Reporting
6.15      The Project Directors of Parts A and B would be responsible for pre-
paring an annual report summarizing all project financial transactions in the
period, and the state of project accounts by the end of the period, starting



-45-
with FY82/83.  These financial reports, accompanied by suitable auditors-
reports, should be submitted to IDA not later than December 31 of each year,
starting with December 31, 1983, for FY82/83 operations.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION, RISKS AND EVALUATION
A. Justification
7.01       The justification of the project lies in its expected impact on (i)
fertility, and (ii) the health of the rural population.
7.02       Fertility Impact.  The project would more than double the number of
RHFs offering daily full FP services (para 4.27).  It would also greatly
increase the regularity of FP services in existing SDPs by making it possible to
use for FP services several categories of RHF personnel who have not hitherto
taken part in this work (para. 4.28).  This would also allow provision of
limited FP services in non-SDP RHFs. Moreover, the project would assist in the
creation of greater demand for FP services through its information and education
activities. The likely impact of all these project activities, and of the
similar activities planned for the 1985-88 phase, on the number of FP users and
on the CBR was indicated in paragraph (4.04) in the form of a range:  a "low"
projection where the CBR would fall from about 53 per thousand at present to 51
per thousand in 1987, and a "high" projection where the CBR would fall to 48 per
thousand in 1987. The "low" projection would require the number of contracep-
tion users to increase by a factor of about 2-1/2 times over the 1980 level,
while the "high" projection would require a four-fold increase.
7.03       In addition to its short-term impact on the number of FP users, the
improvement of FP services makes good sense from a medium to long term point of
view. Without continuous building up of FP services a situation could develop
in which an increase in demaand for FP services, due to the start of a downward
trend in desired family size could not be adequately met. Since experience
shows that it takes a long time to increase FP services substantially, and since
the marginal cost of providing these services in an integrated health system as
in Kenya is low, it seems reasonable to increase FP capacity beyond what would
be justified in terms of present demand alone.
7.04       It is important, however, that the GOK should not confine itself to
providing an effective service delivery network and then wait passively for
demnand to increase in response to socio-economic modernizing influences. A
strong population/family planning information and education drive is needed to
increase awareness of the benefits of limiting family size.  Part A activities
would therefore constitute a key element in Kenya-s population program in the
1980s. During 1982-88, at least 75% of the population over the age of six would
be exposed to direct program communication, and many of them will pass on to
others what they have learned. Although it is difficult to forecast the change
in demand for FP that would result from the proposed information and education
activities of Part A, experience elsewhere strongly suggests that a well-
organized information and education program is a necessary, if not a sufficient,
condiFion of a successful FP prograt[.
7.05       Impact on Rural Health.  Health benefits that would be generated by
the project -an be classified in three categories:



-46-
(a) Some rural people that without the project would not be
provided with any primary-level health services within the
next three years, would be so provided with the project.5/
Existing surveys indicate that rural people living further
than five miles away from a RHF do not avail themselves of
primary-level health services, except in cases of extreme
emergencies, because the costs of doing so are perceived
to outweigh benefits. This condition could be called
"total primary-level service inaccessibility". About 23%
of the rural population, or 2.8 million people, were in
this category in 1977 (Table 6).
(b) Some rural people that without the project would
not be provided within the next three years with
certain important primary-level health services
(e.g. MCH, FP) would be so provided because of t:he
project.
(c) Some rural people that without the project woulcl be
provided with primary-level health services at a
certain average annual frequency, with the project
would be provided with such services at a higher fre-
quency, or would be provided with a higher quality of
services at the same frequency, or both.
7.06      Benefits type (a) would be generated by the project construction of
new facilities [para. 4.50(c)]. This would allow provision of rural health
services to between 30,000 and 40,000 people. This is a very modest effort
relative to the needs, but consolidation of the existing dispensary network is a
higher priority because of its implications for expansion of MCH/FP services to
the bulk of the rural population.
7.07      The im act of the project would be pronounced with regard to type (b)
benefits.  This refers mainly to MCH and FP services.  Present]y few dispen-
saries provide either type of services. Under the project, daily MCH/FP
services would be introduced in 300 MOH RHFs, mostly dispensaries, and in 30 NGO
RHFs, and this would benefit a population of up to about 2,500,000 people. The
extension of MCH services made possible through project inputs, combined with
the Kenya Expanded Program of Immunization (see paragraph 4.43>1 would be
expected to raise the percentage of fully immunized children under five years of
age from about 25% currently to 60-70% by the mid 1980s.
7.08      The project would also generate very substantial henefits type (c).
Since MOH RHFs are closed on an average about 25% of the time due to lack of
drugs, the annual per capita frequency of use of RHFs would be expected to
increase by at least that much once the new drug supply progranL for RHFs is in
place nationwide (some of this increase would be a diversion from use of dis-
trict hospital facilities, but it would be an efficient diversion).  Frequency
of use would be also expected to increase on account of better staffing of RRFs
(paragraph 4.35).  Quality of services provided would increase with both better
drug availability and better staffing and training (paragraphs 4.41 to 4.43)
provided through the project.
5/ Benefits arising from capital goods provided through the project would,
of course, continue to be forthcoming well beyond the project period.



-47-
B.  Risks
7.09      Part A.  Part A is subject to the serious risk that, because the
members of the Council who, as such, must choose among competing proposals for
the allocation of resources, would be representatives of the agencies submitting
these proposals, quid pro quo considerations would prevail instead of impartial
evaluation. During the project period, this risk would be reduced by requiring
the annual plans to be approved by the external financing agencies.Beyond the
project period, the experience by then acquired by the staff of the Councils
Secretariat should serve to ensure an adequate degree of quality control of
proposals.
7.10      Part B.  The principal risk regarding Part B is whether the MOH has
the capacity to utilize project resources effectively and to meet the exacting
administrative requirements of so complex a project. The deployment of a strong
core project staff (paragraph 6.02), and the provisions in the project for the
additional staff and consultants estimated to be needed for promnpt implementa-
tion of MOH project components, would lessen this risk to an acceptable low
level. The general implementation capabilities of MOH are also likely to
improve following implementation of the recommendations of the planned manage-
nent study (paragraph 6.06).
7.11      The risks associated with the more innovative components of Part B,
drug supplies and community-based health care, have been pointed out in paras.
4.47, 4.48 and 4.75. One factor that might jeopardize the success of the man-
power and training component is the almost certainty that, given present in-
centives, ECNs and COs will continue to prefer hospital to rural health posts.
Thus, in order to achieve the planned distribution of staff (paragraph 4.35),
the MOH would have to monitor carefully job offers in both sectors, using the
personnel monitoring system recommended in paragraph 4.36. The remaining Part B
components consist mainly of extensions of current activities, and therefore do
not carry the same degree of risk as the more innovative components of the
project.
C. Evaluation
7.12      Project evaluation would cover inputs, processes and outputs.  Input
evaluation compares actual with planned inputs. Process evaluation measures the
progress of the project in terms of the attainment of intermediate objectives--
e.g. in the present case, increase of nunber of SDPs and trained personnel, con-
traceptive prevalence rate, percentage of married women with knowledge of modern
FP methods--necessary to reach the final objectives. The values of these
variables at any stage of the project are compared with the corresponding values
before the project and with those it was planned that the project should
achieve.  Output evaluation applies similar comparisons to the variables whose
changes in desired directions constitute the ultimate objectives of the project.
In the present case, output would have to be measured in terms of fertility
(CBR, total fertility rate), mortality (CDR, life expectancy) and morbidity
(incidence of major diseases, average annual days of sickness by sex and age
group).
7.13      The evaluation of Part A activities would be the responsibility of
the Coordinating Council. The evaluation of Part B activities would be the
responsibility of the Core MOH Project Staff, assisted by other MOH units as
appropriate. For the drug supplies and community-based health care components,
special evaluation provisions have been built into the project (paras. 4.46 and
4.74 respectively).



-48-
7.14       Input evaluation, which would form the main part of project progress
reports to be prepared by MOH and the Coordinating Council, is not expected to
present difficulties. Process evaluation of Part A would include measurement of
how far I&E messages are acceptable and comprehensible to the audiences. The
Council would also conduct periodic surveys of public knowledge, attitudes and
practices concerning population and FP and compare the results with the prepro-
ject situation as reflected in the Kenya World Fertility Survey. Process
evaluation of Part B would be based on the MOHs system of service statistics
(which would be strengthened through the project).
7.15      The most important form of evaluation is that of outputs--in the
present case, declines in fertility, mortality and morbidity. In countries
with a well-developed vital statistics system, changes in fertility and mortal-
ity can normally be detected through that system. This is not the case in
Kenya, where reliable data on fertility and mortality can only be obtained
through surveys. A good baseline is provided by the 1977-78 Kenya World
Fertility Survey and the 1979 Population Census. An assurance has been obtained
that the government will engage a qualified institution to conduct a
fertility/mortality survey during the course of the project, to allow an
assessment of progress towards the goals of declines in fertility and
mortality. There are as yet no useful baseline morbidity data and one of the
main tasks of the new Health Information System would be to define appropriate
indicators of morbidity and to design cost-effective ways of measuring them.
Thus progress towards a reduction of morbidity would be measurable for at least
part of the project period.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement with the government was reached on the
following points:
(a) The government will appoint the members of the
National Council on Population and Development,
and will issue appropriate policy and procedural
guidelines, by October 1, 1982. The Council will
submit by March 31 of each year (beginning with
March 31, 1983) the draft annual work-plan for the
following year for the interagency I&E program to
the funding agencies supporting Part A for their
approval (paragraph 4.21), and will subsequently
agree with those agencies on a detailed financing
plan for the activities in the work-plan
(paragraph 5.08);
(b) The MOH will prepare a detailed timetable for the
conversion of all Government RHFs not presently
functioning as MCH/FP SDPs into full SDPs, and for
their interim conversion into limited SDPs supply-
ing non-medical contraceptives and resupplying
oral contraceptives, by December 31, 1982
(paragraph 4.29);
(c) The-MOH will set up a system to show the number,
type and posting by specific facility of rural
health staff, by December 31, 1982 (paragraph
4.36);

and CO student attrition and possible remedies,
and of the feasibility of shortening ECN training,
not later than December 31, 1982 (paragraph 4.39);



-49-
(e) The MOH will conduct a study, the terms of
reference of which would be agreed upon with TDA,
SIDA and DANIDA, of the options available for
financing the expanding supply of drugs in
government facilities, by June 30, 1984.
(f) The MOH will establish the following posts: (i)
seven provincial health education officers; and
(ii) 41 district health education officers, by
June 30, 1983 (paragraph 4.64);
(g) The MOH will complete the interior of the building
housing its health education production unit, by
December 31, 1982 (paragraph 4.65);
(h) The MOH will prepare a timetable for implementa-
tion of those recommendations of the management
consultants report to which MOH, SIDA and IDA
agree, not later than three months after
completion of the final version of the report
(paragraph 6.06);
(i) The Project Directors of Parts A and B will each
submit to IDA an annual report summarizing all
project financial transactions in the period, and
the state of project accounts by the end of the
period, accompanied by suitable auditors' reports,
not later than December 31 of each year, starting
with December 31, 1983 (paragraph 6.15);
(j) The MOH will engage a qualified institution to con-
duct a fertility/mortality survey during the course
of the project (paragraph 7.15);
(k) The MOH should select the locations for the new CO,
ECN, and maintenance training schools to be built
under the project, and select and appoint qualified
architects to prepare the corresponding designs,
detailed cost estimates, bid documents and priced
furniture and equipment lists, and to supervise
construction, not later than December 31, 1982
(paragraphs 4.40 and 4.58);
(1) The MOH should conduct a survey of its existing
RHFs and with the help of this survey and criteria
agreed with the appraisal mission, determine the
locations of the approximately 25 dispensaries to
be improved, 37 dispensaries to be upgraded, and
the one new RHC and four new dispensaries Type I
and six sets of dispensary staff houses to be
built. Details of the above should be submitted to
IDA for its review, together with the corresponding
preliminary type designs and priced lists for
furniture and equipment, not later than December
31, 1982 (paragraph 4.53);
(m)  The Kenya Catholic Secretariat and the Protestant
Churches Medical Association should, in coopera-
tion with MOH, determine the locations of the new
30 MCH/FP service delivery points to be estab-
lished, and of the three nursing schools and three
RHCs to be upgraded. The list of these locations
should be submitted to IDA for its review, to-
gether with the corresponding preliminary type de-
signs and priced lists of furniture and equipment,
not later than December 31, 1982 (paragraph 4.82).

KENYA--Projection of Family Planning Users and New Acceptors,
1982-1987
Forecasting the likely pace of expansion of the family plan-
ning program over the next six years which might be expected to occur
in view of project interventions is very difficult, especially since
program performance has been stalled in recent years (paragraph 3.15).
Nonetheless, an attempt is made below (see attached table) to forecast
a likely range of FP users for the period 1981-87. Implications in
terms of estimated numbers of new acceptors needed are also shown.
According to the 1977-78 Kenya World Fertility Survey, 17% of married
women stated that they wanted no more children (paragraph 3.20). This
figure provides a rough estimate of the proportion who in principle
would be willing to practice FP permanently, although probably on the
high side, since it has been observed in other countries that there is
usually a gap between attitude and practice of FP. On the other hand,
at any given point in time there would also be a number of women who
would be willing to practice FP on a temporary basis for spacing
purposes. These considerations suggest that it would not be unreason-
able to expect the improvement of FP services to be effected through
the project (which includes an almost doubling of FP SDPs) to be asso-
ciated with an increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate from
about 5% now to about 10% by 1987, even assuming no substantial short-
term effect of the project's information and education activities on
average desired family size. If the latter assumption is relaxed, a



-70-
ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 3
larger expansion could take place. Experience from other countries in
Asia and Latin America shows that very rarely the pace of decline in
the CBR has exceeded one per thousand point per year. Hlence we could
assume that the maximum increase to be expected in the CPR in Kenya
from 1982 to 1987 would be an increase that is consistent with a de-
cline in the CBR of about five per thousand points, from about 53 in
1982 to about 48 in 1987. This would correspond to a CPR of about 17%
by 1987. In the low projection case, in which the CPR attains a value
of 10% by 1987, the corresponding value of the CBR would be 51 per
thousand.

KENYA--INDICATIVE PROGRAM FOR INFORMATION
AND EDUCATION, FIRST YEAR
The proposed indicative program consists of the following 16
activities to be implemented by two ministries and six NGOs:
(a) The Ministry of Economic Planning and Development (MHEPD), Rural
Services Coordination and Training Unit: Population Documenta-
tion and Clearinghouse--This unit would assemble the data-base
required for program coordination and implementation (e.g.
inventories of resources, research findings, data on program
audiences) and would encourage its utilization through a training
program. The project would provide office furniture and
equipment, a vehicle, salaries and housing allowances for staff,
vehicle operating and maintenance costs, office operating costs,
a curriculum preparation workshop, resource materials, and funds
for subcontracts.
(b) MOH, National Family Welfare Center
(i)  Motivation of MOH Staff Support for FP.  During the
first year, the NFWC would test the impact of a news-
letter about FP for MOH service staff and would produce
a videotape and associated handouts on population and
development, with special reference to health, aimed at
senior MOH staff.
(ii) Strengthening of FP In-clinic and Extension Education.
This activity would consist of four main elements: the
identification of ways to strengthen FP I&E content in MOH

ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 5
training programs, the production of support materials
for use by MOH service and health education staff, a
pilot scheme to stimulate local groups to discuss FP
using audio cassettes, and a pilot post-partum education
program. The project would provide equipment, supplies,
two preparatory workshops, and production of materials.
(iii)  Mass Media Support for FP Interpersonal Communication.
This would consist of the decentralized use of mass media,
mainly by HEOs and, as such, would be closely coordinated
with the health education component of Part B. The project
would provide funds for local campaigns to publicize the
opening of new SDPs and for such purposes as countering
rumors.
(iv) Production of Mass Media Materials on FP. It is planned to
produce two films on FP and cinema slides giving details
about local FP services and, as an experiment, to use bill-
boards at places frequented by men (e.g. sportsfield).
(c) Family Planning Association of Kenya (FPAK):
(i) Private Medical Practitioners. The project would support
one workshop to be organized by FPAK during the first year
to encourage private doctors to offer FP services.
(ii) I&E Program for Members of Parliament. The FPAK will
organize a workshop to inform MPs about, and to enlist
their support for Kenya's population program.
(iii) Training of Traditional Birth Attendants. Traditional birth
attendants (TBA) still deliver nearly three-fourths of the



-74-
ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 5
babies in Kenya. This program would eventually train 320 a
year in FP, I&E, improved delivery techniques, and basic
maternal and child health. The project will provide
equipment, vehicles, salaries and housing allowances
for supervisory and training staff, vehicle operating
and maintenance costs, and per diems for trainees and
for field supervision.
(iv) In-service Training in I&E for FPAK Staff. FPAK is the
only NGO in Kenya devoted solely to the promotion of FP.
The project will provide FPAK with funds to conduct in-
service courses in I&E for its own field educators,
senior management, and clerical staff (who have consider-
able contact with the public).
(v) Production of Support Materials for Field Use. The project
would provide for the designs, pre-testing and production
of materials for use by FPAK's field educators.
(vi) Evaluation of On-going I&E Programs. During the first year,
the FPAK would carry out or subcontract evaluations of its
lay educator and youth programs with a view to requesting
the Council to finance expansions of these programs.
(d) Kenya Catholic Secretariat: Family Life Education Plrogram. This
program is designed to increase understanding of the population
problem among Catholics and to educate couples in thLe ovulation
method of FP, which has been found to be acceptable to Catholic
couples because of its similarity to traditional child spacing

methods. The project would provide office furniture, office and
audio-visual equipment, a vehicle, salaries and housing
allowances for a small staff, vehicle operation and maintenance
costs, office operating costs, staff development, per diem,
consultants, training materials, and national and regional
workshops to train diocesan leaders, tutors in Catholic paramed-
ical training schools, and laymen in various facets of the
program.
(e) Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organization: Maternal and Child Health/FP
I&E Services. Training in MCH/FP and I&E would be provided for
field staff, leaders, and 10,000 members of Maendeleo ya
Wanawake, the largest women-s organization in Kenya. The project
would provide office furniture, office and audio-visual equip-
ment, vehicles, salaries and housing allowances for staff,
vehicle operating and maintenance costs, office rental and other
operating costs, domestic travel, production of I&E materials,
and an extensive program of training workshops.
(f) National Christian Council of Kenya: Family Life Education
Program. The Council conducts a program of curriculum develop-
ment and training of teachers in family life education methods.
The project would provide office furniture, office and audio-
visual equipment, vehicles, audio-visual and office supplies,
domestic travel, production of materials, and workshops for
tutors in teacher training schools, headmasters of secondary
schools, and officials and leaders at the provincial and district
level.

(g) Protestant Churches Medical Association: Adolescent Health and
FP I&E Program. The PCMA intends to encourage its members to
reach in- and out-of-school youth in their areas. The project
would provide office furniture, audio-visual and office equip-
ment, a vehicle, salaries and housing allowances for staff,
vehicle operation and maintenance costs, office operating costs,
staff development, domestic travel, consulting services,
production of I&E materials, and workshops and training courses
for heads of participating institutions, headmasters, and
teachers.
(h) Salvation Army: FP I&E Program. The Salvation Army intends to
carry out a program, aimed primarily at men, with the help of
male workers who would be recruited and trained by
trainer/supervisors. Complementary FP services would be
provided, where needed, by Salvation Army health staff. The
project would provide equipment for these services, vehicles,
salaries, incentive payments for nurses, production of guides and
other materials, domestic travel, and training costs.

1/ Financing of all items in Part A would be on a parallel basis. The specific items to be financed
by each donor and government have been identified at this point for the first project year only.
For the second and third project years, the determination of specific items to be financed by each
of the donors and government will be made at the time of the review by donors of the corresponding
annual work plans, also in consultation with council.
2/ UK-ODA also intends simuiltaneously to provide approximately 500 kits of visual learning aids,
especially designed for semi-literate and illiterate audiences, at a cost of about 100,000.
The kits would cover a wide spectrum of health/FP topics.  This ccnponent was not included in the
cost estimates of this appraisal report, hence it is not shown here as part of ADA-s contribution
to project financing.  However, they are likely to be channeled through one of the implementing                                                              co
