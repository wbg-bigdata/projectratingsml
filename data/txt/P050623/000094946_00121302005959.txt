ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESETTLEMENT/COMPENSATION FRAMEWORK
GHANA ROAD SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (RSDP)
INTRODUCTION
The Ghana Road Sector Development Program (RSDP) is being proposed as the follow-
on investment to the Highway Sector Improvement Program (HSIP). The overall
approach to the environmental and social management of the proposed new program is to
strengthen the environmental impact assessment system established under the HSIP. The
potentially new and expected environmental and social impacts of the RSDP's field of
influence and activities have been identified and assessed. The overall approach to
environmental and social management of this new investment is to strengthen and
enhance the EIA system by improving the Ghana Highway Authority's (GHA). and
extended to the Department of Urban Roads (DUR) and Department of Feeder Roads
(DFR), capacity to supervise or undertake EIAs and to monitor environmental and social
impacts of road rehabilitation activities.
PROPOSED ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR RSDP
The concern for environmental and social management sustainability under RSDP is the
need for improving the institutional capacity for continuous environmental management
activities within the road sector and the efficient use of available resources. The kev
institutional activities that require attention during the implementation of the RSDP are
articulated the Andoh/Katz report, 2000. These will provide the basis for strengthening
environmental management under the proposed RSDP where a detailed plan of required
action, time frame to implement, estimated budget, and responsible agencies to
adequately ensure the efficient and continuous implementation of environmental
management activities within the road sector, under RSDP, are developed. A
resettlement and compensation policy framework has been developed to address such
issues within the RSDP. In accordance with national environmental legislation, each
road activity will be subject to an environmental assessment. Strengthening the capacity
and co-ordination will be crucial in managing the environmental and social issues in the
RSDP.
Based on the RSDP investments and environmental and social management experience
gained under the HSIP. the Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP) will support the
following activities: i) environmental and social capacity strengthening, ii) ensuring
physical works are adequately managed, iii) co-ordination of all project cycle aspects.

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES OF RSDP
Road projects earmarked for implementation under the RSDP by three road agencies. the
Ghana Highway Authority. the Department of Feeder Roads. and the Department of
Urban Roads of the Ministry of Roads and Transport generally involve the rehabilitation
or reconstruction of existing roads. The project will follow existing alignments and no
radical widening of roads will take place. The expected impact of the RSDP projects on
the environment will therefore be minimal. In a few cases. sections of the roads fall short
of the required standard width. This is due to the fact that buildings and other structures
have been constructed close to the road and within the road reservation. To obtain the
standard width some such properties will have to be demolished. The number of such
properties involved is very small.
Similar to many other development projects, the RSDP projects, if not handled properly,
could impact negatively on the environment. Although the extent to which it could affect
the environment is minimal, an Environmental Assessment is presented in this report to
outline measures that would be put in place to minimise or eliminate these impacts. The
Assessment is also in line with the World Bank Policy for such projects. In preparing
this report reference was made to a number of publications including the World Bank
Technical Paper No. 140 - Environmental Assessment Sourcebook Vol.11 and EPA of
Ghana's EIA guidelines
POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
Government Of Ghana's Environmental Policy
The environmental policy of the Government of Ghana seeks to:
- Maintain ecosystems and ecological processes essential for the functioning of
the bio-sphere
* Ensure sound management of natural resources and the environment
* Adequately protect humans, animals and plants, their biological communities
and habitats against harmful impacts and destructive practices, and preserve
biological diversity
* Guide development in accordance with quality requirements to prevent,
reduce and as far as possible, eliminate pollution and nuisances
* Integrate environmental considerations in sectoral structural socio-economic
planning at national, regional and district levels; and
* Seek common solutions to environmental problems in West Africa, Africa
and the World at large.
Legal And Administrative Framework
In order to achieve the above policy objectives. the government has put in place the
necessary legal and administrative framework. which includes the following:
* Passing of the Environmental Protection Act (Act.460 of 1994) and
Legislative Instrument 1652 of 1999. Under both Legislatives.
Environmental Impact Assessment is mandatory for Road projects.
- 2 -



*  The establishment of the Environmental Protection Agencv which ensures the
implementation of environmental policy and co-ordinates environmental
activities
*  The preparation of a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in 1988 to
articulate government's environmental policies and provide the framework for
interventions needed to protect the environment
* International Conventions And Treaties
* Ghana is a signatory to many international conventions, which impinge on the
environment. These include:
*  UN Framework Convention on Climatic Change (Kyoto) (1997)
* Chemical Weapons Convention (1997)
* Convention to Combat Desertification (1994)
*  Convention on Biological Diversity (1992)
*  Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the Ozone (1989)
* Vienna Convention on Protection of Ozone layer (1987)
* Convention on Preservation of Wetlands for Migratory Birds (Ramsar)
* The African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources (1968)
* International Convention for the pollution of the Sea by oil (1954).
SELECTION OF PROJECT ROADS
During the prefeasibility stage, in the selection of roads, preliminary environmental
studies are conducted alongside the socio-economic studies. Where a major negative
environmental impact is envisaged, eg., major negative impact on wetlands,
recommendations are made not to select the road. When the roads pass the prefeasibility
stage, a detailed environmental impact assessment is carried out. Thus all roads selected
for rehabilitation or reconstruction will undergo an environmental assessment when
accepted for implementation. The assessment is a requirement under the Legislative
Instrument LI. 1652 (1999) and the Environmental Protection Act 460 of 1995.
ALTERNATIVES EXAMINED
Taking the effect of road projects on the environment - both natural and built, the
following alternatives were considered:
* "No-action" Alternative
* Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Alternatives
No ACTION ALTERNATIVE
The "No-action" alternative assumes that the present state of the roads proposed under
the RSDP would pertain. This would imply that the roads would be left in their current
state of poor riding surface and unacceptable geometric alignments. Some of the roads
are characterised by sharp horizontal curves and poor sight distances.
Under this alternative, the present low standard of living in areas within the RSDP road
corridor would continue to worsen. All development opportunities such as easy
movement of agricultural produce, easy movement of passengers, reduced vehicle
operating cost would not be realised.
- 3 -



The present dusty nature of some of the roads. which is causina a serious health problem
for the people living in the area. would remain. The narrow. uneven road surface and
sharp curves causing long heavy vehicles to topple over and spill oil would continue to
pertain.
A choice of a 'No-action" alternative will therefore. only rarely be in line with the
Government's long term development objectives as outlined in Vision 2020.
REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRlJCTION ALTERNATIVE
Improvement Of Existing Road
This alternative implies improving the road alignment to an acceptable safety, speed and
environmental standard.
The alternative usually looks the more realistic since there would be virtually very
minimal environmental impact as compared to the benefits that would be accrued from
its implementation.
Although there are environmental implications associated with the option appropriate
mitigation measures would be implemented to control them. In spite of its high initial
cost. the benefits to be accrued far outweigh the benefits of the other alternatives
considered.
BASELINE INFORMATION OF RSDP ROADS
Highways
Under the RSDP, the first roads to be rehabilitated/reconstructed have been packaged as
follows. and the considerations given below are examples of the baseline information
compiled before the EA is carried out:
Total Distance
Lot.1 Jasikan-Brewaniase-Oti Damanko (40-89km)
Oti Damanko-Yendi (0-05km)                  -      98km
These roads stretch from the Eastern corridor of the dry semi-equatorial climate
of the Volta Region to the tropical continental or savanna climate of the northern
region. Whereas the first part of the project roads receive two rainy seasons with
mean annual rainfall between 1250-1500mm. the rest of the roads have a single
rainy season of about 1000-1 1150mm of mean annual rainfall. The mean monthly
temperatures are between 24°C to 300C. Relative humidities are between 75 to
95%.
The Semi-equatorial climate sections of the project road have dry-semi deciduous
forest. Due to frequent use as farmland the zone has been replaced through such
activities by wooded or tree savanna vegetation. The Northern end of roads lies
in the interior wooded savanna vegetation zone, which constitutes the largest
single vegetation, zone in Ghana. Only trees such as baobab, dawa dawa, acacias
and shea have adapted to this environment.
Grasses within this area grow in tussocks and can reach heights of 3 metres or
more. Regular burning, grazing of livestock and cultivation have reduced
considerably trees in this zone.
- 4 -



The soil is Ochrosols (i.e.. highly coloured soils) which are developed over highly
weathered parent materials.
They are developed over the voltatian shales and granites. These soils are not
easily porous and thus become waterlogged in the rainy season, but dry out in the
dry season. These soils are poor in organic matter and nutrients and are
sometimes acidic.
Geologically, the project roads are made up of gently dipping or flat-bedded
sandstones, shales and mudstones that are easily eroded. The land-use of the
project corridor consists of farm/uncultivated land and human settlements.
Lot.2 Sogakope-Ho (30-80km)
Ho-Fume (25-40.6km)                         -     65.6km
The Sogakope-Ho-Fume road project starts from the dry equatorial through to the
dry semi-equatorial climates in the Volta Region of Ghana. Both climates
experience two rainfall maxima, with mean annual rainfall between 74-89cm for
the dry equatorial and 125-200cm for the Wet-Semi equatoral climate.
Temperature ranges between 26°C-30°C, while monthly relative humidities in the
dry equatorial climatic region do not exceed 75%.
The area falls within the interior wooded savanna with few and widely scattered
trees such as acacias. The plant life of this vegetation zone has a marked change
which looks green with life during the rainy season. Trees blossom and grasses
shoot up rapidly. The whole area looks parched and desolate with leaves
changing colour from green to yellow and shedding leaves during the dry season.
The vegetation is quite open and dominated by short grasses.
There are three main soil groups in this project zone: coastal savanna ochrosols
lateritic sandy soils and forest ochrosols. The coastal sandy soils are pale yellow
sands often without top layer of humus or organic matter. They support coconuts
and where manured. shallots and other crops. The lateritic sandy soils are
deficient in organic matter and nutrients. They are acidic and become
waterlogged during the wet season because of an underlying layer of hardened
clay.
Birds found in the corridor include the Common Hooded Vulture (Neophron
Monsehus) Harrier Hawk (Polyboroides Radiatus) Finch (Serinus Mozambicus)
Woodland Kingfisher (Halcyon Senegalenses).
The common reptiles include the Nile Monitor (Veranus Niloticus) Agama lizard
(Agama Agama)
Lot.3 Techiman-Kintampo (60km)
Berekum-Sampa (58-88km)                     -      90km
The two roads lie in the Dry Semi Deciduous forest zone. Mean annual rainfall is
between 1250-1500mm and occur in two seasons. a minor in May to June and a
major in September to October. Mean monthly temperatures range from about
30°C in March to about 26°C in August. While from 90-95% in the rainy season
to 75-80% in the dry season.
The corridors traverse a rolling terrain with gentle 2 to 6 degree slopes. Very
little of the original forest remains and most of what is left is secondary forest.
The fauna inhabiting the zone includes birds such as the Hooded Vulture,
-5-



Neophran Monuchus. Harrier Haw;k (Pollhoroides Radiatuls) West African Black
Kite (.MVitrus Alligrcans) and the WVoodland King Fisher. Reptiles include the Nile
Monitor (f aramus .Niloticus) Agama Lizards (Green AManmba. Black Cobra) and
the African Python. Mammals include the Royal Antelope Maxwell Duiker.
Neither flora nor fauna species is endangered.
Principal soils are the forest ochrosols not heavily leached as forest oxysols and
generally contain more nutrients. In some areas derived savanna have resulted
from forest destruction due to use as farmlands.
Lot.4 Accra-Tema Motorway Phases II & III (14km)         -     66km
The Motorway has the same environmental characteristics as the RSDP urban
roads.
It is located in the southeast coastal plains of Ghana, which are generally flat.
The general elevation is not more than 75m above sea level. The rocks
underlying the motorway is of the Dahomeyan series of the Precambrian era
which forms the basement complex of Ghana. The rocks are mainly
metamorphic and consist of gneisses and schist. The major soil groups found in
the project corridor include coastal savanna ochrosols, lateritic sandy soils.
tropical black clays or Akuse soils.
Both sides of this section of the motorway are built up areas and the land use
consists of mainly residential and commercial.

Bamboi-Bole (35-70km)                             -      113km
These roads lie in the interior wooded savanna zone. The road corridors
experience a single rainy season (May to October) followed by a prolonged dry
season. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1000-1 150mm with mean monthly
temperatures ranging from 36°C in March to 270C in August. Relative humidity
ranges from a high of 70-90% (rainy season) to a low of 20% (dry season).
The Low-lying topography of the area is susceptible to erosion during storm
water flows.
Urban Roads
The urban roads proposed for rehabilitation or reconstruction under the RSDP are all
located in built-up areas in the following cities or urban centres.
* Accra
* Kumasi
* Tema
* Ga
* Tamale
* Sekondi Takoradi
* Koforidua
* Cape Coast
The roads follow existing alignments through residential, commercial, industrial, and
other land uses commonly found in cities. These are all statutory planning areas where
- 6 -



the Town and Country Planning has prepared planning schemes indicating road
alignment and their reservations. Within these road reservations there are few
unauthorised structures such as kiosks.
Feeder Roads
The thrust of the feeder roads program is rehabilitation and spot improvements of
existing networks throughout the country. Road improvement segments will range in
distance between 2 km and 35 km. The feeder roads are located in various climatic
zones throughout the country, starting from the coastal savannah through the forest belt
to the dry wooded savannah zone in the north. They connect remote villages to major
highways or urban centres. The planned activity of works is constrained to existing
alignments only.
MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF RSDP ROADS
Highways and Feeder Roads
The following will be the major impacts with regard to the highway component of the
RSDP. The same impacts could be expected from the feeder road projects but on a
smaller scale.
*  Clearing around the right-of-way or for borrow pits may damage ecologically
sensitive areas such as forests, wetlands and wildlife refuges during capital-
intensive rehabilitation of the type envisaged in RSDP;
*  Sedimentation or pollution of streams and other water bodies may result from
road works such as vegetation clearing, and from operation of heavy
machinery itself;
*  After road rehabilitation further sedimentation may occur as a result of
inadequate or poorly designed erosion control and drainage measures.
Pollution levels may increase as a result of improved access for people and
livestock as a result of drinking, waste water and washing activities;
*  Direct effects on roadside communities may include health problems resulting
from excessive noise and dust during road work, and as a result of increased
traffic after completion. Road safety problems may also be increased during
and after rehabilitation work.
Secondary impacts commonly resulting from extensive road rehabilitation are listed
below. These result from increased access and commercial activity for the most part.
Although these impacts are indirect, they are often as important as direct effects, in both
positive and negative aspects. However, negative secondary aspects are often more
difficult to mitigate, since they spread beyond direct responsibilities of road agencies.
*  Shifts in land-use and ownership may occur due to increased land value,
opening of new areas to markets and delivery of inputs and social services;
* Settlement patterns may change (for example, growth of existing villages or
formation of new settlements) as a result of increased commercial activity
along the road corridor;
-7 -



* Exploitation of forest products and wildlife mav increase as result of mark-et
access or land use changes. leading to a decline in the natural resource base
and biodiversity;
* Changes may occur in cultural practices and traditions as a result of increased
exposure to outside influences.
The most notable direct adverse socio-economic impacts from RSDP are those related to
increased safety hazards to pedestrians caused by: expansion of automobile traffic (and
speed), greater pedestrian road traffic resulting from expected increased commerce as
road conditions improve; and the proximity of houses sited too close to the road to permit
road rehabilitation to proceed efficiently.
Urban Roads
With regard to the urban roads. the major negative impacts will be:
* Dust pollution
* Disruption of traffic flow
* Pedestrian vehicular conflict.
POSITIVE IMPACTS OF RSDP
The positive impacts of the RSDP will include strengthening capacity of the road
agencies under the Ministry of Roads and Transport, in particular the GHA, DFR and
DUR to supervise or undertake EIAs and to monitor environmental impacts of road
rehabilitation activities. Details of proposed plans for institutional strengthening of these
agencies with regard to environmental management are found in the section on
Environmental Management and Training of this report.
Other positive impacts expected from the road rehabilitation, which from the basis of
project viability, include:
*  Radical reduction in dust pollution
•  Elimination of hazardous traffic points
*  Savings in transport costs, both in time and through modal transfers;
*  More efficient transport of farm to produce to markets; and
*  Increased access to social and health services.
SLIMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FOR ROAD PROJECTS IN GHANA
A review of the Environmental Assessment already prepared showed the following as the
most significant negative impacts. The table below presents a summary of these
common negative impacts and corresponding mitigation measures proposed to minimise
or eliminate these impacts. It also illustrates that generally the adverse impact of road
projects in Ghana is minimal.

SOCIAL ISSUES OF RSDP
Resettlement and compensation issues have been handled by the implementing agencies
of the Ministry of Roads and Transport. The RSDP projects usually follow the existing
alignments. However, in a few cases buildings and structures will have to be demolished
to obtain the standard road width.
The RSDP will have three implementing agencies -- Ghana Highway Authority.
Department of Feeder Roads. and the Department of Urban Roads of the Ministry of
Roads and Transport -- who will handle compensation and resettlement issues.
The physical works component of the Program is one of the largest. consisting of routine
maintenance, periodic maintenance and rehabilitation, upgrading, reconstruction, limited
new construction as well as bridge and culvert work in all three road sub-sectors. GHA
accounts for the largest portion of the funding requirements for this component at 56% of
the total, followed by the Department of Urban Roads at 23%, with the Department of
Feeder Roads at 19%.
Some preliminary assessment work has already been prepared for the Urban Roads
component of the Program and the established framework will be applied for the rest of
the Program. In addition to this initial screening process, individual social assessments
and environmental assessments will be completed for each road segment to be
rehabilitated as stated in the principles for the Program. These assessments will be
monitored closely by the Environment Unit based on studies already undertaken for
example. baseline socio-economic studies on the impact of roads on poverty reduction.
RESETTLEMENT/COMPENSATION LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Resettlement/compensation policy in Ghana
It is the policy of the Government of Ghana to pay compensation to people whose
properties. lands or landed property are affected by such projects. The State Lands Act
1963 section 6 (1) provides that any person whose property is affected by public projects
shall be entitled to compensation. The same Act provides avenues for people who are
not satisfied with compensation to seek redress.
Land Acquisition and compensation laws
Acquisition of land for road projects is regulated by the Lands (Statutory Wayleaves) Act
1963 Act 186 (Vide Section 1, 2(1) and 2, 6 (1-5).
A wavleave instrument contains the following:
* A description (with measurements) of the land affected by the Statutory wayleave
together with a plan showing the position of the works (road alignment).
A copy of wayleave instrument is served on the owner or occupier of the land affected by
the Statutory wayleave. Under Section 6(1) of the Act. any person who suffers any loss
or damage as a result of the construction, maintenance etc shall be entitled to
compensation. A claim for compensation shall be made to the Minister in the prescribed
form not more than three months after the date of declaration made by the President
under Section I of the Act.
- 12 -



Category of loss
Categories of loss are land, landed property and farms/crops. There are three main areas
where road projects under the RSDP will result in these: Road alignment. Borrow
pits/Quarries and Project Campsite.
The Lands Act (1963) and World Bank OP4.30
Road projects planned under the RSDP follow existing alignments. The aim of the
programme is to improve existing roads. Attempts have been made in the designs to
avoid destruction of properties. In cases where it becomes necessary to demolish or
destroy part of a farmland. cash compensation will be paid under the Lands Act 1963
Section 6 (1) Payment of cash as compensation is line with part III (10) of the World
Bank OP4.12 which provides that "the payment of cash compensation is appropriate
where livelihoods are land based but the land taken for the project (in this case road) is a
small fraction of the affected asset and the residual is economically viable, where active
markets for land, housing and labour exist".
Eligibility
The owner of the property under the Act is the only person entitled to compensation. In
most cases the owner is the household head who takes care of the other members
including the extended family.
Valuation
Where a farm is the perennial plantation type, the investment method is used for the
assessment. In this case, the net annual income from the farm is capitalised at the
appropriate interest rate over the expected remaining life of the farm. For others like the
seasonal crops and the isolated perennial ones, the acreage/unit rates are used.
Building/structures
Compensation for land and buildings/structures is also assessed having regard to the
market value of the affected property. Where particulars on transactions of similar
properties are readily available and easily accessible, the simple comparative approach is
adopted. with the necessary adjustment as a result of the minor differences in the
conditions of the properties (the subject property and the comparable ones).
Incidentally, building/structures which are usually affected by GHA and feeder road
projects are the types that do not change hands in the market. (they are mostly rural
properties). The Comparative Method can therefore not be used to arrive at the market
value. This method can typically be used only in the case of urban roads.
The market value is arrived at by the "Replacement Cost". Since compensation is paid
for any affected property as we find it at the time of the demolition, the replacement cost
figure arrived at, which makes the property as if new, is depreciated by an appropriate
percentage, (condition of the property determines the percentage figure), to arrive at the
figure that is appropriately related to the property as it is. Drink money paid to the
traditional landowners for building plots is added to the depreciated figure obtained
(hence the method termed "Depreciated Replacement Cost of the Development plus the
Value of the Land"). This, in turn, is topped up by 10-15%, representing 'Removal and
Contingencies'. to arrive at the compensation payable.
- 13 -



The cost rate used in the assessment. encompasses all the cost items indicated in the
'"Draft P04. 12 Annex Notes' under Part III of the 'Resettlement Policy Framework"'. In
the assessment, the value of salvage materials is not taken into account. The affected
property ownners are allowed to take them. However. if it is established that the project is
likely to enhance the values of the claimant's adjoining properties. the extent of the
enhancement - 'Betterment' - may be taklen into account in the compensation
assessment.
Assessment of Compensation
As already mentioned above, properties affected by roads projects are
inspected/referenced or enumerated jointly by the Valuation Unit of the GHA and the
Land Valuation Board, the Government's statutorily accredited valuation body. The
GHA Valuation Unit jointly undertakes the inspection/referencing exercise with the
Board's regional offices, according to the Region where the project is located. The two
offices, however, prepare independent reports/valuations, applying rates of value/cost
determined by the Board. The depreciated Replacement Cost of the development plus
the value of the land is the method used in the assessment. The two independent
reports/valuations are submitted to the Board at the national level, for vetting and final
approved compensation.
Assessment of royalties on borrow pits: Royalties on borrow pits are assessed, based on
quantity of materials taken from the pits. Contractors are therefore advised to keep a
record of, or find a way of calculating quantity of, materials taken from each borrow pit.
The recorded quantities are submitted to the Valuation Section of the GHA for
assessment of the appropriate royalties
Procedures for delivery of entitlements
The approved amounts are communicated to the GHA for payment to the beneficiaries.
Ideally and as much as possible, compensation is to be paid before the owners/occupiers
are made to vacate their properties for demolition. This has, however, not always been
the case, because either funds may not be available for the payment when the
compensation amounts are approved by the Board or there may be a delay of approval
from the Board. Where funds are not readily available, GHA appeals to the extended
families of the affected property owner/occupiers to temporarily accommodate the latter.
Where on the other hand, there is a delay of approval from the Land Valuation Board,
part payment of the values, as assessed by GHA valuation Unit is made to the
beneficiaries, and the difference paid when the approved amounts are received from the
Board.
When adequate compensation is paid to the affected property owner, they arrange to
resettle themselves. The GHA, however, assists them, through the District Assemblies,
to acquire some of the materials they may require for their resettlement.
Time Frame
Approval from the Land Valuation takes on the average of four months. Payment to the
property owners depends on the availability of funds. Non availability of funds usually
causes delays in the payment of compensation. Although property owners are alerted
about the demolition during the assessment, they are given two months notice to quit
- 14 -



after payment of compensation. This means if funds are available the w hole process
from assessment to demolition could take roughly nine months.
Conflict Management
During the consultation process and at the forum the extent of damage to properties will
be made known. When the amount of compensation to be paid is made known, the
affected people have every right to appeal if not satisfied.
Where grievance entails inadequacy of compensation paid, the law. Section 4 of the
Lands Act 1963, provides for appeal to the "Lands Tribunal" - an ad judicatory body.
Where the grievance relates to implementation of the resettlement plan. the affected
persons appeal to the District Assembly.
Consultation and participation
During the consultation stages of the projects, the affected people will be briefed on the
compensation/resettlement process. Each affected person will be given the chance to
speak on a draft compensation/resettlement plan particularly on issues of concern to him
or her. Names and contact addresses will be compiled for the database at the
environmental unit. The final compensation and resettlement plan will be presented to
the affected persons.
The monitoring team will liaise with all those involved in the compensation/resettlement
process (e.g. the Valuation Section, Legal Division and the Lands Valuation Board) to
monitor the timing. The affected persons will be kept informed at the various stages of
the process.
Financial responsibilities
It will be the responsibility of the Government of Ghana to pay compensation as
provided under section 6 (1) of the State Land Act 1963. The Same Act directs people
with claims to forward these to the Minister.
Funds for compensation will be drawn from the Road Fund. According to the revenue
projection of the Fund. (see Road Fund projections 2001-2003) approximately US$251m
will be realised over the investment period. About 95% of this amount is to be allocated
for road works that will include payment of compensation. Another source for funds for
compensation is the Consolidated Fund.
The same sources will fund the management and monitoring of the environmental/social
aspects of the RSDP.
RESETTLEMENT/COMPENSATION PROCEDURES
The next three years of activities will include road rehabilitation in the following areas:
* Highway rehabilitation;
* Urban road improvement;
* Feeder roads.
Because the exact locations on these roads to be rehabilitated have not yet been
identified, no individual social assessments have been carried out and thus potential
impacts are not known. Therefore it has been agreed that the government will prepare a
frameworkl for potential impacts (compensation/resettlement) on people who live along
- 15 -



these roads. This framework will be applied in the likelihood that people will be affected
negatively and will need to receive compensation.
The following steps will be followed:
Step 1: Prepare a Social Assessment - Social assessments need TORs to be prepared
which should cover collection and evaluation of data in the following fields:
* demographic and socio-economic profile of the people in the specific area,
* assessment of potential impact on cultural. social and economic spheres,
* suggestion of mitigation plans if applicable
Step II. Applyframework for Compensation/Resettlement - Such a framework, designed
and approved of by the government, will include information and instructions under the
following headlines:
* laws and regulations,
* institutional arrangements,
* resettlement/compensation eligibility and criteria,
* consultation/participation strategy,
* implementation procedures,
* financial responsibilities, and
* a monitoring and evaluation plan.
Step III: Design a compensation/resettlement plan if applicable
Institutional Arrangements
The institutional arrangements build on the existing structure in the GHA. extending the
survey and design parts of the environmental and social works to the DUR and DFR.
The agencies involved in the process are as follows:
Agency and Unit                        Role

In the short and medium term the Environmental nit will co-ordinate the activities of
monitoring teams made up of Finance. Legal and Valuation Section. The team will
monitor the compensation/resettlement plans to be put into place. The Unit will be
involved from the planning stages during the identification of the people and properties
involved. A database will be put in place to monitor the timing of compensation
andresettlement issues. A Desk will be established at the Unit to receive and resolve
complaints. GHA will make arrangements for monitoring and for an independent
evaluation of the impacts of the compensation/resettlement activities.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION ACTIONS FOR
FIRST YEAR ACTIVITIES OF RSDP
The Government of Ghana is to be assisted by external donors to implement a Road
Sector Development Programme. This is to help the Government achieve its prime
objective to clear the backlog on road deterioration and work towards a road condition
mix of 70% good. 20% fair and not more than 10% poor by 2005. The Programme is to
be implemented by three implementing agencies of the Ministry of Roads and Transport
namely the Ghana Highway Authority, the Department of Urban Roads, and the
Department of Feeder Roads. In the first year of the programme the three agencies will
concentrate on rehabilitation projects.
The first years activities are limited to rehabilitation of roads under the following
headlines:
(i)    Highways
Jasikan-Brewaniase (52km)
Brewaniase-Oti Damanko
Accra-Tema Motorway Phase II & III
Sogakope-Ho (80km)
Berekum-Sampa (87km)
Ho-Fume (40km)
(ii)   Urban Roads
(iii)  Feeder Roads
An Environmental Assessment has been carried out which cover the project activities
during this first year (see GHA Environmental Impact Assessment of selected roads
prepared by the Environmnental unit, 1997 & updated 1999). Social assessments have
also been carried out and the social impact have been identified in the same report. In
some instances negative social impacts were identified and refer to the following
instances:
(i)    Two structures owned by two families to be demolished - Jasikan Brewaniase;
(ii)   14 farms - less than one acre of each farm to be destroyed by the road
rehabilitation;
Table I provides the breakdown for the first year activities.
ENV'IRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF PROPOSED HIGHWAY PROJECTS
Jasikan Brewaniase (52km)
The project involves the rehabilitation of this 52km laterite road which is in the semi
deciduous vegetation zone. The land use along the road consists of human settlements,
farms and uncultivated land. Kadjebi is the only urban settlement (population more than
5000) along the road corridor. The remaining settlements, namely Guaman, Moyadi,
Nsuta Buem. Menuso. Dzindzi, Puase Dodo, are all rural with population less than 1000.
- 18-



Although the settlements are nucleated. only two structures will have to be demolished
on the outskirts of Brewaniase and the centre of Kadjebi.
Environmental Assessment
The main negative environmental impact of the project could be as follows:
Noise/Diust pollution: Senditive at Kajebi (Km 15) - school and hospital could suffer
from both noise and .dust pollution during the construction phase.
Erosion: Erosion problems within the settlements could be exacerbated during the earth
works.
Vegetation.' Destruction of vegetation could occur at the borrow pit and construction
camp sites. Along the road little vegetation will be destroyed since the 7.2m required for
the carriageway and 2 m for the shoulders already exist. This is the result of regular
maintenance of this laterite road. However at Km 18.5. Km 21.2 and Km 29.5 there will
be the need to widen the road to obtain the required road width.
Mitigation
The following measures have been proposed to mitigate the negative impacts.
Noise/Dust pollution: The contractor is to limit heavy construction activities involving
noisy equipment to outside school hours. Equipment and vehicles are to be serviced
regularly in accordance with manufacturer's specification. To control dust, water is to be
applied to the road surface twice in the build-up areas. This will be part of the
contractual obligations of the selected contractor.
Borrow pits/Construction campsites
The borrow pits should be reinstated as soon as possible. The site should be contoured to
blend with area. This is to formn part of the works contract.
Decommissioning of the campsite
After road projects, District Assemblies negotiate with the contractors to turn the camp-
site into a school, clinic or offices. This has already been done. The site should be
landscaped before handing over.
Social Assessment
The social assessment was carried out by the Environmental Unit in conjunction with the
Valuation Section of the Ghana Highway Authority in July 1999. The Assessment took
the form of consultation with the District Assembly the Chiefs of Brewaniase Jasikan,
Guam Nsuta Buem and Dodo. The owners of the two properties to be demolished and
the three farms part of which were going to be taken by the road.
The first meeting was to inform the people about the project and properties likely to be
affected. The second consultation was with the affected people. Their properties were
valued. This included measurement of farm land to be taken by the road. During the
third meeting. the valuation figures were outlined in the presence of the Chiefs and the
affected persons. For the corn mill an amount of five hundred and seventy million cedis
was to be paid. The farmers were to receive one million five hundred thousand cedis
each. After extensive discussions on the compensation, the affected persons accepted the
figures. Apart from the affected persons the Chiefs who are the customary custodians of
the land were given ceremonial drinks. The customary rites were then performed to seal
the deal. A monitoring exercise carried out by the Environmental Unit in March 2000
revealed that the farmers did not plant any crops on the affected land this year.
Two buildings, a corn mill at Kadjebi (Km1 5) and the wall of a house near Brewaniase
(Km49.5) will be demolished. During the consultation exercise the owner of the
- 19-



cornmill indicated that he owned the land on which the mill is sited. This land is more
than 1.5 acres. The mill is housed in a structure 22ft bv 14ft. The owner will be pleased
to receive compensation because he could put up a better structure and add
accommodation to it.
In all, three farms are expected to be affected by the road at Kml8.5, Km2 1.2 and
Km29.5. Crops cultivated are mainly yam and cassava. In all 15 people work in these
farms and the amount of land to be taken from each of the farms is less than 1 acre. The
amount of land to be taken is an insignificant proportion of the farm. Secondly. the
owners have large tracts of land which due to financial constraints have not been
developed. Compensation paid could be used to expand these farms in other directions.
The two borrow pits are located on land which is no more under cultivation. However,
the District Assembly has negotiated successfully with the Chief to release the land to the
contractor when required subject to customary rites being performed.
Brewaniase - Oti Damanko
This 49Km laterite road lies in the Interior Wooded Savanna zone which constitutes the
largest single vegetation zone in Ghana. Only trees such as baobab, dawadawa. acacias
and shea trees have adapted to this environment. The soil along the road corridor is the
ochrosols type consisting of sandstones, shales and mudstones. Land use along the road
consists of farms. uncultivated land and human settlements. Apart from Nkwanta. the
rest of the settlements namely Salifukrom. Dufumkpa. Nkwanta, Agoo. Kpasa. Adibo
and Sibi are villages with populations less than 1000. Most of these settlements are not
of the nucleated a common feature of settlements in the Northern part of Ghana.
Buildings are always scattered, sited mostly in individual's farms. The only nucleated
settlement, Nkwanta has building set away from the road. In rehabilitating the road
therefore. there will be more than enough space to obtain the standard width of 7.2m.
Environmental Assessments
The major negative impact of this road will be dust pollution. The area experiences
prolonged periods without rain. During the implementation phase dust pollution could
affect the individual homes as well as crops. Due to the effect of dust on crop yield
farmers do not plant close to dusty roads. Traffic disruption will be another negative
impact. Construction vehicles could interface with other vehicles such as motor cycles
and cycles.
Social Assessment
The social assessment for this road project was carried out by the Environmental Unit
and valuation section of the Ghana Highway Authority in the month of August 1999. In
all these meetings and a number of consultations with the District Assembly Chiefs and
elders of Salifukrom, Dufumkpa, Nkwata and Sibi villages were held to discuss the
project. The two farrners whose farms were affected were at the meeting at the palace of
the Chief of Salifukrom. Those consulted expressed the hope that the project would be
implemented speedily to enable them to transport their farm produce to the market at
Jasikan. Environmental concerns expressed by the people consulted included dust
pollution. They also wanted the road to be made motorable during implementation since
it could be turned into mud during heavy rains. The two farmers were promised
compensation although there were no crops on parts to be taken by the road.
A second visit by the valuation obtained the amount of land which was to be taken. In
both cases less than one acre 0.75 for the first farm and 0.82 for the second. A third
- 20 -



meeting w as held to inform the farmners that they both would receive one million five
hundred thousand Cedis each. The figure wvas accepted by the farmers. The Chiefs of
Salifukron and Dufumkpa were given the customary drinks which they accepted and
performed the customary rites. The affected portions of the farms remained as they were
(uncultivated) in March this year when the Environmental Unit of the Ghana Highway
Authority monitored road projects in the Area.
Although the project will follow the existing alignment. there will be the need to widen
the road at Km2l and Km32. Approximately one acre each of two farms with a total
number of 13 farmhands and owned by two families will be destroyed. Both farms are
managed by family members, husband, wife and children (no hired labour). Due to
financial constraints. less than 50% of land available to these people is under cultivation.
According to the family heads, compensation expected under Section 4 (i) of the State
Land Act (1962) Act 125, could be used to expand the farms away from the project road.
The nature of settlement pattern in the area is such that there will be no need to demolish
any property during the implementation phase. It could be concluded from the above that
the negative environmental and social impacts of this road project will be minimal and
could be easily mitigated.
Accra - Tema - Motorway Phase II & III
This 14Km road passes through built up areas in Accra. The project is to construct the
opposite lane of the existing road, turn it into a dual carriageway to complete the motor
way. It has a well preserved road reservation, about 150 ft each side.
Environmental Assessment
The major environmental impacts will be as follows:
Dust pollution: The built up area could experience dust pollution during the
implementation phase
Noise pollution: Noise from construction equipment and vehicles could affect
developments along the road. Already, the background noise L90 level around Lapaz
area a popular lorry park is very high. It is unlikely that the specific noise LAeq from
construction equipment and vehicles will adversely affect the background noise level.
Traffic disruption. Construction vehicles and activities could affect the free flow of
traffic especially during the morning and evening rush hour.
Mitigation Measures
Dust Pollution: It has been proposed that the contractor will apply water to the road
surface and other piled materials such as sand twice daily.
Noise Pollution: The contractor will have to service his equipment as advised in the
manufacturer's manual. Work hours should be limited to daytime.
Traffic: Temporary traffic control measures to be installed. Advance warning signs to
be erected 500 ft from work location.
Social Assessment
No negative social impact in terms of resettlement or compensation is expected from this
project. No properties - kiosks, building, or farms are going to be affected by the
project. It was therefore not necessary to carry out any extensive social assessment.
Diversions and closures will be announced on local radio stations during the
implementation phase.
- 21 -



It could be seen from the above that the environmental impact of the project is minimal
and capable of being mitigated.
Sogakope - Ho (80km)
The project road lies in the wooded Savannah vegetation zone. This type of vegetation,
which is quite open, is dominated by short grasses dotted with similar trees. The road
passes through 14 rural settlements. There are no know forest reserves, games park or
protected areas along the road.
Environment Assessment
An environmental impact assessment was carried out in 1998 before this road project
was started and abandoned in 1999 due to financial constraints. The first 30km from
Sogakope has been completed. Mitigation measures identified for implementation were
incorporated in the contract documents in the forn of clauses based on the General
conditions of contract prepared by the International Federation of Consulting Engineers
(FIDIC 1987 - 4th ed).
This road is monitored monthly by the Environmental Unit of the Ghana Highway
Authority. No changes have occurred within the environmental setting to warrant a new
assessment for the RSDP.
Social Assessment
The Social Assessment was carried out by the Environmental and Valuation sections of
the Ghana Highway Authority. Apart from consultations with the District Assembly,
Traditional rulers to ascertain ownership of the affected farms, two meetings were held.
The first was to discuss the project and listen to the concerns of the people especially the
eight farmers. The second was to discuss the compensation figures. The 8 farmers
accepted the figures.
Two buildings owned by two people and occupied by a total of 13 people were to be
demolished. The properties were valued by the valuation section in 1997 and the owners
accepted the figure. A total of 8 farms with a total labour force of 63 were affected.
Apart from one farm at Km 17.5 which about 2 acres of uncultivated land was to be
destroyed the sections to be taken from the other farms were less than one acre in all
cases. The amount represents a small fraction less than 2% of the farm lands. With
regard to compensation for borrow pits, the contractor had implemented a number of
projects in the area. was to obtain material from already established borrow pits where
compensation had already been paid.
Berekum - Sampa
This 87 km road lies in the Dry-semi deciduous forest zone. It passes through 21 rural
settlements in the north-western direction very close to the border with Ivory Coast. The
settlements along the road are all nucleated and bisected by the road. The structure of
these settlements are common. Usually a small commercial centre consisting of a market
and a few shops are located in the middle of the town close to the road. Enforcement of
planning regulations by the District Assemblies has left the road reservation in the
settlements clear. Apart from the fetish shrine in the middle of the road at Seketia town
(km63) the project road is clear and the 7.2m standard width could be obtained without
demolishing any property.
Environmental Assessment
- 22 -



An Environmental Impact Assessment was carried out in February 1999 before the road
project started. Already the first 20 km has been completed. The direct impacts
identified were: destruction of vegetation. air and dust pollution in the settlements, noise
pollution, destruction of the shrine. erosion within settlements and slopes.
For the purposes of the RSDP. the project road was monitored by the environmental unit
of the Ghana Highway Authority. and the assessment remains unchanged. Mitigation
measures propose. i.e., applying water twice daily to the exposed road surface, limiting
clearance to space required for the road, servicing of equipment to reduce noise and
erosion controls measures still apply.
Social Assessment
The second assessment was carried out by the Environmental Unit and Valuation section
of the Ghana Highway Authority in three stages in August 1998. The first meeting at the
Ghana Highway Authority offices in Berekum discussed the project. The second
meeting was to value the properties while the third was to inform the affected people
about the amount of compensation to be paid. At the third meeting the affected farmers
accepted the compensation figure.
This road work was started and abandoned in 1999. The first 20 km has been completed.
Owners of the 20 farms with 155 workers have already received their compensation
which was paid in March 1999. This was after series of meetings and consultation with
the affected people, the Chiefs, District Assembly and interested individuals. The
farmers accepted the compensation figures. As stated earlier, no building was
demolished because of well preserved road reservation.
Ho -Fume
This 40 km highway lies in the interior Wooded Savannah zone and passes through 9
settlements. The first 1.5 km of this road goes through an avenue of mango trees (86
trees). This section is very narrow about 5m wide. The road project was started in 1998
and abandoned in the last quarter of 1999 due to financial constraints. Approximately 9
km of this road has been completed. The remaining 31 km is to be completed under the
Road Sector Development Programme.
Environmental Assessment
An environmental impact assessment was carried out by the Environmental Unit of the
Ghana Highway Authority. The identified direct negative impact were:
Dust pollution. Dust pollution is likely to affect the people in the nine settlements which
the road goes through.
Loss of Trees: All 86 mango trees along the first 1.5km will have to be cut so as to
achieve the 7.2m standard road width.
.N'oise pollution: Sensitive developments at KmO.01, Ola Secondary school, Km5
(hospital). Km 23.9 school could be affected by noise from construction vehicles and
equipment.
Destruction of Farms: Due to the rolling nature of the topography there are no farms
along the project road.
Mitigation
The negative impacts outlined are all capable of being controlled. The Environmental
Protection Agency's permit of 1997 for the project requested four new trees to be planted
for each mango tree cut. A new species (Mahogany) was proposed because of the danger
- 23 -



posed by the mango trees. Children throw stones in their attempt to collect mangoes.
This together with ripe mangos dropping on the road pose danger to motorists. and
explain why a different specie was selected. To control dust, the contractor was required
(contract clause) to apply water to the road surface. Another contract clause requires the
contractor to service his vehicles and equipment as recommended by the manufacturers.
Social Assessment
There were no buildings to be demolished. neither were farms to be destroved. Materials
were to be obtained from an already established borrow pit and quarry which had an
Environmental Protection Agency permit. There was no need to carry out any social
assessment. The road was monitored in March 2000, and the social and environmental
settings were found to be the same as when the environmental assessment was carried
out.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF URBAN ROAD PROJECTS
During the first year of the RSDP, urban roads to be rehabilitated are as outlined in
Tables 2-9. The urban roads to be rehabilitated during the first year of the RSDP are
located in build up areas - mainly residential. The roads exist already with open drains
along each side. The projects involve basically surface improvements. There will be no
demolition and no trees will be lost. During the Accra clean up exercise, temporary
structures were removed. A similar exercise has been carried out along the roads in other
urban areas such as Kumasi, Capse coast. Sekondi Takoradi And Tamale. Owners of
Kiosks relocated these inside nearby properties. Parts of the fence walls had to be
demolished to allow these kiosks to be located inside the houses facing the street. In
cases where drains will be repaired, trees will not be cut.
Environmental Assessment
The main negative impacts of the urban road projects will be noise and dust. However,
people living in these areas will be at work during implementation. There are no noise
sensitive developments along any of these roads. The effect of noise pollution on
residents along these roads will be minimal. Dust pollution during the implementation
stage can be controlled by requesting the contractor (contract clause) to apply water to
the exposed road surface twice daily - early morning and late afternoon.
Social Assessment
Since the urban road project does not involve demolition and tree cutting a limited
consultation was undertaken. This involved consultation with the Town and Country
Planning Department to make sure the layouts of the areas were not going to change.
Utility services like water company and Ghana Telecom were also consulted about any
future new lines to avoid cutting the road up after rehabilitation. All indicated their lines
have already been laid and there will not be any new lines in the near future. A month
before the contractor starts work, the neighbours will be informed to remove parked
broken down vehicles along the streets. The negative impacts both environmental and
social will be minimal.
ENV'IRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF FEEDER ROAD PROJECTS
The first year feeder roads projects under the RSDP will basically involve spot
improvements. Patches or small areas along selected feeder roads will be rehabilitated.
The contractors usually find materials (in very small quantities) for this type work from
the road side or an already established borrow pit. The project will concentrate mainly
- 24 -



on road surfaces and as such no trees will be cut along these roads. The same applies to
vegetation destruction or farms. Again. it will not involve the demolition of properties.
No consultation was therefore carried out for these minor road improvement projects.
The Environmental Protection Agency also does not insist on environmental assessment
since the impacts are negligible.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MITIGATION PLAN FOR THE RSDP
The RSDP includes components to enhance environmental and social sustainability. The
following recommendations are aimed towards achieving the objective.
Management and Monitoring the Environmental Impacts of the RSDP
Unlike the Ghana Highway Authority, the Department of Urban Roads and Department
of Feeder Roads have no separate Environmental Units. The DFR however has recently
established an environmental desk but relies mostly on an Environmental Consultant for
advice.
In view of the limited amount of work at both the DFR and DUR, it is recommended that
the already established Environmental Unit should be formally tasked with oversight for
both the Department of Feeder Roads and Urban Roads. The main function of the
Environmental Unit under the proposal could be summarised as follows:
-  Ensure that at the design stages of DUR, DFR and GHA projects,
environmental and social mitigation measures are incorporated in the various
road designs.
• That strategies for social mitigation have been put in place i.e. buildings and
people affected have access to land and the new location will not adversely
affect their income.
- Monitor the compensation plans to ensure prompt payment and access to
land.
Management and Monitoring the Social Impacts of the RSDP
Capacity to monitor the social aspects of road projects is low within the implementing
agencies namely the Ghana Highway Authority, Department of Feeder Roads and
Department of Urban Roads. In this regard it is recommended that a social scientist from
any of the Social Science Faculties of the universities in Ghana be engaged for a total of
12 months spread over 3 years to handle the social impacts. The Social Scientist will be
attached to the Environmental Unit and will work closely with the Environmental
Consultant.
Redefining the Environmental Unit Within GHA
The Environmental Unit is to remain in the Development Section of Ghana Highway
Authority. but with oversight responsibilities for DFR and DUR. This means that head
of the Unit will report directly to the Deputy Chief Executive, Development and liaise
with the heads of Department of Urban Roads and Department of Feeder Roads. See
Figure 1.
- 25 -



Functions
The main functions of the Unit will be as follows:
*  Brief consultations prior to their award of consultancy contracts to highlight
the need to incorporate mitigation measures:
*  Supervision of the Environimental Impact Social Assessment Studies will be
performed by the Unit, to ensure that mitigation measures are incorporated in
road and bridge designs rather than being added on mitigation:
*  Monitoring of road and bridge projects to ensure that the recommendations
made for mitigating the on-site impacts suggested in the Environmental and
Social Impact Assessment report are incorporated.
*  Undertaking yearly environmental awareness campaigns. This is to coincide
with World Environment Day, which falls in June every year.
Staffing
The nit will initially be headed by the Consultant but later by an Environmental Manager.
Within the new organisational structure of the Environmental Unit, the head will be
assisted by two deputies at the Ghana Highway Authority and one each at the
Department of Feeder Roads and Department of Urban Roads. See Figure 2.
Planning and Traffic. The Consultant will supervise and co-ordinate the work at GHA
Environmental Unit, and the Environment desks at DUR and DFR. The Consultant will
serve as the link between the Agencies and the Environmental Protection Agency. Other
major duties of the manager will be:
3  Issue Environmental Clearance for road designs prepared by GHA, DUR and
DFR.
*  Co-ordinate and Supervise work of the Agencies
*  Liaise with the Environmental Protection Agency - changes in Environmental
Legislation:
D  Prepare and sign Environmental Clearance Reports for road and bridge
designs for the GHA. DFR and DUR projects;
*  Attend meetings on the Road Section Development Programme.
*  Brief consultants prior to their award of consultancy contracts;
*  Conduct public hearings to provide a forum for localities to discuss their
concerns about environmental and social aspects of proposed road projects.
*  Ensure that Social Assessment has been carried out for DFR, DUR and GHA
projects.
Deputy Managers
Four Deputy Managers will assist the Manager. Environment. The first of the Deputy
Managers will be in charge of monitoring GHA projects. He will monitor the extent and
effectiveness of mitigation measures suggested for the various impacts. The second
Deputy Manager also based at GHA will be in charge of Environmental Impact
Assessment Studies. The third and fourth Deputy Managers will be based in DFR and
DUR, respectively, and will deal with the environmental matters for the two Agencies.
- 26 -



Deputy Manager - Monitoring
Reporting directly to the Environmental Manager. the Deputy Manager in charge of
monitoring. wvill liaise with the Regional Maintenance Engineer. Through the use of
standard monitoring forms he/she will receive monthly information from the Regional
Maintenance Engineer. The Deputy Manager may visit sections of the roads to cross-
check the information received. He will then analyse the information to find out if the
recommendations made for mitigating the site impacts suggested in the EIA reports are
closely adhered to.
Advise the DFR and DUR on the imposition or exacting financial penalties from
Contractors or other sanctions. e.g., halting work of contractor for non-compliance with
environmental laws or implementing correctly the mitigation measures.
GHA Deputy Manager - Assessment
The Deputy Manager (GHA) for Assessment will assist the Environment Manager to
brief consultants. The task of registering the project with the Environmental Protection
Agency will be performed by him when there is the need to conduct in-house
Environmental Impact Assessment of road projects, the Deputy Manager in-charge of
Assessment will be the lead officer.
Deputy Managers - DFR/DUR
The Deputy Manager (DFR) will report directly to the Environmental Manager/
Consultant at the GHA. He will compile a list of projects. assist the manager to
commission and conduct Environment Studies, review designs and monitor road
projects.
The Unit At Regional Level
In the Regions and District, the Regional Maintenance Engineers will, among their
normal duties, serve as the Environmental Monitoring Officers. They will be supplied
with monitoring forms on monthly basis from the head office (GHA. DUR and DFR).
The forms should be distributed to the District Heads. The Regional Maintenance
Engineer will collect the forms from the District Heads on monthly basis and submit
them to the Environment Manager.
