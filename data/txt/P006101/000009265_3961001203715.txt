MfMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION 0  THE PRESIDENT
OF TIE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO BELIZE
FOR A PRR  EDUCATION DEVELOMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to Belize for the equivalent of US$7.1
million to help finance a Primary Education Development Project. The loan
would be repayable over a period of 17 years, including four years of grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. It would help finance a
project covering selected investments to improve the quality of instructional
inputs in the country's primary schools and increase student educational
achievement levels through training of teachers and staff in the Ministry of
Education; developing curriculum, textbooks, and diagnostic tests, and
upgrading school facilities. It would also support improvements in the
management of the education system to make schools more responsive to the
needs of the country's multi-cultural population, and more effective
environment for learning.
2.         Backaround.  Belize is a small, sparsely populated country with an
economy based on agriculture, including an agricultural export sector,
tourism, and light manufacturing. The population in 1989 was around 184,200,
occupying an area of about 22,000 kml. Per capita GDP reached US$1,610 in
1989, placing Belize among the upper-income countries of Contral America and
the Caribbean region. The main feature of the population is that 43 percent
is under 14 years of age. Emigration and 4imgration flows are also important
forces affecting the population. About 40,000 Beliseans are living in the
United States while a mainly Spanish-speaking refugee population from
neighboring countries that is living in Belize reached about 30,000 according
to official 1"89 estimates. The ethnic composition of the population is
diverse, yet no single ethnic or cultural group is dominant. Estimates of
income and wealth distribution indicated that economic resources are more
evenly distributed in Belize than in most of the other countries in the
region. Belize appears to have an ample supply of semi-skilled and skilled
workers to meet the needs of the country's principal economic sectors.
However, the quality of basic education and training of the labor force must
be improved as a prerequisite to mobilizing investment and sustaining economic
development.
3.          Belize's primary education system has achieved high levels of
participation as compared to other Caribbean and Central American countries.
However, the quality of education and studant performance urgently need
improvement. About 90 percent of the population aged 5-14 (about 40,000
pupils) were enrolled in government and government-aided primary scbools in
the school year 1990191; thus universal primary education is apt to be
achieved before the end of the decade. Male and female enrollments at the
primary level are about evenly distributed. About 80 percent of children
beginning prrimary school progress through the eight grades and some 60 percent
of those who take the primary school leaving examiration go on to the
secondary level. Gross progression rates are in the range of 90 percent so
that very few students repeat an academic year at the primary level. On the
other hand, Belizean authorities generally acknowledge--albeit without
comprehensive hard data--that the education system suffers from low quality



performance. Poor quality is evidenced by low levels of reading ability,
English comprehension and knowledge of math among primary school graduates.
Even the more capable students--those who gain access to secondary schools--
are ill-prepared for work at the first year level.
4.          The Ministry of Education, Youth, Sports and Culture (MOE) is
responsible for managing the national education system. However, it shares
responsibilities with churches of various denominations in a unique public and
private sector partnership. Under the partnership, defined by the 1991
revised Education Act, the Government establishes educational objectives,
develops the curriculum and administrative standards, trains teachers, and
administers selection examirations at the end of the primary education cycle.
It also pays teachers' salaries, contributes half the costs of school
facilities and their maintenance, and makes an allotment per student for
instructional materials. The church organizations are responsible for
operations, school maintenance, and all personnel matters in their schools
which constitute 85% of the total of 236 primary schools. The partnership
between MOE and the churches has assisted the Government in overcoming some
manpower and financial constraints in managing the system, although
constraints continue. Despite the relatively high private spending
contributions to total expenditures on education in Belize, the bulk of
educational financing still comes from the central government. The share of
public education expenditures of GDP and of the central government budget for
1989 were 5.7 percent and 21 percent respectively. In addition, the education
sector as a whole receives a modest US$0.9 million (1990) or 4.7 percent of
the Government's public invLstment program annually. At present there is no
tuition charged in government primary schools and none is proposed, as parents
in all types of schools generally contribute through various fund raising
activities and in purchasing instructional materials. Under the proposed
loan, annual public investments in education over the next eight years would
increase to about US$1.2 million for primary education. The distribution of
MOE expenditure is generally appropriate: in 1989 approximately 60 percent of
the total education budget was allocated to primary education; about 24
percent to secondary, and 7 percent to tertiary. Only 3 percent of total
expenditures were spent on administration.
5.          The main needs facing Government in primary education--having
attained relatively high rates of student enrollment and progression--are
improving thA quality of educational inputs and student achievement levels,
enhancing educational resources, and increasing the effectiveness of the
management of education. The system has a serious shortage of adequately
trained teachers, with only 45 percent of the 1,941 primary teachers qualified
for teaching according to MOE standards. It also provides insufficient salary
incentives for teachers to undertake training, does not equip teachers with
relevant skills, and its Belize Teachers College (BTTC) has neither sufficient
capacity nor resources. Teachers do not follow a standard curriculum
developed by the Curriculum Development Unit (CDU) and lack the minimum
necessary instructional materials. Neither teacher training nor the
curriculum are safficiently geared to meeting the early primary education
needs of Belize's non-English speaking children. The education system also
lacks reliable instruments for assessment and evaluation of school performance
and student achievement needed to identify necessary improvements, and most
primary school facilities are overcrowded and/or in need of expansion or
repair. Most primary students, particularly those of low-income families, do



not have access to a basic set of textbooks, and when books are available for
purchase, they are not affordable to most families. MOE's operational
capacity to address these problems is constrained by its small staff,
inadequate field level management resources (e.g. transportation and office
facilities), lack of management information, and budget constraints. There
4s, however, considerable scope for strengthening education planning and
management, and to make schools more responsive to community needs and more
effective learning e.vironments.
6.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project forms an
integral part of the Bank's strategy for country assistance. One of the major
objectives of the strategy is to assist in the development of Belize's human
resources, including the institution-building tha. is critical for sustained
economic growth. Other objectives are aimed at supporting the development of
basic infrastructure for the effective utilization of the country's vast
natural resources, and promoting the development of the private sector as the
principal engine of economic growth. The proposed operation is the Bank's
first in the education sector. Strengthening primary education in this first
operation is the logical point of departure of a longer-term strategy of Bank
support to upgrade the quality of Belize's education system at all levels.
The project draws upon an Education Sector Review (Report No. 7505~--REA.. aated
January 24, 1989, and the lessons learned from other sector operations within
and outside the region on school improvement initiatives and on the develop-
ment and sustainability of education in small countries. These lessons
indicate that small countries need extensive technical assietance to
supplement their very limited administrative and technica. manpower available
for project implementation; the introduction of eduacation reforms is a complex
and lengthy process requiring strong and innovative leadership by Ministries
of Education in partnership with public and private groups at all levels; and
the sustainability of improvements in instructional inputs requires the
Government and private sources to make increased provisions in their budgets
for non-salary expenditures.
7.          Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project supports the
Government's education policies and development plans for primary education
for the period 1992-97. The project's principal aim is to improve the quality
of instructional inputs in primary schools and increase student educational
achievement levels by pursuing the following objectives: (a) introducing a
new system for the training of primary school teachers in order to improve the
quality and relevance of teacher training and increase the number of teachers
with professional certification; (b) improving the quality, availability, and
efficient use of educational facilities and resources for teaching, learning
and assessment; and (c) strengthening the planning and management of education
to enable Government to develop policies and implement programs to improve the
cost-effectiveness of its expenditures on primary education.
8.          Proiect Descrigtion.  The objectives of the project would be
achieved through three components: teacher education, education development,
and planning and management. (a) The Teacher Education Comtonent (US$2.50
million including contingencies) would provide 46 months of technical
assistance to hel& introduce a new pre-and in-service training system under
which 700 primary school teachers would become professionally certified,
thereby increasing the percentage of certified teachers from 50 percent to 80
percent over the life of the project. It would also enhance the quality and



- 4 -
relevance of teacher training, emphasize practical skills for effective
instruction in a culturally and linguistically diverse society, introduce a
system of salary incentives for teachers who complete the various stagee of
training, and help establish an in-service teachers training system on a part-
time basis in outlying districts. It woul4 also provide training for
principals as key agents of change and instructional leaders at the school
level. Finally, the project would help strengthen the BTTC through an
institutional twinning arrangement with a zeacher training college abroad,
travel and stuoy for staff, and civil woris and equipment. (b) The Education
Development Component (US$7.75 million including contingencies) would have two
sub-components. The first is a School Facilities Improvement Program (SPIP)
under which the project would give pr-ority to addressing the problems of
overcrowded classrooms. It would support where appropriate, a combination of
multiple shifts and construction and renovation of 105 classrooms in both
urban and rural schools to relieve overcrowding, and the renovation, upgrading
and construction of 10 principals' houses to help rural and remote communities
attract principals to those schools. A second would: (i) strengthen the
capacity of the CDU to develop standardized and ctlturally relevant school
curricula and produce and disseminate learning materials compatible with the
curriculum and the teaching of English as a second language; (ii) support the
implementation and moanitoring of a new textbook loan scheme to provide all
students with a basic set of textbooks for use in school; and (iii) help
establish an achievement monitoring system for continuous classroom evaluation
for feedback into policy analysis, teacher training and curriculum/materials
development. Approximately 50 months of technical assistance would be
provided, as well as 18 months of fellowships and study tours, civil works to
expand the facilities of the CDU and build offices for a new Assessment and
Evaluation cell, books, materials and equipment. (c) The Planning and
M4anagement Component (US$2.39 million including contingencies) would provide
42 months of technical assistance to help strengthen a new educational
Planning Unit (PU) in MOE, develop a new management information system and a
school map, and support special studies for planning and policy making. The
component would also provide technical assistance and in-service training to
help MOE strengthen its management of the education sector, in particular its
financial managements budget processing, budget monitoring, and accounting
systems. The -omponent would support MOE's strategy of strengthening regional
management and support services to teachers and principals by constructing new
facilities and upgrading the resources of three education centers, now in
temporary and inadequate facilities. Books and equipm.nt would also be
provided for the centers.
9.          The proposed project would be managed by a small Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) staffed by Belizeans and located in MOE under the
direct supervision of the Chief Education Officer.  The Director of the PIU
would manage the PIU team and coordinate the inputs of the long- and short-
term consultants financed by the Overseas Development Administration of he
United Kingdom (ODA). The ODA-financed inputs would be provided by an
educational institution in the Un.ted Kingdom under a twinning arrangement
with the MOE. The PIU Director would also ensure effective cooperation,
stipulated under the Belize Education Act, between the MOE and the church
organizations in implementing project objectives. The project would be
carried out over a period of seven years. Annual reviews and a mid-term
review will be carried out to follow up project implementation and take
corrective actions as needed. The total cost of the project is estimated at



- 5 -
US$12.6 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$4.1 million
(481). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shcwn in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Belize are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 9845-BEL dated November 8, Ls also attached.
10.         Agreed Actions.  Prior to nen.otiations, the Government confirmed
it had: (a) established the PIU and appointed its Director with qualifications
and experience satisfactory to the Bank, and agreed not to change the Director
without the prior agreement of the Bank; (b) approved the proposed changes to
the system of teacher training, certification, and remuneration developed for
the project; (c) filled 50 percent of existing and newly created establishment
posts of importance to project implementation in the BTTC, PU, Evaluation and
Assessment Unit, and District Education Offices, and agreed to fill the
remaining posts by June 30, 1992. At negotiations, the Government agreed to:
(a) sustain a minimum annual allocation of US$300,000 equivalent in real terms
in each fiscal year for operations and maintenance of school facilities
beginning on April 1, 1993, and continuing throughout project implementation,
and to prepare an operations and maintenance plan for all primary schools,
acceptable to the Bank, by December 31, 1992; (b) adopt a policy by May 31,
1992, for permitting each school to use textbook loans fees collected from
parents to purchase additional textbooks or other instructional materials;
(c) monitoring indicators and key performance targets (e.g. new teachers
certified, classrooms constructed, textbooks used in the classroom); (d)
prepare and furnish for Bank review, not later than December 1 of each year
beginning in 1993: (i) a yearly evaluation of project implementation results
and expenditure for the preceding year; (ii) a related review of achievements
and shortfalls based on established plans and objectives; (iii) an impla-
mentation and expenditure plan for the following year, acceptable to the Bank;
and (iv) the results of periodic assessments carried out by HOE to measure
student achievement at the primary level; (e) conduct a mid-term review of the
project towards the end of 1994 and take corrective actions as needed; and,
(f) provide annual increments to the recurrent budget totalling US$0.9 million
for the period 1992-98 for: staff salaries, operations and maintenance, and
other expenses to support project implementation and sustain all project
inputs after project completion.
11.         As conditions of loan effectiveness, the Government would: (a)
complete the appointment of the PIU professional staff with skills and
experience satisfactory to the Bank; (b) sign an agreement with ODA,
satisfactory to the Bank, on the co-financing of the troposed project; and (c)
submit preliminary designs and draft bidding documents for new facilities
satisfact.ory to the Bank.
12.         Proiect Benefits.  The project would improve the quality and
effectiveness of primary education by: (a) increasing the percentage of
certified primary school teachers from 50 percent to 80 percent; (b)
renovating and building approximately 105 primary school classrooms to relieve
overcrowding and improve the teaching and learning environment; (c) providing
all primary school children with a basic set of textbooks in the classroom;
(d) revisLng and standardizing primary school curricula and constructing
diagnostic and achievement tests for continuous classroom evaluation and



- 6 -
feedback for policy, teacher training and curriculum development; and (e)
strengthening the planning and management cipacity of the MOE to make needed
improvements in management information, research and analysis, and education
and training of staff.
13.         Pro1ect Risks.  There are two main risks.  The first relates to
the limited management capacity in MOE to implement the measures needed to
improve the quality and efficiency of the education system. This risk is
addressed by providing support for a PKJ under the Chief Education Officer to
plan and cocrdinate project implementation with MOP, staff and by making
available technical assistance and training to strengthen the ma-nagement of
government and church schools. The second risk is that project achievements
may not be sustained after project completion. To ensure the sustainability
of project achievements, MOE would approve the necessary policies and levels
of recurrent budgetary support for key programs of teacher training, textbook
distribution, and school facilities construction and maintenance.
14.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan of US$7.1
million would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bink and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve it.
