MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ANTALYA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY
FOR THE ANTALYA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Antalya Water Supply and Sewerage
Authority (ASAT) for US$100 million equivalent, with the guarantee of the
Republic of Turkey to help finance the Antalya Water Supply and Sanitation
Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,
with a maturity of seventeen years, including five years of grace. A parallel
financing totalling US$46.0 million is to be provided by the European
Investment Bank (EIB).
2.        Country/Sector Background.  Turkey enjoys abundant aggregate water
resources. However, there are some regions facing permanent or seasonal water
shortages. About 93 percent of the population is served with piped water but
the quality of service is often poor. Water consumption (77 lcd) is about 39
percent of the European average (200 lcd). Water resources are estimated at
about 200 billion m3/year, of which 60 percent are used for irrigation and the
rest for municipal and industrial use. In the Central Government, the
responsibility for water and sewerage is shared by six different
organizations.
3.        Greater Metropolitan Antalya (AMM) is a major tourism center and
the largest municipality on the southern Turkish Mediterranean coast with a
population of 491,000 in 1994, growing at an average annual rate of 7 percent.
About 95 percent of the population is connected to the water supply network,
and 100 percent to individual septic tanks, cesspits or small sewage treatment
plants. Handling of septage is provided by the municipal Environmental Health
Department and three private companies. Domestic, commercial and industrial
wastewater is currently discharged into the underlying karstic limestone
travertine formation. This has degraded underground water quality and has had
negative impacts on water supply, health, recreation and fisheries. The
provision of water supply and distribution is inefficient. Non-revenue water
accounts for 46 percent of production. These losses generate pressure for
premature development of new water sources. Moreover, pollution from septic
tanks has forced AMM to abandon some springs and wells, and soon other water
sources will have to be abandoned.
4.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  In the past 20
years the Bank provided eight loans amounting to US$946.3 million to water
authorities in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and Bursa and to small municipalities
in the Cukurova Region. Five of the projects are still under implementation.
The Bank-financed projects have been partially successful in meeting their
physical targets and in encouraging the Government to establish municipal
water authorities, thereby reducing the need for financial support from the
central and municipal governments. Lessons learned from the previous projects
indicated a need to improve efficiency. In view of the generally poor track
record and constraints faced by public sector entities, there is a growing
consensus that private sector participation would improve project management
and financial discipline. Past projections of water sales and implementation
schedules generally proved to be too optimistic. It was also learned that for
timely and successful project implementation, detailed designs should be
prepared in the early stages of the project. Last but not least, it is



- 2 -
essential to obtain a clear political commitment to implement adequate tariff
levels and improve utility finances. The proposed project takes the above
lessons into account and goes a step further than previous projects by
promoting important institutional changes to enable significant private sector
involvement.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  This project is consistent with
the Bank's strategy for Turkey as outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) discussed by the Board on March 11, 1993. The strategy includes support
to help improve water supply and the environment, promote sustainable use of
natural resources, and strengthen local institutions' capacity. Recently,
through a review of sector issues (Urban Water and Sanitation Sector Review,
March 26, 1993) and a workshop, the Bank has promoted discussion of
institutional changes aiming at: (a) reducing Central Government involvement
in water supply and sanitation investments; (b) promoting decentralization of
investment responsibilities and service delivery; and (c) encouraging private
sector involvement wherever possible. The proposed project outlines a course
to achieve these goals, and hence could have potential for replication in
other municipalities. Also, the proposed project is to be followed by a solid
waste management project, also for Antalya, which is expected to be submitted
for Board consideration shortly, after the borrower completes all the
necessary requirements for acquiring the land for the landfill. The solid
waste management project would aim at: (a) improving solid waste collection;
(b) developing a new sanitary landfill; (c) improving land management and
pollution monitoring; and (d) contracting out with the private sector solid
waste operations and street sweeping.
6.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would be an important step
in the implementation of the Bank's strategy in the water supply and sanitation
sector. The objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to meet at least cost
the demand for water supply, sewerage, and stormwater drainage; (b) to develop
new institutional arrangements for management of municipal water supply,
sewerage and stormwater drainage, and to introduce private sector participation
in the operation of the services; (c) to implement appropriate cost recovery
policies; (d) to postpone the need to develop costly new water resources by
improving the efficiency of utilization of existing sources and of water usage;
and (e) to improve and sustain environmental conditions and reduce health
hazards that threaten the local population and the tourism industry.
7.        Prolect Description.  The project would support the policies needed
to achieve the objectives summarized above. The project represents the first
phase, to be implemented from 1995 through 2002, of an investment program
designed to continue to the year 2020. The project will: (a) renovate,
rehabilitate and extend the existing water supply network; (b) provide a new
sewerage network and a preliminary wastewater treatment plant on the western
part of the Municipality; (c) improve operation of septic tanks in the eastern
part of the city; (d) upgrade the stormwater drainage system in flood areas and
establish a comprehensive master plan; and (e) provide technical assistance for
project implementation (engineering services and project management) and
institutional development (particularly training and preparation of the lease
and management arrangements for the provision of water and sewerage services).
8.        Project Implementation.  The project comprises water supply,
sewerage and stormwater drainage, with Antalya Water Supply and Sewerage
Authority (ASAT) as borrower. While leaving the legal authority with the



borrower, administrative and financial management of the services would be
consolidated within a company (Sirket), owned by ASAT, AMM and the District
Municipalities (DMs) and incorporated under Turkish trade law. The creation
of this Sirket, which will oversee the operation of the services by a private
operator under lease and management arrangements is a condition of loan
effectiveness. The Project Management Unit (PMU), which is already in place
and reporting to the AMM Mayor, will assist the Sirket as well as the AMM,
ASAT and DMs in implementing the project for about one year after the signing
of the contract with a private firm for the operation of water supply and
sewerage services. A high-level expert for the PMU, experienced in project
management and familiar with the Bank's procurement and disbursement
procedures and guidelines, will be hired as a condition of loan effectiveness.
9.        Project Cost and Financing.  The project cost is estimated at
US$244.6 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$129.9
million equivalent (53%), including taxes and duties estimated at about 9% of
total cost. The Bank would finance US$100.0 million (77% of the foreign
exchange cost and 41% of the total financing required). EIB would finance
US$46.0 million, Iller Bank US$31.5 million, DSI US$3.5 million and internal
cash generation US$63.6 million.
10.       The Bank would finance incremental recurring expenditures for the
Sirket and the PMU (US$200,000 each) for a limited period (until the end of
August and November 1996, respectively). The financing of the Sirket is
required to cover its operating costs from the initiation of operations until
the flow of tariff-based income from the private operator of the water and
sewerage system becomes effective. The financing of the PMU is required to
substitute for the Japanese Grant until the Sirket is fully operational.
Retroactive financing in an amount of US$600,000 would be provided to cover
PMU expenditures after March 31, 1995.
11.       Issues and Actions.  At negotiations agreement was reached that
ASAT would invite bids for the private operator of water and sewerage services
not later than October 31, 1995, and that the private operator would be hired
not later than May 31, 1996. Assurances were obtained that ASAT would
implement tariff and other charges sufficient to ensure full coverage of: (i)
ASAT and Sirket operating costs; (ii) the charges of the private operator as
set in the lease and management contract; (iii) a reasonable contribution to
investment; and (iv) debt service. ASAT also agreed to: (a) implement
quarterly tariff adjustments to compensate for inflation; (b) not to undertake
investments over US$200,000 outside the Project without the prior concurrence
of the Bank; (c) to come with alternative financing arrangements if EIB
financing is not effective by December 1, 1995. Further, it was agreed that
ASAT: (a) would appoint key staff of the Sirket by November 30, 1995 and would
limit the Sirket professional staff to a maximun of ten; (b) would contract,
not later than April 30, 1996, technical assistance for the Sirket, (c) would
sign with the Sirket, not later than November 30, 1995, a subsidiary agreement
for contract management and other project related administrative and financial
services; and (d) would undertake jointly with the Bank and the Sirket annual
reviews of progress in project execution. Prior to loan effectiveness ASAT
would: (a) establish the Sirket; (b) engage the technical assistance for the
PMU; (c) engage the consultant to assist in the preparation of bidding
documents, bid evaluation and negotiations for the hiring of the private
operator of the water and sewerage services; and (d) complete all the legal



- 4 -
requirements for land acquisition and ensure that no obstacles remain for the
completion of the sewage treatment plant.
12.       Environmental Aspects.  The Project is classified as "B" for the
purpose of O.D. 4.01. Analyses consistent with the requirements for Category
"B" projects were undertaken during the preparation of the Project and the
consultant who prepared the feasibility study took into account the needed
assessment and control of detrimental effects of the marine outfall for the
treated effluent from the wastewater treatment plant. Satisfactory designs
would be submitted to the Ministry of Environment and the Bank for approval
before tendering. Civil works contracts would include appropriate
requirements to ensure that these works are carried out in such a way as to
minimize any negative environmental effects. There are no resettlement issues
in the project.
13.       The project strives to protect the unique environmental conditions
of Antalya, benefitting the local population and the tourism industry as it
would: (a) protect and improve underground water quality through construction
of sewerage; and (b) improve water distribution and ease pressure on the water
sources by reducing water losses.
14.       Program Objective Categories.  The project would introduce private
sector participation in the operation of municipal services and would
contribute to improving environmental conditions and reducing health hazards.
The gender impact of the project is expected to be positive because adequate
access to water tends to alleviate existing burden on women. In 2002, 96% of
the population would be connected to the water network with about 60,000 new
beneficiary households having been added, including about 12,000 additional
low income households. Care has been taken to ensure that water and sewer
tariffs do not exceed two percent of the monthly income of the lowest income
groups. This is well within the Bank's rule of thumb of 5% of income for
maximum level of water and sewer charges for poor households.
15.       Participatory Approach.  Municipal as well as Central Government
authorities participated extensively in the project preparation process
including, inter alia, a seminar to discuss the proposed institutional
arrangements and a visit to privately-operated water and sanitation facilities
in Europe. This has ensured government ownership of the project at both
levels.
16.       Project Benefits.  The project approach supports the Government's
decentralization objective in shifting investment responsibility from the
government budget to the Municipality, which would recover costs through user
charges. It also seeks to strengthen the local authorities responsible for
provision of services. In particular, the project would: (a) promote
managerial efficiency and improve service quality through the new
institutional arrangements that would introduce private sector participation
through lease and management arrangements for the operation of the water
supply and sewerage services; (b) reduce health hazards to the local and
tourist population; and (c) improve environmental conditions.
17.       Risks.  Project risks relate to: (a) the challenge of setting up,
for the first time in Turkey, lease and management arrangements for the
operation of public utilities; (b) the Sirket's institutional and financial
capacity to carry out a large investment program in view of potential



-- 5 -
political interference; (c) the sustained willingness of municipal authorities
to maintain cost recovery measures necessary to assure affordability and self-
financing; and (d) the ability of Iller Bank and the State Hydraulic Works
(DSI) to complete their investments within the expected time. To mitigate
these risks substantial up-front actions have taken place. In addition, (i) a
seminar was held in May 1994 to discuss private sector participation as an
instrument to improve efficiency in the operation of public services; and (ii)
a visit of representatives of AMM, DMs, Ministry of Interior and Treasury was
organized in May-June 1994 to privately-operated water and sanitation
facilities in France and the UK. Furthermore, the project would include: (i)
substantial technical assistance; (ii) commitments from Iller Bank and DSI to
the objectives of the project; and (iii) a commitment from ASAT to complete
land acquisition before loan effectiveness. Another risk relates to securing
the full financing required; this would be contained by requiring that EIB
financing, which has already been approved, becomes effective by December 1,
1995, or that ASAT secure alternative financing arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank. Failure to secure such financing would constitute an event of
default.
18.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
