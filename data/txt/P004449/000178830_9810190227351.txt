FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR
THE JALAUR IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of $15 million
to help finance the Jalaur Irrigation Project. The loan would have a term
of 20 years including four and a half years of grace with interest at
8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited the Philippines in April/May 1975 and
its report, "The Philippines: Priorities and Prospects for Development, Basic
Economic Report" (Report No. 1095a-PH of May 5, 1976) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on May 18, 1976 (SecM/76/366). Paragraphs 3-16 below are
an updated summary of that report. Annex 1 contains country economic data. L
3.        During the 1960s, the economy grew in real terms at an annual rate
of about 5-6 percent. However, the rate of growth was less than the level
that might have been achieved if the considerable natural and human resources
of the Philippines had been exploited more effectively. Moreover, the benefits
of growth were distributed relatively unevenly. As the population and labor
force continued to grow rapidly, unemployment rose. Low levels of taxation
accentuated these problems and resulted in inadequate public investment in
necessary infrastructure and social services. A relatively weak export per-
formance combined with a failure to reduce the import dependence of domestic
industry resulted in a steady deterioration in the balance of payments posi-
tion.
4.        During 1970-72, the authorities adopted policies of monetary and
fiscal restraint in order to lay a firm basis for future growth. With
assistance from the Consultative Group for the Philippines, they succeeded in
improving substantially the maturity structure of the external public debt.
Real GNP during that period increased at about 5 percent a year. In 1972,
the Government initiated a series of social and economic reforms including
an agrarian reform program, tax reforms, and an administrative reorganiza-
tion.
5.        In 1973, there was a sharp increase in the level of economic
activity in the Philippines and the growth in real GNP doubled to 10 percent.
This upsurge was led by the international commodity boom, which resulted in
higher export incomes, a strong recovery in agricultural and industrial
production for the domestic market, and an expansion in public and private
investment.
/1 This is the same discussion of the economy as that in the President's
Report for the Third Highway Project (Report No. P-19604-PH1of December 13,
1976).

6.        Like most countries, the Philippines was profoundly affected by
the tumultuous events in the world economy that began with the jump in the
prices for food and petroleum in late 1973. With international trade the
equivalent of almost half of its GNP, the Philippines was quite vulnerable
to the impact of world inflation, the increase in oil prices, and the pro-
longed recession in the industrialized countries. While adverse effects of
the recession were cushioned somewhat in 1974 by a modest improvement in the
external terms of trade, the Philippines was more seriously affected in 1975
by the continued rise in import prices and reduced demand for Philippine
exports.  While the international economic situation has made it difficult
for the Government to realize its objective of accelerating the rate of
development, GNP in 1974 and 1975 has, nevertheless, grown in real terms at
an annual rate of about 6 percent and the same rate is expected in 1976.
7.        Agricultural production has grown at an average rate of 3.2 per-
cent per year during the 1970s, a period which has been characterized by
unusually adverse weather conditions. Rice production increased by 25 per-
cent in 1973/74, but because of damage by typhoons, grew by only 1 percent
in 1974/75; the Government had to import 200,000 tons in the first half of
1975 to ensure adequate stocks. However, the rice harvest in 1975/76 was
very good due to unusually favorable weather conditions and during this
period the Philippines was virtually self-sufficient in rice. The Government
continues to give the highest priority to further increasing agricultural
production and has initiated a number of programs designed to expand the use
of fertilizer, irrigation and supervised credit. It has also intensified
efforts to expand the social services needed in rural areas, including rural
electrification, health and family planning services, and village road and
small-scale irrigation projects.
8.        Although progress has been slower than initially planned, the
Government has made some progress with its agrarian reform for the nation's
one million tenant farmers who grow rice and corn. By May 31, 1976, the
Government had issued Certificates of Land Transfer to 216,000 of the
424,000 tenants on holdings of over 7 hectares; thus, title to 378,000
hectares of the total 825,000 hectares of farms occupied by such tenants has
been transferred. The Government has raised the cash portion of the com-
pensation package to landlords to reduce their resistance to land reform,
but strong administrative efforts will be necessary to ensure continued
progress in the implementation of the program.
9.        Industry accounts for almost 30 percent of net domestic product,
one third of total fixed investment and 15 percent of total employment.
Industrial production, which grew by 12 percent in 1973, was adversely
affected in 1974 and 1975 by the worldwide economic slowdown and the depressed
demand for Philippine exports. As a result, industrial production increased
by only 4 percent in 1974 and 5 percent in 1975. Stepped-up public sector
spending for infrastructure development and other priority projects and for
the alleviation of recent flood and earthquake damages has contributed
significantly to sustaining the higher level of domestic activity in 1976,
especially in the construction industry. The longer term prospects for
industrial growth are favorable because of the natural and human resource
endowment of the Philippines and a very active private sector.



- 3 -
10.       The Government has made significant progress in increasing public
investment. The ratio of public investment to GNP is currently over 3 percent,
having risen from 1.8 percent in FY72./1 The Government has also implemented a
series of long needed tax reforms and improvements in tax administration.
These reforms, aided by the increased economic activity, the boom in export
incomes, and domestic inflation, resulted in a 36 percent increase in national
government tax revenues in FY73, and an estimated 47 percent in FY74. The
ratio of national government tax revenues to GNP has increased from an average
of 9 percent in the early 1970s to about 12 percent in FY74 and FY75.
11.       Significant financial reforms have also been enacted.    At the begin-
ning of 1976, the Central Bank issued circulars designed to help rationalize
the level and structure of deposit and lending rates; deposit rates were raised
for the second time in 18 months; long-standing statutory ceilings on the long-
term lending rates of banking institutions were increased from 12-14 percent
to 19 percent per annum; and the ceilings on short-term lending rates were
raised. Efforts were also made to control short-term money market operations
and to strengthen the organized banking institutions. These actions should
help to improve the mobilization and allocation of domestic resources in the
Philippines.
12.       In the latter part of 1973, inflation emerged as a major problem
in the Philippines. The increase in prices was caused by the large increase
in liquidity that came with the export boom in 1973/74, and by a number of
cost-push factors, including the higher rate of world inflation. To deal
with this problem, the Government adopted contractionary monetary and fiscal
policies, and attempted to reduce the impact of inflation on consumers by
subsidizing such essential goods as wheat, imported rice, and cooking oil.
The annual inflation rate fell from 35 percent in 1974 to 8 percent in 1975,
and the authorities aim at keeping inflation below 7 percent in 1976. While
monthly inflation rates have generally been lower in 1976 than in 1975, there
have been moderate inflationary pressures in the last few months resulting
from the damages of recent typhoons to food crops, a 25 percent increase in
land transport fares, a significant though long overdue raise in the minimum
wages, and an increase in the controlled prices for rice and corn.
13.       On the external side, the Philippine balance of payments benefitted
considerably from the international commodity price boom during 1973. High
prices for the country's chief exports, including coconut products, sugar,
copper and wood products, resulted in a 70 percent increase in export earnings
and a current account surplus of about $550 million. Since mid-1974, the
external trade position has deteriorated, due to the sharp increases in the
prices of oil and other imports, less favorable prices for Philippine exports,
and reduced volume of some exports resulting from the downturn in the econo-
mies of the Philippines' main trading partners. As a result, current account
deficits of $240 million in 1974 and about $900 million in 1975 were incurred.
The current account deficits have been offset by direct foreign investment,
inflows of medium- and long-term loan capital, the use of IMF facilities and
/1 Fiscal year July 1 to June 30.

some short-term borrowing by the Central Bank. During 1976, export receipts
are expected to be about 10 percent greater than in 1975, with growth in
nonsugar primary exports and nontraditional manufactured exports more than
offsetting shortfalls in sugar receipts. Imports are expected to be only
about 4 percent greater than in 1975 because of relatively low rates of
industrial investment and the excellent rice crop which made rice imports
unnecessary. Taking into account trends in services and transfers, the
outlook is for a current account deficit of about the same magnitude as in
1975, which will be largely offset by capital inflows; the overall deficit is
expected to be about $200 million. In mid-1976, reserves stood at about
$1.2 billion, equivalent to four months' imports. Assuming continued sound
debt management and the maintenance of a reasonable maturity structure of
foreign borrowings, the overall level of external debt of the Philippines is
expected to remain within reasonable limits, as the ratio of debt service
payments to exports and nonfactor services would average about 16-17 percent
during the rest of this decade. At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt
outstanding is about 17 percent and its share in debt-service is about 4 per-
cent. These shares are expected to increase somewhat in the years ahead.
14.       Foreign assistance on concessional terms will be essential to
help finance the large investment expenditures which will be necessary for
the country's development. In order to ensure that disbursement of external
assistance reaches levels commensurate with the level of development expendi-
tures which will be required during the latter part of the decade and that
debt service obligations remain within reasonable limits, total commitments
of official assistance will need to be maintained in real terms at least
at the annual level of about $500 million which was achieved in 1974. The
Consultative Group for the Philippines at its meeting in Paris on June 15
and 16, 1976, agreed that it would be reasonable for the Philippine Govern-
ment to seek official aid commitments of about $600 million in 1976 and $700
million in 1977. Total new commitments of public and private medium- and
long-term capital would reach $2 billion in 1976 and need to be maintained
at approximately this level through 1980.
15.       Despite the slowdown in the growth of the economy, which is pri-
marily a result of worldwide economic conditions, the Government remains
committed to regaining the growth momentum which began in 1973 to provide
for a continued increase in incomes and employment. Both the Philippine
Government and the Bank's Basic Economic Report estimate that it should be
possible in the longer term for the Philippine economy to grow in real terms
at a rate of about 7 percent per annum provided that good economic management
continues and international economic conditions improve. High priority must
be accorded to expanding employment opportunities because unemployment
and underemployment are still high, and the labor force continues to grow
at 3 percent a year. Continued attention must also be given to expanding
the Government's effective family planning program to reduce the rate of
growth of the population and the labor force.
16.       The Government is pursuing a development strategy which focuses on
rural development with emphasis on food production; accelerated industriali-
zation, both in capital-intensive resource based industries and labor-intensive
export industries and a substantial expansion in public sector investment in
infrastructure to support the growth of the productive sectors. In support
of these objectives, the Government plans to continue its efforts to increase



- 5 -
public revenues, to strengthen the capacity of public sector agencies and to
foster the growth of exports. The Government recognizes that the increased
cost of petroleum and other imports cannot be financed indefinitely by borrow-
ing abroad, and it is actively encouraging both local and foreign investors to
expand productive investments. It will, however, take time for Government
programs to have an impact on the balance of payments, and the Government is,
therefore, seeking increased support from the international financial community
to assist in the financing of its development effort.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.       By November 30, 1976, the Philippines had received 38 Bank loans /1
(of which two were on Third Window terms) and three IDA credits for a total of
$941.5 million, net of cancellations. About one third of Bank lending, $306 mil-
lion, has been for infrastructure projects in power, transportation, and water
supply and another third, $303 million, has been for agriculture. Of the
remainder, about $250 million has been for industry and about $83 million has
been for social sector projects in education, population and urban develop-
ment. There has been a marked improvement in the execution of Bank-financed
projects in the last four years compared with experience in the 1960s, when
there were serious problems caused by a shortage of peso counterpart funds and
poor administration. All ongoing projects are now being implemented reasonably
well. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and
IFC investments as of November 30, 1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
18.       The Bank's lending program has been designed to continue to support
the Philippine development effort with its emphasis on agriculture and infra-
structure and its growing attention to the needs of lower income groups. About
one third of Bank lending planned for the future would continue to be for agri-
culture and rural development projects and another third would be for needed
basic infrastructure projects, mainly in the fields of transportation and power.
The amount of lending for social sector projects, including education, popula-
tion and urban development, is expected to continue to grow rapidly and account
for nearly 20 percent of future lending. The balance of future lending would
be for industrial development, where growing attention is being given to the
needs of small and medium industries with high employment potential. The rapid
growth in public revenues during the past five years has allowed for a signi-
ficant expansion in public investment and both the ambitious Philippine develop-
ment program and the Bank's growing lending program have been designed to make
good past neglect and to meet future needs. Bank lending totalled $165.1 mil-
lion in FY74, $208 million in FY75 and $268 million in FY76 compared to about
$30 million a year in the preceding five years.
19.       This is the second loan to be presented to the Executive Directors
in FY77. Other loans which may be ready for presentation later in FY77 are for
/1 On December 23, 1976, the Executive Directors approved a loan of $95 million
for a Third Highway Project.



- 6 -
agricultural credit, land settlement, education, power, irrigation and water
supply projects; a smallholder tree farming and forestry development project
and an inter-island shipping project may be ready in early FY78. A number of
these projects are designed to help the Government meet its objective of
increasing the productivity and incomes of the poorer segments of the population.
20.       As of October 31, L976, IFC has made commitments in the Philippines
totalling $78.9 million for investment in 14 companies in the fields of devel-
opment banking, power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum
products, nickel mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibres and
edible oils. Of these investments, $18.1 million had been sold, $0.4 million
cancelled and $7.2 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $53.3 million,
including $2.8 million undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have been received
for projects in the wood and mining industry.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
21.       Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy
accounting for about one third of net domestic product, over one half of
total employment and nearly three quarters of export earnings. Over 70 percent
of the 9 million ha of land under cultivation is used for the production of
cereals, of which rice and corn are the most important. The remaining land
is taken up by the major export crops: sugar, coconuts, abaca, pineapples,
and tobacco.
22.       The performance of the agricultural sector will be crucial in deter-
mining whether the Philippines can increase income both rapidly and equitably.
At present, the domestic market for industrial products is limited by rela-
tively low rural incomes. Although in recent years there has been a substan-
tial change in the terms of trade in favor of agriculture, the problems of
poverty and income distribution continue to be particularly acute in rural
areas; of the 15 million people in the bottom 40 percent of the income scale,
12 million live in rural areas. The Government is aware of these problems
and as noted in paras. 7 and 8, has initiated a number of programs designed
to assist the rural poor.
23.       The major goals the Government has set for the sector are
sustained self-sufficiency in cereals, particularly rice and corn; devel-
opment of the livestock and fisheries subsectors; and expansion of agri-
cultural exports. Sustained self-sufficiency in cereals would not only
strengthen the balance of payments, but would also help raise incomes for
much of rural population. The ability to assure self-sufficiency in rice
will depend largely on improving yields through increased cropping
intensity, the increased use of fertilizer and agro-chemicals and



-7-
the provision of adequate credit and other supporting services. High yield-
ing varieties, which helped to increase production in the late 1960s, require
a much higher degree of water control than is possible ufider rainfed condi-
tions or with the typical unimproved irrigation systems in the Philippines.
At present, out of 3.2 million ha planted to rice, only 1.3 million ha, or 40
percent, is irrigated. A program to upgrade and expand irrigation to cover an
additional 50,000 ha of rice land a year over the next decade would be needed
to meet the growing domestic rice demand on a sustained basis. Investment in
irrigation is therefore of high priority.
24.       Since the late 1960s, the National Irrigation Administration (NIA),
with assistance from the Bank and from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), has
been engaged in upgrading and extending large irrigation systems, mainly in
Luzon and to a lesser extent in Mindanao. In addition to rehabilitation of
existing canals and structures, the construction of new ones, the provision
of better drainage and access and the introduction of water management and
rotational irrigation practices, additional water supply is being provided in
some areas through the construction of storage or by transbasin diversion.
However, NIA has not neglected the need for rehabilitation and upgrading of
the badly deteriorated smaller systems scattered throughout the Philippines.
The National Irrigation Systems Improvement Study is expected to lead to pro-
jects increasing rice production on a total of about 150,000 ha with the highest
priority for improvement in a number of regions of the Philippines. A first
project in Leyte in the Eastern Visayas and in Northern Luzon, which are among
the poorest areas of the country, has already been appraised by the Bank.
25.       About one half of the expected Bank lending for agriculture in the
Philippines in the next five years is likely to be for irrigation. The pro-
posed project would be the seventh Bank-assisted irrigation project designed
to increase rice production in the Philippines. It is the first such project
on the Visayan islands. The first six projects, three in Central Luzon, two
in the Cagayan Valley of Northern Luzon and one on Mindoro Island,/1 set the
pattern for the type of irrigation rehabilitation, new construction and opera-
tions needed for increasing rice production in the Philippines. These projects
are providing improved irrigation and drainage facilities, better road systems
needed for efficient operation and maintenance and marketing of farm products,
stronger supporting services to assist farmers in adopting the new techniques
needed to increase production, and technical assistance and training to help
the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) to expand and improve its irriga-
tion program. These projects, together with the project now proposed, will
bring about substantial increases in rice production on about 235,000 ha and
will benefit nearly 100,000 farmers, most of whom are smallholders. As noted
in Annex II, while there have been some difficulties in attracting interest

in bidding on the part of local contractors and there have been substantial
cost increases under §ome of the projects, these problems are being overcome
and progress under the projects is generally satisfactory. All of the
projects are expected to have high economic benefits.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
26.       The proposed project would follow the same basic approach to
improving and expanding four national irrigation systems on Panay island in
the Western Visayas. In terms of size, it would fall between the larger Bank-
financed projects in Luzon and the smaller, scattered projects now being
prepared under the National Irrigation Systems Improvement Study. As the
first Bank-financed irrigation project on the Visayan islands, it would contri-
bute to the Government's objective of achieving a more regionally balanced
distribution of development.
27.       The Jalaur irrigation project feasibility report was prepared by
NIA with the assistance of consultants. The project was appraised in
June-July 1976 and negotiations were held in November 1976. The leader of
the Government negotiating team was His Excellency Eduardo Z. Romualdez,
the Philippines' Ambassador to the United States. The Appraisal Report
(No. 1311a-PH) on the project is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. Annex III of this report contains a loan and project
summary.
The Project Area
28.       The project is located in Iloilo Province on Panay island in the
Western Visayas. The Panay region is a surplus producer of rice and contains
about 12 percent of the area annually planted to rice in the Philippines and
accounts for 12 percent of total national production. The Iloilo Province of
Panay accounts for 35 percent of the region's rice production and exports
65 percent of its rice production to the nearby island of Negros. The mean
rice yield in Iloilo is about 18 percent above the national average. This
is due to the existence of irrigation systems, fertile soils well suited
to rice production, good external drainage, rapid adoption of high yielding
varieties, the relative absence of typhoons, and a fairly even distribution
of rainfall. The project area accounts for about 40 percent of the rice area
and 60 percent of rice production in Iloilo. There are a number of small
towns with populations of between 5,000 and 10,000 in the project area;
larger towns, including the provincial capital, provide banking, storage and
processing facilities as well as supplies of inputs to the surrounding
agricultural area. The project area is connected to the provincial capital
and port of Iloilo by a national highway and a paved provincial road.



- 9 -
29.       About 12,000 farm families live in the project area.    The average
farm size is 2.1 ha; two thirds of the farms, accounting for more than half
the total area, range from 1 to 3 ha and more than 95 percent of the farms,
accounting for 85 percent of the total area, are less than 5 ha. Per capita
incomes on rice farms of 1.5 - 3 ha range from $45 to $135, or between 12
and 35 percent of national per capita income. About 75 percent of the farm
families are presently at or below the absolute poverty level for the
Philippines.
30.       Under the Government's land reform program, land transfer certi-
ficates have been issued to all tenants in the country on rice and corn
holdings of more than 24 ha and the Government is now proceeding with transfer
on land holdings of between 7 and 24 ha. Under the Government's program,
tenants on holdings of less than 7 ha will no longer be share croppers, but
will be protected by lease agreements providing for payment of fixed rents.
Of the 12,000 farm families in the project area, about 9,000 are tenants on
17,600 ha. Land transfer certificates have already been issued to about
2,650 tenants on about 4,200 ha and the transfer of land on holdings of more
than 7 ha will eventually benefit about 4,100 tenants who will own more than
6,600 ha. When the land transfer has been completed, some 7,100 owner opera-
tors, or 59 percent of the farmers, will own and cultivate 12,700 ha (average
size of holdings will be 3 ha irrigated and 5 ha unirrigated land), or 54
percent of the land in the project area. The remaining 4,900 tenant farmers
would operate under leasehold agreements.
Description of the Project
31.       The proposed project would upgrade four exising irrigation systems
and extend irrigation service to currently rainfed rice lands, a total of
24,700 ha, to standards adopted for similar Bank-assisted projects in the
Philippines. The project would include:
(a)  rehabilitation of four existing NIA irrigation and drainage
systems serving a total area of 22,000 ha;
(b)  construction of new irrigation and drainage facilities for
about 2,700 ha;
(c)  construction of project headquarters building and facilities
for operation and maintenance;
(d)  procurement of vehicles and equipment;
(e)  the provision of technical assistance to NIA for further
studies on the expansion of the project; and
(f)  a water management training program.

Project Cost and Financing
32.       The project is estimated to cost a total of $34 million, of which
$15 million, or 44 percent, would be in foreign exchange. The cost estimates
include provision for physical contingencies of 25 percent for irrigation
and drainage works and 10 percent for the operation and maintenance facilities
and water management training program. The cost estimates also include price
contingencies, amounting to 26 percent of total project cost, which take into
account the projected rates of international and domestic inflation. The Bank
loan of $15 million would finance the foreign exchange cost of the project.
The Government would finance the balance of $19 million from budgetary resour-
ces. To ensure timely and continuous flow of funds for implementation of the
project, NIA has set up a special account (Section 3.01 (b), draft Loan Agree-
ment). The Government would deposit money in the account and replenish it at
monthly intervals to a level equivalent to the estimated payments for goods
and services required for the project during each subsequent two-month period
less the estimated payments to be made by the Bank directly to suppliers and
contractors. The arrangement is similar to those adopted under previous
Bank-financed irrigation projects.
Project Execution
33.       The project would be implemented by the NIA, which was established
in 1964 to develop, operate and maintain all national irrigation systems in
the Philippines. It has recently been reorganized to meet the Government's
program of accelerated irrigation development. Major foreign assisted
projects have been placed under a Special Projects Organization headed by
an Assistant Administrator. To help the Assistant Administrator carry out
his heavy responsibilities, NIA proposes to employ two officers with broad
experience in public and/or business administration.
34.       Outside the headquarters, NIA is organized on a regional basis.
There are ten irrigation regions, each of which is headed by an Engineer.
The Regional Engineer, stationed in Iloilo, would be appointed Project Manager
for the proposed project. There would be an Assistant Project Manager who
would be stationed in the project headquarters in the project area. He would
have the day-to-day responsibility for project construction and would report
to the Project Manager in Iloilo, who would in turn report to the Assistant
Administrator in charge of the Special Projects Organization.
35.       For operation and maintenance purposes, NIA would establish in the
project area four support divisions dealing with engineering and operation,
administration, agriculture and equipment. For administrative purposes, the
project area would be divided into two irrigation districts serving about
14,600 ha and 10,000 ha respectively. The Director, who supervises the Central
Luzon and Magat water management training programs, would also be in charge of
water management training for the Jalaur project. A field supervisor would
be attached to each of the two irrigation districts to be responsible for the
day-to-day operation of the training program. To coordinate the provision of
agricultural services to farmers, the Government would establish an Agricul-
tural Development Coordinating Council in Iloilo Province (Section 3.01 (c),



- 11 -
draft Loan Agreement). The Council would consist of senior officers of
Government agencies concerned with agriculture development in the project
area. It would be chaired by an NIA representative. This arrangement has
worked well under the earlier irrigation projects financed by the Bank.
36.       The Agriculture Department of the Special Projects Organization in
NIA headquarters would be responsible for monitoring use of farm inputs,
adequacy of support services and progress in agricultural production and land
reform. The Department already performs these functions in the Bank-assisted
Luzon projects.
Cost Recovery
37.       Following discussions with the Bank in 1975 and 1976 in connection
with the Magat River Multipurpose Project and the Chico River Irrigation
Project (Loans 1154-PH and 1227-PH), NIA has agreed to review the rate of
collection of water charges for the national irrigation systems and to
identify factors affecting such collections. A report completed in June
1976 showed that for FY75 the total rate of collection was 59 percent, a
small improvement over the FY74 collection performance. However, preliminary
information indicates that for FY76 the national collection rate has fallen
to 25 percent since the fourfold increase in water charges in July 1975. The
collection rate in the region which includes the project is among the better
ones in the country. The study also resulted in some preliminary findings on
the factors affecting collections. NIA is making the necessary arrangements
to study the factors in greater depth. The objective of the investigations
will be to identify administrative and managerial obstacles to improved
collection, as well as to determine the causes of farmers' resistance to
payment. In view of the problems encountered in collecting water fees, NIA
would prepare, by October 31, 1978, a plan of action for improved collection
of irrigation fees for review by the Bank and implement this program thereafter
(Section 4.04, draft Loan Agreement).
38.       NIA is authorized to collect from users of irrigation systems, fees
to finance the costs of operation and maintenance of the system and to recover
construction costs. Irrigation fees on national irrigation systems were
raised in July 1975 to the equivalent of 2.0 cavans (100 kilograms) of paddy
per ha in the wet season and 3.0 cavans (150 kilograms) in the dry season,
to be applied uniformly to all national irrigation systems. As an exception
to the uniform rate policy, the Government has agreed to raise the rates on
the Bank-assisted Central and Northern Luzon Projects to a level equivalent
to about 3.5 cavans (175 kilograms) of paddy per ha in the wet season and
4.4 cavans (220 kilograms) in the dry season. These rates would be reached
gradually over a period of five years from completion of construction of each
project. It has been agreed that the same rates would apply to the proposed



- 12 -
Jalaur project. As a result, one third of the farms' total surplus (after
deducting imputed returns to capital, labor management and uncertainty) would
be paid in water charges.
Procurement
39.       Civil works in the project service area ($13.7 million) would be
scattered over five separate areas and have to be planned and executed as
far as possible to take into account the growing season and bad weather.
This work would not be suitable for international competitive bidding as it
consists of relatively small systems and would be phased over the project
implementation period. In the past, NIA has experienced considerable diffi-
culty in attracting bids for such works. Several steps have been taken
through Bank-assisted projects to strengthen local contractors, including the
financing of reconditioned equipment and providing mobilization allowances.
This has resulted in encouraging results in recent bids. Nevertheless, it is
doubtful that all civil works could be done by local contractors; some of the
works would therefore have to be carried out by force account. At the same
time, it would not be desirable for NIA to expand its force account work too
rapidly because of its heavy work program in the years ahead. Therefore,
the amount of work to be done by NIA by force account would be limited to not
more than 40 percent of the total cost of the civil works (para. B (i),
Schedule 4 to the draft Loan Agreement). The balance of this work would be
carried out on the basis of competitive bidding procedures advertised locally
in accordance with procedures which are acceptable to the Bank.
40.       Equipment and vehicles for force account construction, operation
and maintenance and the water management training program, costing about
$4.5 million, would be procured after international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. For purposes of bid comparison, a
preference limited to 15 percent of the c.i.f. price of imported goods, or
the customs duty, whichever is the lower, would be extended to qualified
local manufacturers. Off-the-shelf items costing less than $10,000 each
would be procured through existing Government procedures, which are accept-
able to the Bank, because any advantage of international competitive bidding
would be clearly outweighed by the administrative costs involved. The total
cost of such items would not exceed $200,000 (para. B (ii), Schedule 4 to the
draft Loan Agreement). There is adequate local competition for such items.
Disbursements
41.       The Bank loan would be disbursed for 100 percent of the c.i.f. cost
of directly imported equipment and vehicles, 100 percent of the ex-factory
cost of such items manufactured locally and 65 percent of such items imported
but procured locally. Disbursements for civil works would be 25 percent of
certified monthly payments or expenditures. For civil works contrators' mobili-
zation, and equipment, the loan would be disbursed for 100 percent of foreign
exchange cost. For consultants for the study of the possible future expan-
sion of the project, the loan would be disbursed for 100 percent of total cost.

Environmental Effects
42.       Schistosomiasis does not exist in the project area and malaria is
not a serious problem. The project would correct poor drainage in scattered
areas and the incidence of the mosquito nuisance caused by poor drainage in
the low-lying areas behind the belt of coastal fishponds would be reduced
by improved project drainage. The principal health problems in the area are
protein deficiencies in the preschool-age children, enteric diseases and
tuberculosis. The project would have little direct impact on them.
Benefits and Justification
43.       The proposed project would contribute to the Philippine Government's
objective of attaining self-sufficiency in rice, improving the productivity
and incomes of small farmers and promoting balanced regional redistribution
of development at a capital cost of $2,010 per benefited farm family. The
project would provide better water control, improved drainage and necessary
agricultural supporting services and thus increase rice yields and production
on 24,700 ha currently dependent on run-of-the-river irrigation and rainfed
cultivation. Total paddy production in the project area would increase from
80,000 tons at present to 147,000 tons per annum at full development. The
project would provide the equivalent of an additional 3,500 full-time jobs.
Some 12,000 farm families and 2,000 landless labor families for a total of
about 80,000 people would benefit directly from the project. At full project
development in 1985, per capita farm income in the project area would increase
in real terms from $45-135 at present to $110-390, compared to projected
national average per capita GNP of $550 in that year. The project would also
provide farmers with increased access to markets through an improved and
denser network of roads to be constructed along the canals and drainage
system as part of the construction of the system.
44.       Assuming a project life of 50 years, rice and fertilizer farm gate
prices based on the Bank's commodity price forecast and appropriate shadow
prices for unskilled labor and foreign exchange, the economic rate of return
of the project would be 20 percent. Sensitivity tests indicate that even
under a number of adverse assumptions, the rate of return would not fall below
15 percent. If shadow prices for unskilled labor and foreign exchange were
not applied, the internal rate of return of the project would be 18 percent.
45.       At full agricultural development, the project would result in rice
import savings of about $10 million per year at the forecast world market
prices. This would mean a net foreign exchange saving of about $9 million.
46.       There are no unusual risks associated with the project.   The risks
normally associated with irrigation projects have been accounted for in the
estimates of yields and of the areas to be irrigated during the dry season.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Loan No. 637     Upper Pampanga River Irrigation; $34.0 Million Loan of
August 18, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: October 15, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines and
will supply water year-round to nearly all its 84,000 ha command area. The
project's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irriga-
tion development in the country. Despite some delays caused by the 1972
floods, the dam was commissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of schedule.
Most of the work has been completed and the Loan is expected to be entirely
disbursed by the Closing Date. The Closing Date was postponed to allow dis-
bursement for the foreign exchange costs of the communications system which
is scheduled for completion April 1977. Project costs have increased 40 per-
cent over appraisal estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation, the
effects of successive devaluations of the peso, and design changes in the
dam (which accounted for nearly half the increase in costs). The increase
in costs is being financed by the Government. However, as a result of the
close coordination established between irrigation and agricultural support
services, the project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after
completion of construction, instead of 13 years which was the appraisal
estimate. Also, nearly 7,000 ha have been added to the project, mostly by
including lands which were formerly under a private irrigation system.
Finally, there has been a considerable increase in the projected world market
price of rice. As a result the estimated rate of return is now higher than
at appraisal.
Loan No. 720     Rice Processing and Storage; $14.3 Million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: May 10, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modern-
ization of the rice and corn processing industry. Originally the project
was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis was on
the construction of new integrated large capacity rice mills. Due in part
to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice mills, the
demand for subloans for new integrated rice mills turned out to be small

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken

tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

and, as explained in the President's Memorandum, dated June 8, 1972 (R72-40),
the Loan Agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis to rehabilita-
tion of existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this the project made
little progress. The Loan Agreement was amended again in April 1974 to (a)
expand the scope of the project to include corn in addition to rice, (b) enable
local governments and the National Grains Authority to borrow funds under the
project, and (c) streamline procurement procedures (President's Memorandum
SecM74-244 of April 15, 1974). As a result of these amendments, the project
is now progressing satisfactorily and the loan is expected to be fully commit-
ted by February 1977 and fully disbursed before the revised Closing Date,
June 30, 1977.

July 1, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150 MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. Although there has been some minor delay
due to the late delivery of transformers, the project is proceeding satis-
factorily, and the unit is expected to be commissioned before the end of
1976. The erection of transmission lines has been somewhat delayed due to
unfavorable weather and poor soil conditions and is' now expected to be
completed in April 1977. A tariff increase was approved, effective July 1,
1974, and a second tariff increase has recently been approved. However,
NPC is unlikely to be able to earn the expected rate of return of 8 percent
on net fixed assets in operation in 1976 because of delays in implementing
the second tariff increase.
Credit No. 471 Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; $9.5 Million Credit and
Loan No. 984     $9.5 Million Loan of May 14, 1974;'Date of Effectiveness:
August 22, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Although there has been some delay in constructing the two diversion
dams because of the need for more extensive foundations and abutment area
grouting than originally expected, most difficulties have been overcome and
the work is progressing satisfactorily. Diversion of 75 percent of Aurora
water into Pantabangan Reservoir was achieved in September 1975, one year
ahead of the appraisal schedule. All remaining engineering work on the
second division dam was completed in July 1976, one year ahead of schedule.
In the area served by the project, lack of competition caused some delay in
awarding of contracts, but this has been overcome. Efforts to attract bids
from more local contractors have been very effective. Urgent work is being
done by Government force account. Project costs have increased about 54
percent over appraisal estimates, largely as a result of inflation. There
would be added benefits from early diversion, however, resulting in additional
water for irrigation sooner than planned, but the rate of return is expected
to fall from 17 percent at appraisal to 14 percent.

Loan No. 998     Industrial Investment and Smallholder Tree-Farmers:
$50.0 Million Loan of June 12, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: September 9, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The proceeds of the Loan are being relent to the Development Bank
of the Philippines (DBP). The industrial portion of the Loan ($48 million)
is being used by DBP to finance direct imports for medium and relatively
large industrial projects. DBP is using the balance ($2 million) to finance
about 1,300 smallholders in a pilot tree-farming project. The Loan is now
virtually fully committed for subloans and disbursements are expected to be
completed before the closing date.
Loan No. 1010    Third Rural Credit; $22.0 Million Loan of June 17, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: August 27, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The Loan was fully committed by December 31, 1975 and disbursements
are expected to be completed long before closing date. Collection of arrears
by about 250 participating banks from beneficiaries under the first and second
projects is not satisfactory. The Central Bank is taking steps to improve
collection and appropriate measures will be included in the fourth project
which is currently being appraised.
Loan No. 1034     Sixth Power:  $61.0 Million Loan of July 31, 1974:
Date of Effectiveness: November 15, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance a 100 MW hydro plant at Pantabangan and transmission lines for the
further expansion of the Luzon grid and feasibility studies by consultants
for a future power project.   Major equipment for the plant has been con-
tracted and project commissioning is expected in January 1977, three months
ahead of original schedule.   The transmission component of the project is
behind schedule because necessary design work has been delayed due to NPC's
heavy construction program.   It is now expected that this part of the project
will be completed by the end of 1978, i.e. one year behind schedule. NPC
raised its tariffs on July 1, 1974, and a second tariff increase was recently
approved. However, NPC is unlikely to be able to earn the expected rate of
return of 8 percent on net fixed assets in operation because of delays in
implementing the second tariff increase.
Credit No. 349 Second Education; $12.7 Million Credit of January 5,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: April 11, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The Credit is helping to finance a project for development of
technical and vocational education and for improvement in curriculum develop-
ment and teacher training. Construction is about 11 months behind schedule



ANNEX II

mainly due to delays in the finalization of design/drawing of buildings and
recruitment of specialist services. This delay is being reduced through
effective management by the project unit. Procurement of equipment is on
schedule. Both the program and schedule of technical assistance have been
revised to suit the current needs of project institutions and to expedite
implementation. Disbursements are ahead of the appraisal estimate. Project
costs are now estimated to be about 25 percent higher than the appraisal
estimates and the cost increase is being financed by the Government. Despite
initial delays, the project is expected to be completed on schedule.
Loan No. 891    Fisheries; $11.6 Million Loan of May 21, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: December 5, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
This project is designed to provide long-term credit to the private
sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine and inland
fisheries development. The demand for subloans has been adequate, and the
organization to implement them has been properly established. The project is
progressing satisfactorily, and all funds were fully committed by July 1976
and are likely to be disbursed by the closing date.
Loan No. 939     Second Ports; $6.1 Million Loan of October 24, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: December 19, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
This project provides for the rehabilitation and expansion of the
ports of General Santos and Cagayan de Oro on the island of Mindanao. The
contract for General Santos was awarded in May 1975 but work has slowed
down due to dredging difficulties. For Cagayan de Oro, after about nine
months' delay, the contract was awarded on March 12, 1976 and work has now
commenced. The civil works were about 15 percent completed as of October 31,
1976.
Loan No. 950     Second Highway; $68.0 Million Loan of December 12,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: December 27, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is helping the Government to implement its program of
construction, improvement and rehabilitation of highways and feeder roads,
by financing the construction, improvement and rehabilitation of 1,400 km of
roads in Luzon. Works were about 70 percent completed as of September 1,
1976 on 14 contracts, 10 of which were awarded to local contractors. Costs
have increased sharply, but price adjustments are being awarded to contractors
by the Government to offset the sharp rises in costs of basic materials, fuels
and labor. Execution of other minor project items is generally proceeding
on schedule.

Date of Effectiveness: November 13, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The project is assisting the Government in expanding rural health
infrastructure, staff training facilities, and research and communications
capacity. Under the direction of Project Management Staff in the Department
of Health, overall project implementation is progressing well. Training
activities are well ahead of schedule in all 12 regions; the civil works
component lags by 9 months, but is projected to be completed ahead of the
appraisal report timetable due to simplification of construction design.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Loan No. 1048    Interisland Shipping; $20 Million Loan of October 29,
1974; Date of Effectiveness: January 15, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
The Government is relending the proceeds of the Loan to the
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for onlending to beneficiaries
for the acquisition of new and used ships and for major repairs and con-
versions. Progress under the project is satisfactory. Commitments were
originally slow, because of lack of demand from the private sector and
DBP's restrictive collateral requirements. These problems are now being
resolved; about $7 million have been committed as of November 1, 1976 and
subloan commitments are expected to increase rapidly during the coming
months.
Loan No. 1052   Private Development Corporation of the Philippines;
$30 million Loan of November 12, 1974: Date of
Effectiveness: February 7, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
The project assists in the financing of industrial subprojects,
the bulk of which are expected to go to export-oriented manufacturing
projects. As of October 31, 1976, commitments for subloans totalling
$12.5 million had been made. While subloan commitments have been some-
what slower than originally expected due to the generally slow pace of
business activity, the implementation of the project is satisfactory.
Loan No. 1080   Tarlac Irrigation; $17.0 Million Loan of January 27,
1975; Date of Effectiveness: April 27, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980
The project is assisting the Government to improve and expand
irrigation on 34,000 ha of land in Central Luzon. The project is progress-
ing satisfactorily with exceptionally good interest in the bidding for
civil works contracts. Procurement of equipment has been slow, but this
problem has been overcome.

Loan No. 1102   Rural Development; $25.0 Million Loan of April 16,
1975; Date of Effectiveness: July 28, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1981
The project is assisting the Government to carry out a rural
development project on the island of Mindoro, which includes infrastructure
and irrigation improvements, and ecological and health improvement measures.
Progress is satisfactory on irrigation and roads, which are being implemented
by agencies having experience with Bank-funded projects. With the exception
of the Mangyan Assistance Program, however, there has been little progress
under the other programs. This was caused mainly by the lack of funds due to
inadequate budgeting for the current 18-month fiscal year while the Government
changes to a calendar year financial system. Adequate financing to carry on
scheduled work for all project components, however, is expected for next year.
Loan No. 1120    Small and Medium Industries Development; $30.0 Million
Loan of June 5. 1975: Date of Effectiveness: August 20,
1975; Closing Date: August 31, 1979
The DBP portion of the funds has been fully committed. After a
slow start, commitment of funds under the Industrial Guarantee Loan Fund and
National Electrification Administration is now proceeding well. Overall
progress of the project is satisfactory.
Loan No. 1154    Magat Multipurpose Project; $42.0 Million Loan of
August 7, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: November 4, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project is assisting the Government to improve and expand
irrigation on 35,000 ha of land in the Cagayan Valley, Northern Luzon.
Consultant's work on the engineering and economic evaluation studies is
making good progress. The water management training is underway and a
start has been made on civil works.
Loan No. 1190    Industrial Investment; $75.0 Million Loan of
January 28, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: April 6, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
The proceeds of the Loan are being relent to the Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for subloans to finance direct imports for
medium and relatively large industrial projects. Commitment of funds
is much slower than expected. As of October 31, 1976, only $1.8 million
against the estimated $17 million was committed. This is due to a slowdown
of investment in the industrial sector as a whole over the past twelve
months. Government has made a proposal to reallocate about $25 million
of the funds for small and medium industries. The proposal is under
consideration.
