I. BACKGROUND
A. The Rural Sector
Agriculture in the Economy
1.01      During the past decade (1970-80), agriculture grew at an average
annual rate of 4.7%, and, although this rate is respectable, it was signifi-
cantly less rapid than GDP growth during the same period (5.9%) and has been
marked by a substantial slowdown in recent years (3.4% versus GDP growth of
4.4% between 1978 and 1980). The agricultural sector's share of GDP has
decreased from about 29% in 1970 to 24% in 1980, with about 13% contributed by
the crop subsector, 9% by the livestock subsector, and 2% by the fishing,
hunting and forestry subsectors. Of an estimated population of about 26.7
million (mid-1980), nearly 8.5 million, or 32%, lived in rural areas, and 27%
of the economically active labor force was engaged in the agricultural sector.
Average GNP per capita in Colombia was about US$1,180 in 1980, disguising
important differences between urban and rural areas.
1.02      In 1980, agricultural sector exports represented about 67% of total
merchandise exports of Colombia. Export performance, however, is highly
influenced by changes in coffee prices and volume; coffee exports increased
by about 50% between 1977 and 1980, both in volume and value. In addition to
coffee, representing in 1980 over three-quarters of the sector's total exports,
main exports in order of importance are: cotton, bananas, livestock (beef and
cattle), sugar, rice, flowers and tobacco. The agricultural sector has a
highly favorable balance of trade, with total food imports averaging only about
9% of total imports in 1979. Apart from wheat, representing 37% of total food
imports, and temperate fruits, the main imports which could be replaced by
domestic production are vegetable oils, feed and food grains and milk.
1.03      Although the growth of aggregate domestic demand for food products
in Colombia has slowed somewhat in recent years, it has generally exceeded
the increase in the domestic supply. As a result, the price of food relative
to other items in the consumption basket has increased. Given that, for the
relatively low income bracket used in the calculation of the consumer price
index, almost half of the consumer's total expenditures are for food, food
price increases have been an important inflationary factor in the country.
Land Distribution and Income Structure
1.04      Colombia is extremely heterogeneous in terms of altitude, climate,
and soils, and this results in a wide range of production possibilities and a
considerable diversity in farm types. Of the total land area of 114 million
ha, some 31 million ha are in farms, of which, according to the 1970/71
census, 7.7 million ha were cropped and 17.5 million ha were in pasture.
1.05      Out of a total of about 1.2 million farms, the 1971 census showed that
some 980,000, or 82%, had less than 20 ha and farmed only about 3.8 million ha,
or 12% of the total farmland; of these, most were below 10 ha (73%). An esti-
mated 270,000 farms had less than 1 ha and 200,000 families dependent on
agriculture were landless. In 1976, the small producer subsector, defined as
all farms with less than 20 ha, was estimated to account for about 60% of the
total agricultural value added and about 65% of total production of basic



- 2 -
foodstuffs (maize, wheat, beans, potatoes, cassava, plantain, non-centrifugal
sugar (panela), fruit and vegetables). It also accounted for about 55% of
rural employment.
1.06      In 1977, about 50% of the rural population had incomes below the
relative poverty income level as defined by the Bank (US$267 per capita in
1977 dollars). Rural unemployment and underemployment were estimated at
15% in 1977.
Institutional Support
1.07      Agrarian Reform.  Since 1961, the Colombian Institute for Agrarian
Reform (INCORA) has been involved in programs of distributing public land
(4.9 million ha as of June 1978) and redistributing unused private land
(0.7 million ha), benefiting a total of about 200,000 families. INCORA's
activities are associated, to varying degrees, with investments in land recla-
mation and infrastructure and the provision of supervised credit and technical
assistance. However, most of the land distributed so far has been assigned to
families already occupying the land. INCORA's land titling activities are
limited mostly to distributing titles to small-scale farmers on public land in
newly settled areas. In recent years, INCORA, and particularly its land
acquisition program, has been subject to considerable criticism and political
resistance and, as a result, land acquisition through both the expropriation of
land and termination of private ownership has been at a standstill since 1974.
1.08      Agricultural Credit.  The main sources of agricultural credit in
Colombia are the Agricultural Financial Fund (FFAP) and Caja Agraria. FFAP is
a rediscounting facility managed by the Bank of the Republic (BOR), which, through
participating financial intermediaries, supplied 56% of total lending for agricul-
ture (Col$ 40.5 billion) in 1980. FFAP funds are almost exclusively relent to
medium- and large-scale farmers. On the other hand, Caja Agraria, the largest
bank in Colombia, is the major source of credit to small-scale farmers, and
accounted for 43% of total agricultural lending. Small-scale farmers are
currently defined as those with gross assets below Col$ 1.8 million (US$35,300).
Nominal interest rates were in 1981 for most crop and livestock activities
21% per annum for FFAP and, for Caja Agraria's own resources, 18% to 23% for
small-scale farmers and 29% for other farmers (Annex 6, Table 1). Effective
rates were somewhat higher (24% for FFAP and 20%, 27% and 35%, respectively for
Caja Agraria) because, for seasonal credit, interest is usually charged
quarterly in advance. Since inflation was close to 30% in 1979, 26.5% in 1980,
and about 27% in 1981, real rates of interest for the most important lines of
of credit for agriculture were still slightly negative.
1.09      Marketing.  The Institute of Agricultural Marketing (IDEMA) is in
charge of regulating prices by purchasing (at support prices), selling, import-
ing, exporting and maintaining regulatory stocks of a number of basic agricul-
tural commodities (wheat, rice, maize, beans, sorghum, barley, soybeans and
sesame). Except when large imports are made by IDEMA, however, the Government's
market stabilization policies have had only a marginal impact because of IDEMA's
limited resources, in turn attributed to the general government policy of
minimizing intervention in the market place (para 1.12).

B. Government Strategy in Rural Areas
The Agricultural Sector
1.10      General.  The relatively modest growth of the agricultural sector
during the past few years, which led to upward pressures on prices of staples
and other foodstuffs (para 1.01), is attributed to slow productivity increases,
inefficient marketing and processing of agricultural produce and inadequate
exploitation of soil and water resources. On the other hand, because of the
slowdown in population growth, it is expected that growth of internal demand
during the 1980-90 period will somewhat slacken, so that changes toward
encouraging exports will have to be made in sector policies in order to ensure
a sustained rate of growth of the sector.
1.11      In attempting to deal with these issues, the National Planning
Department (DNP), within the context of the National Integration Plan (1979-82)
(PIN), has formulated objectives and strategies for the 1980s. Briefly, the
main objectives are to: (a) increase substantially the productivity of
agricultural resources; (b) improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the
marketing system; (c) develop agroindustries to stabilize prices and increase
employment, rural incomes and foreign exchange earnings; and (d) increase
exports of agricultural products. Top priority has consequently been given to
improving technology and infrastructure, through public investments in research
and extension, rural roads, land development (mainly watershed management,
irrigation and drainage), storage, agroindustries and marketing facilities.
In addition, sector policies on credit, prices and foreign trade are to be
modified to provide adequate incentives to the private sector.
1.12      Marketing and Prices.  It is the Government policy not to try to
influence price-setting mechanisms through heavy intervention or price controls.
Support prices for the few commodities purchased by IDEMA (para 1.09) are set
as closely as possible to world market levels and the Government has been
progressively removing existing price controls at producer, wholesale, or
retail levels. Rather, the Government aims at improving the efficiency and
competitiveness of the system by expanding and improving the road network,
investing in marketing infrastructure in association with the private sector
and improving price formation through better price and market information
and strengthening of the Agricultural Exchange. In line with this policy,
a project is being prepared, for submission to IDB for financing, to construct
two more wholesale markets for perishables in Barranquilla and Bucaramanga
("Centrales de Abastos") and associated sub-regional collection centers
("Centros de Acopio").
1.13      Agricultural Credit. In order to secure sufficient funding for the
sector, while making agricultural credit policies compatible with general
monetary policies (which are directed at fighting inflation), the Government
has progressively increased FFAP interest rates to levels which would permit
BOR to raise more funds from the capital market. Although implementation of
this policy has not yet led to elimination of interest rate subsidies (para
1.08), periodic adjustments have progressively narrowed the gap between
prevailing interest rates and inflation.



-4-
1.14      The Small-holder Subsector.  While emphasis is being put on the
modern agricultural sector as the main source of additional foreign exchange
earnings and as a source of foodstuffs to complement the output of the tradi-
tional sector, it is recognized that the latter contributes the major part of
the national production of basic foodstuffs (para 1.05). Therefore, within
the context of the overall sector policies, the development of the small-scale
farmer subsector will continue to be assisted through specific programs, such
as the Integrated Rural Development Program (DRI) and the provision of techni-
cal assistance and credit to consolidate the agrarian reform process. Land
re-distribution and colonization are to be carried out only in response to
local circumstances in areas with both high pressure on land and unequal land
distribution.
The Multisectoral Programs in Rural Areas - Food and Welfare Strategies
1.15      In early 1975, the National Council for Economic and Social Policy
(CONPES) approved an ambitious and wide-ranging National Food and Nutrition
Plan aimed at increasing the availability of low-cost foodstuffs to the
poorest 50% of Colombia's population and raising the income and improving the
general welfare and nutritional status of this group.   This was to be achieved
through multisectoral and coordinated actions in production, marketing, pro-
cessing, subsidized food distribution and the provision of infrastructure and
social services. The first phase of this food and nutrition strategy was
incorporated in the 1975-78 National Plan for Social and Economic Development
through the first-stage implementation of two multisectoral programs, the
Integrated Rural Development Program (DRI) (para 1.19) and the National Food
and Nutrition Program (PAN) (para 1.16). Support and appropriate funding for
both programs were continued by the present Government, which took office in
1978, and incorporated into PIN. The Bank is partially financing both programs
through the Integrated Nutrition Improvement Project (Loan 1487-CO), in
support of PAN, and the Integrated Rural Development Project (Loan 1352-CO),
in support of DRI (para 1.25).
1.16      PAN is a welfare-oriented program aimed primarily at improving the
nutritional status of the most vulnerable groups of Colombia's poorest marginal
urban and rural population (especially pregnant women, lactating mothers
and pre-school children). PAN presently covers seven Departments and the
Special District of Bogota and aims at providing an integrated package that
includes community health services, potable water supply and sanitation
facilities, nutrition education, distribution of subsidized processed food and
promotion of family gardens.
1.17      DRI, on the other hand, is essentially production-oriented and,
while substantial amounts are spent on infrastructure and social services to
increase the well-being of those living in rural communities, it aims mainly
at developing small-scale farms of less than 20 ha to the fullest extent
possible in order to provide the farm families with a substantially higher
income from self-sustaining operations. The impact of the program on food
production was considered a cornerstone of the previous Administration's
national food strategy and the present Administration considers it as one
element of its general food strategy which emphasizes removing the bottle-
necks that hamper general productivity increases and prevent a more efficient
flow and use of agricultural products (paras 1.11 and 1.12). Within PIN, the
primary objectives of DRI are therefore regarded as the improvement of incomes
and standard of living of small-scale producers and increased production of
foodstuffs.



- 5 -
1.18      Since both PAN and DRI are expanding to almost nationwide coverage
and PAN is shifting its emphasis from marginal urban areas to rural areas,
there will be frequent cases of overlap. Coordination mechanisms are dis-
cussed in paragraphs 5.02 through 5.04.
The Integrated Rural Development Program
1.19      Phase I.  Full implementation of the DRI Program started in July 1976
after a one-year experimental period. A total of 13 national public institu-
tions are participating, plus various regional entities. This first phase
was to take place in selected areas in eight Departments (Map IBRD 15802) over
a period of five to six years at a cost of approximately US$273 million. To
help finance the program, the Government obtained loans from public external
development agencies, for a total of US$130 million. The Bank, with US$52
million (Loan 1352-CO), was to partly finance the program in the Departments
of Antioquia, Narino, Cauca and Cundinamarca; the Inter-american Development
Bank (IDB), with US$64 million, was to finance it in the departments of Boyaca
and Santander; and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), with
US$14 million, was to finance it in the departments of Cordoba and Sucre.
The World Food Program has also been participating in DRI since 1980 by
distributing food to some of the beneficiaries of the program.
1.20      As of the end of December 1980, in all areas (para 1.19), the DRI
program was assisting 2,468 communities ("veredas" 1/) in 226 municipalities
("municipios" 1/). At the end of 1981, direct beneficiaries (defined as those
receiving credit and individual technical assistance) numbered close to 70,000
farm families; while an additional 145,000 rural families were estimated to be
benefiting indirectly from the technological improvements, infrastructure and
social services provided. The total rural population deriving some benefit
from the program is estimated at about 1.2 million people, or about 15% of
Colombia's total rural population. These achievements, after five and a half
years of implementation, represent 70% to 75% of the 5-1/2-year targets
originally set for Phase I (92,000 direct beneficiaries and 1.7 million
people).
1.21      The DRI program has, over the years, gained considerable popularity
in rural areas and political support at all Government levels and in the
legislature. Success can be attributed to the following factors:
(a) its concentrated focus on poverty in selected veredas with the
largest population and development potential by coordinating the investment
programs of most public entities involved in the rural sector;
(b) a systematic approach to the selection of high priority communi-
ties and investments, which has been increasingly effective in screening out
investments and minimizing political interferences. The program has thus to a
large extent rationalized public investment in the rural areas attended;
1/   A "vereda" is a community of about 50 to 100 families.  An average
of about 25 "veredas" constitutes a "municipio," an administrative
subdivision of the department, with its administrative seat ("cabecera
municipal").



- 6 -
(c) the provision of credit according to regulations, incorporated
into a credit manual specific to the program, which ensure that credit is
provided in sufficient amounts and on terms consistent with the farmers'
development needs and their cash flow situation (para 1.29);
(d) the Program has been able to secure the participation of
beneficiaries and communities in the programming and execution of works (the
mechanisms of community participation are described in Chapter V); and
(e) the Program has been able to generate a strong commitment in
field and regional staff of the executing agencies. This is quite remarkable,
considering that several entities have been unable to provide them with the
necessary support because of continuing financial problems (Annex 1).
1.22      Phase II.  The Government plans in a second phase, during the period
1981-86, to extend the DRI program to 126 municipalities in eight new Depart-
ments (IBRD Map 15802), reaching as many as 49,000 more direct beneficiaries.
The Government has asked the Bank to help finance the extension of the Program
in 55 municipalities in four of these new Departments, and IDB to assist in
the remaining 71 municipalities. IDB has recently processed a US$64.6 million
loan to help meet the cost of the program in these areas (estimated at US$118.6
million). All new areas to be covered are contiguous with Phase I areas.
C. Bank Involvement in the Rural Sector
1.23      Since 1966, the Bank has made 12 loans, totaling US$296.6 million,
to Colombia for the agricultural sector. Project Performance Audit Reports
have been issued for four of them, including Loans 502-CO (Atlantico I Irriga-
tion), 624-CO (First Agricultural Credit), 651-CO (Second Livestock Development)
and 739-CO (Caqueta Land Colonization - Phase I). They are, however, of little
relevance to the proposed project. Other Bank operations in the rural sector
include the Integrated Nutrition Improvement Project, a recent Rural Roads
Project, a Village Electrification Project in seven Departments of the Atlantic
Coast, and the Integrated Rural Development Project. A Rural Basic Education
Sub-sector Project was appraised in March 1982.
1.24      Eight agricultural projects are being implemented, four of which were
made in support of INCORA's agrarian reform efforts: the Second Atlantico
Development Project (Loan 849-CO, to the Government for US$5 million); the
Caqueta II Rural Settlement Project (Loan 1118-CO, to the Government for
US$19.5 million); the Cordoba II Agricultural Development Project (Loan
1163-CO, to the Government for US$21 million); and the Third Agricultural
Credit Project (Loan 1737-CO to INCORA for US$20 million). Other operations
include the Second Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1357-CO to Banco de la
Republica for US$64 million), the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (Loan
1996-CO to HIMAT for US$37 million), the Integrated Rural Development Project
(Loan 1352-CO to the Government for US$52 million) and the Upper Magdalena Pilot
Watershed Management Project (Loan 2069-CO of US$7.5 million to INDERENA).
The Integrated Rural Development Project (Loan 1352-CO to the Government)
1.25      The loan, US$52 million for a project with total costs of US$131
million, became effective in August 1977 and partially finances implementation
of the DRI program in four Departments (para 1.19) over a period of five years.



- 7 -
1.26      As of December 31, 1980, after four years of implementation, 72% of
project funds were committed. By the end of 1981, it is estimated that over
90% of funds were committed. As of March 26, 1982, disbursements of the Bank
loan amounted to US$39.8 million, or 76% of the total amount. The loan is
expected to be fully disbursed by the end of 1983.
1.27      As of December 31, 1981 a total of about 30,000 smallholders were
receiving credit and individual technical assistance from the project (the five-
year target was 40,000), and an estimated additional 74,000 families were deriving
indirect benefit from the project, bringing the total number of beneficiaries
to about 600,000.
1.28      While overall implementation is quite satisfactory, some components
have encountered problems because of insufficient commitment by the implement-
ing institutions to necessary sector policies (Health) or institutional weak-
nesses (Natural Resources, Marketing) which are further described in Annex 1.
However, the project has never suffered from insufficient counterpart funding.
1.29      Implementation of the credit program, which accounts for about half
of the project's total costs, has been according to appraisal estimates. The
average amount of credit received annually by project beneficiaries (in 1981
about Col$45,000, or US$820) was substantially above the average amount of
credit other small-scale farmers have received from Caja Agraria, as was also
the credit received per hectare financed. Also, the terms and conditions of
the DRI credit were perceived by the farmers as especially favorable since
resources were provided in sufficient amounts; with terms and grace periods
tailored to the cash flow requirements of the farm; and interest was not
charged in advance. Up to the end of 1980, over 90% of all subloans were
secured by personal signature versus only about 50% of subloans made by Caja
Agraria to other small-scale farmers. Credit was closely associated with
individual technical assistance in planning the farmer's requirements and
carrying out the farm development plan. The credit delivery and supervision
systems appear to have been effective since arrears as of the end of December
1981 amounted to 4.6% of project portfolio and were noticeably below the
general Caja Agraria average of 1980 (13%).
1.30     It appears that, at least in the areas where data are available, the
project has led to substantial increases in productivity and production. In
the Department of Antioquia, a comprehensive survey carried out in 1979 shows
that, between 1975 and 1978, yields of major crops on farms of direct project
beneficiaries increased by 33% to 60%. In the Department of Narino, field
records indicate that yields have increased by 50% on average between 1976 and
1980. The area under cultivation and the cropping intensity have also somewhat
increased, so that total production has risen significantly. In Antioquia, in
two years, direct beneficiaries have doubled their participation in the
national and departmental production of potatoes, maize and beans, the main
staples in the area and nationwide. Although the performance of the DRI
program has certainly been better in these two Departments than in the Depart-
ments of Cauca and Cundinamarca, for which only partial data are available
to this date, it appears that the program is reaching its desired objective.



- 8 -
1.31      The weakest link in the DRI program has been an inadequate coverage
of marketing activities. This has been in part because of the inherent diffi-
culties in dealing with marketing of perishable agricultural produce and largely
because of institutional weaknesses of the agency in charge of the marketing
advisory service (Annex 1). Fortunately, most of the project areas are relatively
well connected to major markets and food prices have been relatively high during the
past five years. Nevertheless, local market surpluses have developed on occasion.
Marketing could become an important constraint to increased production and pro-
ductivity if more attention is not given to developing an expanded and systematic
approach towards exploring marketing possibilities and modalities before production
is encouraged.
1.32      Full assessment of the impact of the project is not possible at this
stage, since the majority of beneficiaries has been incorporated into the pro-
gram for only two or three years. Such an assessment will be possible only when
the farmers have had sufficient time to take full advantage of the infrastructure
built, or being built, and services offered, which is not likely before the end
of 1983. Also, all efforts were initially directed towards establishing proper
mechanisms for programing and coordination at all levels, and it was not until
1978 that attention began to be paid to evaluation of impact.
II. THE PROJECT AREAS
2.01      The project areas (IBRD Map 15802) include:  (a) 55 municipalities
in the Departments of Huila, Tolima, Meta and Caldas (Phase II areas); and
(b) the 154 municipalities of the first project (Phase I areas). A list of
municipalities is provided in Schedule A.
The Selection of Phase II Areas
2.02      The selection of the Phase II areas was made using the basic metho-
dology developed for the preparation of the first project. All the socio-
economic districts of the country, and then all municipalities in the selected
Departments were ranked, according to criteria, indicators and weights which
sought to measure agricultural potential, the presence of public sector
institutions and socio-economic conditions and infrastructure. Particular
importance was given to production criteria, such as the concentration of
small-scale farms, their production potential and the exclusion of areas where
coffee production is significant. The selection process is further described
in Annex 2.
Location, Climate and Soils
2.03      The project areas, Phase I as well as Phase II, are mainly located
in densely populated parts of the Andean Highlands. The topography is pre-
dominantly mountainous and soils are mostly of volcanic origin. Farms are
often on poor soils and steep slopes. A wide range of climatic conditions
is found, as shown below, for the areas designated for Bank financing:

Temperatures vary considerably. In Phase I areas, average yearly temperatures
range from 120C in the cold zones to 25 C in the hot zone. In Phase II areas,
the averages range from 15 C in the cold zone to 29 0C in the hot zone. Rainfall
varies among and within areas from 550 mm to 2,120 mm in Phase I areas and
from 890 mm to 3,100 mm in Phase II areas. There are two distinct rainy
seasons, February to June and September to November. The distribution of
farms in Phase II areas according to climatic zones and size categories is
further detailed in Annex 6, Table 2.

Production
2.05      A large variety of annual, semi-permanent and permanent crops is
grown in the project areas, mostly maize and beans, potatoes, cassava, sugarcane
for panela (non-centrifugal sugar), plantain, rice and vegetables. In Phase I
areas, relatively more importance is placed on growing potatoes and vegetables
while in Phase II areas, the main crops are staples (cassava, maize, beans and
upland rice) and semi-permanent and permanent crops, such as plantain, sugar-
cane and cacao. Mixed and relay intercropping is widespread, the main crop
associations being maize/beans, potatoes/maize/beans and maize/arracacha. Most
small-scale farmers own one or more cows in addition to a variety of minor
animal species (pigs, poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs and bees) which make an
important contribution to the family diet. Productivity is low because of often
poor soils, inadequate cultural practices, poor seeds and insufficient use
of manure, fertilizers and other inputs, but the absence of technical assistance,
credit, and secure markets are the main constraint to production increases.
Production Support Services
2.06      Credit.  In the 55 municipalities of Phase II, Caja Agraria has an
extensive network of 53 agencies, almost one per municipality. In 1978, 23,150
subloans were made to small-scale farmers by Caja Agraria through these
agencies, which indicates that only about a third of all small-scale farmers
in those municipalities did receive credit in that year. Though most small-
scale farmers have had credit experience with Caja Agraria, it has been
intermittent. The average subloan amount in 1978 was Col$ 19,400 (US$480),
close to the countrywide average for Caja Agraria subloans to small-scale
farmers during that year (Col$ 20,500 or US$510). The expansion of credit in
Phase II areas has been hampered by lack of resources, resulting in rationed
(only about a third of costs per hectare are financed) and delayed credit,
with emphasis on short-term operations (74% of total operations in 1978).
2.07      Technical Assistance.  In Phase II areas, technical support is
provided to small-scale farmers on a limited basis by ICA, INCORA and the
Departmental Secretariats of Agriculture (SDAs). ICA provides technical
assistance, veterinary services and also controls the quality of inputs through
four regional and eight district offices in the project area, which are staffed
with 26 professionals and 45 sub-professionals. Insufficient staff and lack
of vehicles and allowances for travel costs seriously constrain ICA's work.
In, or near, the project areas, ICA operates 2 experimental stations, 2 national
research centers, one demonstration and six diagnotic centers.
2.08      The SDAs are part of the administrative structure of the local
(Departmental) Governments. In the four new DRI Departments, they manage
seven research and demonstration centers. In 1980, they had a total technical
staff of 89, but only about 15 were providing technical assistance to small-
scale farmers. In 1980, INCORA, with 39 technicians distributed among
15 agencies, was assisting about 1,730 families in land reform settlements
located in the municipalities of the Phase II project areas.
2.09      Agricultural Supplies.  In the Phase II project areas, basic seed is
produced by ICA and sold to Caja Agraria and 43 authorized certified seed producing
enterprises. ICA, Caja Agraria and 18 of these enterprises produce seed in the



- 11 -
project area. Caja Agraria also has 79 distribution outlets for agricultural
inputs and supplies in the four Departments, 36 of which are located in the
55 municipalities, where it is often in competition with private distributors.
Many cooperatives are also involved in the provision of inputs.
2.10      Marketing.  There are some 32 agricultural cooperatives in the
55 Phase II municipalities. Of these, 14 are formed by coffee growers. Small-
scale farmers, however, usually market small amounts of a wide range of products
sold at the farmgate to intermediaries. Marketing efficiency and competition
are constrained by the lack of access roads, price information and collection
centers.
2.11      Some of the country's main coffee zones are adjacent to the project
areas. In these, the Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia (FEDECAFE) has
been active for years in promoting diversification. Farmers' groups that take
part are provided with technical assistance and credit for marketing non-coffee
products grown in coffee areas as well as surrounding areas. Many of these
groups have associated to gather and sell perishable products on the main
markets (such as FRUVERCAFE, the fruit and vegetable cooperative of small-scale
coffee producers) or through their own supermarkets.
Physical Infrastructure
2.12      While all Phase II project areas are well linked to the most important
markets by the highway network, production (particularly of perishables)
is seriously constrained by the lack of access roads to farming areas. The
existing road network in the project area totals 4,980 km, including 3,640 km
of rural roads, or less than 0.2 km per square kilometer. Many of the exist-
ing roads are impassable during the rainy season.
2.13      In the Departments of Huila, Tolima and Meta, the proportion of
rural households with electrical service is less than the national average
in rural areas (12.8%, 10.7% and 0%, respectively, versus 13%). In the
Department of Caldas, service coverage (45%) appears high, but is concen-
trated in the coffee areas, which are not within the project area.
2.14      In the four Phase II project departments, about 24% of the rural
population has access to a safe water supply. However, service is concentrated
on agglomerated communities and in areas where the Diversification Program of
of FEDECAFE is operating, particularly in Caldas and Tolima.
Social Services
2.15      In the Phase II project area, health conditions are generally poor,
with a high incidence of infectious diseases associated with malnutrition and
lack of clean potable water. Although physical infrastructure, in terms of
number of existing local hospitals, health centers and health posts is fairly
adequate (207, or 1 per 4,300 inhabitants in the 55 municipalities), the quality
of primary health care services is poor because of lack of staff, drugs, equipment
and transportation and proper training. With respect to education services, the
Phase II project areas have a school age population of about 140,000, about 60%
of which are enrolled in some 3,900 classrooms - the project areas account for
about 40% of the total school-age population of their respective departments - here



- 12 -
also educational achievements are not so much constrained by the lack of infra-
structure as by the poor quality of the services provided, particularly in the
Departments of Huila and Tolima, where only about 12% of the pupils ever complete
the full primary cycle (equal to the national average for rural areas), versus 18%
to 20% for the departments of Caldas and Meta; and where they attend school for
a total of only about 1.5 years (also about equal to the national rural average),
versus 2.1 to 2.3 years in the departments of Meta and Caldas.
III. THE EXECUTING AGENCIES
3.01      Excluding the National Planning Department (DNP), a total of
12 national agencies, all the main institutions involved in the rural sector,
would participate in the execution of the project, 10 of which have been
involved in the DRI Program for the past five years. In addition, an increasing
number of relevant departmental entities are expected to participate along the
same lines as other departmental services currently participating in the Phase
I areas.
3.02      Caja Agraria, the main agricultural development bank in the country
and the largest bank in Colombia, is a semi-autonomous public agency whose
principal shareholder is the Government, under the general direction of the
Minister of Agriculture. It is the principal source of credit for small-scale
farmers and is also an important retailer of farm inputs throughout the country.
3.03      ICA is the main institution responsible for agricultural research
and technology transfer, along with pest control, animal health and the control
of the quality of inputs. INCORA (para 1.07) and most Departmental Secretariats
of Agriculture - three in Phase I areas and four in Phase II areas (para 2.08) -
have had no previous experience with DRI and would, on a limited basis, assist
ICA in its task of technology transfer. The Colombian Institute for Renewable
Natural Resources and the Environment (INDERENA), is responsible for protect-
ing, administering and developing Colombia's natural resources, including the
promotion of reforestation, fisheries and soil conservation. ICA, INCORA and
INDERENA all are autonomous public entities dependent on the Ministry of
Agriculture.
3.04      CECORA is a second-level cooperative organization, and therefore a
private entity. Originally created to assist cooperative societies of land
reform beneficiaries, its mandate also extends to other cooperatives and
farmer groups. The Colombian Institute of Financing and Development of
Cooperatives (FINANCIACOOP), is a private entity in charge of financing the
cooperative sector. It is the major cooperative financing institution in the
country.
3.05      With respect to the provision of rural infrastructure, the National
Fund for Rural Roads (FNCV) is a public autonomous agency dependent upon the
Ministry of Public Works and Transportation, responsible for the construction,
upgrading and maintenance of rural roads, in cooperation with Departmental
Secretariats of Public Works (SDOP's) and municipal authorities. The Colombian
Institute for Electrical Power (ICEL), is a public autonomous agency dependent
on the Ministry of Power and Mines, responsible for planning the electrical
network and setting national standards for electrical installations in the



- 13 -
twelve Departments of its area of influence. ICEL is the major shareholder of
the departmental "Electrificadoras", which are responsible for the design and
construction of installations and the production, transmission and sale of
electrical power. The National Institute of Health (INS) is a public agency
dependent on the Ministry of Health (MINSALUD), responsible for the provision
of water supply and sanitation services in rural areas, either directly
through its departmental offices or through the Departmental Health Services
(SSSs), to which the responsibility for carrying out rural water supply
systems funded through the National Budget is increasingly being delegated by
INS. SSSs are public entities under the control of the respective Departmental
Governors. Departments also have Departmental Water Supply Funds (FDA's) to
finance locally funded projects.
3.06      The SSSs are also the main entities responsibl-e for health services
delivery in rural areas. For that purpose, they are under the supervision of
MINSALUD, which is responsible for policy-making, planning, funding and
supervising government intervention in the health sector. The Ministry of
Education (MINED) is responsible for the formulation of the education policies
and the unification of academic standards and terms of service of educational
personnel throughout the country. The Departmental Secretariats of Education
(SDEs) have the administrative responsibility for running the school system,
but recurrent as well as investment educational expenditures are controlled by
the Regional Education Funds (FERs), the boards of which are made of representatives
of MINED as well as of regional authorities. The Colombian Institute for School
Buildings (ICCE), a public entity dependent on MINED, is responsible for building
and equipping schools. Pilot Experimental Centers (CEPs) are dependencies of MINED,
in charge of executing new curricular programs.
3.07      Finally, the newly created autonomous Regional Development Corporations
(CRDs) in the Departments of Tolima, Caldas and Huila, are public agencies
dependent on DNP in charge of planning, funding and carrying out projects of
regional interest. In some areas, they would, on a limited basis, substitute
for INDERENA, INS or FNCV. Their participation, as well as the participation
of the various departmental secretariats would be defined on a case per case basis,
according to their implementation capacity and the comparative effectiveness of
the pertinent national agencies in their area of influence.
3.08      A summary of functions, funding and performance of the main institu-
tions is provided in Annex 1 of this report.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Origin and Formulation
4.01      The Government of Colombia has requested a Bank loan of US$53.0
million to help finance the Second Integrated Rural Development Project.  The
proposed project is part of a planned expansion of the DRI program contemplated
in the PIN (para 1.11). The project was prepared by the General Directorate
of PAN and DRI in DNP, with Bank assistance.



- 14 -
4.02      Government authorities have decided that the continuation of the
program in the Phase I areas should be financed mostly out of national
resources, in order to progressively establish the permanence of the program
in these areas independently from external financing. For this reason, with
the exception of some additional funding for credit operations in the Bank-
financed Phase I areas, which aim at consolidating achievements, the proposed
project would finance expansion of the DRI Program to new areas. However,
at negotiations, an assurance was obtained that the Government would provide,
or cause to be provided, all credit funds and farm and marketing advisory
services necessary to allow the direct beneficiaries of the first project to
complete the planned development of their farms and to maintain the income
level associated with the technology they have adopted as a result of the
first project. In addition, every year, the Government would present to the
Bank a program of activities in the Phase I areas in these respects.
B. Objectives and Brief Description
Objectives
4.03      The main objective of the project would be to improve the standard
of living of the population in a number of selected rural areas (para 2.01). A
second objective would be to contribute to the increased availability of basic
foodstuffs at reasonable prices for the two thirds of the Colombian population
living in urban areas.
Brief Description
4.04      The project would, over a five-year period, seek to accomplish these
objectives by:
(a) developing about 35,000 farms of less than 20 ha (direct benefi-
ciaries), including 28,000 in the 55 municipalities of Phase II areas (para
2.01) and 7,000 in the 154 municipalities of the first project (additional to
those already attended in Phase I areas), through the provision of credit,
advisory services and training (including for tree planting and fish ponds);
(b) promoting group marketing and processing activities in Phase I
and II areas through the provision of credit and advisory services;
(c) improving physical infrastructure in the Phase II municipali-
ties through the construction or improvement of about 540 km of rural roads,
the construction or expansion of about 126 piped water supply systems for the
benefit of about 52,000 people, and the extension of the electrical network to
serve an additional 4,800 households; and
(d) expanding and improving primary health care services throughout
the Phase II project area and improving the quality of primary education services
provided in two of the four departments of Phase II areas.



- 15 -
4.05      The project would provide funding for the expansion of the
administrative and technical services of the executing agencies, including
the General Directorate of the DRI and PAN programs in DNP (DNP/PAN-DRI)
which is in charge of overall coordination, programing, control, monitoring
and evaluation (Chapter V). Activities of the executing agencies would be
governed by the terms of subsidiary agreements entered into with DNP
(Schedule B).
4.06      The proposed loan would be to the Republic of Colombia.  The
Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
C. Detailed Features
Production
4.07      Farm Development.  The project would finance farm development costs
through the provision of credit to participating farmers. Subloans would
finance: (a) seasonal expenditures for crop production and livestock main-
tenance; (b) medium- and long-term investments in semi-permanent and permanent
crops, livestock, farm infrastructure, machinery and equipment, tree planting
and fish ponds; and (c) home improvement (including electrical connection)
after the farmer had participated no less than 12 months in the credit
prbgram and demonstrated satisfactory creditworthiness.
4.08      An estimated 35,000 farmers would receive credit under the project,
according to the following schedule of incorporation:

- 16 -
4.09      Credit would be made available by Caja Agraria to participating
farmers upon the presentation of integrated farm development plans prepared
with the assistance of the farm advisory service (ICA, INCORA or the SDA's).
In order to be eligible,Afarmers would have to have: (a) holdings located in
a vereda incorporated into the program; (b) a total farm area not in excess of
20 ha; and (c) gross assets (including land) not exceeding Col$ 3.0 million
(US$49,180), such limit being adjusted automatically every six months or every
year in accordance with the variations in the national consumer price index.
Further adjustments would be possible, though not automatic, should it be
demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Bank that increases in land values
in the project areas have exceeded those in the consumer price index. Identical
automatic adjustments would be made to the maximum indebtedness of farmers
under the project (para 5.22). A tentative distribution of Phase II credit
beneficiaries by departments, type of climate and farm sizes is shown in
Annex 6, Table 3.
4.10      It is expected that 50% of total requirements would be for short-
term and 50% for medium- and long-term credit. Since the proceeds of subloan
recuperations would be relent under the project, only the costs corresponding
to credit requirements net of recuperations (US$57.8 million, including US$45.7
million for Phase II areas and US$12.1 million for Phase I areas) were accounted
as project costs.
4.11      By Year 5, an estimated 157,500 ha would have been included in the
farm development plans (4.5 ha per farm), of which 101,500 ha would be under
crops with financing from the credit program (2.9 ha per farm on average not
including about 0.1 ha under coffee), in addition to pasture improvements and
a large number of various animal species on an additional 52,500 ha (1.5 ha per
farm). A distribution of estimated areas financed by activities and the
phasing of the lending program and of recuperations of subloans are presented
in Annex 6, Tables 4 through 9.
4.12      In order to ensure timely review of credit applications, disburse-
ments and investment control, Caja Agraria as agreed annually with DNP/PAN-DRI,
would designate or appoint credit inspectors as required, estimated at about 70
at full development (one per 400 beneficiaries) in the 53 Phase II agencies,
together with district advisers (about 7) and one supervisor per Department (4),
whose primary responsibility would be the DRI credit program, and provide them
with appropriate transportation means and administrative support. An assurance
was obtained at negotiations in this respect.
4.13      Marketing Development.  The project would finance the provision of
credit to individuals, cooperatives or other farmers' associations for (a)
working capital for purchase of crops and inventories; (b) machinery and
equipment for sorting, grading, packing, and storage; (c) infrastructure for
gathering and storage; (d) exceptionally, transportation equipment; and
(e) feasibility studies and technical assistance contracts. Groups, other
than cooperatives, eligible to receive credit would be those in which at least
75% of the members are smallholders eligible for receiving credit under the
project (para 4.09). Cooperatives eligible to receive financing would be
those in which at least 50% of the members are eligible for receiving credit
under the project. Exceptionally, whenever group marketing and processing



- 17 -
has been shown not to be economically feasible for specific commodities in
an area, and when no marketing as well as financing alternative exists,
credit would be made available to individuals, identified by the Marketing and
Processing Advisory Service, willing to offer project farmers favorable terms
and stable markets, provided they market or process a large proportion of the
production of DRI beneficiaries in the area.
4.14      Phase II Areas.  Credit requirements for working capital have been
calculated assuming that, by Year 5, 15% of direct beneficiaries would partici-
pate in group marketing operations, for about 20% of the production sold.
Priority would be given to established cooperatives and to a few products
of major importance in each area. At the district 1/ or municipal level,
emphasis would be put on produce gathering posts. It is expected that
seven posts would be financed (one in each district) in addition to about
nine primary posts at the municipal level. The purchase of transportation
equipment (about five vehicles per department) would be exceptional and
reserved to groups that handle large volumes regularly.
4.15      Phase I Areas.  In Phase I areas, credit would be provided to the
32 marketing groups formed during the implementation of the first project and
to several of the cooperatives existing in the area, which, because of Caja
Agraria's statutory limitations on cooperative lending (Caja Agraria cannot
lend to cooperatives amounts exceeding 25% of their paid-in capital), have
not been able to receive credit funds during the first project.
4.16      Processing Development.  The project would provide financing for the
establishment, expansion or diversification in Phase I as well as Phase II
areas of about 40 small food processing industries (such as jam, preserves or
sauce manufacturing), which would benefit the project areas by increasing
rural productivity; by permitting a more efficient use of crop and livestock
products; and by providing additional employment to rural workers. This type
of "cottage industry" would have an average sub-project cost of about
Col$ 700,000 (US$11,500) and an average subloan amount of about Col$ 600,000
(about US$10,000). The project would also finance the establishment, or expansion
of about 15 larger size agroindustries (such as those manufacturing ingredients
for animal feed or small dairy plants) aimed at providing stable outlets and
prices to a large number of farmers in a given area. This type of sub-project
would have an average cost of about Col$ 6 million (about US$100,000) and require
an average subloan amount of about Col$ 5 million (about US$80,000). The Advisory
Service for Marketing and Processing (para 4.24) would help prepare and review
their feasibility.
4.17      Subloans would be made to cooperatives, farmers' groups and indivi-
duals for construction, machinery and equipment, permanent working capital,
feasibility studies and technical assistance contracts for enterprises located
in project municipalities in a proportion expected to be about 50% working
capital, 35% for machinery and equipment and 15% for construction and other
expenditures. Groups eligible for marketing credit would also be eligible to
receive credit under this component. In order to be eligible, individuals
would have to either qualify as direct beneficiaries of the project or meet
the criteria referred to in para. 4.13 above.
1/   A district consists of about nine municipalities.  There are seven districts
in the project Phase II areas.



- 18 -
4.18      FINANCIACOOP is allowed to lend to cooperatives, precooperatives,
groups without legal personality as well as to individuals, and would be
responsible for credit for marketing and processing. However, all subloans for
marketing and processing would, at least initially, need to receive the approval
of the departmental technical committees (paras. 5.11) and of the DNP/PAN-DRI
regional director.
Advisory Services and Training
4.19      Farm Advisory Service.  The project would finance the costs over
five years of local adaptation trials, demonstration plots and technical
assistance services to be provided to the beneficiaries of Phase II areas.
More specifically, the project would finance: (a) the cost of field and
other staff as described in paragraph 4.20; (b) about 96 four-wheel drive
vehicles, 359 motorcycles, field and office equipment; (c) inputs and materials
for the adaptation trials and demonstration plots; (d) training of field
agents; and (e) all other incremental recurrent expenditures.
4.20      ICA's field staff requirements in Phase II areas have been calculated
assuming a ratio of farmers to agent of 45 to 1 the first year, 60 to 1 the
second year and 80 to 1 subsequently. Estimated staffing, all considered as
incremental, by year 5 is as follows:
Research Staff                Technical Assistance Staff
ICA regional directors        3
Professionals    9            ICA district directors         9
Assistants        9           Professionals                 70
Skilled workers  9            Sub-professionals            350
Administrative staff          17
Sub-total     27                   Sub-total             449
Additional staff at ICA-DRI headquarters would include two professionals and
two support staff. A monitoring and evaluation unit would be formed in ICA,
with one director, two professionals and two secretaries.
4.21      ICA would have sole responsibility for the design and testing of
technological packages. However, under the supervision of ICA, extension work
and farm credit planning could also be the responsibility of some SDAs
selected on a case-by-case basis, as under the first project, and of INCORA in
veredas where over half of the potential beneficiaries are INCORA settlers
(para 2.08). Where INCORA and the Secretariats participate, only their exist-
ing staff would be used, so that personnel costs would not be charged to the
project. While all farmers within the selected veredas would be eligible for
receiving technical assistance, it is expected that such services would focus
on beneficiaries receiving credit from the program.
4.22      In Phase I areas, by December 1981, after five years of implementation
of the ongoing project, the average ratio of farmers to agents was 90 to 1
(versus 100 to 1 expected at appraisal) and the total sub-professional staff
involved in technical assistance was 354.



- 19 -
It is estimated that the proposed additional 7,000 benefiaries could be attended
by the existing staff over the five-year period 1982-86, according to the schedule
of incorporation presented in paragraph 4.08. Therefore, the project would not
finance additional technical assistance in these areas. However, an assurance
was obtained that the Government would provide them with the necessary farm
advisory services.
4.23      The extension staff would be responsible for the preparation of farm
plans to be used as a basis for the provision of technical assistance and for
the projections of credit requirements of individual farms over a period of four
to five years. Such work, however, is presently taking an excessive proportion
of technical assistance time and substantial time savings are possible which
could result in lower technical assistance costs. Consequently, for farms with
less than 2 ha, the farm development plan would consist of very simple financial
projections prepared by Caja Agraria or the Advisory Service, normally based on
model budgets prepared and periodically updated by ICA, for activities and
technological levels typical to each area. For farms with more than 2 ha, the
Advisory Service would prepare individual integrated farm plans. With respect
to the provision of technical assistance, while all farmers would benefit from
technical training provided by SENA and group technical assistance organized by
the Advisory Service, individual technical assistance would be provided only to
those farmers with more than 2 ha. At negotiations, assurances were obtained
that by July 1, 1983, ICA, in coordination with DNP, Caja Agraria and SENA,
would have developed and started application of appropriate methods of group
technical assistance and farm planning suitable to farms with less than 2 ha.
In the meantime, farm planning and technical assistance would continue to be
provided to all farmers individually. An assurance was obtained during negotia-
tions that the above arrangements for individual and group technical assistance
would be accepted by FFAP as meeting its technical assistance requirements for
rediscounted subloans (paras 1.08 and 4.55).
4.24      Advisory Service for Marketing Operations and Rural Industries.
Under the first project, CECORA had responsibility for technical assistance
for marketing operations (including credit planning), but its performance
has been disappointing because of frequent changes in management, instability of
generally inexperienced staff and lack of operating funds (Annex 1). Under the
proposed project, CECORA would be responsible only for the operation of the
market intelligence service. FINANCIACOOP would take over the responsibility
for technical assistance for marketing and processing and SENA would handle
promotion of group marketing and training. Other experienced institutions
such as the Diversification Program of FEDECAFE, (PRODESARROLLO), which has
been actively involved in technical assistance for marketing (including price
information) and processing of small-scale farmer produce from the coffee or
adjoining areas since the early 1970's, or IDEMA, would be invited on an ad-hoc
basis to participate in the identification and design of sub-projects. Coordi-
nation of those institutions would be the responsibility of DNP/PAN-DRI, which
would have a specialized marketing division (para 5.05), and through a marketing
coordination sub-committee (para 5.11).
4.25      The project would, over a period of five years, finance the incremen-
tal costs to CECORA of operating the market intelligence service in the Phase II
areas. Financing would cover: (a) at headquarters, five additional staff, office
furniture and equipment, per diem and other recurrent expenditures; (b) nine
additional staff in two regional offices (one office in Bogota with two staff



- 20 -
stationed in Ibague and Neiva, and one office in Manizales), two 4-wheel
drive vehicles, office equipment and furniture, per diem and other recurrent
expenditures; and (c) renting of telex lines and the cost of radio messages
and publications.
4.26      With respect to FINANCIACOOP, the project would, for Phase II areas,
finance: (a) 50% of the headquarter's costs of a technical assistance unit,
including the salaries of six staff and the cost of one vehicle, office furniture
and equipment and associated per diem and recurrent expenditures; and (b) the
cost of four departmental offices, each including five staff, one vehicle, office
equipment and furniture, per diem and associated recurrent expenditures.
4.27      The signature of a subsidiary agreement between the Borrower and
FINANCIACOOP, satisfactory to the Bank, stating their respective responsi-
bilities in the financing of credit operations (para 4.18) and the provision
of technical assistance for marketing and processing in Phase II areas, the
draft of which was reviewed and commented upon by the Bank during negotiations,
would be a condition of effectiveness. With respect to the Phase I areas, an
assurance was obtained at negotiations that the Government would provide the
beneficiaries borrowing under the project for marketing and processing, with
the required advisory and price and market information services.
4.28      Advisory Service for Natural Resources.  The project would finance
the costs of technical assistance services to be provided by INDERENA to Phase II
beneficiaries, for: (a) the planting by farmers of the equivalent of about 5,700
ha of eucalyptus trees or fast-growing native species; (b) the construction
and stocking of about 300 fish ponds, with either tilapia or trout; and (c) the
planting of about 100 ha of trees around threatened potable water sources as a
protective measure. More specifically, the project would finance a total
staff (all additional) of 55 at regional level at full development, including
eight professionals, 33 sub-professionals, and 14 support staff. The project
would also finance eight four-wheel drive vehicles, 33 motorcycles, field and
office equipment and furniture, all associated recurrent expenditures,
and the cost of the subsidy for tree seedlings (para 4.29).
4.29      Half of the area planted with trees would be expected to be grown by
farmers for their commercial value and these would require credit and indivi-
dual supervision. The other half would be planted with subsidized seedlings
distributed by INDERENA at about half of their cost as woodlots to supply the
family fuelwood or live fences. Seedlings would be produced by INDERENA in
its existing nurseries or bought from nurseries of other organizations in the
project area, all of which have sufficient capacity. Fish fingerlings would
be purchased from INDERENA's existing production facilities.
4.30      Finally, in coordination with ICA, INDERENA would review the soil
and water conservation implications of ICA's technical recommendations and
agree with ICA on simple, corrective measures to be incorporated in ICA's
technical packages and in SENA's training courses.
4.31      INDERENA has just completed a full internal reorganization, which
was embodied in Presidential Decree 72 of January 15, 1982, within which the
responsibility for managing the DRI sub-program has been assigned to a special
division of a Sub-direction of Implementation of Integrated Programs. This
sub-direction will orient and control DRI-related activities at the field level,
which will be carried out by special sections within INDERENA's regional
offices. This new structure clears up the previous confusion of responsi-
bilities over the sub-program, which has been a major cause for unsatisfactory
performance under the first project.



-21 -
4.32      Training and Community Organization.  SENA would be responsible for
the training component of the project, which is designed to complement and
support the action of the various advisory services in Phase II areas. Such
training would consist of:
(a) about 700 induction/organization courses to inform all potential
direct and indirect beneficiaries of the selected communities of the objectives
and operation of the program and to organize community representation in
local (vereda) assemblies;
(b) about 3,200 technical courses in crop and livestock production
for approximately 46,000 participants. Topics would be selected in consultation
with the community through the Vereda Assembly and with the advisory services;
(c) 52 induction and 116 technical upgrading courses for the staffs
of the executing agencies for about 1,040 and 2,330 participants, respectively.
The technical courses would emphasize farm management, soil and water conser-
vation practices, credit planning, group organization, technical transfer
methods and group marketing; and
(d) promotion of group marketing and training of cooperatives and
other groups in administration and management, cooperativism, accounting,
produce handling and food technology; and training of farmers in produce
quality improvements, grading, packing and other produce handling practices.
4.33      The project would finance training over five and a half years,
including retroactive expenses for training carried out in Phase II areas
since February 1981. With respect to items (a) to (c) above, costs include
financing of personnel expenditures, which in the peak year (1984) would
provide for about 47 instructors and 24 support staff at regional level and an
additional six staff members at headquarters; about nine four-wheel drive
vehicles, 38 motorcycles, four mobile units, audiovisual equipment, teaching
materials and inputs and all associated recurrent expenditures. With respect
to promotion and training for marketing and processing (item (d)), the
project would finance the cost of four departmental units, each one consisting
of one coordinator and three instructors, with one vehicle, audiovisual
equipment and materials, transportation and subsistence allowances for trainees
and other recurrent expenditures, and of a headquarter unit, with two advisers,
one secretary, and per diem allowances.
Infrastructure
4.34      Rural Roads.  FNCV would be responsible for the rural roads component.
The project would finance the design, construction and supervision of about
270 km of new rural roads and the improvement of about 270 km of existing
rural roads in Phase II areas. It is estimated that each kilometer of new or
improved roads would benefit about 580 ha of agricultural land in the hands of
small-scale farmers. A determining factor in the final selection of roads by
DNP would be the cost per head of population benefited, which would be on
average equivalent to about US$37 in March 1982 constant terms. In March 1982
terms, the average cost per km of new construction was estimated at US$40,000
and of rehabiliation at US$19,000 (excluding designs and supervision).
Selection criteria under the DRI program are consistent with those applied for
the selection of roads under a Bank-financed Rural Roads Project (para 1.23).



- 22 -
4.35      Rural roads designs are determined by FNCV Regulation No. 448 of-
April 10, 1975, which are reasonable and no modifications are envisaged under
the project. Civil works would all be contracted out. Engineering and super-
vision would be either contracted out or carried out by FNCV.
4.36      Potable Water Supply.  INS, or the SSSs under INS supervision, would
be responsible for the implementation of this component which would bring
drinking water to about 52,000 people (about 8,500 families) living in about
126 rural communities of Phase II areas. The project would finance construc-
tion costs, and an additional 17% to cover the cost of INS supervision and
administration and 4% for the preparation of studies and designs.
4.37      Each system would serve an average of about 70 households (400
persons) through individual house connections. The great majority of these
systems would be new constructions, but some would be extensions or involve the
upgrading of existing systems. The majority of the schemes would be fed by
gravity, since most of the project area is located in or near mountainous
areas. A small number of systems would require pumping either from surface
water sources or shallow wells and a few deep wells would be drilled.
4.38      All systems would be designed following INS-established criteria,
which are acceptable. Design values for daily demand, including losses, vary
from 80 to 150 liters per capita, sufficient to meet needs for human consumption.
Per capita investment would, in constant March 1982 terms, average the equivalent
of US$140, except for deep-well systems, for which it would average US$185.
4.39      While most systems would rely on high quality water sources and
would not require treatment, water derived from sources not meeting World
Health Organization Drinking Water Standards regarding bacteriological contam-
ination would at least be disinfected. INS is currently carrying out studies
to identify solutions to the problem of disinfecting and to determine the
appropriate physical treatment for rural water supply systems. By December 31,
1983 INS would, to the satisfaction of the Bank, submit a plan defining its
strategy for providing cost effective disinfection for systems fed by
bacteriologically contaminated water sources and would promptly carry out
this plan in the Phase II municipalities. An assurance was obtained in this
respect.
4.40      Rural Electrification. The project would finance the provision of
electrical services to about 4,800 households in the Phase II project areas.
The veredas chosen for the program would be close to existing electrical lines
and be sufficiently populated so that the investment per house connection
would average US$1,100 (in March 1982 constant terms). Electrical installations
would be limited to: (a) extending existing 13.2 kv transmission lines which
are within 5 km of a vereda; no higher voltage transmission lines or substa-
tions would be financed; (b) installing 13.2 kv and low voltage distribution
lines (120/240 volts) with the pole-mounted transformers inside the vereda to
bring low voltage electric service to the houses; and (c) constructing the
installations inside the houses.
4.41      ICEL would be responsible for overall implementation of the component
and for procurement of materials. The "electrificadoras" would be responsible
for contracting the works and subsequently for operating and maintaining the
systems.



- 23 -
Social Services
4.42      Health Services.  MINSALUD would have overall responsibility for
this component, which would aim at establishing a total of about 82 primary
health care units to achieve an 80% coverage of the population in the munici-
palities of Phase II areas. The project would finance: (a) repairs to 60
existing health posts and eight existing health centers; (b) construction of
about 12 new health posts and three new health centers; (c) repairs to the
primary health care units of 10 existing local hospitals to serve as a base
for the primary health care system; (d) all the necessary equipment and
materials for these facilities, including 27 ambulances, 76 motorcycles or
bicycles for the field medical staff and communication equipment; (e) initial
training of para-professional staff ("promotoras") and (f) in-service training
of all staff, with emphasis on the organization and delivery of primary health
care services in rural areas.
4.43      The project would finance operating costs, including personnel, over
four years, and four vehicles for four departmental supervision teams, one
per department of Phase II areas. All other operating costs would be borne by
MINSALUD (para 5.19). These teams, to be attached to the SSSs, would consist
of a physician, a registered nurse, a sanitation engineer and a driver. They
would be responsible for supervision and quality control and support to the
primary health care staff, physical and financial control of primary health
care expenditures, and monitoring and on-going evaluation of the health component
at the departmental level. The sanitation engineer would collaborate with INS or
the sections of the SSSs responsible for checking the quality of water provided
to the rural communities.
4.44      Following an evaluation of the primary health care system which was
carried out in 1979 as part of the Government's commitments under the Integrated
Nutrition Improvement Project (para. 1.15), the Minister of Health appointed
an advisory group within the office of the General Secretary to make policy
recommendations, set up procedures and propose a plan of action for (a) a more
rational location of health facilities, (b) improved physical, financial and
managerial control over investment and recurrent expenditures in primary health
care services, (c) supervision and training and (d) community participation. The
advisory group has completed its working program, and policies satisfactory to
the Bank have been adopted in most of these respects. However, at negotiations,
assurances were obtained that by December 31, 1982, MINSALUD would present proposals,
satisfactory to the Bank, for the establishment of mechanisms and procedures to
improve the delivery of primary rural health care services, more specifically:
(i) to provide adequate support from MINSALUD central level to the four
departmental supervision teams;
(ii)  for the SSSs to maintain adequate physical and financial records of
all expenditures in primary health care in the project areas;
(iii) for the four supervision teams to provide adequate professional and
administrative support to the primary health care medical staff in the health
posts, health centers and local and regional hospitals of the project areas;
(iv) for the four supervision teams to maintain a set of performance
indicators to monitor the coverage and quality of the service provided under
the project; and



- 24 -
(v) to carry out in-service training of the health staff in the
project departments in the objectives, methods and procedures of primary
health care delivery.
4.45      Primary Education.  The project would finance the first phase of the
implementation of the Government's ten-year program to upgrade the quality of
rural primary education, in the project municipalities of the departments of Huila
(during the first three years) and Tolima (during the last two years), which are
the most deprived of the four project Departments in terms of educational achieve-
ments (para 2.15). This program centers around: (a) the use of already developed
educational inputs aiming at providing the full five-year primary cycle in small,
incomplete, rural schools with one or two classrooms and teachers ("Escuela Nueva")
and at upgrading the quality of education offered in already complete schools, with
five grades, classrooms and teachers ("Experimentacion Curricular"); and (b) the
decentralization of school administration, supervision and planning at the school
district level ("Nucleos"), 1/ such districts receiving appropriate administrative
and pedagogical support at the zone, department and national levels. The Bank is
to support the first three-year phase of this national program through a
sub-sector loan (paras 1.23 and 4.47).
4.46      The project would finance the implementation of the above-described
packages in all the primary schools of about 80 Nucleos, selected for their high
concentration of DRI Veredas, including: (a) the construction of, or repairs
to, classrooms and water supply and sanitation facilities of existing schools;
(b) the provision of school furniture and teaching materials; (c) training of
teachers, supervisors, Nucleo directors, zone chiefs and department administra-
tors; and (d) the provision of vehicles and office equipment for Nucleo directors,
zone chiefs, supervisors and department administrators.
4.47      The responsibility for management and implementation would be shared
among the various structures at national, departmental, zone and nucleo levels
which have been identified to carry out the Rural Basic Education Sub-sector
Program of the Ministry of Education (Plan de Fomento Educativo para las Areas
Rurales y Centros Menores de Poblacion) and would be based on procedures and
criteria, satisfactory to the Bank, applicable to the Subsector Program (as
defined in Appraisal Report No. 3896-CO for a Rural Basic Education Sub-sector
Project) with one exception. The exception would be the selection of Nucleos
and the phasing of their incorporation, which would be the responsibility of
DNP/PAN-DRI. At negotiations, an assurance was obtained in this respect. The
proceeds of the Loan as well as counterpart funds from the National Budget would
be channeled to the Fund of the Ministry of Education (FONDO/MEN), an entity with
separate legal personality which would be the Borrower under the proposed Basic
Education Sub-sector Project and the executing agency for this component.
FONDO/MEN would transfer these funds to the FERs, which in turn would channel
them to the regional representatives of ICCE, the SDE's and the CEPs (para 3.06)
under their normal operating procedures. In addition to the signature of a
subsidiary contract between DNP/PAN-DRI and FONDO/MEN, a condition of disburse-
ment under the education component would be that implementation contracts,
satisfactory to the Bank, had been signed between the FONDO/MEN and the Adminis-
trative Boards of the FERs of Huila and Tolima.
1/   A "nucleo" normally consists of 10 to 15 schools.



- 25 -
Project Administration and Management, Monitoring and Evaluation
4.48      In order to handle the eight new departments of Phase II, including
the four Bank-financed Departments, the project would finance the hiring by
the General Directorate of the PAN and DRI Programs in DNP (DNP/PAN-DRI)
(para 5.02) of additional staff at headquarters as well as in the regional
offices. At headquarters, the additional staff would consist of six profes-
sionals, one assistant and two support staff; the project would also finance
two vehicles for the group in charge of monitoring and all associated recur-
rent expenditures. Since the headquarters' staff would dedicate about half of
its time to the Bank-financed areas (four Departments out of eight), the
Bank project would finance half of headquarters' costs.
4.49      At the regional level, the existing Regional Directors of the PAN
Program would also become Regional Directors of the DRI program. In each
regional office, the project would finance the cost of an assistant director
for DRI, a statistical clerk, two-thirds of the cost of an engineer, two
vehicles, office furniture and equipment, and all other associated recurrent
expenditures, over a period of five years.
4.50      DNP/PAN-DRI would also draw on funds, provided through the project,
totalling about US$320,000 for technical assistance contracts with individuals,
consulting firms or with agencies such as the Interamerican Institute for
Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) or international research centers, needed to
support and orient the work of the agencies in charge of technical assistance
and training for marketing and processing (about 65 man-months in total),
and for study tours and seminars. DNP/PAN-DRI would contract services for
(a) monitoring and evaluating the cooperatives and other groups assisted and
the work of the executing agencies; (b) identifying and studying agroindustrial
processes; (c) financing special technical assistance services in produce
handling; (d) identifying and studying export possibilities for specific
products; and (e) organizing direct marketing links with chains of supermarkets
or retail stores; (f) improving market information services; and (g) financing
any study required for improving the effectiveness of the technical assistance
services and training provided to the beneficiaries of the project. Finally,
about US$50,000, would be used for study tours and seminars for the staff of
the executing agencies and DNP and for members of the participating cooperatives
and farmers' groups.
4.51      Finally, the project would finance the full incremental costs of
project evaluation, including repeat surveys in Antioquia and Cauca, which are
Phase I Departments. While detailed impact evaluation through comprehensive
surveys would be carried out by a special division within the Agrarian Studies
Unit of DNP, on-going evaluation and ad hoc studies would be carried out by
the Evaluation Division of DNP/PAN-DRI. Since the evaluation units are already
fully staffed, the project would only finance contracts with individuals or
firms needed to carry out surveys or ad hoc studies (including the contracting
of systems analysts, statisticians, surveyors, staff for verification, coding
and key punching, programming services and computer services) for a total
estimated cost of Col$ 7.5 million over five years (US$123,000) (Annex 4). At
negotiations, an assurance was obtained that, by no later than February 28, 1983,
DNP would have carried out and processed a socio-economic baseline survey in at
least two of ICA's districts in the Phase II project areas; and that such surveys
would be repeated no later than by February 28, 1987.

D. Project Costs
4.52      Total project cost, excluding beneficiaries' contribution in labor,
are estimated at US$172.4 million, including contingencies. These costs
include US$4.4 million in taxes (taxes on inputs purchased by farmers and
taxes paid by some executing agencies which are not tax exempt for equipment
and vehicles). Contribution of family labor to farm development is estimated
at US$19 million, excluding contingencies. The foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$47 million, or 27% of total project cost. Project baseline
costs are updated to March 30, 1982. Physical contingencies equivalent to
2% of total baseline costs have been added, based on 10% of estimated costs
of civil works for roads, water supply systems and rural electrification
and education and health infrastructure. Price contingencies have been
calculated separately for local and foreign costs, and a correction was also
applied for the Bank's projected devaluation of the Colombian peso. An
estimated annual phasing of project costs by components and a breakdown of
project costs by category of expenditures are shown in Colombian pesos in
Annex 6, Tables 10 and 11. Total project costs are summarized on the
preceding page.
E. Financing
4.53      The proposed Bank loan of US$53 million (including the front-end fee)
would finance 30% of total project costs, excluding the value of labor contri-
bution by beneficiaries. The Bank loan would finance the entire foreign exchange
cost of the project, and US$5.1 million of local costs (3% of total project costs).
Some local currency expenditures would be financed in order for the Bank to retain
a meaningful participation in the extension of the DRI program to the new areas.
4.54      The beneficiaries' contribution to the cash costs of the project
would be US$4.4 million (3% of total project costs). In addition, they would
contribute US$23.0 million in labor (with contingencies), so that their total
contribution would account for 14% of the gross project costs of US$195.4 million
(total project costs plus the value of labor contributed by beneficiaries).
Although the minimum contribution required toward meeting farm development costs
would be lower (para 5.22), it is expected that beneficiaries would put up, on
average, about 24% of farm development and marketing and processing development
costs in cash and family labor. For potable water systems, the communities
would be required to make an initial contribution of 15% to 20%, depending on
their socio-economic status (18% on average), in the form of cash, labor and/or
materials. For electrical distribution systems, beneficiaries would be
required to contribute 25% of total costs, in cash or labor. Caja Agraria
would make subloans to beneficiaries to finance their cash down-payment for
electrification at terms and conditions similar to other DRI credit operations
(para 7.09). Finally, the communities would be required to contribute 10% of
civil works for health posts and centers and local hospitals. Their contri-
bution to the physical upgrading of school facilities, which would vary
according to the economic standing of the communities and the availability of
local labor and materials, is expected to be at least 10% of such costs.
4.55      The Government would finance no less than 65% of subloans for farm
development through Caja Agraria with funds to be provided from FFAP. The
balance of sub-loan amounts would be provided by Caja Agraria out of its own
resources. The Government would ensure that appropriate arrangements are

made between FFAP and Caja Agraria to secure the proposed funding of credit
operations (Schedule D). FINANCIACOOP would finance at least 12% of marketing
and processing credit operations out of its own resources, the remaining 88%
being financed by the Government, from the National Budget (up to 38%) and
from the Bank loan (50%). SENA would also contribute 49% of the costs of the
training component out of its own resources. ICEL and the "Electrificadoras"
would finance about 10% of the cost of electrification, mostly as staff time
needed to design the works and supervise their execution. all remaining funds
would come from the national budget. A summary of the respective financing
shares is shown on the preceding page. At negotiations, an assurance was
obtained that the Government would provide, or would cause Caja Agraria and
FINANCIACOOP to provide, all funds required to carry out the credit program of
the project, as well as all funds needed after project implementation by the
beneficiaries of the project to complete the planned development of their farms
and enterprises.
4.56      The Government allocated funds in the 1981 and 1982 budgets to
start a training program in the areas of the Second Project and initiate
activity for most of the project components. These funds were, or are being,
used under the programing criteria and procurement and disbursement procedures
in force under the ongoing Bank-financed project. Most of the funds spent in
1981 were for training, technical assistance and designs and studies for civil
works. Training of staff and communities started shortly after appraisal so
that the DRI's objectives and institutional requirements would be well under-
stood by the start of the project in 1982. Since experience under the first
project has shown that the benefits of training are quickly lost unless
immediately followed by tangible program actions, the Government included
funds in the 1982 budget equivalent to the counterpart funding of the first
year of the project. Therefore, eligible expenditures made in Phase II areas
after February 1, 1981 under each one of the components would qualify for
retroactive financing, for a maximum aggregate amount of US$10.0 million.
The Bank share of such expenditures is estimated at US$5.0 million (9% of the
total loan amount).
F. Procurement
Works
4.57      Civil works contracts not exceeding the equivalent of US$1 million, for
the construction and upgrading of rural roads, water supply systems, electrical
networks, health facilities and schools totaling US$35 million including
contingencies, would be awarded according to local competitive bidding procedures
satisfactory to the Bank, with foreign bidders having opportunity to participate.
However, because of their small size and limited scope, these contracts would not
interest companies not already operating in Colombia, or even those not already
established in the regions where the sub-projects would be located.
Goods
4.58      Four-wheel drive vehicles and motorcycles (US$3.1 million including
contingencies), ambulances (US$520,000), pipes and pumping equipment for the water
supply component (US$2.9 million) and electrical distribution equipment (US$3.8
million) totaling US$10.3 million would be procured through international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Qualifying domestic manufacturers
would receive a preference in bid evaluation of up to 15% or the import duty which-
ever is the lower.



- 30 -
4.59      A wide range of field, office equipment and furniture, training and
communication equipment, medical equipment, school furniture and teaching
materials totalling US$7.1 million (including contingencies) would be procured
in many dispersed purchases spread over five years under local competitive pro-
cedures satisfactory to the Bank, with foreign bidders having the opportunity
to participate, provided that each purchase, or appropriate group of purchases
does not exceed the equivalent of US$150,000 and that, in aggregate, they would
not exceed US$1.0 million. Farm inputs and equipment would be purchased by
individual farmers and associations through normal commercial channels. A
wide range of international and local manufacturers of vehicles, equipment,
materials and agricultural inputs are represented in Colombia and competition
is satisfactory and servicing and spare parts are available.
Contract Review
4.60      All bidding packages estimated to cost over US$150,000 equivalent
for equipment, or over US$700,000 equivalent for civil works, would be subject
to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation resulting in a coverage
of about 10% of the total estimated value of works contracts and about 90% of
contracts for goods. The balance of contracts would be subjected to random
post review by the Bank after contract award. Experience under the first
project has shown that the executing agencies are well aware of Bank require-
ments and have generally followed procurement regulations satisfactorily.
4.61      Consulting and other contracted services would include about 90 man-
months totaling US$570,000 (including contingencies) at an average gross cost of
US$4,800 per month (in March 1982 constant terms). Though foreign consultants
would not be excluded, it is expected that the expertise for required services
(mostly marketing, processing and evaluation) would be available in Colombia.
The services of consultants would be engaged in accordance with the "Bank
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the
World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the procurement procedures specified in this and preceding
paragraphs would be followed.

4.63      Standard documentation would be required for disbursements, estimated
at US$14.0 million including contingencies, against vehicles, equipment and
furniture, consulting services and, for contracts above US$200,000 equivalent,
against civil works. Statements of expenditures would be used for disbursements,
estimated at US$38.2 million, against all other expenses, including subloans
(US$3.7 million), civil works (US$16.1 million) and recurrent expenditures
(US$18.4 million ). Supporting documentation would be retained by the executing
agencies for periodic review by DNP and Bank supervision missions.
Disbursement Schedule
4.64      Disbursements would be made according to the following schedule,
which is generally consistent with experience under the first project and
disbursement profiles of similar projects in Latin America, assuming project
effectiveness in September 1982:
Bank         ------------------------ (US$ million) ------------------------

4.65      Disbursements of FY1983 would largely reflect retroactive financing of
expenditures incurred since February 1981 (para 4.56). The date of completion is
estimated to be June 31, 1988 and the closing date, June 30, 1989. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that the disbursements would be carried out as
specified in this paragraph and in paragraphs 4.62 and 4.63.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
5.01      Overall responsibility for management, planning, budgeting, coordin-
ation, administration, control, progress reporting, monitoring and evaluation,
review and coordination of procurement and disbursement matters would rest
with the Directorate General of the DRI and PAN programs in DNP (DNP/PAN-DRI).
Implementation of the various components of the DRI program would be the
responsibility of the executing agencies (Chapter III), according to their
normal operating procedures. A series of committees at the vereda, municipal,
departmental and national levels, which would meet regularly and include
pertinent staff of the executing agencies and representatives of the communi-
ties (Chart 1), would assist DNP/PAN-DRI in the planning, integration and
coordination of program actions.
The Directorate General of the DRI and PAN Programs (DNP/PAN-DRI)
5.02      Presidential Decree 1965 of June 4, 1981 unified the directorship of
the PAN and the DRI programs, although the programs would remain separate.
DNP/PAN-DRI is now headed by one Director General, whose functions are to



- 33 -
direct, coordinate and evaluate the program; prepare and present the annual
program to the National DRI Committee (para 5.10) and the National Council
for Economic Policy (CONPES); ensure a proper flow of resources from the
budget and external agencies to the executing agencies; control the use of
funds; and monitor the physical and financial implementation of each component.
5.03      In 1981, DNP/PAN-DRI had a total staff of 186, including the 93 staff
of the former DRI General Directorate, which consisted of 48 staff members at
headquarters and 45 staff members in eight regional offices. Such staff would
be reinforced for the purposes of the proposed project, as detailed in para-
graphs 4.48 and 4.49.
5.04      Since the PAN and DRI programs overlap in some areas (para 1.18),
and several institutions are involved in both programs for similar investments,
there is an obvious need to ensure the compatibility of criteria and policies
in dealing with the executing agencies, to coordinate program scopes according
to their implementation capacities, and to avoid duplication. However, joint
management of two such complex programs is a difficult task. By May 31, 1983,
based on program execution during 1982, DNP would review the effectiveness of
the coordination, integration, supervision and control it provided at every
level and, if necessary, would take remedial action and inform the Bank about
such action. An assurance was obtained in that respect. At negotiations, an
assurance was also obtained that DNP/PAN-DRI would continue to operate with
the functions referred to in paras 5.02 and would staff its headquarters and
regional offices accordingly.
5.05      In order to define the marketing strategy for the program and orient
and ensure proper coordination of the executing agencies involved in the
provision of credit and technical assistance for marketing and processing
(FINANCIACOOP, SENA and CECORA), a Marketing Division has been created within
DNP/PAN-DRI. This division would also be responsible for coordinating market-
ing actions with other sectoral agencies, such as IDEMA, PRODESARROLLO, and the
Ministry of Agriculture, which are not executing agencies but which are active
in the DRI areas or influence price setting mechanisms of commodities produced
by DRI farmers. The division would be staffed by a chief and four specialists
in marketing, technical assistance, cooperative development, sub-project
identification and appraisal, and market and price information. The functions
of this unit are further described in Annex 3.
Coordination Mechanisms and Community Participation
5.06      A series of committees has been constituted at the vereda, municipal,
departmental and national levels to establish priorities for action; partici-
pate in the preparation, review and approval of the annual program; coordinate
and integrate the actions of the various entities; bring up implementation
problems and seek joint solutions; and ensure a proper participation of the
communities in planning and execution. These committees meet several times a
year. Under the proposed project, their secretariats would be provided by ICA
at the vereda and municipal levels, and by DNP/PAN-DRI at the departmental
and national levels.
5.07      The Vereda Assembly is open to all the inhabitants of the vereda and
the representatives of the agencies involved in the production components.
All small-scale farmers have a right to vote. The chairman must be a direct
beneficiary of the program.



- 34 -
5.08      The Municipal Committee is made up of one direct beneficiary repre-
senting each vereda (usually the chairman of the Vereda Assembly) and a
representative of each participating agency. Agencies involved in production
aspects always attend, while agencies involved in physical and social infra-
structure must participate when asked to attend. The chairman is a direct
beneficiary elected for one year by the vereda representatives.
5.09      The Departmental Committee is chaired by the DNP/PAN-DRI Regional
Director and is made up of all the regional directors or representatives of
the executing agencies and, as required, representatives of beneficiaries,
elected for one year by the chairmen of the municipal committees.
5.10      Finally, the National Committee for DRI, which was created by
Presidential Decree 1268 of 1976, is composed of all Ministers, or their
representatives, to whom the executing agencies are responsible, the managers
of the executing agencies, and at the discretion of the Committee, representa-
tives of beneficiaries (currently one per Department). The Chairman is the
Chief of the National Planning Department or, in his absence, the DNP/PAN-DRI
Director General. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that a system of
such committees, satisfactory to the Bank, would continue to operate and that
ICA or, if necessary, other entities would provide the staff necessary to keep
records of the meetings of the Vereda Assembly and of the Municipal Committees.
5.11      The executing agencies involved in the production components also
have regular technical coordination committees at every level. Under the
proposed project, special marketing coordination sub-committees would be set
up at the departmental and national levels, with representatives of DNP/PAN-DRI,
Caja Agraria, CECORA, SENA and FINANCIACOOP, and, as invited, PRODESARROLLO
and other relevant entities (para 5.05). Concurrently, efforts would be made,
particularly with the help of SENA, to promote and assist in the formation
of regional marketing committees or federations of DRI cooperatives and other
farmers' groups.
Programing and Budgeting
5.12      The programing exercise begins every year in March when DNP/PAN-DRI
has selected the veredas to be incorporated, established the programming
criteria and proposed a tentative allocation of funds between components and
areas and when the Vereda Assemblies meet to set their priorities for considera-
tion in the program of the following year. These requests are transmitted to
the municipal committees where they are ranked, consolidated and transmitted
to the Departmental Committees and to the executing agencies for tentative
costing. At this stage, the works which do not meet the annual programming
criteria established by DNP/PAN-DRI for each component are eliminated.
General budget appropriations are requested by DNP/PAN-DRI from the national
budget office in April and incorporated in the national budget for presentation
to Congress in July. Between April and the end of September the annual
program is elaborated by matching resources and requests. A final revision is
made in October, when the program is approved by the National Committee, and,
by November, after congressional approval of the national budget, the detailed
budget and annual program for the coming year are finalized. The programing
criteria, the program itself and the list of municipalities to be incorporated
would be submitted to the Bank annually for approval by January 1 of each year.
An assurance was obtained at negotiations in that respect.



- 35 -
5.13      All budgetary appropriations for the DRI program are conEsolidated
into a single DRI budget, which is considered an investment !budget. Funds are
allocated by institutions, categories of expenditures and De?artments and,
upon clearance from DNP/PAN-DRI, are released directly by thie Nat!Lonal
Treasury to the participating agencies.
Subsidiary Agreements
5.14      Subsidiary agreements between DNP and FINANCIACOOP andl between DNP
and Caja Agraria would state the respective obligations of CaLja Agraria,
FINANCIACOOP and of the Government. The signature of those a.grfeements,
satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness.  DNP would
into subsidiary project agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, 'rith the partici-
pating agencies for the five years of the project and signaturE! of these contracts
would be a condition of disbursements of external funds to the respective agencies.
The general content of the subsidiary agreements is summarized in Schedule B.
B. Operation and Maintenance
Roads
5.15      As part of the ongoing rural roads project (para ].-23), in 1981 FNCV
initiated a routine maintenance policy for new and rehabilil:ated roads that
provides for the continual upkeep of all rural roads under FNCV's responsibil-
ity. As part of this maintenance strategy, FNCV employs peasant workers to
help municipal authorities perform routine maintenance on eLesignated road
sections (on average, 5 km long). The expenditures corresj?onding to the
maintenance of the project roads have already been included in FNCV's own work
program. At negotiations, an assurance was obtained that the Government would
ensure adequate maintenance of the project roads.
Water Supply Systems
5.16      It is the responsibility of the community to mELintain and operate
completed water supply systems under the supervision of INS personnel. Main-
tenance and operation tasks are carried out by the community represented by an
Administrative Board (Junta). Each family pays an opereLtion and maintenance fee
into a special banking account, maintained in the name of the community, for
each house connection. Money collected is used to pay for the salary of an
operator (generally a member of the community who takes on the job on a
part-time basis) and, if applicable, to cover the energ;y costs for pumped
systems. In addition, each month the Junta collects ficom the community a sum
equivalent to the depreciation of the system. This mo'ney is maintained by the
community in a savings account and is reserved to pay major maintenance,
repair and replacement costs. The upper limit on monthly fees is set at the
value of one day of unskilled labor. Fees are adjuste!d to keep up with
increasing costs. At negotiations, an assurance was (btained that tariffs
would be sufficient to cover all operating expenses, including administrative
expenses and depreciation.



- 36 -
5.17      Commun-ities, in general, do a satisfactory job of maintaining simple
gravity systems, but effective maintenance of pumping facilities is, in most
cases, beyond the capacity of the local operator.  INS is therefore considering
establishing maint enance and operation units at its departmental offices in
the near future. l'he formulation of a strategy for the appropriate maintenance
and operation of rtral water supply systems is in process. An assurance was
obtained that, by tDecember 31, 1983, INS would present this strategy to the Bank,
together with a pla;n for action, satisfactory to the Bank, which would be
carried out in the 1?hatse II municipalities.
Rural Electrificatic)n Networks
5.18      It is the responsibility of the "Electrificadoras" to operate
and maintain the neti-orks in their area of influence. The "Electrificadoras"
are obliged to generuite income sufficient to cover the real cost of the
service and provide at reasonable rate of return on the assets employed.
Rates charged under the project would at all times be consistent with those
charged to similar beiaeficiaries by the four "Electrificadoras" under the
National Rural Electri.fication Plan, partly financed by IDB (Loan CO-0160).
An assurance was obtained at negotiations in that respect.
Health Facilities
5.19      With the exception of the incremental costs associated with the
operation of the four siupervision teams (para 4.43), all operating costs
would be borne by MINSAI.UD out of its regular budget. The annual operating
costs of the 82 primary health care units at the end of the project period
are estimated at about Col$ 90 million (US$1.5 million) a year, about half
of which represent incremnental outlays. These estimates are based on the
assumption that each heal'th post would be staffed with one auxiliary nurse
and four health promoters', with appropriate support from a physician, while
each health care center w ould have a physician, two auxiliary nurses, four
health promoters; and that a sanitation technician would attend four primary
health care units.  At neg,otiations, assurances were obtained that the Govern-
ment would support the rec urrent costs of project facilities and, unless
otherwise agreed with the Bank, staff them with the personnel specified in
this paragraph.
Education Facilities
5.20      Few additional re(zurrent costs are expected to result from the
project, which focuses on qtuality improvements. The incremental administra-
tive staff needed to carry out the Government's decentralization policies
(para 4.47), well defined under the Rural Basic Education Sub-sector Program,
would be financed by the Ministry of Education out of its regular budget
under the terms of the subsi(liary agreement between FONDO-MEN and DNP.

C. Lending Terms and Conditions
5.21      Subloans would be made to eligible farmers and farmers groups and
individuals and cooperatives as defined in paras 4.09, 4.13 and 4.17. An
assurance was obtained in this respect.
5.22      Except for working capital for marketing and processing for which sub-
loans would finance up to 100% of requirements, sub-borrowers would be required
to contribute at least 15% of production costs financed by short-, medium-
and long-term subloans. The maximum amount a sub-borrower could have in
outstanding subloans at any time would not exceed Col$650,000 (US$10,650
per beneficiary) for individuals and Col$ 10.0 million (US$164,000) for
associations, such limit being automatically adjusted every six months or
annually in accordance with the variations in the national consumer price
index during the corresponding period (para 4.09). Grace and repayment
periods would be flexible, according to cash flow requirements of individual
farms, but would not exceed five and 12 years, respectively, except for tree-
planting, for which they would not exceed eight and 18 years, respectively.
Interest rates would be equal to those normally charged by financial inter-
mediaries on subloans rediscounted from FFAP or, for farmers with gross
assets of less than Col$100,000, by Caja Agraria, since these would be attended
by Caja Agraria using its own resources. At negotiations, assurances were
obtained in these respects. Present nominal FFAP rates that would be
applicable under the project vary from 18% to 24% (Annex 6, Table 1), with
the exception of reforestation subloans, which carry 15%, the weighted average
nominal rate being estimated at 21%. However, (a) interest would be due at
the end of each quarter or semester; (b) additional one-time fees are charged
for loan insurance (1%) and, for farmers with gross assets of more than
Col$1.8 million, an additional technical assistance charge (1%), so that, the
weighted average effective rate is estimated at between 23% and 24%. Since
inflation has been projected at 25% in 1982 and is expected to fall to, or
below 23% subsequently, on average, interest rates would not be negative in
real terms.
5.23      Interest rates charged by FINANCIACOOP to cooperatives and other
associations would be the same as those normally charged by FINANCIACOOP
on similar operations (Annex 1, para 32), which would average a nominal rate
of 21% and an effective rate of 22% to 23%. At negotiations, an assurance was
obtained in this respect. Lending terms and conditions are further detailed
in Schedule C.
5.24      Except for interest rates, most of the above lending terms are consistent
with those applicable to ongoing DRI operations and are incorporated into Caja
Agraria's DRI manual, the latest version of which is dated September 18, 1980.
This manual also defines all regulations pertaining to the selection of sub-
borrowers, guarantees and procedures, all of which are acceptable. However,
several modifications to the manual would be required (Schedule C) to make it
consistent with the proposed lending terms. It would be a condition of effective-
ness that Caja Agraria and FINANCIACOOP had adopted credit manuals, satisfactory
to the Bank, incorporating terms and conditions and other credit procedures
applicable to their lending operations under the project. At negotiations, an



- 38 -
assurance was obtained that terms and conditions of FINANCIACOOP's credit opera-
would be reviewed twice a year and, if necessary, revised in a manner satisfactory
to the Bank; that the Bank would be informed of any change in Caja Agraria's credit
manual; and that no change would be made to Caja Agraria's credit manual which would
materially and adversely affect the implementation of the project.
D. Accounts and Auditing
5.25      Each of the participating agencies and DNP would maintain separate
project accounts. These would be subject to annual examination according to
generally accepted auditing standards by external auditors acceptable to the
Bank.
5.26      The auditor's report would express an opinion on the fairness with
which each project account is presented. Detailed accounting and auditing
requirements, including provision for the analysis of the credit activities of
FINANCIACOOP, are provided in Annex 5.
5.27      The Borrower, within six months of the close of each fiscal year,
would provide the Bank with the audited project accounts of all agencies.
Also, no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year, DNP/PAN-DRI
would present to the Bank the result of an audit of the statements of
expenditures by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that auditing would be carried out as specified in
this paragraph and paragraph 5.25.
E. Progress Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation
Progress Reports
5.28      Reports on physical and financial progress would be submitted
to the Bank every six months by DNP/PAN-DRI no later than two months
after the end of each reporting period. DNP/PAN-DRI would prepare this
report based on information provided by the executing agencies, according to
an agreed upon format. DNP/PAN-DRI would check such data against information
provided by its own regional teams and resolve all discrepancies with the
institutions before finalizing the report. DNP/PAN-DRI would comment on
general compliance with the clauses of the subsidiary project agreements.
Also, at the completion of the project, and no later than six months after
the closing date, DNP/PAN-DRI would submit to the bank a completion report
on the achievements and impact of the project. At negotiations, assurances
were obtained in these respects.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.29      Monitoring would be the responsibility of each institution, under
the guidance and supervision of DNP/PAN-DRI, which would agree with them on
the type of information that should be collected; the frequency of collection;
and the nature of, and responsibility for, subsequent processing and analysis.
DNP/PAN-DRI has contracted a firm to help set up the monitoring and control
system. Most of the required information is already being collected on a
routine basis.



- 39 -
5.30      On-going evaluation of the production components would be the
responsibility of DNP/PAN-DRI, which principally would use the data gathered
by the executing agencies and contract ad-hoc studies. Extensive surveys of
project beneficiaries to determine the impact of the project would be carried
out by the Agrarian Studies Unit of DNP. Those would include repeat surveys of
Phase I areas and of a control group in Phase II areas (para 4.51). DNP/PAN-DRI
would delegate impact evaluation of the social components to the ministries
concerned according to a methodology that would be agreed upon in advance between
DNP/PAN-DRI and the ministries. The orientation and content of impact evaluation
are further described in Annex 4.
5.31      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government would
continue to evaluate the impact of the Project in the Phase II areas for ten
years after Loan signature.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND PRICES
A. Production
6.01      At full development (Year 10), the annual incremental production

- 40 -
6.02      This incremental production was calculated based on technical
coefficients and areas shown in Annex 6, Tables 4, 5, 12 and 13. At full
development, and at farmgate prices utilized in the financial analysis
(Annex 6, Table 14), the annual total value at full development of the annual
incremental production generated is estimated at about US$75 million (in
constant February 1981 terms), of which about 45% would be from annual crops,
30% from semi-permanent and permanent crops, and 25% from livestock activities.
B. Markets, Marketing and Prices
6.03      It is estimated that 15% to 20% of total production would be consumed
on the farm.  The rest, which would consist of a wide range of commodities, would
be sold on the local markets or outside the project areas. Project incremental
production would represent a small proportion of national production and would be
well within estimated incremental national demand by 1992 since, in order just to
keep pace with the projected 2.1% annual population growth, incremental food supply
would have to increase by 23% over its 1980 level. 1/ Incremental production from
the project as well as from other IDB-financed Phase II areas would therefore be
easily absorbed by the national market and would thus contribute to check the
recent rapid increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs (para 1.03).
6.04      The additional production would slow down imports of maize, cocoa and
dairy products which, during the three-year period 1978-80 amounted to 91,700 m
ton, 7,000 m ton and the equivalent of 140 million liters of milk, respectively.
On the other hand, the incremental production of rice, potatoes, sugar and
beef would release additional volumes for export, which, during the same period,
amounted to 93,300 m ton, 240,700 m ton and 20,500 m ton, respectively. Farm-
gate prices of grains, beans and a few oilseeds are somewhat influenced by
Government intervention (para 1.09). The Government has recently freed the
prices of milk and cocoa to allow production to catch up with national demand.
All other prices are principally determined by market forces.
6.05      All project areas are well connected to the main regional capitals
through the highway network. However, because of the relative isolation of
small producers, their small production of a wide variety of commodities and
their lack of market and price information, sudden increases in production
resulting from the project might well result in local price decreases. It
is expected that the project would help avoid such occurrences through better
planning of production (particularly for perishables), and broadening of
marketing options through improved access to markets (rural roads), better
price information and the promotion of group marketing.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Producer Benefits and Financial Rates of Return
7.01      Five farm models have been prepared (Annex 6, Tables 15 through 26),
which are illustrative of the three climatic zones, topographic conditions, farm
sizes and the wide range of farm activities prevalent in Phase II areas (Annex 2).
1/   During the period 1981-86, growth of demand for foodstuff has been
estimated to rise by at least 4% per year.



- 41 -
7.02      The projected farm development is based on the assumption Ihai
the farmer would phase the start of development of various activities oNer
a period of three to four years. For each activity, yields and associatked
production costs have been projected to increase progressively to their full
development level over a period of five years (Annex 6, Tables 12 and! 13).
Consequently, full development of the available usable land of a given farm
would take place over eight to nine years.
7.03      Farm improvements would not require heavy investments.  For crops,
they would consist mostly of: (a) intensification of land use through reduc--
tion of areas under fallow, increase in areas under multiple cropping, and,
when permitted by topographic conditions, increase in area cultivated; (b) in-
creases in yields through the adoption of simple measures, including better
land preparation; optimum crop population; use of certified seed of improved
varieties; control of weeds, insects and diseases; rational use of inputs and
improved post-harvest handling; and (c) erosion control through planting of
trees and the adoption of simple soil and water conservation practices and
minor soil protection works. With respect to livestock, financing would be
made available to develop family herds of dual-purpose cattle and a whole
range of minor species, for the purchase of animals and other inputs necessary
to ensure their adequate nutrition, health and management. Except in those
cases for which special feed is required for growing animals, the use of
concentrate feed would be avoided, animals would be fed on grass, crop residues
or home-grown feed. ICA would ensure that selected genetic material (certified
seeds, insemination services for cattle, breeding stocks for minor species)
were readily available at reasonable prices.
7.04      The impact of the proposed development on farmers' incomes (Annex 6,
Table 16) may be summarized as follows:

7.05      Internal financial rates of return for the various activities
financed vary from 16% for dual-purpose cattle to over 50% for annual crops.
Each farm model includes a mix of activities. Their high internal financial
rates of return (all above 50%) reflect the relative importance of activities
requiring low investment and yielding quick returns to incremental costs
(annual crops and minor species).

7.06      In constant 1981 terms, the income of direct beneficiaries would
increase on average by about two-thirds after five years of participation
in the program and would double at full development. It is estimated that
about 75% of direct beneficiaries currently have incomes substantially below
the relative poverty income estimated at US$393 per capita in 1980. After
development, this proportion would decrease to 40%, and incomes in that group
of farmers would be only marginally below the relative poverty level.
B. Cost Recovery and Fiscal Impact
Cost Recovery and Tariffs
7.07      About US$84 million, or 50% of total project costs, excluding the
beneficiaries' initial contributions, amounting to US$4.4 million (para 4.54),
would be recovered. Farm development costs financed through credit operations
would be recovered, according to an estimated repayment schedule shown in Annex 6,
Tables 7 and 9. The cost of part of the tree seedlings distributed (those whose
planting would not require credit) would not be recovered, as only a nominal fee
would be charged. There would be no cost recovery for management and administra-
tion, advisory services, training, roads or education and health services.
7.08      Twenty percent to 60% of initial investment in water supply systems (40%
on average) would be recovered in the form of repayment of loans made by INS to
the communities. The water supply loan generally carries a 6% interest during an
amortization period varying from 10 to 20 years. The socio-economic standing of
the community determines the size of the loan and the repayment conditions.
7.09      The electricity tariff would be expected to cover at least the cost
of power generation, transmission, overheads and depreciation (para 5.18).
Capital cost recovery for electrification additional to the initial 25% bene-
ficiaries' down payment mentioned in paragraph 4.54 would be consistent with
levels to be set for the National Rural Electrification Plan (para 5.18).
Fiscal Impact
7.10      After the end of the five-year project period, the Government would
need to continue financing incremental recurrent costs, estimated (in March 1982
constant terms) at US$4.3 million per year on average, out of the national budget,
in order to adequately operate and maintain the project roads and health and
education facilities and to continue to provide the project farmers with advisory
services until full development of their farms. Such annual incremental expendi-
tures are estimated as follows:
(Col$ million)
Project management                                9.1
Farm advisory service                           102.7
Marketing and processing advisory service         16.0
Natural resources advisory service                12.8
Roads                                            26.0
Health facilities                                45.0
Education facilities                             48.0
Total                                 259.6



- 44 -
7.11      After the completion of the project, sub-loan recuperations would
have to be supplemented by additional resources to make credit available to
project farmers in amounts sufficient to allow them to complete the planned
development of their farms. At negotiations, an assurance was obtained that
either the National Government or Caja Agraria would make such funds avail-
able and that the Government would continue to provide project beneficiaries
with the necessary farm and marketing and processing advisory services.
VIII. BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Economic Rate of Return
8.01      The economic rate of return for the productive components of the
project, which account for 80% of total project costs, is estimated at 27%.
Several components (health and education, water supply, electrification) do
not have readily quantifiable benefits and therefore no economic rates of
return have been calculated for them. A summary of economic cost and benefit
streams is presented in Annex 6, Table 27. It is estimated that, besides the
35,000 direct beneficiaries, about half the rural population of the selected
Phase II municipalities, or about 300,000 people (50,000 families) would
benefit from infrastructure built under the project, while up to 80% of the
total rural population of Phase II areas, or about 500,000 people (about
80,000 families), would benefit from the proposed improvements in health and
education services.
8.02      Cost streams include:  (a) all phased investment and incremental
operating costs of farm development in Phase I as well as Phase II areas;
(b) all phased costs of marketing development; (c) the incremental cost of
all the advisory services and training during the project period and for an
additional five years beyond project completion; (d) the costs of construction
and rehabilitation of rural roads and their subsequent maintenance; and (e) all
incremental costs of management, administration and control, monitoring and
evaluation. Benefit streams include all phased incremental benefits of farm
development for the 28,000 beneficiaries of Phase II areas and the 7,000
beneficiaries of Phase I areas. It has been assumed, conservatively, that
benefits from marketing development would consist of the stabilization of
prices at the values used in the financial analysis, so that no specific
additional benefits have been included. Costs and benefits of processing
development have been excluded from the economic analysis since they will
be determined on a case-per-case basis.
8.03      When non-farm costs, only associated with Phase II areas, are matched
against benefits generated in Phase II areas only, the economic rate of return is
23%. The high economic return for the project as a whole is explained by the
inclusion of additional Phase I beneficiaries who do not require additional support
services and infrastructure.
8.04      The main assumptions on the basis of which the economic rates of
return were derived were the following:
(a) Efficiency Pricing of Project Output. All project outputs were
considered tradable commodities and efficiency prices were derived for the most
important commodities, according to their net external trade position (para 6.04),



- 45 -
from their CIF or FOB value adjusted for internal transportation and processing
costs. Efficiency prices for milk and non-centrifugal sugar (panela) were de-
rived from the CIF or FOB value of their closest substitutes, imported dry milk
powder and exported sugar. For the remaining commodities, no significant trade
is taking place and their financial value has been assumed to represent their
economic value adequately. When available, prices for future years have
been estimated in 1981 constant terms according to trends projected by the
Bank Export Projections and Commodities Department. Financial and efficiency
prices are shown in Annex 6, Table 14.
(b) Taxes. In order to allow for import duties on agricultural
inputs and equipment, ranging from 5% to 15%, a weighted average conversion
factor of 0.94 was applied to their aggregate incremental value.
(c) Efficiency Wage Rate for Rural Unskilled Labor. The efficiency
wage rate for unskilled farm labor was derived as follows:
(i) for family labor, it is estimated that, without the
project, only about 40% of the available family labor is engaged in farm
activities, including those not directly related to production. Labor sold
outside the farm is estimated at about 20%, so that the average unemployment
rate (including underemployment) may be estimated at 40%;
(ii) for hired labor, the average unemployment rate (including
underemployment) for rural labor is estimated at 15% nationwide. Because of
widespread seasonal migrations and the high mobility of farm laborers, this
average is considered an adequate measure of unemployment among laborers
contracted under the project;
(iii) it is estimated that about half of the incremental labor
required under the project would be supplied by family labor and the other
half by hired labor. Thus, the average unemployment rate for the project
incremental labor may be estimated at about 27%. Assuming that the market
wage represents the marginal productivity of labor, the efficiency wage rate
(EWR) may be estimated as follows:
EWR = r x p = 0.68
where p is the probability of hiring a previously employed worker (1 - 0.27)
and r is the Consumption Conversion Factor (estimated at 0.93) used to convert
the opportunity cost of labor into border prices; and
(d) Standard Conversion Factor. All other non-tradables (mostly
civil works and utilities) have been converted into border prices by applying
a standard conversion factor of 0.92, as calculated by the Latin America and
the Caribbean Country Programs II Department.
8.05      Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of return is
estimated as follows:

Sensitivity Analysis
8.06      The above values show that the economic rate of return on the project
is not sensitive to the value of efficiency parameters. Sensitivity tests
show that the project is relatively insensitive to various assumptions of
higher costs, lower benefits, and lower and/or lagged incorporation of
beneficiaries, as shown below:

Employment Effects
8.07      At full development, the project would utilize annually the equivalent
of an additional 15,700 man-years of agricultural labor. It is expected that
family labor would supply about 70% of total labor required and hired labor,
the remaining 30%.
Environmental Impact
8.08      Technical assistance for land management would be provided through
ICA and INDERENA. Particular attention would be given to minor soil protection
works, and crop production would be developed in accordance with classes of
soils, in order to tackle soil erosion problems which are severe in several
parts of the project area. Fertilizers and chemicals for plant and animal
protection utilized in the project would have little or no effect on the local
ecology, assuming normal precautions in their applications, to be taught by
ICA and SENA agents, and considering the localization of their use and the
small area covered by any particular farm participating in the project.
Chemicals would no longer be stored in the farmer's home, but in separate
storage rooms located away from the house and financed under the project.
Project Risks
8.09      The proposed project is complex but the risk of insufficient coordi-
nation and lack of integration of the actions of the many participating
agencies is reduced because most of them have participated in the program for
over four years in Phase I areas and gained considerable experience in program
processes and the small-scale farm environment. Phase II areas, in spite of
the variety of ecological conditions, are not basically different from those
of the first project. Targets have been set for the second project, which
the experience under the first phase has shown can be achieved. Projected
rates of incorporation of beneficiaries, of annual credit uptake, of average
areas financed per farm and yields are consistent with what has been observed
under the first project in areas where data are available. Physical targets
for infrastructure and social services are also consistent with demonstrated
capabilities of the institutions and it is expected that fulfillment of the
various covenants for the health and water supply components would be sufficient
to introduce improvements in the quality of service delivery and avoid un-
necessary delays.
8.10      However, a project risk remains associated with the functioning
of the marketing system and price fluctuations. Since the Government policy
is to limit its direct intervention in marketing (para 1.12), the extent of
farmers' participation in the production program would ultimately depend on
how well the executing agencies plan production according to available
markets and facilitate access of farmers, intermediaries and industrialists
to relevant market and price information, and on how fast farmers enter into
group marketing. These factors have been taken into account since the main
production parameters were adapted to what is known has taken place in the
areas of the first project, where the institutional performance in that
respect has been poor. Sensitivity tests of farmers' incomes to cropping
intensities, mixes of activities, and yields, which are known to be obtainable
in the project areas with available technology under small-scale farm production



- 48 -
systems, show that considerably higher incomes could be obtained at current
prices should there be no marketing constraint.  How much better farmers of
this project would do will depend on the ability of DNP to orient project
marketing actions and on the willingness of the institutions new to the
program (FINANCIACOOP in particular) to adapt to the program framework.
8.11      Finally, the merging of the DRI and PAN management structures,
recently implemented by DNP, and the simultaneous rapid expansion of the
geographical coverage of both programs, represents a formidable management task
and therefore a risk exists that the DRI program will lose the clear definition
of objectives and criteria and the specific leadership that has permitted to
implement the first project effectively. However, should this occur, it should
become apparent by May 31, 1983, when the Government would review the efficiency
of the management structure (para 5.04) and at negotiations, assurances were
obtained that the Government would take prompt action to resolve any problems
if they arise.
IX.   SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Assurances Obtained at Negotiations
9.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) The Government would continue to provide all credit funds and
technical assistance services necessary for the beneficiaries
of the first project to complete the planned development of their
farms and to sustain the technological improvements made as a
result of the first project; and submit an annual program to the
Bank in these respects (para 4.02);
(b) In Phase II areas, Caja Agraria would designate or appoint the
required staff to attend to matters pertaining to the DRI credit
program, and would provide it with the necessary transportation
means and administrative support (para 4.12);
(c) The Government would provide the project's Phase I beneficiaries
with the supporting advisory services (paras 4.22 and 4.27);
(d) individual and group technical assistance under the project would

systems; and would implement such a plan in the Phase II
municipalities (paras 4.39 and 5.17);



- 49 -
(g) MINSALUD would, by December 31, 1982, present to the Bank

Ministry of Education (para 4.47);
(i) DNP would, no later than by February 28, 1983, have carried
out processed baseline surveys in two districts of Phase II
project areas; and would repeat such surveys by no later
than February 28, 1987 (para 4.51);
(j) The Government would provide, or would cause Caja Agraria
and FINANCIACOOP to provide, all funds necessary to carry out
the credit program of the project and, after project completion,
to allow project beneficiaries to complete the planned development
of their farms and enterprises (paras 4.55 and 7.11);
(k) Procurement procedures under the project would be as specified
in paragraphs 4.57 through 4.61;
(1) Disbursements of external funds would be made according to
proportions and procedures and timing proposed in paragraphs
4.62, 4.63 and 4.65;
(m)  DNP/PAN-DRI would continue to operate with the functions
described in paragraph 5.03 and staff its offices accordingly
(para 5.04); by May 31, 1983, the Government and the Bank
would review the effectiveness of DNP/PAN-DRI and the Government
would promptly take remedial action should it be found inadequate
(para 5.04);
(n) A system of Vereda Assemblies and of Municipal, or Departmental
and National Committees, satisfactory to the Bank, would continue
to operate; adequate staff would be provided to keep record of
the meetings of the Vereda Assemblies and of the Municipal
Committees (para 5.10);
(o) Together with the list of incorporated municipalities, the annual
program for the project would be submitted to the Bank for approval
by January 1 of each year (para 5.12);
(p) After project implementation, the Government would continue to
evaluate the impact of the project in the Phase II areas and
continue to finance the required advisory services in the
project areas for at least five additional years (para 5.31 and
7.11);



- 50 -
(q) The Government would ensure adequate maintenance of the
project roads (para 5.15);
(r) Tariffs for the sale of potable water would be set so as
to cover all operating expenses, including administrative
expenses and depreciation (para 5.16); tariffs for the sale of
electrical energy would at all times be consistent with those
charged to similar beneficiaries under the National Rural
Electrification Plan (para 5.18);
(s)  The Government would staff and finance the operating costs
of the health facilities financed under the project as
specified in para 5.19;
(t) Credit operations under the project would be made according to
terms and conditions detailed in paragraphs 5.21 through 5.23;
terms and conditions of FINANCIACOOP's credit operations would
be reviewed twice a year and changes would be made, satisfactory
to the Bank; the Bank would be informed of any change in Caja's
Credit manual; and no changes would be made to Caja Agraria's
an FINANCIACOOP's credit manuals which could adversely affect
project implementation (para 5.24);
(u) Project accounts would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank in such scope as, and according
to the schedule, described in paragraphs 5.25 through 5.27 and
in Annex 5; and
(v) Adequate records would be maintained to monitor the progress
-f the project; reports on its physical and financial progress
would be submitted to the Bank every six months; and after
completion of the project, DNP/PAN-DRI would prepare a report
on the achievements and impact of the project (para 5.28).
Conditions of Effectiveness
9.02      Conditions of effectiveness would be that:  (a) a subsidiary
agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, between the Borrower and FINANCIACOOP
had been signed (para 4.27); (b) a subsidiary agreement, satisfactory to the
Bank, between the Borrower and Caja Agraria had been signed (para 5.14); and
(c) Caja Agraria and FINANCIACOOP had adopted credit manuals, satisfactory to
the Bank, consistent with the proposed lending terms and conditions (para 5.24).



- 51 -
Conditions of Disbursements
9.03      Conditions of disbursements would be that:
(a)  Under the education component, implementation contracts,
satisfactory to the Bank, had been signed between FONDO/MEN
and the FERs of Huila and Tolima (para 4.47); and
(b)  under each part of the project, subsidiary agreements, satis-
to the Bank, between the Borrower and the institutions concerned
had been signed (para 5.14).
9.04      With the above assurances and conditions, the Project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$53 million to the Republic of Colombia, including US$5.0 mil-
lion, retroactively to February 1, 1981 (para 4.56). The loan would have a term
of 17 years, including four years of grace, with interest at the rate prevailing
at the time of distribution of the documents to the Board.

Interest
10.       Interest would normally be collected every three or six months or
every year, according to the activities financed. Interest may be capitalized
during grace periods, except for tree-planting, for which it would simply be
accumulated and paid with the principal amounts.
11.       Interest rates charged on subloans made by Caja Agraria would, at
all times, be equal to those changed by FFAP or Caja Agraria (in the case of
those farmers with gross assets of less than Col$ 100,000 which would be
attended with Caja Agraria's own resources) to farmers with similar gross assets
for similar operations. Interest rates charged on subloans made by FINANCIACOOP
would be those normally charged by FINANCIACOOP on similar operations.

12.       Most of the above lending terms are consistent with those applicable
to ongoing DRI credit operations, and are incorporated into Caja Agraria's DRI
Credit Manual, the latest version of which is dated September 18, 1980. This
manual also defines all regulations pertaining to the selection of sub-borrowers,
guarantees and procedures, all of which are acceptable. However, the following
modifications would be required to the Manual to make it compatible with the
above lending conditions:
(a) The definition of eligibility criteria and maximum outstanding
credit amounts would be revised and would make provision for automatic increases
in the upper gross asset limit and in maximum indebtedness;
(b) The maximum subloan to groups would be increased from
Col$ 5.0 million to Col$ 10.0 million;
(c) Subloans to groups up to Col$ 5.0 million would be approved
at regional levels; and
(d)  Interest rates would be those normally charged by Caja Agraria
and FFAP on subloans made to other comparable farmers for similar activities.

Schedule D
ARRANGEMENTS TO BE MADE BETWEEN FFAP AND CAJA AGRARIA
The Borrower would ensure that appropriate arrangements are made
between FFAP and Caja Agraria to secure the proposed funding by FFAP of DRI
credit operations. These arrangements should cover:
(a) the margins and rates of rediscount applicable under the
project, sufficient to ensure an adequate return on Caja
Agraria's own resources;
(b) technical assistance, as provided by ICA, the SDAs or
INCORA under the project, and the corresponding certification
of the extension agents by ICA would be recognized by FFAP
as meeting its technical assistance regulations;
(c) subloans made by Caja Agraria under the project would be
rediscounted by FFAP automatically and in block;
(d) terms and conditions of subloans would be consistent with
Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement.

ANNEX 1
COLOMBIA
SECOND INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Executing Agencies
The Agricultural, Industrial and Mining Bank (Caja Agraria)
1.        Caja Agraria is well known to the Bank since it has been the
executing agency for Loans 448-CO and 651-CO (now fully disbursed), the
banking window for Loans 624-CO and 739-CO (fully disbursed) and for the
on-going Loans 849-CO, 1118-CO and 1737-COC and the agency responsible of
providing banking services, controlling, coordinating procurement matters,
and of progress reporting of Loan 1352-CO.
2.        Caja Agraria was established as a semi-autonomous Government
agency in 1931, to increase production through provision of agricultural
and industrial credit to small-scale and other clients which had no access
to commercial banks. Currently, Caja is the leading agricultural credit
institution, particularly in respect to small-scale farmers, and the
largest bank in Colombia in terms of banking/commercial infrastructure,
with 25 regional offices, about 852 branch offices, a network of 425 agri-
cultural supply stores, and a total staff of 14,000. Besides serving as
the main source of credit for the agricultural sector, Caja provides credit
for rural industries, rural housing, and forestry and it is an important
retailer of farm inputs, equipment and machinery all across the country.
It also provides insurance facilities and administers some agricultural
development projects.
3.        Caja's management and lending decisions are made within the
framework of the Government's general agricultural policy. It has
considerable operational autonomy and generally conducts its operations
on commercial lines as a profit making organization. Caja's Board of
Directors is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and its members
include representatives of the President of the Republic (2), Minister
of Finance (1), BOR (1), the Coffee Growers Federation (1), Caja's
beneficiaries (1) and the General Manager of INCORA. Day-to-day operation
is the responsibility of the General Manager, appointed by the President
of the Republic, assisted by six sub-managers corresponding to the
functional lines of Administration, Finance, Commerce, Credit, Legal and
General Secretariat. In addition to its internal audit and control
department, Caja activities are subject to auditing by the Superintendency
of Banks. Caja regional offices have a large measure of autonomy in
managing its operations; subloan approval, supervision (192 university
professionals and 1,198 mid-level technicians by mid-1980) and recoveries
are the responsibility of local branches.

4.         Caja continues to be the largest monetary intermediary in Colombia
and relies principally upon savings and sights deposits snd BOR rediscounts
for resources. Total assets, as of December 1980, was Col$ 52.6 billion
(US$1.0 billion); a comparative breakdown of Caja's main assets and liabilities
for the last three years appear below.

5.        Lending by Caja in 1980 totalled Col$ 23.5 billion (equivalent
to 56% of the total institutional credit to agriculture granted in Colombia
during supplied principally through rediscounts with BOR. As of December 1980
total outstanding portfolio amounted to Col$ 33.3 billion distributed among
420,000 farmers (equivalent to about 40% of Colombia's farmer population) of
whom: 90% were small-scale farmers (including beneficiaries under the
IRDP with a total outstanding portfolio of Col$ 2.6 billion); 9% were medium-
scale farmers; and, the balance, 1%, were large-scale farmers (para 7).
Nearly 68% of Caja's own resources were on-lent to small-scale farmers; on
average, small-scale farmers accounted for 55% of the total value of the
portfolio of Caja.

as Ordinary Credit and its financed mainly with Caja's own resources; IRDP
loans are partially financed by the Bank, IDB and CIDA; FFAP includes loans
partially rediscounted by BOR for current production and on-farm investments.
The "other"credit line category include industrial lending and export
financing rediscounted through BOR, "Bonos de Prenda"(short-term credit
secured by crops stored in bonded warehouses), "second window"(short-term
credit at commercial interest rates), and credit for rural housing. On
average during the 1978-1980 period, Caja's new lending has remained constant
in real terms, and the most important development is a change in emphasis
by increasing lending through its lines of credit of a higher relative
profitability (IRDP and others) reflecting the need to improve its financial
situation (para 10).
7.        Caja's credit clients are classified into three categories:  small-
scale, medium-scale, and large producers, according to the value of their
total assets including land. A beneficiary whose total assets including
the value of land ("patrimonio bruto") do not exceed Col$ 1.2 million 1/
(US$23,500) is classified as small-scale producer; assets of a medium-scale
producer vary between Col$ 1.2 million and Col$ 4 million (US$78,400). All
others are classified as large producers. Interest rates on loans from
Caja's regular resources ("credito ordinario") are also fixed according to
the gross value of assets, but are not following the above classification
of beneficiaries. Annex 7, Table 1 shows the nominal and effective
interest rates (interest is usually collected in advance) for the different
lines of credit and beneficiaries categories of Caja as well as for most of
the lines of credit available for the agricultural sector in Colombia.
8.        Loans to small-scale farmers are processed very efficiently as
over 50% (200,000 loans) to known clients of Caja, are signature loans
without any additional guarantees.   A borrower can present his application
and receive the loan, either in cash or by transfer to his savings or
current account within about one hour. Loans that require a prior visit
by Caja's farm inspector or approval by higher authority take about 10-14
1/   Although Caja is authorized to increase this limit to Col$1.8 million.

days to process. Of Caja's total loan portfolio, as of end-December 1979,
26% are signature loans, 8% have one additional guarantor, 35% are secured
by liens on livestock, vehicles, equipment, etc., and 31% are secured by
mortgages on land. Branch managers have authority to approve loans, but
their limits vary according to the category of the branch office. The manager
of an "A" branch may approve loans up to Col$ 900'000 (total indebtedness of
client) while in a "B" branch the limit is Col$ 800,000. Each branch office
has a credit advisory committee composed of farmers living in the region. In
an "A" branch, the manager, in consultation with this advisory committee may
approve loans up to Col$ 1,700,000 while such limit for a "B" branch is
Col$ 1,000,000. Loan applications exceeding these limits are submitted to
regional offices or Caja's headquarters for approval.
9.        In spite of Caja's serious overall financial problems, its experience
and performance in handling supervised credit lines is considered to be fully
satisfactory. Overdue loans are classified into: (a) loans overdue up to one
year ("cartera vencida"); and (b) loans overdue for one year and above ("deudas
de dudoso recaudo"). As of December 31, 1980 total overdues of Caja, measured
as a percentage of total portfolio, amounted to 14%, of which overdues of up
to one year 8%, and the balance, 6%, overdues for one year and above. Given
the predominance of small-scale farmers among Caja's subborrowers and the fact
that in Caia's statistics, the whole loan is considered in arrears even if
only interest or part of the principal is overdue, this is a satisfactory
performance. Under the on-going IRDP (Loan 1352-CO), the overall rate of
arrears is about 3%; this level is comparable to the 3.1% observed under the
Second Livestock Project (PPAR No. 1344, dated November 9, 1976). Total
overdues have not changed significantly in recent years and do not pose a
major problem for Caja. Loan recuperation is closely watched and timely legal
action is taken, whenever necessary, to speed up collection. Interest rates
on overdues double the nominal rates, inducing borrowers to repay their loans
on time. Loans made under FFAP programs, and commercial loans from the "second
window," line of credit have a relatively higher percentage of overdues
than those to small- and medium-scale farmers from Caja's regular resources
("credito ordinario").
10.       In spite of the fact that Caja's spread (gross margins) between
average cost of raising resources (about 11.7%) and the average earnings on
its portfolio (about 24.1%) and a relatively low overdue accounts, Caja
income is not sufficient to cover it expenses. This has resulted in sustained
losses during recent years associated mainly with a stable portfolio in real
terms, and substantial increases in payroll costs. Accumulated losses during
the 1979-80 period amount to Col$ 4.6 billion (US$90 million) which is roughly
equivalent to 84% of its paid-in capital.
11.       Caja's problems have been reviewed in detail in different oppor-
tunities by the Bank. Briefly Caja's financial weakness can be attributed
in part to the very nature and legal status of the institution. It is not a
commercial bank whose principal goal is to maximize returns--but rather
difficult compromise between a development bank, a public sector development
agency and a commercial enterprise. Juridically, Caja's program and policy



- 66 -
ANNEX 1
Page 5
decisions are subject to the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture and the
National Planning Department and specific guidelines concerning Caja's activ-
ities--e.g., 50% of Caja's portfolio must be lent to small-scale farmers--are
incorporated into the organic law of the institution. Decisions having a
direct bearing on the institution's financial position such as interest rate
have to be approved by its Board, dominated by the public sector and users.
The external and legal control over Caja operations at times brings financial
benefits--such as access to a limited amount of inexpensive resources--as well
as costs. However, clearly on balance, Caja's financial and bureaucratic
difficulties stem in psrt from the outside controls and influences on matters
ranging from interest rates, to the closing of a branch office with serious
losses to what price to charge fertilizer. While some other development
agencies in Colombia, which are bound by similar problems, can function
efficiently, Caja's situation is exacerbated by the multiplicity of its
function and the variety of approvals required from outside public sector
institutions. Although the above problems are not new, their impact on Caja
operations has become critical since 1975, and while Caja's role and legal
foundation may inhibit significantly its capacity to generate profits, the
origin of its serious financial difficulties stems principally from the
following three factors:
(a) Law 33/71 established that the Government should pay
Col$ 200 million a year, in constant terms, towards the unpaid
portion of its capital subscription to the Caja. Assuming that
these payments would be made, Caja embarked on a major expansion
program, opening 300 new agencies. As the Government defaulted
on its obligation, Caja was left with greatly increased expendi--
tures without increased revenues;
(b) as a result of policy and political decisions, Caja has maintained
a level of services and coverage that is not commensurate with its
financial resources and capabilities; and
(c) the inability of Caja to control the size of its staff combined
with a strong staff association has resulted in important increases
in payroll costs.
12.       Among the most important steps the Government has taken to bring
about an improvement in Caja's financial situation has been gradually raising
the institution's lending interest rate. This has resulted in an substantial
increase of the weighted average return on its agricultural portfolio.
Another important event has been honoring of the provisions of Law 3/1971
which called for the capitalization of Caja. Some US$35 million has thus
been allocated in the 1979 and 1980 National Budgets for this purpose, the
first such commitment made under the Law 3/1971; similarly the Government
has recently authorized to increase the capital of Caja from about US$142
million to US$238 million. Additional ways to increase: the yield of its
reserve requirements; the amount of rediscounts from BOR; and the amount of
resources lent through the commercial lines of credit are under study. Also
in this context, a draft law which modifies substantially the administrative
and financial structure of Caja, was submitted recently by Caja to Congress.

ANNEX 1
Page 6
13.       Given the relatively large volume of Caja's operations and the fact
that the financial problems Caja will be dealt with under a separate project,
the Bank in this opportunity, rather than getting involved in the overall
institutional aspect of Caja, should focus its efforts in: (i) upgrading
Caja's department responsible for management control and reporting functions
of IRDP; and (ii) improving Caja's ability to appraise, provide technical
assistance and supervision of subloans. Caja, although with serious financial
problems, associated mainly with extra-institutional and sector-wide issues,
has a great deal of expertise in channelling funds to small-scale farmers.
Also, from previous Bank experience, it is envisaged that the issues related
to an adequate implementation of Caja's responsibilities under the proposed
project, will be minor ones, and that with some additional assistance Caja
should be able to continue its satisfactory performance under the on-going
Loan 1352-CO.
The Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA)
14.       ICA was formed in 1963 as an autonomous Government institution
dependent on the Ministry of Agriculture. ICA is responsible for: (a) research
in crop and livestock production; (b) monitoring and controling the production
and quality of inputs; (c) pest control; (d) artificial insemination and animal
health in general; (e) registration and supervision of private technical assis-
tance; (f) professional training and cooperation in agricultural education;
and (g) the provision of technical assistance to small-scale farmers.
15.       In spite of an increasing load of functions, the total budget of ICA
has not increased significantly in real terms since 1975. In 1981, ICA's
total budget was about Col$ 1.9 billion (US$36 million). Since 1975, the
share of the national budget in ICA's total resources decreased from 84% in
1970 to 48% in 1975, rising slightly to 53% in 1979. This includes the DRI
budget, which represented 14% of ICA's total resources in 1979 (about 15% in
1980). Other resources include sales of goods and services (12%), the proceeds
of a 1% surcharge on agricultural subloans to medium- and large-scale farmers
rediscounted from the Agricultural Financing Fund (FFAP) of the Central Bank
(12%), transfers from other institutions (7%) and returns on capital (16%).
In the currently difficult fiscal situation, ICA is in a very tight financial
position, which is resulting in high desertion of qualified staff because of
low pay and general lack of funds for transportation, field equipment, gasoline
and per diem.
16.       ICA operates 12 experimental stations, five research centers and
24 diagnostic centers throughout the country, and has nine regional offices
and 75 district extension offices. As of January 1981, ICA had a total staff
of 5,719, including 421 at headquarters and 5,298 stationed in regional or
local offices. There were 1,114 professionals working in research and exten-
sion and 1,127 middle-level technicians.
17.       Total staff involved in the DRI program in 1981 was 1,051, or 18%
of ICA's total staff. These included 155 agriculturists and veterinarians
and 613 middle-level technicians. Only 18 staff were involved in the central
administration of the program. Coordination of all DRI activities is the
responsibility of the Sub-direction of Rural Development.

The National Apprenticeship Service (SENA)
18.       Established in 1957, SENA is an autonomous agency dependent on the
Ministry of Labor and Social Security and responsible for vocational and
informal training. SENA's involvement in rural areas started with the setting
up in 1967 of the Rural Mobile Program to provide technical courses to farmers,
and its role has considerably increased since then. Today it is a multisec-
torial nationwide training institution.
19.       SENA derives about 90% of its resources from a payroll tax charged
on private and public enterprises (2% and 0.5%, respectively). SENA's budget,
which amounts to about US$120 million in 1981, has increased steadily in real
terms over the past five years. SENA is in good financial condition and its
staff is relatively well paid and the turnover is low.
20.       SENA has 18 regional offices and a total staff of about 8,000.  It
runs 70 well-equipped training centers. In 1980, SENA provided training to
a total of about 390,000 employees of over 2,500 enterprises at all levels,
from semi-qualified workers to administrators and managers. In addition, over
250,000 participants attended classes in agriculture.
21.       The share of DRI activities in SENA's total budget does not
exceed 3%, including funding contributed by SENA out of its own resources
(about 40% of total costs). Total staff involved in DRI operations in 1980
was 160, including 121 instructors and 14 supervisors. Central Administration
staff was equivalent to only 3.5 full-time positions.
The National Institute for Renewable Natural Resources and the Environment
(INDERENA)
22.       INDERENA was established in 1968 as an autonomous public agency
dependent on the Ministry of Agriculture. It is responsible for protecting,
administering and developing the natural resources of Colombia. Although
essentially concerned with protection and control, INDERENA is attempting to
increase its involvement in research and development of reforestation, inland
fisheries and soil conservation schemes.
23.       In that context, the Bank has just appraised a pilot watershed
management project in three catchment areas for the water supply of the cities
of Neiva and Ibague in the upper part of the River Magdalena catchment area.
The project would assist farmers by introducing soil conservation cropping
patterns, changing livestock management, reforesting marginal or extremely
vulnerable areas and constructing appropriate structures to slow down erosion.
INDERENA would direct the program with the participation of ICA, SENA and Caja
Agraria.
24.       In real terms, INDERENA's budget increased slightly until 1979, but
since then it has been decreasing. In 1981, INDERENA's budget amounted to
about Col$ 800 million (US$16 million). Government budget appropriations and
taxes account for 81% of the budget; the remaining 19% is derived from contracts
with other entities, commercial operations and sales of services.

ANNEX 1
Page 8
25.       In 1980 INDERENA had a total staff of 3,220, including 2,668
working in its six regional offices. There were 371 professionals and
368 middle-level technicians. Total staff dedicated to the DRI program
in 1981 was 336 (10% of total staff). In 1980, INDERENA received about
10% of its total budget from the program.
The Union of Agrarian Reform Cooperatives Ltd. (CECORA)
26.       CECORA was established in 1968 by INCORA to assist cooperative
societies of beneficiaries of the agrarian reform program, but, according to
its statutes, it is also allowed to assist cooperatives outside INCORA areas.
CECORA is a second-level cooperative organization and, therefore, a private
entity.
27.       CECORA generates income through various activities.  Total sales in
1980 amounted to about Col$ 200 million, or US$4 million, mostly from production
of animal feed (82% of sales in 1979/80) and breeding animals (10%) for its
22 member cooperatives to which it has also provided credit. CECORA is in a
critical financial condition, with accumulated losses of Col$ 290 million at
the end of 1980 and a negative equity. Average annual operating losses over
the two-year period 1979-80 have been Col$ 24 million. In 1980, administra-
tion and sales costs, excluding DRI, amounted to 18% of the total of sales and
other income (Col$ 19 million) while service on its heavy debts accounted for
an additional 11%. Altogether, these costs come to three times the Col$ 20
million gross margin on production and commercial operations and almost two
times the gross margin on operations, plus other income (mostly interest
earned on deposits and loans). The financial viability of CECORA depends on
the results of possible arrangements with the Government, to extend repayments
and assume some of its financial liabilities.
28.       The DRI operations are separately recorded and managed by a special
technical sub-direction. They are entirely financed out of the national
budget. In 1980, CECORA received Col$85 million from the DRI program, close
to 30% of all its sources of funds. At the end of 1980, total DRI staff
numbered 160, including 22 at headquarters and 138 in the eight CECORA's DRI
regional offices.. Thus, at that time, DRI employed 65% of CECORA's total
staff of 245.
29.       In spite of the importance of DRI in CECORA's activities, implemen-
tation of the marketing component of DRI has suffered from the overall finan-
cial condition of the institution. Low pay and political considerations in
the appointment of staff have resulted in irregular performance, because of
the excessive turnover of inexperienced technicians, inadequate support from
central level to its regional levels, and lack of well-defined strategies and
criteria. In addition, field work has been severely hampered by delayed flows
of funds from central to regional levels. Excessive staffing at both central
and regional offices (in 1980, there was about one promoter for each of the
125 farmer groups attended) has led to extremely high technical assistance
costs (between 1976 and 1980, these costs, including CECORA's DRI headquarters'
staff, amounted to about 50% of the total value of production sold by the



- 70~ -                           ANNEX 1
Page 9
groups assisted). Since mid-1980, DNP has considerably tightened its control
over CECORA'S DRI operations, imposing reduced staffing levels at both national
and regional levels, monitoring the flow of funds, setting goals and operating
criteria around priority products, agreeing on monitoring and evaluation data
for specific post-harvest projects, and giving clearance for disbursement of
funds for the payment of personnel to be agreed upon with their terms of
reference and contracts. Performance, however, has not kept up with expecta-
tions.
The Colombian Institute of Financing and Development of Cooperatives
(FINANCIACOOP)
30.       FINANCIACOOP was established in 1968 as a private entity to provide
financial support to the cooperative sector. Its total number of affiliates
increased from 867 in 1976 to 1,275 in 1980, equivalent to about 60% of the
total number of cooperatives in Colombia. It is now the most important
financial institution in the cooperative sector.
31.       Since 1974, FINANCIACOOP has substantially increased its lending for
agricultural production, which, in 1980, accounted for 19% of total lending.
Besides agriculture, lending is mostly for savings and credit unions (23%),
housing (20%) and marketing (16%). Greater involvement in the agricultural
sector is largely the result of a US$3.5 million USAID-financed operation,
which, between 1976 and 1980, asisted in the consolidation of existing rural
cooperatives, expanding FINANCIACOOP's operations, and achieving its decentral-
ization.
32.       In 1980, total loan portfolio was Col$ 896 million (US$19.1 million),
distributed among 540 clients. The value of new loans granted during the same
year was Col$ 536 million (US$11.4 million). Lending rates vary according to
sources of funds and type of investment financed but nominal rates are normally
between 20% and 24% and charged in advance. The total loan portfolio,
however, dropped in real terms over the period 1978-80, by about 30% as a
result of substantial reductions since 1978 in the rediscounting facilities
available in the Central Bank for cooperative financing (100% of subloans at
12%, with an 8 percentage point spread). FINANCIACOOP has not been willing so
far to increase its lending rates sufficiently to raise enough funds on the
capital market to compensate for this shortfall and this has caused the return
on equity to decrease from 11% in 1978 to 6% in 1980.
33.       Nevertheless, FINANCIACOOP is in a good financial position.  The
debt:equity ratio has been quite stable over the past four years, going
from 67:33 in 1977 to 62:38 in 1980. The current ratio (current assets over
current liabilities) has also been stable and sound, standing at 1.9 in 1978
and 1.8 in 1980. Equity has been growing in nominal terms by 15% on average
over the period 1978-80.
34.       FINANCIACOOP is an efficient, well-managed organization.  It has a
total staff of 116 and eight regional offices. Staff costs represented about
29% of total income in 1980, or about 4.8% of the portfolio. Doubtful debts
amounted to about 3% of total portfolio in 1980. This good performance



- 71 -
ANNEX I
Page 10
resulted from tight screening of investment plans and close supervision and
control. FINANCIACOOP is also trying to put more emphasis on the provision of
technical assistance in preparation of feasibility studies, technical implemen-
tation, administration and management, accounting and auditing.
The National Fund for Rural Roads (FNCV)
35.       FNCV is a public autonomous agency dependent on the Ministry of
Public Works and Transportation (MOPT), which was created in 1960. It is
responsible for the construction, upgrading and maintenance of rural roads, in
cooperation with departmental and other local authorities.
36.       Since its creation, FNCV has constructed about 8,000 km of rural
roads and completed about 5,340 km initiated by other entities. Including
DRI roads, the 1981-84 four-year program calls for the construction of about
2,025 km of new roads, the rehabilitation of 1,810 km and the maintenance of
4,580 km of roads. FNCV has 24 regional offices and a total staff of 1,600,
including about 100 engineers. It is estimated that FNCV's capability is
in fact about double that needed for this four-year program. In 1981, total
budget allocation was Col$ 1.4 billion (US$28 million), but execution has
normally been less than 50% because of slow disbursements by MOPT and the
National Treasury of the proceeds of the gasoline tax, which constitute over
60% of FNCV resources. In 1979, funds received for DRI operations represented
22% of all funds received and above a third in 1980. It is estimated that DRI
activities will represent about 12% of the above-mentioned four-year program.
The Colombian Institute for Electrical Power (ICEL) and the
Electricity Corporations ("Electrificadoras")
37.       ICEL is an autonomous public entity, dependent on the Ministry of
Power and Mines, which was created in 1967. The Electric Corporation of the
Atlantic Coast (CORELCA), which is responsible for seven departments of the
Atlantic Coast, and ICEL, which is responsible for the other 15 departments,
together coordinate electric energy development over the entire country.
38.       ICEL is responsible for planning the electrical network and setting
national standards for electrical installations in its area of influence. It
also supervises the design and construction of generating plants and major
transmission and distribution systems, or finances their construction when
design and construction is the responsibility of the "Electrificadoras".  The
electrificadoras, public corporations in which ICEL is the major shareholder,
are responsible in each department for the design and supervision of works and
the production, transmission and sale of electrical power.
39.       ICEL is largely dependent on Government appropriations, which in
1980 amounted to close to Col$ 4 billion (US$85 million). ICEL is starting
implementation of a US$150 million National Plan of Rural Electrification
which aims at connecting 13% of all rural homes, or 145,000, over a period of
four years. A loan of US$50 million was signed with IDB in late 1980 to help
finance the program.

ANNEX 1
Page 11
40.       DRI operations in 1980 represented less than 4% of the total ICEL
budget.
Ministry of Health (MINSALUD) and Departmental Health Services (SSSs)
41.       The Ministry of Health is responsible for policymaking, planning,
funding, and issuing directives for implementing and controlling Government
intervention in the health sector. Implementation is partly the responsibility
of various decentralized agencies, such as INS, the National Institute for
Municipal Development (INSFOPAL), the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare
(ICBF) and the Social Security Institute. The National Hospital Fund (FNH) is
a separate account in the administrative division of MINSALUD for the financing
of major hospital construction and maintenance.
42.       The Sectional Health Services (SSSs) at the department level are now
also decentralized entities responsible for implementation of Government
policy at the local level. These are legal entities which are part of the
administrative structure of the departmental Governments, responsible for
planning and designing health facilities. In the case of local hospitals,
approval of designs by FNH is required. Their directors are appointed by
the department governors. The SSSs are responsible for bidding and contracting
works and equipment and for the operation and maintenance of all the department
health facilities. SSSs receive a variable portion of their funding from the
national budget through the budget of MINSALUD. However, they are encouraged
to secure as much funding as possible from local sources, particularly for
financing of recurrent expenditures. Local sources of financing include
statutory allocation of part of local taxes on liquor, tobacco and of the
proceeds of lotteries. In some departments, they require contributions from
private organizations, such as the Committee of Coffee Growers in Caldas.
43.       For the portion of their funding received from the Central Government,
the SSSs are subject to the presentation of an annual program of expenditures
to be approved by MINSALUD. They are also subject to review and control by
officials of MINSALUD and have standard reporting and auditing obligations.
44.       In 1981, of total Government appropriations of about Col$ 15 billion
(US$295 million), MINSALUD was planning to spend about 10% on the implementa-
tion of the National Health Plan (PNS), which includes the DRI and PAN programs.
This plan, the implementation of which started in 1976, aimed at providing
primary health care services to about 8 million deprived Colombians in rural
or marginal urban areas over a period of four years. This was to be achieved
through the establishment of 2,500 primary health care units that would
put emphasis on the practice of medicine and sanitation through the use
of properly supervised para-professionals. At the end of 1980, over 1,000
units had been established, but an evaluation carried out in 1979 revealed
that coverage was substantially less than expected; that funds allocated to
primary health care tended to be directed towards financing of hospital
expenditures at the expense of the periphery; that the outreach staff
(promoters and auxiliary nurses) received little or no supervision or
professional and administrative support; and that the communications and
transportation equipment needed for an adequate referral system was lacking.



- 73 -
ANNEX 1
Page 12
45.       PNS was until 1980 the responsibility of the Programming Office of
MINSALUD. Following the 1979 evaluation, responsibility for the coordination
and control of execution of PNS and for planning and implementing remedial
actions was shifted to the Office of the Secretary General, which has executive
power over all MINSALUD divisions and which has recently completed a plan for
action for improved financial and managerial control, supervision and training.
Implementation of PNS is the responsibility of the SSSs.
The National Health Institute (INS) and the Departmental Health Service (SSSs)
46.       INS is a decentralized, semi-autonomous agency dependent on the
Ministry of Health. It is responsible for the provision of water and sewerage
systems to rural communities as well as food testing in its laboratories and
vaccine production and research. In 1980, its total budget amounted to about
Col$ 900 million (US$19 million), almost entirely financed by the national
government.
47.       The Division of Basic Rural Sanitation (DSBR) is responsible for
water supply and sanitation either directly through its branch offices, or
through the SSSs to which the responsibility for carrying rural water supply
projects is increasingly being delegated. For the delegated programs, INS
remains the regulating agency and controls the allocation of funds. The Meta
and Huila departments have INS branch offices and, in the Caldas and Tolima
departments, the programs are delegated to the SSSs.
48.       DSBR had a total staff of about 625 employees.  During the four
years 1977-80, INS invested about Col$ 1,300 million (about US$31 million) in
the construction of water supply systems, sewerage and drainage works and
sanitary units for schools for the benefit of 500,000 people. The PAN and
DRI programs accounted in 1980 for 38% and 31%, respectively, of the INS
total investment budget for water supply.
The Ministry of Education (MINED), the Colombian Institute for School
Buildings (ICCE) and departmental entities responsible for education services.
49.       The Ministry of Education is responsible for the formulation of
the education policy and the unification of academic standards and terms
of service of educational personnel throughout the country. By law, a
minimum of 11% of national budget expenditures must be for primary educa-
tion.
50.       Administrative responsibility for actually running the school
system rests with the Departmental Education Secretariats (SDEs), which are part
of the administrative structure of the department Government. Their functions
include the selection and appointment of teachers and their administrative
supervision, and the routine collection of statistics. Control over educational
public recurrent and investment expenditures is exercised by the Regional
Education Funds (FERs). The FERs, which are funded by the national budget,
are administered by a Board made up of representatives of the department
governor's cabinet, of MINED and other national and departmental interests.
The Minister's delegate must approve all expenditures, after verification
that nationally mandated norms are being observed.

51.       The Pilot Experimental Centers (CEPs) are the departmental depen-
dencies of MINED's Pedagogical Improvement Directorate. They are in charge
of executing new curricular programs, including associated pedagogical
supervision, training of teachers and provision of educational materials.
52.       ICCE was created in 1969 as a public entity dependent on the Ministry
of Education. ICCE is responsible for the building and furnishing of, and for
the provision of some teaching materials for, schools and is financed almost
entirely from the national budget. In 1980, budget appropriations amounted
to Col$ 860 million (about US$19 million).

SECOND INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Selection of Phase II Areas
1.        In order to select the departments for Phase II of DRI, a review was
made of the documents which were elaborated for the preparation of the first
project. These documents ranked all the 61 socio-economic districts of the
country according to criteria, indicators and weights which were designed to
evaluate agricultural potential, the presence of public sector institutions
and socio-economic conditions and infrastructure.
2.        After excluding all districts in the first phase of the program and
a few others which are located in areas of predominantly large-scale commercial
agriculture, the next 11 districts in line were selected, as well as the Meta
Piedmont area, which was not originally ranked as a district but is a natural
continuation of, and has socio-economic characteristics similar to, one of the
areas of the first phase. Six of these districts are located in the Departments
of Huila, Tolima, Meta and Caldas and are geographically contiguous to the
areas of the ongoing Bank project. They were consequently assigned by the
Government for Bank assistance. The remaining districts constitute the area
which has been assigned for IDB finance.
3.        In a second stage, the methodology was refined and a set of 11 of
the most relevant criteria were used to rank all 124 municipalities within
the four departments. A list of the criteria used is provided in Table 1.
A range of points was defined for each criterion according to the position
of each municipality relative to the national average. The maximum number of
points which could be obtained for a given criterion was determined according
to a weighting system that allowed more emphasis to be given to those criteria
considered more relevant to the overall objectives of DRI. A review of the
structure of weighting shows the overriding importance given to production and
production support criteria in the final selection (particularly, concentration
of small-scale farms and of land in these small-scale farms, and production
potential), since these accounted for two-thirds of total maximum weight.
Municipalities were disqualified when they did not meet minimum standards in
that respect, or when, according to the 1970/71 census, they had an area under
coffee accounting for more than 15% of the total agricultural land. A list of
the selected municipalities and of points obtained is provided in Table 2.
4.        Finally, based on a short socio-economic survey of each "vereda,"
villages have been selected within the municipalities scheduled for incorpora-
tion in 1982. The process has thus been completed in 26 of the 61 municipali-
ties, leading to the further elimination of about half the villages, mostly on
grounds of relatively large area under coffee, insufficient concentration of
potential beneficiaries, or marked concentration of land ownership.

DNP/PAN-DRI has established a marketing division with a specialist
staff of five, which will:
(a) help develop a general strategy for the marketing actions of
the project;
(b) coordinate all entities involved in technical assistance
and credit for marketing or rural industry;
(c) promote improvements in the CECORA price and market information
system in coordination with price and market information produced by other entities,
such as, PRODESARROLLO, the Bogota Terminal Market (CORABASTOS), and IDEMA;
(d) draft terms of reference for CECORA-contracted staff, and
review, approve and periodically evaluate the staff proposed and hired
by CECORA;
(e) orient the on-the-job training of CECORA staff;
(f) help locate and approve the use of short-term consulting
services by the executing agencies in charge of providing technical assistance
and credit for marketing and processing, for preparing technical, financial
or marketing studies in support of sub-projects or for their follow-up;
(g) direct the review of sub-projects when approval by DNP is
required;
(h) in coordination with FINANCIACOOP and SENA, orient the training
program for the cooperatives and other farmer groups;
(i) maintain contact with other national or international organiza-
tions specialized in agricultural produce, marketing (including price informa-
tion), and technology and orient the hiring by DNP of such additional technical
assistance as may be required;
(j) help develop a reporting, monitoring and evaluation system of
the marketing actions of the project; and
(k) continuously supervise and evaluate the effectiveness of such
marketing actions.

SECOND INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Evaluation
1.        The data to be collected by the executing entities for monitoring
and ongoing evaluation purposes would be supplemented by more direct impact
evaluation work, which would be the overall responsibility of DNP. For this
analysis, emphasis would be placed on improvements to and the review of the
material being collected by the various executing agencies on a routine basis.
A.  Production Components
2.        Based on data routinely collected by ICA and Caja Agraria, DNP would
be responsible for preparing a yearly report, which would aim at obtaining,
from a sample of direct beneficiaries, measures of:
(a) changes in farm size;
(b) changes in areas dedicated to the various activities on the
farm and changes in the number of animals on the farm;
(c) changes in cropping intensity;
(d) changes in yields;
(e) changes in production;
(f) income calculated by deducting from estimated production value,
the estimated cash outlays (inputs, paid labor, interest);
(g) employment of family labor on the farm, changes in the use of
child labor, changes in the use of paid labor and in employment
outside the farm;
(h) changes in total assets values; and
(i) changes in prices received and marketing channels.
3.        The field data obtained by ICA would be crosschecked or complemented
by data from the credit files (including the farm plans, debt service payment,
and data recorded periodically by Caja Agraria on the farmers' assets). Input
prices would be derived from the data collected by ICA for the calculation of
typical production costs per hectare or for credit requirements, or from
Caja's lists of input prices.
4.        The analysis would be complemented by a review of ICA's reports of
technical assistance visits to the selected beneficiaries in an attempt to
determine adoption rates and reasons for not following the advice given. SENA
records would also be reviewed to analyze attendance of direct beneficiaries
at training courses provided.



- 80 -
ANNEX 4
Page 2
5.        Also, the credit files and technical assistance reports of the
selected beneficiaries would be reviewed to analyze their credit performance
over time and the intensity of technical assistance received.
6.        A more in-depth evaluation of SENA's work would be undertaken at the
end of 1983 (mid-term) and at the end of 1986 (end of the project period)
according to the methodology already developed by DNP and described in an
annex to the Staff Working Paper on training.
7.        The selection of the farmers to be surveyed would be the responsi-
bility of DNP. A new set of farmers should be selected randomly each year,
although the analysis of the samples should always differentiate between the
farmers according to how many years they have been participating in the program.
8.        If possible, the data would be organized into a common data bank to
which all production institutions would have access. Programming services
would be available at any time to the institutions concerned to retrieve the
data in the desired form for their own monitoring purposes. The preparation
of the annual evaluation report, nevertheless, would be the responsibility of
DNP.
9.        Assuming that 100 direct beneficiaries per department are surveyed
every year, a total of about 400 files would be reviewed in the new departments,
plus about 100 in the Phase I departments, or a total of about 500 per year.
Data collection would be the responsibility of ICA through its routine keeping
of technical reports on beneficiaries ("ficha tecnica"). In addition, DNP
would carry out a baseline survey at the beginning of the project, including
a control group, which would be repeated four years later.
10.       DNP would, as required, contract individual or firms to carry
to carry out ad hoc studies or surveys. It is expected that most funds would
be made to contract:
(a) systems analysts (up to full time during the first year and
two months a year subsequently);
(b) statisticians (up to full time during the first year, and two
months a year subsequently);
(c) interviewers for surveys of the control group and repeat
surveys in Antioquia and Cauca;
(d) additional staff, as required, for coding, verification and
entering data in the computer for the above surveys;
(e) purchase of programing and computer services.

It is expected that, while DNP would be responsible for the design of the
methodology, the actual survey design, interviewing and processing work would
be contracted out.
B. Infrastructure and Social Services
12.       The impact evaluation of the social components of the project
(health services) would be delegated by DNP/PAN-DRI to the Ministries of
Health and Education which are in the process of designing a methodology for
evaluating actions in primary health care and primary education. DNP/DRI
would determine with MINSALUD and MINED the nature of the evaluation to be
carried out and its frequency, which should be identical with the methods used
for evaluating the corresponding national programs.



- 82 -
ANNEX 4
Page 4
13.       Evaluation of the primary health care provided would, as a minimum,
require monitoring deaths and morbidity among small children, the incidence of
water-borne diseases, and annual anthropometric measurements of children under
five (weight per age, height per age, and weight per height).
14.       Evaluation of the primary education component would involve careful
examination of the movement in completion rates, dropout rates, repetition
rates, and net enrollment rates, for which the basic information is generated
through a combination of the ministry's management information system and
the monitoring activities. This analysis should be complemented by testing
a sample group of children to measure direct learning outcomes. This latter
part of the evaluation could be contracted out to qualified specialized
institutions, which exist in Colombia.
15.       The impact of other infrastructure would be measured through the
community surveys described in paragraph 16.
C. Impact Evaluation of Integrated Actions on Communities
16.       Every year, DNP/PAN-DRI would, in coordination with ICA and SENA,
conduct an in-depth review of changes taking place in a number of selected
veredas. This evaluation would require: (a) annual updating of the short
socio-economic survey carried out for the initial selection of veredas ("ficha
veredal"), which includes data on population, number and type of farms,
production, infrastructure and services available; (b) review of all available
monitoring data on project actions; and (c) interviews with beneficiaries and
their representatives.

Audit Requirements
1.        Separate project accounts would be kept by DNP/PAN-DRI and each
executing entity, and DNP/PAN-DRI, as program administrator, would ensure that
they would make timely submission to the external auditor of the information
required under the non-credit and credit components.
Components Other than Credit
2.        DNP/PAN-DRI and all executing entities would submit to the External

project;
(b) the system of internal control;
(c) corrective measures taken by the entities in response to
observations and recommendations made in the previous report;
(d) the adequacy of the reserve or provision for doubtful debts and
changes in said provision or reserve;
(e) the accounting system used; and
(f) compliance with procurement regulations.
6.        Not later than six months after the close of their fiscal year,
DNP/PAN-DRI would present to the Bank the result of an audit of the statements
of expenditures carried out by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
This audit report would convey the auditors' opinion (and comments as neces-
sary) on the methodology employed in the compilation of the statements of
expenditures, their accuracy, the relevance of supporting documents, eligi-
bility for financing and the standard of record keeping and internal control.
7.        The external auditor should forward to the Bank its audit reports
no later than two months after having received the information from the
various entities, that is, no later than six months after the end of the
Colombian fiscal year.

Notes:   (i)  Interest rates, both for on-lending and paid-on deposits,
and partic-larly those of financial institutions other
than Caja and FFAP, are determined by the market.
The above quotations correspond to the average rates in
effect during February-March 1981.
(ii)  Normally, for short-term credit, interest rates are
charged by trimester or semester in advance.
For medium- and long-term subloans with a grace period,
interest is paid at the end of each period. However,
since the banks may request interest to be paid at the
end of each trimester or semester, the effective interest
rate, on a per annum basis, may still be higher than the
nomonal rates.
(iii)  In addition to the interest rate, all lending to the
agricultural sector in Colombia includes: (i) IZ per a000m
(paid in advance) for life insurance; and (ii) medium- and
large-scale farmers Technical Assistance Fund. These
charges are not included in the effective rates quoted
above.
