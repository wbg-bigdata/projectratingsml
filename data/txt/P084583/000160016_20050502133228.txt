A. STRATEGICCONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

The proposed project i s the third in a series o f Urban Poverty Projects (UPP) inIndonesia and i s
essentially an expansion of UPP to 14 additional provinces. The first UPP became effective in
1999, with Phase Icompleted in2002, and Phase I1i s under implementation. Based on the
success o f UPP, the government proposed an expansion o f the project to 13 provinces, and the
second project (UPP2) was approved by the Bank inJune 2002. Subsequently, the government
engaged with the Bank in extensive discussions about the potential impact o f the UPP approach
on poverty alleviation, community development and local govemance in Indonesia. As a result,
and inconjunction with the preparationo f the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the
government has developed a long-term 10-year program o f urban poverty alleviation, involving
the geographic expansion o f UPP, learning, and consolidation. The proposedproject, requested
by the highest levels o f government, would further expand the coverage o f UPP to the rest o fthe
country to make it a national program.

Urbanpoverty alleviation and commtirzity developinent. The concept o f UPP was developed
following the 1997 financial crisis, when the problem o f urban poverty in Indonesiawas seen
primarily as a lack o f income and employment. There was an urgent need to get financial
resources to the poor rapidly. UPP was, therefore, designed to: (i)     organize the poor into groups
which would receive micro-credit loans for income generation or grants for tertiary level
infrastructure; and (ii) promote the development o f community organizations (Badan
KeswadayanMasyarakat or BKM) at the ward (kelurahan) level that would receive block grants
that the BKMwould manage as a revolvingfund. Inthe first two years alone, the project
provided loans/grants to over 670,000 households through 1,298 BKMs, primarily for income
generation activities (e.g., petty trade; selling cooked/fresh food; services such as electronics
repair, tailoring; small scale manufacturing o f shoes, clothing, handbags, pottery; etc.). Some
tertiary level infrastructure investments were also financed, including road/bridge
constmctiodimprovements, drainage, water supply, garbage collection, etc. benefiting more than
a million people. Over US$53 million have been disbursed to communities, most o f which i s
still being revolved, generating more capital for additional loans and for infrastructure
improvements.

UPP's original goals were surpassed at the end o f Phase I.However, through the large network
o f facilitators and field implementers, four observations came to the forefront: (i)  income
poverty i s a limited view o fpoverty-poor     people demand improvements invarious
infrastructure and social services in addition to income generation; (ii)   even well-run micro-
credit systems are not a very effective way to reach the poorest; (iii)  although poor communities
value loans, the main strength o f the project i s the opportunity it has given them to create an
organization that they elect, with leaders that they trust, and an opportunity to discuss issues o f
poverty together as a community; and (iv) the relationship between the BKM and local
governments needs to be clarified and strengthened.




                                                  3

Inresponse to the above, the focus o fUPP2 evolvedinthe followingdirections: (i)       developing
broad-based community organizations by placing more emphasis on the process o f electing
community representatives to the BKM; (ii)     assisting communities to formulate Community
Development Plans that address the multi-dimensional nature o f poverty; (iii)   supporting the
formation o f city level federations (BKMForum) which bring together BKMs from all the
kelurahans within the city; and (iv) encouraging a partnership between local governments and
BKMs through the introductionof the PovertyAlleviation Partnership Grant (PAPG), which
finances activities jointly proposed by local government agencies and BKMs. UPP2 hasjust
started with consultants mobilized and currently beingtrained.

The proposedproject will expand these ideas to new geographical areas. UPP has, in fact,
become a key part o f the government's emerging national Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP). This project takes a longer-term view o fthe role o fthe BKMas an institution o f
community development and poverty alleviation. The vision o f a successfd and sustainable
BKMis an organization that is: (i) by and accountable to the community; (ii) to
                                     trusted                                            able
address poverty issues and the needs o f the community beyond the confines o f the project; (iii)
able to carry the aggregated demands o f communities to higher levels o f government and
demand better services from the government; and (iv) a legitimate conduit for government and
other agencies for delivering services. This project will support the longer-term consolidation o f
this vision.

Decentralization and local governance. The decentralization laws in Indonesia place local
govemments incharge of providing services to their citizens. With limited resources, however,
local governments will inevitably face tradeoffs interms o f what they deliver. They will meet
the demands o f the population only if officials understand community priorities and are
accountable to them. This, intum, will require communities to be organized, to aggregate and
prioritize their needs and demands, and to articulate these priorities to government. Thus, for
decentralization to work at the local level, two parallel processes need to take place-
strengthening community capacity to organize, aggregate and articulate their needs and
priorities, and buildingthe capacities o f local governments to respond to and work with
communities. Based on leaming from UPP 1 & 2, this project explicitly supports bothprocesses
(see Section B and Annex 4, Project Description). Inaddition, the govemment has mandated
certain measuresipolicies for a decentralized approach to community development and poverty
alleviation that will be supported by the project: (i) the mandated community consultations for
kelurahan development (Musbangkel) will be supported under the project through the
formulation o f Community Development Plans at the kelurahan level; (ii)     Poverty Alleviation
Committees (KPK)required at the district level will be strengthened, through participation in
project activities and through training; and (iii) development o f Regional Poverty Alleviation
                                                  the
Strategies (WAS) newly required at the district level.

Responsibility for service delivery. The UPP concept at its inception called for block grants to
communities to enable them to make decisions about their priority needs largely because o f the
general lack o f trust between communities and local governments at that time (1998) and the
government's failure to deliver what communities needed. However, the concept does not
advocate that all community level services should be provided and managed by communities.
Many urban services have significant network factors and are best managed at a level higher than



                                                 4

the community. InUPPl, the local government role in service delivery was left to a future
(beyond project) stage, untilthe BKMwould be strong enough to demand better services on its
own from the government. For UPP2 and this project, given the passing o f the decentralization
law in2001, the focus has shifted to strengthening both community and local government
capacity for service delivery at the same time. Block grants will still be provided to communities
for services at the kelurahan level that communities are willing and able to manage. A t the same
time, the capacity of local governments to work with communities will be strengthened through:
(i)involvementinthedevelopmentoftheBKM;(ii)formulationofWASwiththeparticipation
o f BKMs; and (iii)  joint implementation of investments ininfrastructure and services with the
minimum50% contribution to PAPG funds (see SectionB and Annex 4). Other issues o f
governance reform at the local level which also have a significant impact on service delivery
such as: procurement and financial management reforms; local economic development policies;
and institutional strengthening will be addressed under a separate Bank-financed project being
preparedconcurrently, the Urban Sector Development Reform Program (USDRP). As some
project cities may participate inboth city and community level programs, a structured exercise
will be carried out in a selected city to integrate these complimentary interventions.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The Bank has gained considerable experience in supporting the government's goals o f more
participation in development, more effective governance and better poverty alleviation programs.
The three Kecamatan Development Projects (KDP), and UPP1 and 2 introducednew ways o f
working with local institutions. They demonstrated that participatory principles can work in
Indonesia on a large scale and that community driven projects can meet Bank standards for
quality and accountability. K D P and UPP reflect a paradigm shift inthe Bank's-and      the
governments-approach        to poverty alleviation, from traditional government-implemented
infrastructure and service delivery projects towards interventions that are owned and
implemented by communities, and supported by government. The Bank has been instrumental in
converting what started o f f as individual projects, into two national programs, which now form a
pillar o f the government's poverty alleviationprogram.

Much has been learned from implementationo f the first two UPP projects. The Bank has proven
its ability to help government departments to incorporate this learning. In so doing, the Bank has
built a strongrelationship with relevant government departments, not only inimplementing UPP,
but also in encouraging the goveniment to scale the program up to a national level. Continued
Bank support for UPP3 will consolidate these gains and enable the important lessons learned to
be internalized inthe program.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

The Bank's latest Country Assistance Strategy (CAS dated October 2003) identifies two primary
constraints in further reductions inpoverty: (i)   inadequate productive employment opportunities
resultingfrom a weak investment climate; and (ii) lack o f quality service delivery to poor
                                                      the
people. Progress in these two areas, inturn, i s compromised by the underlying problem o f weak
governance. The CAS aims to address these constraints through four delivery platforms. One o f
these i s the Community Driven Development, or CDD platform. Approximately 25% o f Bank



                                                  5

lending under this CAS period i s expected to be directed through the CDD platform (namely
KDP and UPP).

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The project i s proposed as a Sector Investment Loan, with an IDNIBRDblend o f 5 1.4% and
48.6%, respectively. The possibility o fpackaging the project as an Adaptable Program Loan
(APL)was considered but rejectedbecause nationalcoverage will be achieved through this third
project, and because no major policy reforms are envisaged. The project will be implemented in
two phases to achieve the national coverage.

2. Projectdevelopmentobjective and key indicators

The objective o f this project i s to provide improved services for the urban poor and strengthen
community and government institutions for responsive service delivery. This objective will be
achieved through: (i) establishment or support o f representative and accountable community
                        the
(kelurahan) organizations that are able to increase the voice o f the poor inpublic decision
making; (ii) making local governments more responsive to the needs o f the poor through
increased cooperationwith community organizations; and (iii)      the transparent provision o f funds
to community organizations and local governments to provide services to the urban poor.

Outcome indicators

        (i)     50% o fpoor households inthe targeted kelurahans receivebenefits and improved
                services from the project
        (ii)    More than 70% o f the community organizations (BKMs) that have been formed
                are representative, effective, and operate in a participatory manner
        (iii)   At least 30 local governments implementing the Poverty Alleviation Partnership
                Grant fund (PAPG) provide their own resources for the implementation o f
                Community Development Plans (CDPs), independently from the PAPG fund.

Annex 3 describes key indicators for each project component.

3. Project components

The first two UPP projects cover the islands o f Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and West Nusa
Tenggara. UPP3 will mainly cover Sumatera, East Kalimantan, Maluku, North Maluku, Papua,
Bali, and East Nusa Tenggara-        15 provinces with about 1,736 wards (kelurahan). The project
will also provide additional institutional support and grants to further strengthen about 660
BKMs selected inUPP1andUPP2 and innew development areas.

Component 1: CoinmuiiityDevelopnierit aiad Local Government Capacity Building
Duringimplementation, the project will aim at: (i)broader awareness inthe kelurahans about
                                                       a
the project and its rules; (ii)
                             well functioning community (kelurahan) organizations that are
democratically elected and accountable to people; (iii)  well functioning community groups



                                                  6

(Kelompok Swadaya Masyarakat or KSM) that participate inplanning for development and use
the kelurahan grants for productive purposes; and (iv) local governments that are able to work
with community (kelurahan) organizations to implement poverty alleviation programs. To
achieve these, this component will finance consultants and facilitators to carry out the following
activities:

         (i)    an awareness raising process that will encourage communities to discuss the
                nature o f poverty intheir kelurahan and how it should be addressed;
         (ii) assistancetothecommunitytocarryoutaCommunitySelfSurvey(CSS) on
                poverty;
         (iii) theformatiordconfinnationofanelectedbodyofrepresentatives(BKM)thatis
                accountable to the community at large and which will act on behalf o f the
                community for poverty reduction;
         (iv)   the formulation o f a poverty-orientedCommunity Development Plan (CDP) for
                the kelurahan using a participatory process;
         (v)    organizing and assisting community groups (KSMs) who will submit proposals to
                the BKMto utilize project resources and implement the programs identified in the
                CDP;
         (vi)   assistance to BKMs to form associations (BKMForums) and work collectively;
         (vii)  building local govenment capacity to work with BKMs and the BKMForum; and
         (viii) strengthening the preparationof city level plans for implementation o fRegional
                Poverty Alleviation Strategy (WAS) programs.

The bulk o f this component will involve a long and guided socialization process where groups of
facilitators will be trained to work directly with communities inthe kelurahan (at least 4
facilitators will work with 10kelurahan). This socialization process i s expected to take about 6
months and will begin after the project becomes effective. Socialization and training activities
will also target local governments, includingparticularly, the city level Poverty Alleviation
Committees (see below).

Compoizent 2: Keluralzan Grailts
Each participating kelurahan will be allocated a grant according to the size o f the population,
ranging from Rp.200 million (US$23,550) for kelurahans with less than 3000 people, to Rp.500
million (US$58,800) for kelurahans with greater than 10,000 people. Once the community
(kelurahan) organization-BKM has been formalized (notarized with the legal status o f an
association) and a CDP has been agreed upon, the BKMwill sign a Grant Implementation
Agreement with the government which will lay out the respective roles and responsibilities o f the
two parties, the terms o f disbursement, as w e l l as the expectations regarding the use o f funds
beyond the project life. The project will also provide additional funds to selected kelurahans
from UPP1 and UPP2 where the BKMs are functioning well, to help them provide more services
to the poor.

For each participating kelurahan, this component will finance specific sub-projects. Sub-projects
have to be in accordance with the CDP, and may cover a range o f poverty alleviation activities
from an open menu (with a short negative list). There will be different rules and regulations




                                                  7

regarding the use of funds depending on the type o f activity being financed. It i s expected that
CDPs will generally include the following types o f activities:

         (i)     pre-identified specific investments that are a community priority by consensus
                 (these could be a bridge, a road, school repair, health facility repair or others);
         (ii)    activities that community groups can compete for (any range o f physical
                 infrastructure to services sub-projects-the   CDP should indicate clearly what
                 priority sectors or priority groups for that community are likely to be financed);
         (iii)   micro credit loans for community groups which will form the basis o f a revolving
                 fund (withclear rulesiprinciplesfor implementation-see       Annex 16); and
         (iv)    grant assistance to the poorest or most vulnerable individuals (this could include
                 scholarships, home improvements, health care, etc. to specific individuals
                 identified by Communities).

The ceiling for any single sub-project per group or micro credit loan to a community group
(KSM) i s Rp.30 million (US$3,550 equivalent). The allocation to the kelurahan will be
disbursed inthree tranches to ensure proper fund use and management, and to encourage better
outcomes, Local govemment staff with full support o f facilitators at the kelurahan level will
provide technical assistance (including socialization and training).

Component 3: Poverty Alleviatiorz Partrzerslziy Grant (PAPG)
The Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant fund (PAPG) will encourage partnerships between
local governments and communities and attempt to institutionalize a consultative process
between the two for future activities undertaken by local governments usingtheir own funds. It
will finance poverty alleviation activities that are too bigto be financed by the kelurahan grants,
or that require local government involvement (e.g., networked infrastructure or operations and
maintenance); or that cover more than one kelurahan.

Initial results from implementing PAPG under U P P l Phase 2 indicate that inorder to reap the
fullbenefits o fthis fund, local governments have to be involvedinthe UPP program as a whole
and not just in the implementationo f the PAPG component, and that the PAPGneeds to be
affiliated with a specific local government structure. Inaddition, the implementation o f PAPG
should be based on Regional Poverty Alleviation Strategies (RPAS) at the city level, which will
be strengthened under Component 1. The responsibility for preparing the RPAS will fall on
local level Poverty Alleviation Committees (Komite Pengetasan Kemiskinanor KPK).

To take into account these developments, the following provisions have been incorporated into
this component: (i)PAPGwill be carried out by established KPKs; (ii)         the K P K s will be
involved inthe process o f BKM formation from the beginning and participate in training
programs and socialization activities; and (iii)  technical assistance will be provided to help KPKs
to develop RPAS. These activities will be undertaken in every participating project city.
However, PAPGfunds will be allocated competitively to 40 local governments (see Annex 4).
PAPGfunds will aim to support the RPAS to the extent possible. The KPKs incities that are
eligible to receive funds will be incharge o f forming an independent PAPG Selection Committee
who will evaluate proposals and detennine the allocation o f PAPGresources. It i s expected that




                                                  8

these design features will build greater ownership o f the UPP approach-and,       therefore, the
PAPGcomponent-by         local governments.

Forty local governments will be selected to participateinthe PAPG. Selected cities will be
eligible to receive amounts ranging from a total of Rp.4.5 billion (US$529,400) over three years
(for cities with less than 15 BKMS), to a total o f Rp.7.5 billion (for cities with more than 25
BKMs). Therewill be an open menufor activities eligible for financing under the PAPG (with a
short negative list). Activities could include basic infrastructure works that go beyond one
kelurahan (such as roads or drains, or refurbishment o f existing schools or clinics that serve more
than one kelurahan); skills training that would benefit more than one kelurahan; non-formal
education and health activities. The cost for individual sub-projects i s expected to range from
Rp.30 million (US$3,550) to a maximum o f Rp.200 million (US$23,550). PAPG
implementation will begin one year after project launch inorder to give cities a chance to
familiarize themselves with the BKMs and to develop the RPAS.

Component 4: Implenzentation Support
The project will be managed by the same Project Management Unit established at the Ministry o f
Settlements and Regional Infrastructure(Kimpraswil) as for the other UPPs, assisted by an
administrative unit (PIMPRO). The PMUwill hire consultants and facilitators to assist inproject
implementation. Technical assistance will be provided through National Management
Consultants (NMC) at the central level; Oversight Consultant (OC) Teams at the provincial level,
with district offices inthe participating cities; and facilitators and community cadres (volunteers)
at the kelurahan level. This component will finance the cost o f the consultants and facilitators.
The cost o f government operating expenditures will be covered through counterpart funds.
Details o f implementation arrangements are provided inAnnex 6.

4. Lessons learned and reflectedin the project design

Many lessons have been learned duringthe process o f implementing UPP1Phase I, were      which
incorporated in designingUPP2. Key design changes betweenthe original UPP and UPP2 (and
this project) include the following:

         (9     The provision o f services to communities i s ajoint responsibility o f communities
                and local governments. Local government therefore has to be one o f the key
                players.
         (ii) Ittakestimetobuildadialoguewithcommunitiesregardingcommunityissues
                and to reach a consensus on ways to approach poverty. A longer (four to six
                month) guided process for awareness raising and socialization i s required. This
                includes a defined set of community development activities; centrally prepared
                training for consultants and facilitators to ensure consistency o f messages; and
                centrally preparedpublicity materials.
         (iii) RevolvingfundscanberunwellbyBKMs,buttheyneedtofollowstandardized
                principlesand best practices and need to be accompanied by a support strategy
                andtraining. Inthis project, ifBKMs choose to runrevolving funds, a
                standardized program has been designed to: apply best practices and principles;
                provide more training for iniprovedmanagement o f revolving funds; and



                                                  9

                  distinguish between levels o f investment inrevolving funds and more support and
                  skills training to those BKMs that wish to (and prove to be eligible to) operate a
                  larger, more professional micro credit program.

The project continues to take a leaming approach and implementation experiences are
continually being incorporated into the implementation processes.

Impact of UPPl and UPP2
UPPl did not have a system to measure the welfare andpoverty impact o f the project. There
was no baseline survey, and not enough importance was given to collecting project data
systematically and accurately across the 1,300 kelurahan. Learning from this, both UPP2 and
UPP3 include a systematic impact evaluation system, with a baseline survey, specific indicators
to measure impact, and a combination o f quantitative and qualitative methods o f evaluation (see
Annex 3, ResultsFramework, and Annex 17, Monitoring and Evaluation). The Management and
Information System (MIS) for data collection under UPP1 Phase I1has been strengthened, but it
i s too early in the implementation stage to measure impacts. The Govemment carried out an
impact evaluation o f UPP1 Phase 11. The findings o f this evaluation will be used to further refine
the implementation o f the UPP program. UPP2 has been launched recently, and the consultants
and facilitators are just starting their work on the ground, following intensive training. Findings
from impact evaluations o f UPP2 will be incorporatedinto UPP3 implementation as they
become available (the implementation trajectories o f the UPP program-including          UPP1, 2 and
3-are    illustrated inAnnex 22).

Despite the absence inUPP1o f direct indicators measuring impact, implementation o f Phase 1,
and now o f Phase I1(usingthe UPP2 design principles), have yielded strong indirect evidence
that the UPP approach i s an effective way o f organizing communities, providing improved
services, and promoting partnerships between local govemnents and communities:

                  the number o f households benefiting from UPP1Phase 1 surpassed targets;
                  the majority o f the BKMs created under Phase 1remain inoperation, even though
                  the project ended inPhase 1kelurahan over one year ago;
                  BKMscame together on their own (without any intervention from the project) to
                  form BKM Fora at sub-district and district levels to work together and help each
                  other out;
                  local governments are already usingBKMs (without any intervention from the
                  project) as a conduit for channeling govemment funds for poverty alleviation
                  activities in some areas;
                  an independent post-audit report indicates that misuse o f project funds at the
                  community level i s insignificant;
                  under Phase 11, improved socialization and facilitation processes have
                  dramatically increased participation inthe program, with about 25% o f adults in
                  Phase I1kelurahan participatinginBKM elections and over 18,000 volunteers
                  signed up to work on behalf o f the project from all layers o f the society; and
                  underPhase 11, a demonstrated increase inthe capacity o f the project to recruit
                  and train motivated and high quality facilitators and volunteers locally.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Duringthe preparation of UPP2, different project altematives were considered (tuming UPP into
a local govemment project, having a micro finance project, or doing an APL),but all were
rejected as the UPP approach was considered to be the most appropriate means for achieving the
project objectives (see UPP2 PAD for details). Inpreparing UPP3, the possibility o f using the
existing intergovernmental fiscal framework to channel funds (DAK) was raised. However,
since the Government decided to make UPP3 a national program as it i s a national priority, the
DAKoption was not exploredfurther. Nonetheless, the DAKmay stillbe an appropriate
instrument to support local government inprioritizing poverty alleviation inthe future.
Therefore, during the course o f implementation, a study will be carried out to investigate ways o f
usingDAK to support the UPP approach inthe future.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

As inUPP1and 2, responsibility for coordination, management andmonitoringlies with the
Ministry o fPublic Works, successor to the Ministryo f Settlement and Regional Infrastructure
(Kimpraswil). The planning ministry, Bappenas, will chair the Project Secretariat Steering
Committee (an inter-ministerial coordination committee), which will consist o f representatives
from Ministries o f Public Works, Finance, Home Affairs, People's Welfare, Cooperation and
Small Medium Enterprises, and Industry and Trade.

A Project Management Unit(PMU) already exists at the central level that is currently managing
UPP1 and 2. The same PMUwill manage UPP3, including project monitoringand reporting. In
consolidating its vision o f UPP as a national program, the government has broadenedthe
mandate o f this PMUand has decided to raise the administrative status o f the PMU so that it will
now report directly to the Director General o f Human Settlements. The PMUwill be assisted by
an administrative unit (PIMPRO). The PIMPRO will hire consultants and facilitators to assist in
project implementation, particularly since this type o f a community driven project will require
extensive presence inthe field at the kelurahan and district (kotdkabupaten) levels. National
Management Consultants (NMC) will be hired at the central level, assisted by Oversight
Consultants teams (OCs) at the provincial level to manage and implement the program. Teams
of facilitators will also be hired with, on average, 4 facilitators serving every 10kelurahan, to
carry out the day-to-day interaction with communities. Facilitators will be supported by
volunteers from the kelurahan (community cadres) who will play a key role indisseminating the
project objectives and principles, and ensuringthe sustainability o f the community organization
beyond the life o f the project. Bappenas as UPP Steering Committee (SC) will hire Evaluation
Consultants to carry out performance and impact evaluation studies.

The district level Poverty Alleviation Committees (KPK)will be the main interlocutor for the
project from the local government side. Coordinating teams will be assigned at different levels
to administer the project, with an administrative manager at the sub-district level and at the
district level who will respectively sign o f f on the kelurahan grants and the PAPG sub-projects
(see Annex 6).

2. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomeshesults

A comprehensivemonitoring and evaluation system has been set up for the project similar to the
system set up under UPP2. This includes a strengthened Management Information System
(MIS) managed by the P M U with monitoring indicators as set out inAnnex 3 and Annex 17. In
addition, Evaluation Consultants will be hired to do a baseline survey, and carry out other
quantitative and qualitative studies to evaluate specific aspects o f the project (see Annex 17,
Monitoring and Evaluation). The project will also support local governments to actively monitor
and evaluate the project. The UPP consultants shall strengthenthe MIS and provide sufficient
support and training to the local government on the MIS application.

As inUPP1 and 2, inUPP3, supervision reports, MIS reports, and the evaluation surveys will
form the basis for continuous learning. The press will be encouraged to report on the project,
and NGOsmay be hired to evaluate specific aspects. The Mid-Term Review and evaluations at
the end o f each phase will provide more obvious opportunities to make any design changes
necessary. Learning from the concurrent UPP1 (Phase 11) and UPP2 will also provide valuable
inputs.

3. Sustainability

Institutional sustainability
The institutional sustainability o f the BKMindelivery of services will be evidenced inthe
following:

        (i)     ifthe BKMis able to address poverty issues andtheneedso fthe community
                beyond the confines o f the project (e.g., play an advocacy role on behalfo f the
                poor, or carry the aggregated demands o f communities to higher levels o f
                government and demand better services from government), thereby demonstrating
                to the community a role beyond implementation o f project funds; and
        (ii)    ifthe BKMis able to become a legitimate conduit for government and other
                agencies to deliver services, thereby providing long-term access to funds beyond
                the project life.

Through the activities described above, these roles will be strengthened to the extent possible
and monitored duringthe course o f implementation.

Institutional sustainability refers also to the sustainability o f the BKM as a representative of the
community. The relationship between the elected community institution established through the
project (the BKM) and existing (and planned) government structures incommunities i s still
evolving. The key government structures affecting the project are the LKMDs or LPMs (the
planning and implementing body at the kelurahan and village level) and the BPD (an elected
legislative body introduced by the new decentralization laws that i s intended to replace the
LKMD). LKMDs are still present inmost kelurahans and, insome cases, are not democratically
elected, have little community confidence, and are considered to be an extension o f the
government's administrative apparatus. InUPP1most communities have rejected the existing
LKMDs infavor of a new, electedBKMas representative o fthe community. However, there are



                                                 12

exceptions. In some kelurahans, widely respected members o f the community who were part o f
the LKMDhave also been elected to the BKM. BPDs, when instituted under the new
decentralization law, will be elected and will be the equivalent o f local level councils. However,
the BPD structure has only been approved for the rural areas (desas) under the new laws, and
does not yet exist inthe majority o f desas. An equivalent structure to the BPD for urban wards
(kelurahans) has not yet been agreed upon.

Given the national coverage o fUPP and communities' overwhelmingly positive response to
BKMs,the central government has initiateda discussion on the relationship betweenBKMs and
BPDs. The experience inUPPl has beenthat where BPDs exist, BKMshave been able to work
closely together with them. Inthe long term, the government envisions that the BPD and the
BKMwill become one institution with two functions: (i) oversee the execution o f local
                                                             to
government expenditure by the Kepala Desa (village chief); and (ii)     to be coordinator and
facilitator to deliver community based services as envisaged inUPP. Similar arrangements are
envisaged for the kelurahan with the LKMDs. Central government agencies intend to review
experiences and best practices o f how BPDs/LKMDs and BKMs function under this project, and
prepare relevant legislation accordingly during the course o f project implementation.

Teclanicalsustainabilityof sub-projectsfinanced
Proposals for both the kelurahan grants and the PAPGwill go through a screening process by
project staff and other experts, ifrequired, to ensure their technical feasibility. For micro credit
activities, BKMs will receive training on analyzing viability o fproposals for use o f loan funds,
and will be supported by micro credit specialists at both the regional level and the central level.
Inaddition, an exit strategy hasbeendeveloped to ensure financial sustainabilityo fthe revolving
fund function (Annex 16). For infrastructure activities, KDP has developed simple technical
manuals for design and supervision o f small works, which will be used to guide UPP3 activities.
Since sub-projects will be community driven, there will be a highlevel o f ownership, and
communities will therefore have an incentive to maintain and sustain whatever activity they have
chosen to finance. Under the PAPG, if any public goods such as infrastructure are financed that
require operations and maintenance by either government or communities, both would have full
ownership o f all such projects as they will have proposed the sub-projects themselves. All sub-
project proposals will be required to set out an operations and maintenance plan (implementation
as well as financial arrangements), which will be one o f the criteria for selection o fproposals.

Financia1Sustainability
The project aims at creating a foundation for communitybased poverty alleviation. It does this
through developing community capacity for collective action and the development o f a credible
community-based organization. Once UPP3 i s complete, almost half o f the kelurahans inthe
country will have such an organization. These communities will not need further support inthis
respect. However, ifthe government chooses to expand the program to every kelurahan inthe
country, a similar program will have to be carried out with a cost about equal to the magnitude o f
this program. The investments indeveloping the BKMwill provide a long-term benefit for the
government's national poverty alleviation program. For example, many poverty alleviation
programs from sectoral departments such health, education, etc., couldbe targeted more
effectively through BKM facilitation. The BKMis, in fact, expected to coordinate these entire
programs at the community level through the CDPs.

Risk mitigation for possible community conflicts. The project will operate inurban areas
where the risk o f conflict i s low. The participatory and inclusive nature o f the project i s such
that it will promote unity and resolution o f conflicts. The core training o f facilitators and
socialization include conflict resolutionmaterials. If adjustments to the guidelines are required
to enhance and adapt the specific conflict resolution mechanisms and a strategy to deal with the
specific conflict, it will be done with the approval o f PMU and the Bank. Incases where the
conflicts interrupts the project processes, or where project staff safety i s at risk, Government o f
Indonesia's policy i s temporarily to suspend the operations until favorable conditions re-emerge.
A similar approach was takenbythe Government inthe Bank-financed Kecamatan Development
Project in conflict areas in2000/1. The phasing o f disbursement at a kelurahan or a city will also
allow temporary suspension, and thus reduce the risk o f inefficient deployment o f resources.

have consistently demonstrated their willingness to share the cost o f maintenance o f small works.
Revolving funds are expected to provide full cost recovery (plus interest) from borrowers. The
fiscal impact on local govemment budgets for the kelurahan grants i s therefore expected to be
minimal. The only direct expense to local govemment i s the overhead costs (BOP) that will be
required for the local coordinating teain and PJOK, which will not have a significant impact on
local govemment finances.

The PAPGwill only be carried out ina limited number o f local governments selected through a
competitive process. The local govemments will be eligible to receive PAPG funds as grants.
The fiscal impact on the recurrent budget o f the local govemment will be operations and
maintenance (O&M) costs o f any infrastructure and services provided through the PAPG. Since
most of these investments will be tertiary innature and will be carried out with the active
participation o f the communities, communities will be expected to provide some o f the O&M
costs. Thus, the impact on local government finances i s expected to be minimal. The concurrent
USDRP project, the Regional Public Expenditure Reviews, and other donor-financed projects
focusing on local govemment capacity building are separately examining local government fiscal
frameworks and revenue generation.

2. Technical

The technical design and approach o f this project has already been tested inUPP1 and 2, and
similar approaches tested under the KDP program. The positive results o f these experiences thus
far attest to the technical soundness o f the approach. With regard to specific technical issues:

        (i)      CDDapproach: The UPP concept is beingobserved by the CDD Thematic
                 Group o f the Bank as a potential "best practice" in CDD approaches in urban
                 areas.
        (ii)     Infrastructure: Lessons from projects with substantial experience incommunity
                 based infrastructureprovision (KDP and VIP) have been taken into account.
        (iii)    Micro credit: Inorder to have a consistent approach to micro credit across Bank-
                 financed operations in Indonesia and prevent underminingor skewing the micro
                 credit market, the same micro credit expert has been hired to help design the
                 approach to micro credit in UPP, KDP and rural finance projects.
        (iv)     Local government development: The project i s being designed concurrently with
                 broad based local govemment development projects and complementarities
                 between these have been taken into account.

3. Fiduciary

The PMUinKimpraswil has considerable experience inprocurement and financial management
under UPP1 and 2, and has met the Bank's procurement and financial management requirements.
The same PMUwill implement UPP3, but a separate sub-section will be established for UPP3.
Training inBank procedures will be provided for key new project staff inthe PMU. The Bank
will also carry out extensive supervisionto ensure that risks are minimized (a strategy for Bank
supervision i s described inAnnex 11).

5. Loadcredit conditions and covenants

There are no significant, non-standard conditions for Board presentation or loadcredit
effectiveness, except the adoption by the Borrower, o f the Project Manual, acceptable to the
IDA. There are no significant non-standard legal covenants applicable to the project.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic andfinancial analyses

As sub-projects are not pre-identified, this project i s considered a framework-type o fproject, and
no specific cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis can be carried out apriori. The most
important benefit o f the project would be non-quantifiable institutional benefit for better
governance; the empowerment o f communities and establishment o f a partnership between
communities and local governments that lays the basis for more participatory development
planning; the delivery o f local level services that are more responsive to community needs; and
greater accountability between communities and local governments. This benefit will trigger
positive economic and financial impacts through achieving cost efficiency and better targeting o f
investments and better maintenance through increased sense o f ownership by the participating
community organizations,

Keluralzan grants. Ifkelurahan grants are usedto finance economic activities through revolving
funds, the mandatory use o f at least the prevailing commercial interest rates (for one year loans)
should provide nominal returns at least that highper year and an expected positive economic
return inreal terms. Iffunds are used for training, these should have positive returns as the
training should enable unemployedpersons to access jobs requiring more skills. Kelurahan
grants used to finance small infrastructure works or environmental improvements generally have
positive economic returns. As proven by UPP1 and KDP works, a community approach for
infrastructureprovision generally yields lower costs and better quality than the conventional
contractor approach. Grant funding i sjustified for public goods because o f the externalities
involved and because o f the expected higher number o f beneficiaries than for private economic
activities.

Poverty Alleviation Partnerslzip Grant. Results from the VIP and KDP projects show economic
internal rates o f return (EIRR) for basic infrastructure (such as small roads, bridges, etc.) similar
to that which could be funded under PAPG, to be inthe range o f 35-40%. Since the VIP and
KDP projects operate inrural areas, it is possiblethat the EIRRs for infrastructure developed
under this project may be higher as urban areas are denser and generally have higher economic
potential. Although EIRRswere not calculated for social infrastructure such as education,
health, and sanitation under VIP and KDP, there are significant non-monetized environmental,
health and education benefits to this type o f infrastructure

Financial soundness of tlzeproject and main institution. The kelurahan grants are provided to
BKMs as a grant from the central government. When the grants are usedto finance
infrastructure or other services that are not micro credit loans, they will be passed on from the
BKMto the community as grants. Inpast projects such as UPP1, KDP and VIP, communities

Procurement. The overall procurement risk i s rated average. Large contracts to be procured
consist only o f consulting services including the N M C and OCs, which will be procured by the
PMUfollowing Bank procurement guidelines. A Procurement Capacity Assessment Report
(PCAR) has been produced and i s summarizedinAnnex 8. The majority o f funds will be
provided for sub-projects at the kelurahan level/local government level. The use o f these funds
will involve numerous purchases o f small amounts under community participation. General
guidelines for procurement using community participationhave been developed and are included
inAnnex 8 and intheproject manuals.

Financial maizagenzeizt. The Project Manager (PIU) will be responsible for financial
management and reporting, and will apply FMR-based disbursements. Financial management
capacity at the PMU and PrU level, particularly with an improved and consolidatedManagement
InformationSystem (MIS),i s considered adequate.

Financial controls at the conzinurzity level. The overall control risk i s assessed as moderate
(Annex 7). The Bank i s financing several projects in Indonesiathat directly transfer funds to
communities. One of the key issues to reduce fiduciary risks inthese types o f projects i s the
need to develop measures to ensure accountability and transparency and to build social controls.
Various design features will ensure transparency and accountability in financial management: (i)
community ownership o f project funds; (ii) qualified people (UPK)to handle financial
                                             hiring
management and accounting at the BKM level (on average, each BKM i s expected to handle
about Rp.250 million or US$29,400); (iii)   a systematic training program for the UPK; (iv) for
those kelurahan organizations that choose to use a large proportion o f their funds for micro credit
activities, stricter financial management procedures (Annex 16); (v) standardized reporting
across BKMs; and (vi) annual audits.

Inaddition, greater awareness inthe community for accountability o fthe BKMand increased
transparency o f accounts will promote stronger social control. Greater transparency will be
obtained through the more intensive awareness raising and socialization activities inthe
beginning and throughout project implementation, more structured guidelines for transparency o f
accounts, qualified staff to manage funds, as well as through ad-hoc evaluation studies. Annex
18 provides the project's Strategy to Reduce Fraud and Corruption, including examples o f social
controls applied when BKM funds were mismanaged inUPP1,

4. Social

Community development and einpoweriizeizt. The project aims at bringing about social change
by empowering communities to address poverty issues intheir neighborhoods directly. The
approach has beentested under UPPl with a positive impact. A longer and more intensive
community development process (4-6 months) will try to ensure greater awareness o f poverty
issues within the community, and the inclusion o f previously marginalized groups into the
election process such that their interests can also be represented inthe BKM.

Gender equality. Women's participation inthe community development process i s a key factor
inestablishing organizations that truly represent all people inthe community. Itis also important
for providing services that respond not only to the community at large, but also to specific needs



                                                17

that women may have. The gender strategy developed under UPP2 to more systematically
address gender equality will also be applied to UPP3 (Annex 19).

Conflict areas. The project will include areas that have beenrecently subject to conflict,
particularly inMaluku. Peace inmany places i s still fragile and it i s not unlikely that over the
course o f the project conflict may arise in areas where the project operates. Sensitivity to the
issues that have led to the conflicts will be critical inthe facilitation and socialization process.
The training program, particularly for facilitators, will focus on promoting reconciliation and
reconstructionwithin communities. The training components will also address how to operate in
possible conflict situations. The training components will benefit from the experience o f KDP in
this area.

Stakeholderparticipation. A key goal of the project i s to achieve greater community
participation in decision-making and to empower communities by providing funds directly to
them. Choices about the allocation o f ltelurahan grants, the PAPG funds and all implementation
and procurement arrangements are up to the communities. Socialization efforts will focus
particularly on getting the active participation o f the poor, the more vulnerable groups within the
kelurahan, women and indigenous people.

Local governments will also participate from the beginning. At the design stage, local
governments have: (i)    participated inworkshops and meetings to discuss the project concept; (ii)
committed to the project as a priority activity and agreed to provide operating costs (BOP) and
counterpart funds, particularly for the PAPG; and (iii)     selected the final list of kelurahan. During
implementation: (i) KPKwill receive training, participate inBKM formation and community
                       the
activities, and develop the WAS; and (ii)      local governments will bejoint implementers o f
individual sub-projects under PAPG.

Existing NGOs and other civil society organizations will be involved in a variety o f ways: (i)
through participation in the regional workshops; (ii) key resource persons for the development
                                                           as
of CDPs where possible; (iii)   as members o f the PAPG Selection Committee; (iv) as evaluators
on an ad-hoc basis; and (v) as training providers inparticular skill areas.

Monitoring of social impact. Monitoringindicators have been designed to measure social
development outcomes. A separate team o f Evaluation Consultants will be hired whose
responsibility i s to ensure that the project i s on the right track regarding achievement o f these
objectives and to provide constructive feedback. NGOs, universities, and other non-government
institutions such as independent think tanks, will be hired on an intermittent basis to carry out
independent evaluations o f the social impact o f the project.

5. Environment

The ceiling for sub-projects under the investment components (kelurahan grants and PAPG) i s
low (US$3,550 and US$23,550, respectively). This, combined with the nature o f the
investments (mostly tertiary level infrastructure), means that the activities financed are not likely
to have any large scale, significant or irreversible impacts. Under UPP Phase I,most o f the
infrastructure investments consisted o f minor roadbridge repairs, footpaths, tertiary drainage,



                                                   18

and sanitatiodpublic toilets, which have contributed to improving environmental conditions in
most cases. For the PAPGcomponent, comparable investments to be undertaken are those
implemented under KDP, which generally have not had adverse environmental impacts. Any
adverse environmental impacts under UPP3 are therefore expected to be limited and highly
localized, and these can be readily mitigated through the project's negative list or through
standard operating procedures and guidelines. Environmental Guidelineshave been agreed with
the government and included inthe Project ImplementationManual (see Annex loa). During
implementation, consultants and facilitators will be trained inthe understanding and application
o f these guidelines and will assist the community groups inpreparing their sub-project proposals
to comply with the guidelines.

Choices about the allocation o f kelurahan grants are up to the communities and BKMs.
Communities will participate inthe formation o f the Community Development Plan, and BKMs
will evaluate proposals for sub-project from community groups based on the CDP. A committee
consisting o f NGOs, government officials and community organizations will determine
allocation o f funds under the PAPG. Safeguards policies will be addressed inthe following
manner:

         (i)        Sub-projects that are a priori known to have an adverse impact on the
                    environment will not be financed and are included inthe negative list (e.g.,
                    protected areas, logging--see Annex 15, Sample Sub-project Proposal Form).
                    Environmental Guidelines (Annex 1Oa) have also been developed to address
                    minor environmental issues that may arise.
         (ii)       Subprojects are not expected to require involuntary vesettlenzent or acquisition o f
                    significant amounts of land. Inthe event they do, however, a Land Acquisition
                    and Resettlement Policy Framework (Annex 1Ob) has been developed in
                    accordance with OP4.12 to ensure application o f the appropriate safeguard
                    policies.

       (iii) Thehighlyparticipatorynatureoftheprojectwillensurethatcommunitieswould
                be able to identify if any proposed sub-project will have an impact on cultural
                property and to ensure that these activities do not adversely affect cultural
                property. Sub-project proposals will require the identification o f any such
                activities and require the group proposing the sub-project to specify adequate
                mitigation measures (see Amex 15, Sample Sub-project Proposal Form).
       (iv)     Inareas where IndigenousPeople maybe affected (e.g., Papua), a Frameworkfor

                be required inthe project approach and design to ensure that IndigenousPeople
                are fully included in the project. The TOR will be reviewed and approved by
                EASES before conducting the study.

The above guidelines and frameworks have beenmade available to the public throughthe Bank's
Project InformationCenters inJakarta and Washington, and will be published inthe project
manuals and be made available to the community organizations/dinases preparing proposals.
Kelurahan facilitators and other project staff (OCs) will be trained inthe application o f the
guidelines. BKMs and the PAF'G Selection Committee will be trained inhow to apply the
safeguards intheir selection process. Communities will be in charge o f deciding all
implementation and procurement arrangements, and follow-up on guidelines and approved
proposals will be monitored by kelurahan facilitators and OCs. On the environment, an
experienced environmental consultant will be required to summarize progress, monitor and
measure the impact o f the project on the environment.

7. Policy Exceptions and Readiness

No exceptions are sought to any Bank policies for this project. With regard to readiness, the
following measures have been taken to ensure that implementation will begin immediately upon
project effectiveness:

                The selection o f the key consultant team has been initiated during project
                preparation and the National Management Consultants (NMC) will be inplace by
                the time project becomes effective. The intention i s to hire the same NMC to
                manage the entire UPP program, thereby reducing the long learning curve for new
                consultants who caused delays inthe startup o f both UPPl and UPP2.
                The RFPs for the Oversight Consultants (OCs) have beenreviewed and agreed
                upon.
                Fiduciary arrangements will be inplace and P M U staff familiar with the UPP will
                be assigned for this project.
                The training and socialization strategies have been tested under UPP1 and 2.
                To cope with the workload, the PMUand the Project Administration unit will be
                strengthenedand Annex 22 provides a detailed project implementation schedule.
                Appropriate safeguards clearances have been obtained and disclosure
                requirements have been met.

                              Annex 1: Country and Sector Background
                                INDONESIA: Third UrbanPovertyProject

1.       Similar to U P P l and UPP2, this project does not take a traditional sector approach. Urban
development practitioners recognize that urban development i s a confluence o f many sectors that requires
a multi-faceted approach. Inaiming to lay the foundation for poverty reduction inurban areas, this
project incorporates three basic assumptions: i)to address poverty requires that specific measures be
taken at the central level, even under a decentralized regime; ii)to improve resource allocation,
communities are sometimes well placed to decide on certain service priorities and should be involved in
decision making; and iii)for improved governance and for decentralization to be effective, communities
and local governments need to work inpartnership.

2.       Ina time o f transition and scarce budgetary resources, local governments are facing hard
decisions as they try to balance their new responsibilities with uncertain budgets. Given the broadrange
of issues they now have to tackle, local governments' initial priorities may not be targeted to the poor.
The central government has identified poverty alleviation as anationalpriority, and is therefore prepared
to provide special grants to local governments for poverty-targeted interventions. Inthe absence o f a
functioning targeted grant mechanism for local governments (DAK as envisaged in the new decentralized
legislation); the central government has decided to continue to fund selected programs directly. This does
not, however, mean that poverty alleviation i s primarily a central government responsibility. It i s with
that inmindthat this project has beendesigned with two distinct components.

3.       The point o f entry for the project is the community. The project approach i s based on the belief
that some local level decisions regardingpoverty reduction should be taken at the community level, and
that community-based organizations are able to address various dimensions o f poverty. However,
community organizations can only do this well if: (i)     they are well organized; (ii) haveresources;
                                                                                          they
(iii) havethecapacitytomanageandutilizetheresources;and(iv)theyhavetheknowledgeand
     they
confidence to work with and influence local governments to respond to their needs and demands. The
project focuses at the ward (kelurahan) level because it i s felt that this i s the right size o f population
within urban areas to work with, and that kelurahan level organizations are sometimes the bestplacedto
tackle issues of poverty at the community level (the experience o f UPPl supports this). Hereafter, the
word "community" in this document will refer to residents living within a kelurahan.

4.       A t the same time, however, i t i s evident that all issues o f poverty cannot and should not be solved
by communities themselves. Local governments have a responsibility for providing infrastructure and
services that cannot be managed independently by communities. These include networked infrastructure,
investments that require operations and maintenance by local government, large investments that are too
expensive to be financed by communities themselves, and investments that benefit more than one
community. To encourage local governments to take on these responsibilities, and to ensure that services
are delivered based on community demand, the project has designed a second component, the Poverty
Alleviation Partnership Grant (PAPG), which requires a partnership between community organizations
and local governments.

5.       UPP has become a national program for urban poverty alleviation. The government is developing
a long-term strategy for poverty alleviation and sees UPP as a vehicle for implementing this strategy. The
government sees the organizations established through UPP (BKMs) as institutions that will grow
organically and whose capacity to manage activities will develop over time so that they can increasingly
take on more complex poverty alleviation initiatives. In fact, the national government i s considering
making BKMs the organizational focal point for a wide range o f local development programs across
sectors (health, education, shelter, etc.), in addition to beingthe main vehicle for implementing



                                                      21

community level poverty alleviation programs. A t the city level, the Government sees UPP, through its
PAPG component, as an instrument for streamlining the local poverty alleviation activities by supporting
development o f Regional Poverty Alleviation Strategy and its implementation.


Specific IssuesRegardingProvision of MicrocreditThroughUPP

6.       As part o f the community empowerment strategy, UPPl provided an open menu o f activities that
communities could undertake; with revolving funds for micro credit as one o f the options. Partly due to
pressure to channel resources immediately to communities in a crisis situation, and partly due to a project
manual that emphasized micro credit over other options, the vast majority o f community funds under
UPPl (over 90%) have been usedto provide micro credit. However, the project design did not have a
well-articulated system to support micro credit effectively on such a large scale. The result is that,
although repayment rates are relatively high (particularly when compared to other govemment runmicro
credit programs such as JPS) and borrowers are generally runningprofitable micro-enterprises, the
principlesand methodologies for revolving fundmanagement differ betweenBKMs,reporting is difficult
to compare across BKMs,and the quality o f technical assistance has not been consistent across the
provinces.

7.       There is no debate in Indonesia about the need to provide greater access to micro credit,
particularly for the poor. A decision was, therefore, made to continue to provide revolving fund through
UPP3 but with the following added design features: (i)      the awareness-raising and socializationprocess
(which will be much longer than under UPP1) will stress that micro credit i s only one o f a range o f
poverty alleviation activities that communities can undertake; and (ii)   iftheBKMchoosestoruna
revolving fund, they will have to follow standardized criteria, rules and principles to ensure sustainable,
prudential micro credit services, and there will be a definedprogram o f training and technical assistance
to support them (see Annex 16).

8.       A second issuewithregard to providingrevolving funds for micro credit relates to the kind of
technical assistance that should be provided to micro credit borrowers. Under UPPl, specific Small Scale
Enterprise Experts were hired as part o f project implementation teams to provide business specific advice
and skills to borrowers to raise the productivity o f their enterprise and the marketability o f their goods,
This component o fUPP1has hadlimited success, primarily because o f the diversity and types o f
enterprises o f the borrowers. O f over 500,000 borrowers inUPP1, over 60% borrow for petty trading
(primarily cooked-foodhawkers, vegetable sellers, rice traders, basic commodity kiosk operators), while
less than 15% borrow for service provision (auto/motorcycle repair, appliance repair, tire repair, petty-cab
driver), and less than 10% for manufacturing(cottage industries, primarily inthe garment, shoe and
accessory sectors).

9.       A strategic choice was made inthis project not to embark on a full scale effort at providing
business-specific technical assistance for the following reasons: (i)the difficulties o f standardizing
support strategies in large projects that have an open menu policy; (ii)the explicit community
development objectives of this project rather than the objective o f developing micro enterprises; and (iii)
the need to keep project design simple and focused. The project will thus focus on providing basic
business analysis andmanagement training to all borrowing groups. Under UPP2, the preparation and
implementation o f a micro enterprise development strategy will be piloted intwo cities that will include:
(i) analysisoflocalmarketsandproductsandthecomparativeadvantageofspecifictypesof
   an
enterprises, and (ii) development of a program o f tailored advice to increase the productivity o f existing
businesses and training innew business ideas. If this i s successful in the UPP2 pilot areas, similar
strategies may be developed inUPP3 provinces as well.

                                Annex 4: DetailedProject Description
                            INDONESIA: Third Urban Poverty Project

1.      The proposedproject is the thirdina series ofUrbanPoverty Projects (UPP) and is essentially an
expansion o f UPP to additional provinces. The first UPP became effective in 1999,with Phase I
completed in2002, and Phase I1under implementation. Based on the success o f UPP, the govemment
proposed an expansion of the project to 13 provinces, and the second project (UPP2) was approved by the
Bank inJune 2002. Subsequently, the govemment engaged with the Bank in extensive discussions about
the potential impact of the UPP approach onpoverty alleviation, community development and local
governance inIndonesia. As a result and in conjunction with the on-going PRSP exercise, the
govemment has developed a long-term 10-year program o f urban poverty alleviation, involving
geographic expansion o f UPP, learning, and consolidation. The proposed project would further expand
the coverage of UPPto the rest o fthe country to make it a nationalprogram.

2.      The design features o f UPP3 are similar to UPP2. Some changes have been made, however,
based on the continuous leaming froin implementation o f the UPPs. These are mainly in the socialization
and training strategies (Component 1), in the design o f the Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant
(Component 3), and in the structure o f some consulting services that support implementation (Component
4).

Project Components
4.       All local governments(kotaikabupaten) inthe project area can participate inthe project.
However, ifthey choose to participate inthe project they need to meet the following conditions: (i)       agree
to the rules o f the project; (ii)establish project offices as required for project coordination and fund
disbursement; (iii)   provide requiredcounterpart funds; and (iv) develop a list o f target kelurahans
according to targeting rules. Meeting the above conditions would allow implementation o f the Capacity
BuildingComponent (Component One) and the KelurahanGrant Component (Component Two) inthat
local government jurisdiction. These components essentially provide support for community
development, local government capacity building and block grants for community sub-projects. Local
governments can also participate in another project component, the Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant
(Component Three). This component allows local governments to access matching grants for city level
poverty reduction activities. The provision o f the grant i s muchmore competitive, as only 40 local
governments can participate. To participate in this component, they would have to meet a few more
conditions as described under Component 3 ,

Project Component 1 US$11.4million
                          -
CommunityDevelopment and Local Goveriiment Capacity Building

5.       Duringimplementation,the project will aim for: (i) awareness inthe wider community about
                                                                  an
the project and its rules (target awareness 70% o fthe adult populationo fthe kelurahan); (ii)    well
functioning kelurahan organizations that are democratically elected and accountable to people; (iii)      well
functioning community groups that participate inplanning for development and use the kelurahan funds
for productive purposes; and (iv) local governments that are able to work with BKMs to implement
poverty alleviation programs.

6.       The community development and capacity building component will include the following
activities:

         (i)       an extended awareness raising or socialization process that will encourage communities
                   to discuss, through a series o f focus group discussions, the nature o f poverty intheir
                   kelurahan, how it should be addressed, and what i s required to deal adequately with
                   poverty (inthe form o f individual commitment, organization, resources, skills, etc);
         (ii)      assistance to the community to carry out a Community Self Survey (CSS) on poverty;
         (iii)     the formationlconfirmation o f an elected body o frepresentatives (Badan Keswadayan
                   Masyarakat or BKM) that i s accountable to the community at large and which will act on
                   behalf o f the community for poverty reduction;
         (iv)      the formulation o f a poverty oriented Community Development Plan(CDP) for the
                   kelurahan usinga participatory process and based on the results o f the CSS;
         (v)       organizing and assisting community groups (Kelompok Swadaya Masyarakat or KSM)
                   who will submit proposals to the BKMto utilize project resources and implement the
                   programs identified inthe CDP;
         (vi)      assistance to BKMs to form associations (BKMForums) and work collectively; and
         (vii)     building local government capacity to work with BKMs and the BKMForum.

1A.      Socialization, social interniediation and formalization of the BKM

7,       Socialization. Socialization, or awareness raising, will be intwo forms-socialization        to the
community about poverty and the need for a community organization to address poverty issues; and
socialization to all stakeholders (community, central & local government) about the project concept,
goals, values, and the rules of the game. Easy and dependable access to information regarding the goals
and rules o f the project i s critical to any community based development initiative. There will be a


                                                         28

separate budget for socialization and dedicated staff inthe consultant teams (NMC and OCs-see
Component 4) who will be in charge of socialization. Socialization will take place through a variety o f
means-the      media (radio shows, TV shows, newspaperslmagazines, press conferences), through
publications (posters, pamphlets and brochures), and through presentations about the project at
workshops, meetings, and focus group discussions at all levels o f the community and government. A
recent study under UPPl Phase 2 has demonstratedthat the most effective socialization strategy i s face-
to-face interactions, and the use o f existing community communicationmechanisms. Socialization
activities will therefore be targeted mainly at the community level, particularly booklets and brochures,
and monthly newsletters that will be distributed widely.

8.       Facilitation. Facilitators will be the key to socialization and raising awareness inthe
communities about poverty and the project. With over 1,700 kelurahans targeted, there will be about 700
facilitators hired by the project. Most will be required to have some experience or background in
community development, and will also be trained extensively through the project. A key goal o f the
socializationprocess will be to create greater accountability. Through socialization activities, facilitators
will assist communities, BKMs, and local governments to clearly lay out their respective roles and
responsibilities. An important factor inthese discussions will be ensuring that each knows the role it
plays in ensuring accountability of the BKMto communities

9.       Streiigtheiziiigthe organizational capacity of the coiiimuiiity. The social intermediation process
leadingup to the election of members to the BKM i s expected to take four to six months. In general, this
will include: (i)national and regional level public campaign, including use o f the TV, radio, pamphlets,
                    a
posters, etc.; (ii)orientation workshops at the provincial level; (iii) workshops at the city level; (iv) a
series o f "reflections" on the nature o f poverty, poverty alleviation and leadership at the kelurahanlevel
(see below); (v) Community Self Surveys; and (vi) identification and training of volunteers who would be
willing to work with project staff inimplementingthe project. Facilitatorswill work inteams (at least
four kelurahan facilitator for 10 kelurahan) and with other project staff and government officials at
various levels in organizing and facilitating these events.

10.      Experience from UPPl Phase 2 has demonstrated the value to the communities o f item (iv)
above-a     series o f "reflections", which give communities an opportunity to gather together to discuss
issues that are common to all, and alternative ways to address them. Inparticular, two types o f
"reflections" will be organized-reflections     on poverty and reflections on the structure o f community
level institutions that can address the problems.

         (i)       Reflectioizs on poverty. The project will facilitate a guidedprocess o f discussions through
                   whichcommunities will discuss the nature and causes o fpoverty intheir kelurahan,
                   identify existing resources in the community, and build consensus on how to strengthen
                   community capacity to overcome poverty. Once these are agreed, groups o f volunteers
                   will carry out a Community Self Survey to identify the poor intheir community (inUPPl
                   Phase 2, there has been tremendous enthusiasm for this activity with over 18,000
                   volunteers participating).
         (ii)     Rejections on commuizity institutions. These reflections will focus on assisting
                   communities to decide whether they wish to build a new community organization or
                   work with existing community organizations. Communities will be assisted inassessing
                   the capacity and ownership o f existing institutions and their suitability for implementing
                  UPP. InUPPl Phase 2, this exercise has been particularly useful inbringing together
                   different institutionsinthe community and evaluating each other's strengths and
                  weaknesses. IfCommunities choose to create a new organization, facilitators together
                  with trained volunteers, will guide the community on how to elect a kelurahan
                  organization (the BKM) that i s democratic, participatory and inclusive. This will be


                                                       29

                  followed by the notarization o f the BKMas a formal entity. Ifcommunities choose to
                 work through existing organizations, project staff will assist the communities to
                  determine whether that organization was elected democratically and in a participatory
                 manner, and determine if some positions may needto be re-elected or the structure o f the
                 organization modified or strengthened (hereafter, use o f the word BKMwill refer to
                 either newly elected organizations or existing ones that have been confirmed by
                 communities). In evaluating the kindo f institutions that will be best able to address
                 poverty, communities will be invited to discuss the kindo f qualities they would like to
                  see in these organizations. Under UPPl Phase2, communities across 1,300 kelurahan
                 have invariably chosen the following qualities in the leaders they have elected to BKMs:
                 trustworthy, just, and committed to serving their communities. The importance o f
                 ensuring that qualified women are considered for leadership inthe BKMwill also be
                 emphasized.

11.      Establishinerat of the coinnaiinity organization (BKM). Inorder to ensure that BKMmembers
will practice participatory decision-making and be accountable to communities, facilitators will pay
particular attention to assisting the community to develop bylaws for the BKM. The bylaws will be
developed through focus group discussions at the community level, which will, intum, raise the
awareness o f the community about the legal status, rights and responsibility o f the BKM. The by-laws
will include mechanisms such as publicizing o f audits, inter-kelurahan monitoring (where one kelurahan
organization visits and reports on others), mechanisms for recall and re-election o fnon-performing
members, and other forms o f reporting and accounting to communities. Each notarized BKMwill open a
bank account inits name, to which funds will be deposited to finance poverty reduction activities
according to a Community Development Plan (see below).

IB.      Preparation of n ConznzuizitvDevelomient Plan

12.      The first task o fthe BKMwill be to formulate a poverty-orientedCommunity Development Plan
(CDP) for the kelurahan. The CDP will be a medium temi (three year) plan, and will include a range o f
poverty alleviation activities, depending on the needs and priorities o f the community-from       revolving
funds for micro credit loans to small scale or tertiary level infrastructure to social services or other
innovative ideas that the community may have.

13,      Based on the results o f Community Self Survey, the BKMwill embark on a participatory
planning process to develop the CDP for the kelurahan. The CDP will take into account other non-
govemment, govemment and donor-funded programs that are on-going and planned at the kelurahan
level, and identify activities that could be financed with the resources allocated to the kelurahanunder the
project (incases where kelurahans already have development plans, the BKM and community members
would either re-validate or amend these and present these for funding such that new plans would not have
to be developed from scratch inevery kelurahan). Ownership o f the program by the community i s the
key to the success o fthe CDP.

14.      The CDP is expected to be a general document, outlining the basic goals and general direction
that communities want to take in addressingpoverty. For example, the participatory planning process and
community self-surveymay identify different types o f poor within the community, which would then
require a range o f solutions. The menu o f activities that may be proposedunder the CDP would be open,
and creative ideas would be encouraged (see Component Two, Kelurahan Grants, for details on activities
eligible for financing under the project). For the first year o f implementation, the CDP will identify a
more detailed poverty program.




                                                       30

15.      When complete, the CDP will be reviewedby senior project staff at the Kota level (Oversight
Consultants). The CDP will be reviewed not for the content, but for the process usedin its formulation
and its focus on poverty. This will be done to ensure that the project staff do not influence the actual
decisions made by the community, but ensure that these decisions were made in an inclusive and
participatory manner. This will bejudged through the types and frequency of meetings held and an
assessment o f the effort placed in including all stakeholders, particularly the poor and vulnerable groups,
inthe community meetings and focus group discussions. Input from facilitators andvolunteers about the
CDP process in their kelurahan will also be sought.

1C.      Capacitv buildiizx for coiizmuiaities and local ~overiinients

16.      Capacity building will focus on three types o f activities-training    for project staff as well as for
communities; assistance for the formation and strengtheningo f federations o f BKMs at the city level
(BKMForum); and capacity buildingfor local governments.

17.      Training. The project is widely dispersed geographically and relies on many implementers.
Thus, training will be key to effective implementation. The following lessons have been learned on how
to best manage training under UPP: (i)     training should be designed to support particular components or
project objectives; (ii)  training should be provided on a continuous basis (e.g., refresher courses)
throughout the life o f the project; (iii)the training program should have sufficient flexibility to address
needs arising during implementation, rather than beingpre-identified; (iv) sufficient budget needs to be
allocated for training; and (v) training events geared for communities should be organized on location
(within the kelurahan) for efficiency and to optimize the coverage o fparticipants. While training for
communities under UPPl and UPP2 was placed under the budget o f the Oversight Consultants, it was
found that it i s more effective to allocate the majority o f the community training budget to the facilitator
teams.

18.      Based on these lessons, a training strategy and program has been designed for UPP3 in support o f
each project component. Seven types o f training will be carried out as laid out inthe table below. Some
o f these will be offered as a one time training course, some will be repeated, and for some, advanced
refresher courses provided. A detailed training matrix, indicating specific training activities, frequency,
and target audience i s provided in Annex 20.




 2. Awareness raising (about poverty NMC, OC, facilitators         Community at large and all stakeholders
     & aboutthe project)                                           (government, consultants, etc.)
 3. Training in leadership              Special Training Group/ BKM and community cadres
                                        outsourcingto experts
 4. Project cycle training              NMC, OC, facilitators      BKM,KSM,UPK, PjOK, Community Cadres
 5. Specific skills training            Outsourcing to experts  I  BKM,KSM,UPK, PjOK, Community Cadres,
                                                                   facilitators
 6. Reflections on best practices      INMC,OCs                    BKM,KSM,UPK, PjOK, Community Cadres,
     (every 3-4 months)                                         I1 facilitators




19.      The majority o f the training modules have already beenprepared for UPP2 by the Project
Preparation Team o f the P M U (same team for both UPP2 and UPP3). Many o f these have been tested,



                                                        31

and it i s clear these new modules are more effective than those usedinUPPl. This team will carry out a
Training o f Trainers exercise for the National Management Consultant team (NMC) about the project and
i t s implementation. They will also train a Special Training Group (individuals from NGOs, academic
institutions, civil society, UPPl and UPP2 best performer) to train communities about leadership. These
training sessions will use field experiences from UPPl and UPP2, and will utilize practitioners to the
extent possible. The N M C will, intum, train the Oversight Consultant teams (OCs). The OCs, with
assistance o f the above-mentioned trainers, will train the facilitators based on standardized training
modules prepared by the Preparation Team. Thus, the N M C and OC will directly carry out training
regarding project implementation and the project cycle; the Special Training Group will carry out the
training on leadership; and the N M C and OC will hire experts from NGOs, academic institutions, and the
private sector to implement specific skills training. A series o f audio-visual products o f best perfonning
BKMshavebeen developed under UPPl and 2, including a documentary video o fthe various steps under
the project have been prepared to help improve the quality o f training. This is expected to significantly
improve the quality of training under UPP3. Of particular importance will be training to support the
revolving funds that BKMsmay choose to run. As explained in Annex 16, training will be offered to: (i)
BKMmembers and the unitincharge ofrunningthe fund inrevolving fund management; (ii)community
groups who will borrow the funds (KSMs) in group organization and dynamics; and (iii)        KSMs inbasic
businessmanagement skills.

20.       Streiigtlzerzirzgfederations of BKMs (BKM Forunzs). The project will encourage and support
BKMsto form networks or federations at the kecamatan andKota levels to share ideas, exchange
experiences, and where they desire, to take collective action regardingpoverty alleviation in their
communities. They can also choose to act collectively to influence local govemment planning and
investment decisions. Under UPP1, various levels o f BKMForums were formed organically (at the
kecamatan level, at the kota level as well as inter-city gatherings o f BKM forums). These have proved to
be valuable for strengthening BKMs,improving accountability and giving communities a voice in
development issues. UPP3 will support the foimation o f BKMForums and provide training and technical
assistance to them to work collectively. This will include training inleadership, management and
networking. Technical assistance through the OCs and N M C will continue to be provided to the BKM
Forumuntilthe end o f the project.

21,       Capacity buildingfor local governiizertts, The central government has embarked on the
development of long-term strategy for poverty alleviation (PRSP) and it sees UPP as a vehicle for the
implementation o f the PRSP. Inaddition, the central government now expects all local governments to
prepare Regional Poverty Alleviation Strategies (WAS) at the city level, and had indicated a clear role
for UPP inthe development o f the W A S as well. To coordinate these activities at the city level,
govemment policy i s to establish multi-sectoral Poverty Alleviation Committees (KPK) at the city level,
to be chaired by BupatiNlialikota. The main interlocutor for UPP3 at the local government level will be
these KPKs, who will be involved in the project from the beginning.

22,       Capacity building activities will focus on: i)raising the awareness o f the KPK on poverty
alleviation through a series o f interactions with the community by means o f visits to BKMs,meetings
with community volunteers, and participation in community focus group discussions; ii)providing them
with training inparticipatoryplanning, community development and budgeting; and iii)enabling local
governments to work with BKMs and BKMForums, particularly in the implementation o f the Poverty
Alleviation Partnership Grant. A special training program will be designed to systematically transfer
learning gained duringproject implementation. It i s expected that through the participatory preparation,
and through implementation o f the PAPG in particular, local government agencies will see the value in
working with community organizations and buildup their capacity to engage in a more efficient working
relationship. Because the K P K will be an established government entity, building their capacity to work

with communities will ensure that they can continue to support BKMsand BKMforums and work on
other poverty issues beyond the life o f the project.


Project Component 2 USS93.8 million
                          -
KelurahanGrants

2A.      Funding allocations

23.      Each participating kelurahan will be allocated a grant, the value o f which depends on the size o f
the population (see table below). This will be usedto finance poverty alleviation activities as defined in
the Community Development Plans (CDPs). Those BKMs that perform particularly well may receive
additional grants o f up to Rp. 150 million to carry out additional activities under the CDP once their first
allocation has been disbursed. This second allocationwill only be provided to those BKMthat meet
certain "maturity criteria" that have been established in the project manual.

                              Population                         Size of allocation
                  <3000 people
                  3000 - 10,000 people                    Rp.200 million (US$ 23,550)
                                                          Rp.300 million (US$ 35,300 )
                  >10,000 people                          Rp.500 million (US$ 58,800)

24.      To take into account the fact that there mightbe variations inthe concentration o f poor within
kelurahan, and in order to benefit the poor more, these allocations may be adjusted according to the
following: if there are 300-1,000 poor households in kelurahan with less than 3,000 people, the allocation
will be Rp.250 million; and ifthere are more than 1,000 poor households inkelurahan with 3000-10,000
people, the allocation will be Rp.500 million. Because o f the relatively high cost o f living inMaluku and
Papua, the minimumallocation for these areas i s Rp.300 million. The ceiling amount o f Rp.500 million
(US$58,800) i s slightly higher than in UPP2 mainly due to the higher cost o f living in these areas and to
accommodate inflation.

25.      Once the BKMhas been formalized (notarized with the legal status o f an association), and the
Community Development Plan has been approved, the BKMwill sign a Grant Implementation
Agreement with the government (PjOK kecamatan) which will lay out the respective roles and
responsibilities o f the two parties, the terms o f disbursement, as well as the expectations regarding the use
o f funds beyond the project life.

2B.      Conziniinitv Developnzerit Plan and eligible activities

26.      For each participating kelurahan, this component will finance specific sub-projects. Funds can be
usedaccording to the Community DevelopmentPlan (CDP), and will cover a range o fpoverty alleviation
activities with an open menu. There would be a simple negative list of items that cannot be funded
including: (i) expenditures intendedfor a military or paramilitary purpose; (ii) works for
                                                                                    civil
government administrationor religious purposes; (iii)activities that relate to the manufacture or use o f
environmentally harmful products (including pesticides, ozone-depleting substances, tobacco or tobacco
products, materials containing asbestos, activities producing liquid or gaseous effluents or emissions at
harmful levels, arms and drugs); (iv) activities using, producing, storing or transporting hazardous
materials and wastes; (v) activities related to logging; (vi) activities inprotected areas; (vii) activities
related to fisheries that are not in accordance with standards set by the Borrower's Fishery Service
Agency; and (viii) the financing o f government salaries.




                                                        33

27.      The cost o f activities to be financed under the CDP doesnot have to be limited to the project
allocation for the kelurahan. Ifcommunities wish to carry out more activities, they will be encouraged to
contribute their own funds to supplement the allocationor leverage additional funds from other
community sources or local governments. As part o fthe three-year CDP, the BKMwill identify an
investment plan for the first year that would be fundedpartially (or completely) through the BKM
allocation from the project. Communities would have freedom to choose whether they want to use their
allocation to finance grant activities for the poor or use part o f the allocationto provide micro credit
loans.

28.      It is expected that CDPs will generally includethe following types o f activities:

    (i)       pre-identified specific investments that are a community priority by consensus (these could
              be a bridge, a road, school repair, healthfacility repair or others);
    (ii)      activities that community groups can compete for (any range o f physical infrastructure to
              services sub-projects-the    CDP should indicate clearly what are the priority sectors or
              priority groups for that community that are likely to be financed);
    (iii)     micro credit loans for community groups which will form the basis o f a revolving fund (with
              clear rules/principles for implementation); and
    (iv)      grant assistance to the poorest or most vulnerable individuals (this could include scholarships,
              home improvements, health care, etc., to specific individuals identifiedby communities as
              being most needy).

29.      The CDP can identify activities from all four categories or just one category, depending on the
communities' circumstances and needs. Category (iv) (grant assistance to individuals), will be limited to
10% o f the allocation in order to minimize leakage. Activities under categories (i), and (iv) are
                                                                                         (ii),
expected to be provided as grants, while activities under (iii)   would consist o f micro credit loans through
a revolving fund mechanism. The ceiling for any single subproject per group (KSM)or micro credit loan
to a group (KSM) i s Rp.30 million (US$3,550 equivalent).

2C.      Iinplenientation of kelurahan praizts

30.      Specific irzvestnients. If specific sub-projects are identified by communities as a priority for the
    .
overall community, the BKM will appoint a team from the community to implementthis activity. The
following implementation process will be followed:
         Team fills out a standard fonn, with the assistance o f facilitators, outlining a description o f the
         sub-project, costs, beneficiaries, operations and maintenance arrangements (where applicable),
    .    compliance with any applicable safeguards, implementation arrangements, the amount o f self
         financing, etc., (see Annex 15 for sample form).
         Review by OC for feasibility, technical soundness, and compliance with safeguards (specifically
         environmental impacts, land acquisition/resettlement, impact on indigenous people and on
         cultural property).
    ..
    .    Signing o f ImplementationAgreement betweenimplementing team and BKM.
         Disbursement to team for implementationcosts.
         Sub-project implementation according to procurement guidelines with supervision by BKMand
         OC/facilitator  .
         Completion certificate by OC/facilitator.

3 1.     Conipetitive grantproposals. The CDP may provide an allocation o f funds to finance proposals
by community groups. Inthis case, the CDP will lay out clearly what the priority areas/sectors/groups are
for this allocation. Examples o f different types o f activities that groups could propose for funding include
basic infrastructure services; programs for children and youth; family planning education, etc.


                                                       34

Community groups will identify sub-projects they want financed, and fill out proposal forms (same as the
ones above) with the help o f facilitators where necessary. These will be reviewedby OCs for feasibility,
technical soundness and compliance. OCs will specifically screen proposals for environmental impacts,
land acquisitioniresettlement, impact on indigenous people and on cultural property, and ensure that
adequate mitigation measures are taken. The BKMwill meet to review the proposals first when at least 5
proposals have been submitted, and at least monthly thereafter. The selection o f proposals by the BKM
will be made ina meetingpublicized inadvance and open to the public. Selection will bebasedon
priorities by clearly ranking proposals and having an open vote. Implementationwill follow the same
arrangement as above.

32.      Revolvingfwtds. If BKMdecides to runa revolving fund, specific guidelines have been
                               the
developed to ensure that funds are usedin accordance with best practices, and apply principles such that
there is no distortion o f the micro finance market. Details for revolving fund management, group
formation, proposal selection, and terms and conditions for loans are provided inAnnex 16.

33.      Grant assistance to thepoorest or most viiliierable iitdividiials. Direct assistance may be
provided to individuals ifidentified duringthe participatory process and included inthe CDP. These will
be accounted for clearly inthe BKMaccounts, and disbursements made ina transparent manner, A
maximum o f 10% of the allocation to the BKMcan be used to finance activities that fall under this
category. Facilitators and OCs will verify use o f these funds.

20.      Disbursements

34.      Fundswill be releasedto kelurahan organizations inthree tranches to ensure proper funduse and
management, and encourage better BKMperformance. The first tranche (20%) will be paid upon review
o f the CDP by project staff. The next tranche (50%) will be based on proof o f adequate utilization o f
funds for implementation of sub-projects according to the CDP, and proper fundmanagement, and will be
released at least four months after the disbursement o f the first tranche. This i s to provide enough time to
see implementation on the ground prior to disbursement o f additional funds (particularly if funds will be
used for micro credit loans). The third and final tranche (30%) will be provided also at least four months
after the disbursement of the second tranche, and following a review to assess the future o f the BKM
beyondproject life (see Annex 7, Chart 1).

PovertyAlleviationPartnership Grant

35.      This fund will encourage partnerships between local government and communities and attempt to
institutionalize a consultative process between the two for future activities undertaken by local
governments using their own funds. I t will finance poverty alleviation activities that are too bigto be
financed by the kelurahan grants, or that require local government involvement (e.g., networked
infrastructure or operations and maintenance); and that cover more than one kelurahan.

3A.      DesiEii Priiiciples

36.      Basic principles guiding the Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant (PAPG) are the following: (i)
local governments (kotaikabupaten) will be required to compete for funds; (ii) will be provided for
                                                                                   funds
sub-projects on a matching fund principle to complement resources from local government agencies
(dinases), from communities and possibly from private sponsors; (iii)    subprojects to be financed must be
jointly prepared, proposed and implementedby BKMsin collaboration with dinases; (iv) subprojects
should be for public goods and services providing direct benefits to a large number o f the poor




                                                     35

community; and (v) there should be transparent competitive selection o f subprojects by an independent
PAPG Selection Committee.

37.       Initial experiences with PAF'G under UPP2 have yielded positive results-BKMs         were given
accesses to dinas' programs to enable them to propose subprojects; dinases have assigned staff to work
with BKMsinpreparing subproject proposals; and PAPG Selection Committees comprising
representatives from local government, BKMs and the private sectors have been successfully formed.
However, most activities identifiedremain conmunity level activities that do not require significant local
government involvement. Therefore, the full benefits o f PAPG are not yet being reaped.

38.       A number o f design changes have been adopted inthis component with the following objectives:
(i) involvelocalgovernmentsmoreintheUPPprogramasawhole(andnotjustintheimplementation
    to
o f the PAPG component) so that they have a better sense o f the larger vision o f UPP; and (ii)  to affiliate
the PAPG component with a specific local government structure. These changes have beenpossible due
to recent developments within govemment. As mentionedunder Component 1, the central government
sees UPP as a vehicle for the implementationo f its long-termPoverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP). In
addition, the central government now expects all local governments to prepare Regional Poverty
Alleviation Strategies (RPAS) at the city level, and has indicated a clear role for UPP in the development
o f the W A S as well. To coordinate these activities at the city level, government policy i s to establish
multi-sectoral Poverty Alleviation Committees (Komite Pengetasan Kemiskinan or KPK) at the city level.

39.       Taking into account these developments, the following design changes have been incorporated
into this component: (i) will be affiliated with established KPKs; (ii) KPK will be involved in
                            PAPG                                                 the
the process o f BKMformation from the beginning and will participate intraining programs and
socialization activities; and (iii) this component will supp.ort KPKs indevelopingRPAS through technical
assistance. To ensure ownership o f UPP inall local governments, the project will provide technical
support for the above to all local govemments participating inthe project inthe first year o f project
implementation. K P K members and other local government staff will be encouraged to attend training
and to participate in community level activities for the formation o f the BKMs, development o f CDPs,
etc. It i s expected that, this systematized learning-by-doing exercise will set the basis for local
governments and communities to work together to prepare a participatory Regional Poverty Alleviation
Strategy, The WAS will provide the framework for investments that can be:financed under the PAPG.

3B.       Selection of ParticipntinaKota/kabuaaten

40.       Although all local governments participating in the project will receive technical assistance to
work with KPKs and develop the RPAS, only forty local governments will be selected to receive
investment funds under PAPG. These cities will be selected on a competitive basis by the central Project
Secretariat (with support from the Project Management Unit and the National Management Consultants)
based on the following criteria: (i)   the extent o f participation o f the KPWother local government staff in
the first year o fproject activities; (ii)
                                         agreement to follow the rules o f the PAPG; (iii) establishment o f an
independent PAPG Committee under the purview o f KPK; (iv) provision o f operational costs from city
budget; (v) completion o f the RPAS; and (vi) the existence o f a functioning and active BKMForum.
Initially, 20 local governments will be selected, with 20 additional cities selected in the subsequentyear.

3C.       Fiiizdina Allocations

41,       The PAPGwill be a three-year program for each participating city with gradual increases in the
annual allocations as presented in the table below. Participation inthe subsequent years would be
determined based on satisfactory performance. The criteria for evaluating performance includes: (i)




                                                         36

adherence to PAPG procedures; and (ii) o f partnership between dinases and BKMs. Most local
                                           degree
governments will be eligible to receive PAPG funds as grants from the central govemment.

                                       Year 1           Year 2         Year 3             TOTAL

 Large cities (>25 BKMs)             Rp 2 billion    Rp 2.5 billion  Rp 3 billion       Rp 7.5 billion


30.      Elipible Activities

42.      There will be an open menufor activities eligible for financing under the PAPG, with a short
negative list (the same as the negative list for kelurahan grants). The following criteria have to be met:
(i) areproposedbyasponsoringdinasincollaborationwithBKMs;(ii)theimpactoftheactivity
   they
affects more than just the one kelurahan; and (iii)it benefits a large number o f poor. Activities could
include basic infrastructure works that go beyond one kelurahan(such as roads or drains, or refurbishment
of existing schools or clinics that serve more than one kelurahan); skills training that would benefit more
than one kelurahan; non-formal education and health etc. This list is not restrictive and creative ideas
from communities and dinases will be encouraged. Many dinases may already be carrying out these
programs currently and, by collaboratingwith communities, they will be able to access PAPGfunds to
expand the programs. Counterpart funding from private sponsors may also be sought whenever possible.

3E.      The PAPG Selection Coninzittee

43,      The Local Government will establish a PAPG Selection Committee under the purview o f the
KPK that will be responsible for evaluating PAPGproposals on a competitive basis (the K P K itself is not
expectedto be directly involved ineither the verification o fproposals, disbursement or implementation).
The PAPG Selection Committee will be legally established by a decree from the Walikota/Bupati after
selection o f its members through a series o f city level meetings. Inthe selection o f proposals, the PAPG
Committee will operate as a collective body and no member will have special privileges. The PAPG
Committee will consist of representatives from the BKMForum, from the local govemment; and from
NGOs or other prominent citizens who are concerned about poverty. The committee will work on a
voluntary basis, but its operational costs will be supported by the local government's counterpart
contributionsto the project. A secretariat for facilitating the work o f the PAPG will be formed at the
KPK secretariat.

44.      OCs will support the overall process of selection o f the PAPG Committee and its functions. In
order to help the KPK review proposals, the Oversight Consultants will carry out field verifications.
However, the OCs will not be allowed to change proposals or decide on winning proposals. Final
decisions on funded proposals will be publicized. After completion of the subprojects, the PAPG
committee will carry out an evaluation to select the best subprojects for awards o f excellence. Duringthis
process, OCs will ensure that the learning generated i s shared with the K P K on regular basis.

3F.      Subproject Proposals

45,      Selection criteria for sub-project proposals include: (i) level o f partnerships as measured by
                                                                   the
the number o f kelurahan organizations and local govemment agencies forming a partnership to propose
the subproject; (ii) level o f contributions bythe kelurahanorganizations, private sponsors and local
                    the
govemment agencies (minimumo f 50%) towards the subproject cost; and (iii)        expected achievements o f



                                                       37

the subproject towards poverty alleviation. A subproject proposal can only cover one specific activity.
BKMsmay submit different proposals incollaboration with different dinases. The proposal can be at any
cost, with a financing plan o f no more than 50% from PAPG funds, and another 50% from the dinas'
development budget, BKMs and private sponsors. Proposals with highlevels o f contributions from these
other sources will be considered more favorably as this would be an indication o f how important the
activity i s for both the local government and the community. Support from PAPG for individual
proposals will range from a minimumo f Rp. 30 million (US$3,550) to a maximum o f Rp. 200 million
(US$23350) per sub-project.

46.      Because proposals will be madejointly with technical agencies o f local govemment, the designs
and technical specifications will be in accordance with govemment standards. Where necessary,
simplifiedtechnical manuals for small-scale infrastructure that have been developed and tested under the
Kecamatan Development Project may also be used.

3G.      Inlpleiiientatioiz and Disbursement Arranrrenzents

47.      The PAPG allocation to the local govemment will bemade through the regular govemment
budgetingprocess to the planning agency (Bappeda) o f the participating Kota. The Bappeda will appoint
a PjOK (administrative manager) to administer the allocations. Once approved by the PAPG committee,
an implementation agreement will be signed between the PjOK and the representatives o f the proposing
dinas and BKMs. They would then be requiredto establish ajoint team to implement the subproject (see
Annex 7, Chart 3).

48.      Disbursementso f PAPG funds from the project Special Account will be made at the request o f
thejoint team as approved by the PjOK, and will be provided intwo equal tranches. Funds from other
sources, either from dinases, BKMs, community members or private sponsors, may be handled separately.
Inorder to ensure that counterpart contributions materialize as proposed, the conditions for the second
payment will include evidence that at least an amount equal to the project funds have been spent on
implementingthe sub-project and this has been verified by the OCs.

49.      Procurement and use o f P U G funds will have to follow the procedures set in the manual. All
procurement decisions will be taken by the team, which will be held accountable to both the local
government and communities through the dinas, BKMs and other contributors. After completion, the
joint implementation team will prepare a completion repoi-t, which represents its accountability for
implementation. This report will be presented to the PAPG Committee, PjOK and OCs and will also be
made available for public scrutiny.

ImplementationSupport

50.      The project will be managed by the Project ManagementUnit (PMU) assisted by an
administrative unit (PIMPRO). Both can be headedby the same Project Manager. The PMU will hire
consultants and facilitators to assist in project implementation, particularly since this type o f a community
drivenproject will require extensive presence in the field at the kelurahanand kotakabupaten levels.

                               Annex 6: ImplementationArrangements
                             INDONESIA: Third Urban Poverty Project

1.       The Ministry of Regional Settlements and Infrastructure (Kimpraswil) has developed significant
institutional capacity for implementing UPP through its experience with UPPl and UPP2 so far. As
mentioned in the main text, the Govemment sees UPP as a nationalprogram and has taken measures to
ensure consistency of approaches and policies, and to manage UPP as a program, rather than as a series o f
individual projects with individual PMUs. Key measures include capturing all data into one integrated
Management Information System for all three projects; usingthe same National Management Consultant
team; and applying the same socialization and training program. The P M U will also be restructured from
a specific project management unit into a program management unit covering all three projects (see
below).

2.       Important lessons have been leamed intenns o f how best to structure the consultant teams,
facilitators and volunteers supporting project implementation, and how to structure training to maximize
the effectiveness o fthe implementers. These have been incorporated inthe implementation
arrangements. By the time UPP3 becomes effective, UPP1 will be largely completed and experienced
staff from UPPl will be available for implementation o f UPP3. This will substantially reduce the time
required to familiarize and train project staff inthe UPP concept, and thereby facilitate implementation of
UPP3*

A. ImplementationStructure

3.       Project Management Uiait. As mentioned above, UPP will be managed as a program, and,
therefore, the same Project Management Unit (PMU) that i s in charge o f UPPl and 2, under the
Directorate General o f Human Settlements inthe Ministry o f Settlement and Regional Infrastructure
(Kimpraswil), will be in charge o f managing this project. To allow for better program management and
coordination, the organizational level o f P M U will be raised a higher administrative level than the
existing PMU. In addition to this PMU, the DG for Settlements and Housing o f MSRI, as a coordinator
for poverty alleviation for the Ministry,will be also be supported by the project to develop capacity for
coordination and integration of the other community based poverty alleviation programs inthe Ministry.
This is expected to stream line all the community basedpoverty program o f the Ministry. The P M Uwill
be assisted by an administrative unit (PIMPRO). Under the Project Manager, there will be three sub-
sections, for UPP1, UPP2 and UPP3, respectively. The P M U will hire consultants and facilitators to
assist inproject implementation, particularly since this type o f a community driven project will require
extensive presence inthe field at the kelurahan and kota/kabupaten levels (see Chart 1).

4.       Expert Team. Because the government sees UPP as a long-termnational poverty alleviation
program, it needs to ensure consistency o f approach among all the UPPs. The govemment i s also keen to
ensure that the learningtaking place on the ground will be systematically captured and fed into policies
and the decision making process. Some individuals will, therefore, be recruited under the P M U to form
an Expert Team. In addition to the above functions, this team will serve as resource persons for all
consultants and facilitators, and they will be expected to continue to enhance the project concept based on
experiences on the ground, and to adjust the project manuals and procedures as required.

5.       National Manageiiieiit Consultants (NMC). The P M U will utilize the existing National
Management Consultants (NMC) at the central level to assist with project management, monitoring and
reporting. There will be thematic teams inthe N M C incharge of micro credit activities, grant activities,
training/socialization/ capacity building, PAPG activities, project monitoring and reporting, and




                                                      40

complaint handling. The N M C will supervise the work of the Oversight Consultants at the provincial and
district (kota/kabupaten) levels.

6.       Oversight Coizsultarzt T e a m (OC). There will be one Oversight Consultant team designated for
every province 100-150 kelurahans, with technical teams for every participating Kota and kabupaten. At
theprovincial level, there will be a provincial coordinator and staff in charge o f micro credit activities,
community development (including socialization and training), project monitoring (including MIS), and
Public Relations/complainthandling. Other expertise will be recruitedlcontracted out on an as-needed
basis. The provincial OC team will work with a provincial Coordination Team assigned by the
government (with the planning agency, Bappeda Province) to coordinate project activities at the
provincial level.

7.       At the kota/kabupatetzlevel, there will be one KotaKabupaten Coordinator and a small group of
technical staff. For Kota that i s selected for the PAPG, there will be at least one staff inthe team to
manage the PAPG. The OC teams will be in charge of: (i)          coordination, support and supervision o f
kelurahan facilitators; (ii)technical assistance to the BKMs and community groups (KSMs); (iii)
consolidationo f reports from facilitators into kota reporting; (iv) promoting the PAPG and facilitating the
partnerships between BKMs and dinases; (v) facilitating the establishment o f the PAPG Selection
Committee; and (vi) sub-project verification and oversight. The Kota level OC team will work with a
Coordination Team assigned by the local government (with the local level planning agency, Bappeda) to
coordinate project activities. The Coordination Team will include an assigned PjOK who will sign off on
sub-project proposals under the PAPG. OC teams will be procuredby the PMU, with the participation o f
provincial govemment in the selection process, and will report directly to the NMC.

8.       Keluraharzfacilitators. Facilitators will be key to the implementation o f the project since they
will be the primary interface between the project and communities. Facilitators will be in charge o f
promoting the project within the kelurahan, carrying out the community development activities, assisting
inthe process of electionof the kelurahan organization, organizing the community into groups and
assisting with proposal preparation, etc. Learning from the experience o fUPP1, instead o f having one
facilitator for every kelurahan, there will be facilitator teams, with 4 kelurahan facilitators for every 10
kelurahan. Working inteams will enable facilitators to support each other in a more integrated manner, to
share experiences betweenkelurahan, and bringin greater quality control. One facilitator will have
higher qualifications and be designated the Senior Facilitator to lead the team. The teams may be larger
according to the size o f the kelurahans and their remoteness. At least 1/3 will be women, and they will be
required to reside inthe kotas where they work. At the kelurahaddesa level, facilitators will coordinate
with the Lurah or the Kepala Desa. Facilitatorswill be hiredby Oversight Consultantteams and report
directly to them (the cost o f hiring facilitators i s included under Component One, Community
Development and Capacity Building, as the cost o f social intermediation).

9.       Conzrnunity volunteers (cadres). Learning from the UPP1Phase2 experience, muchmore
emphasis will be paid to engaging community cadres, or volunteers from the kelurahan, to work closely
with the kelurahan facilitator duringthe course o f the project. InUPPl Phase 2, there are over 18,000'
cadres who have volunteered to work with the project without any financial incentive. Similar numbers
will be encouraged for UPP3 and additional budget (more than inUPP2) will be allocated for training
cadres to support the facilitators' work. At the end o f the project, it i s expected that these community
cadres will continue to facilitate and promote the interests o f the poor with the BKM.

B. Project Staging

10.      The project will be implemented intwo stages. The first stage will cover community building
and kelurahan grant components inall provinces. The second stage covers the PAPG component. OCs
will support BKMs inall project areas for four years, gradually decreasing the level o f support duringthe
third year and fourth years. For the PAPG, technical support will be provided to all local governments in
the first year. Inthe second year, 20 cities will be competitively selected to receive PAPG funds. An
additional 20 cities will be selected inthe subsequent year.

C. Monitoring and Evaluation

11.      A similar approach to UPP2 will be taken for monitoring and evaluation o fUPP3. Evaluation
Consultants independent from the N M C will be hiredto carry out the evaluation but monitoring will be
retained as an essential role of the N M C and OCs. Because there are three UPPs in operation at the same
time, a team will be set up within the P M Uto integrate and synchronize the Management Information
System. The Evaluation Consultants will be hired on a periodic basis, first to carry out a baseline survey,
and subsequently to carry out follow up surveys and evaluation studies at least three times over the
project period. There will also be an allocation o f funds to hire local NGOs, universities or qualified
individuals to carry out ad-hoc evaluations or surveys on an as-needed basis. Details on project
monitoring and performance evaluation are provided inAnnex 3.

               Annex 7: FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements
                             INDONESIA: Third Urban PovertyProject


1. Summaryofthe FinancialManagementAssessment


Projects (UPP1 - Cr.3210 and UPP2 - Cr3658/Ln. 4664). The existing projects have satisfied the Bank's
This project will use a similar financialmanagement system as the one usedinthe existing UrbanPoverty

minimumfinancial management requirement as stipulated inOP/BP 10.02. The Management
Information System (MIS) under UPP1has been improved and includes financial reporting aspects and
related standards and formats for the project financial statements. The same MIS used for UPP2 will be
used for UPP3. Duringappraisal o f UPP2, a review o f the M I S confirmed that the system would enable
the P M U to apply FMR-based disbursement.

Given the current decentralized environment, studies such as the CFAA and Fiduciary Review indicate
that the country i s a highrisk regarding public financial management. The project will mitigate this risk
intwo ways: (i)    greater accountability by and to communities by having participatory planning o f
subprojects at the community level and implementationby locally elected community organizations
(BKMs); and (ii)   provision o f technical assistance, support and oversight to each BKM. Inorder to
ensure that communities and the public will have control over project implementation, the project will set
mechanisms for accountability and transparency, which are included in the manual, and ensure that
project rules are adequately enforced. The overall control risk is therefore assessed as moderate.

2. Audit Arrangements

The Project ManagementUnit (same as the one incharge o fUPPl and UPP2) will prepare and produce
consolidated project accounts. Independent auditors acceptable to the Bank will carry out the audit for
the project accounts, including the Special Accounts. The annual audit reports will be furnished to the
Bank no later than six months after the end o f the govemment fiscal year. The P M U has agreed to
appoint BPKP to audit the project in accordance with the Terms o f Reference for the audit o f special
purpose financial statements, with a similar TOR to the one for UPPl and UPP2. The auditor will also
audit the attainment of objectives according to the agreed performance indicators. There are no
outstanding Audit Reports under UPPl or UPP2.

Inaddition EachBKMwill berequiredto prepare a financial statement and appoint public accountants or
eligible institutions (such as the accounting department o f a university for kotas or kabupatens that do not
have adequate qualified public accounting firms) to audit the BKM'sbooks. The Terms o f Reference for
BKMaudits that have been agreed upon and usedinUPPl and UPP2 will be used inUPP3. During
implementation, OCs will assist BKMs to select the firm. The audit fee will be financed by BKM.

3. DisbursementArrangements

FZow of Funds. The PMUwill be responsible for the administration process o f consultants (NMC, OCs
and EvaluationConsultants) that are hired centrally. PjOKs at the sub-district (kecamatan) level will be
responsible for the administration process on the kelurahan grants, while PjOKs at the district
(kota/kabupaten) will be responsible for the Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant (PAPG). PMU/PjOKs
will submit payment requests (SPP) to the relevant Treasury Office (KPKN) o f the Ministryo f Finance
(MOF) at the district level. K P K N will issue payment remittance orders (SPM) to their respective bank
that will transfer the money to the intendedbeneficiaries and make the arrangement to debit the project
special account (see figure below).


                                                       45

Kelurahan Grants. The first withdrawal on the kelurahan grants (20%) will be supported by a Grant
Implementation Agreement signed by the PjOK and the BKM, and an approved Community
Development Plan as verified   by the OC. For the second tranche (50%), withdrawal will be supported by
evidence o f adequate financial management by the BKMand implementationprogress in accordance with
the CDP (as verified by the OC). Withdrawal for the third tranche (30%) will be based o n a review o f the
BKM'ssustainability and implementationprogress.

Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grants. The first withdrawal (50%) will be made upon signing o f the
Implementation Agreement between the PjOK and the BKMs and the Dinas. The second tranche (50%)
will be based on a satisfactory progress report and evidence o f the use of counterpart funds o f at least an
equal amount as the project disbursement.

Accounting and reporting. The accounting system and procedures at the central level (PMU)will follow
the government accounting system. At the BKMlevel, expenditures made by the BKMwill be accounted
for in a simple report. The specific accounting procedures will be included inthe project manual. The
PMU,PjOK, BKMs andjoint BKMIDinasteams will maintain separate accounting records on a cash
basis.

At the kelurahan level, the BKM(withthe help o f the facilitator) will prepare and submit a financial
report and progress report to the OC (kotaidistrict level) on a monthly basis. The OCs who will submit
them electronically to the PMUthrough the M I S in a timely manner will summarize these reports. Based
on these M I S reports, the PMUwill consolidate all the information from all project unitsat the district
and kelurahan levels into a Financial Monitoring Report (FMR) consisting o f a financial report, progress
report, and procurement report, using similar formats used inUPPl and UPP2. The FMR will be
submitted to the Bank within 30 days after the end o f each quarter, along with a withdrawal application to
replenish the project special account through Directorate General o f Budget o f the MOF.

Special Account. GO1will establish a Special Account (SA) at Bank Indonesia or other
commercial bank denominated inUS dollars, under the name o f the Directorate General of
Budget (DGB), Ministry of Finance. The DGB shall provide copies o f the weekly bank
statements o f the SA to the PMU. Disbursementto the Special Account would be for the six
months project expenditures, following the FMR-based disbursement procedures.

4. Allocation of Loadcredit Proceeds

The table below shows the allocation o f loadcredit proceeds by category and the disbursement
percentages for each category. The estimated disbursements per year and cumulative i s shown as part o f
the Project Financing Data elsewhere in the document (in the cover page). It i s based on the assumption

                              INDONESIA: Third Urban Poverty Project


EXECUTIVESUMMARY

1.       This is a third of a series o fUPP, and UPPl and UPP2 are under implementation. Through this
project the govemment intends to scale up this program to a national programwith national coverage.
The main intent through this project i s to add new locations. Thus the time frame o f this project will
overlap with UPP2 and the existing P M U for UPP2 will also manage this project.


    0    The overall procurement arrangements consist entirely o f (i)         Selection o f consultants; and (ii)
         Community ParticipationProcedures for sub-projects and grants. No N C B or I C B i s envisaged
         under the project. The main challenge in the selection o f consultants i s to select qualified
         consultants from the current pool, because familiarity with the project i s essential, and keep the
         costs low. Therefore, the selection procedures will follow mostly LCS. The project manual fixes
         the approach and methodology under the assignment and, thus, the consultants i s required only to
         provide the proper staffing. The cost estimates will be based on the average costs from the
         previous assignments under UPP 1 and 2.

2.       For procurement involving the community, the main challenge i s to have a "contract" with the
community for the delivery of certain outputs/products based on the agreed ceiling amounts and technical
specifications with a control mechanism. The control mechanism from within the community for
procurementprocesses (as currently applied under UPP 1 and 2) will be included in the project manuals.

3.       The overall management framework i s supported by the main consultants' contracts. The
P M U inJakarta will assign a National Management Consultants (NMC) to provide assistance for overall
project management, monitoring and reporting, including the supervision o f the Oversight Consultants
(OC). There will be OC at the regional level providing assistance to the community live1inpreparing
and implementingthe project, in addition to assessing the quality and readiness o f particular community
incarrying out the project. The contracts for the OCs will include the selection andhiringofkelurahan
facilitators and other training and socialization activities that are not included inthe NMC contract.
Evaluation consultants will also be hired to regularly provide input to the P M U on project implementation
and progress towards achieving its objectives. There will also be as many as five individual consultants
hired by the P M U as technical advisors. The consultant packages are shown inthe table below.

PROCUREMENT CAPACITY ASSESSMENT

4.       The last Country Procurement Assessment Report for Indonesia was carried out inFebruary
2000, with the final report being issuedin February 2001, after which a new Keppres 8012003 was issued
to replace Keppres 1812000. A detailed comparison and update betweenthe two Keppres was provided
separately inthe Procurement Capacity Assessment Report (PCAR), which was conducted particularly
for this project. The PCAR also resultedinthe following findings and recommendations:

5.       This is the thirdproject ina series o f similar projects. The following lessons have been drawn
from implementation o f UPP1and 2 with regardto procurement and have been taken into consideration
inthe designofUPP3:

         Communities carry out a considerable amount o f simple procurement. Their capacity needs to be
         improved. Recordkeepingrelated to handling o f procurement and complaints needs to be
         strengthened. Therefore, it i s proposed that under UPP3, a contract with communities be signed
         and agreed upfront to carry out certain assignments and activities. Unitrates should be agreed
         upfront, and the community will be responsible for technical delivery o f the agreed output. For
         this purpose, assistance should beprovided to the communities under the project.

         The P M U deals with a relatively small number o f large value consultant contracts. All the
         contracts were multiyear and in stages, and the selection process followed QCBS procedures.
         The resultwas that highcosts were observed inmany ofthe contracts. Effective price
         competition did not occur since, during the technical evaluation, there was always the possibility
         o f a firm getting significantly higher technical scores than others by proposing over-qualified
         staff (who also cost significantly more). To remedythis, it i s suggested that the selection method
         be adjustedto give more weight to the financial score, and ifpossible, follow QCBS procedures
         with a ceiling. The TOR should be re-written to clearly describe the assignment and expected
         outcome, and the estimated cost should be more carefully reviewed. In addition, there i s a need
         to expand the shortlist and ensure that only qualified firms are included. Ifnecessary, good,



                                                       52

         qualified firms from previous assignments should be identified and encouraged to participate.
         For thispurpose, a review ofperformance offirins under UPPl and 2 will be coizducted by the
         PMU and submitted to the Bankprior tofinalization of the shortlist.

    e    The National Management Consultant (NMC) was critical ingetting UPP1 and 2 moving on the
         right track. The qualifications and capability o f the N M C is extremely important to the success o f
         the project. Experience under UPPl and 2 demonstrated that not many firms have the kind o f
         experience and knowledge required for this contract. It i s anticipated that it would be difficult to
         come up with a large pool o f qualified shortlist or satisfactory technical proposals for the N M C
         contract from the existingpool in the country. On the other hand, this package i s not attractive to
         foreign firms since large numbers o f experts with local knowledge are required (however, foreign
         individuals with international experience may have added value as part o f the N M C team). The
         N M C selection process will be completed prior to loan effectiveness, using the Least Cost
         Selection procedures. With this kindo f arrangement, it is expected that the package could be
         procured more efficiently, and result in a better technical proposal and more qualified people at
         more reasonable costs to implement the project.

    e    There were significant procurement delays under UPPl and 2, especially at the start up o f the
         project. This was mostly due to delays in some administrative process in initiating the
         preparatory work for the selection process. It i s proposed that under UPP3, the procurement plan
         should be submitted and agreed upfront, and be strictly followed. In addition, there should be
         staff proficient inprocurement hired under the project that have the power to pushthe
         procurementprocess in a timely manner, so that the selection process can be initiated early
         enough. Delays in the budgetingprocess are a national issue, not only applicable to Bank
         financed projects. It would be difficult for the Bank to influence the improvement o f this process
         unless the disbursement o fproject funds can be made directly to the Project accounts, which
         would be unlikely inthis case. The only thing that may be possible would be to obtain a
         commitment from MOF, as part o f the Minutes o f Negotiation, to provide the budget ina timely
         manner.

6.       It is expected that the existing Project Management Unit (PMU) will manage UPP3 for UPPl and
2. Additional staff will be hired to work full time on UPP3 only. The TORSfor staffing will be the same
as the ones inprevious projects. The P M U will be fully staffed prior to loan effectiveness.

7.       Itwas also agreed that the existingUPP2 team would be employed for UPP3 to carry out
necessary project preparation work prior to the formal establishment o f the PMUPIMPRO for UPP3.
This includes the selection process for the National Management Consultants and the Oversight
Consultants (including preparingthe shortlist and issuing the RFP). It i s expected that these consultants
will be hired prior to loan effectiveness.

8.       As National Competitive Bidding will not be applied for this Project, there i s no major conflict
with national procedures, including ones involving community participation. It was agreed that the
selection o f consultants would follow the Bank's Consultant Guidelines. With the effectiveness o f
Keppres 80/2003, it i s expected that the following actions will be more effectively implemented under the
project: (i) transparency inthe procurement process, including mandatory announcement o f award o f
contracts inthe public domain; (ii)   sanctions and enforcement against collusive practices, both for
consultantshidders and for the government officials; and (iii)    sanctions and enforcement against poor
performance o f consultantshidders. These requirements will be stated inthe project manuals. In
addition, the implementingagencies have an option to follow the "Pemilihan Langsung" procedures as
described inKeppres 8012003 to satisfy the Bank's shopping procedures, subject to clarifications which
will be included inthe project manuals.


                                                      53

9.      The preparation o f the General Guidelines and Technical Guidelineshas been initiated during
project preparation, and will serve as the project manuals. These basically will follow the existing
documents, with a few improvements to make them clearer, and include requirements on transparency
and enforcing sanctions against irregularities. The General Guidelines have been finalized, and the
Technical Guidelines will be finalized prior to effectiveness. These guidelines should include, but not be
limited to, all applicable procurement, procedures, and monitoring and reporting requirements.

10.     A training program on the project manuals, including on procurement, has beendeveloped and
approved by the Bank, and provided to all the project stakeholders. A special training program on
selection o f consultants will be provided to key project staff at the PMU.

11.     The Assessment found that the overall procurement risk is average. The prior review thresholds,
as indicated inthis Annex, are based on this capacity assessment.

A. Guidelines

12.     Procurement o f consultants follow on the Guidelinesfor Selection and Employment of
Consultants by WorldBank Borrowers dated May 2004 (the Consultant Guidelines). Procurement o f
works, goods, and related services funded wholly or partly by the World Bank inthis Project shall follow
the Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits datedMay 2004 (the Procurement
Guidelines).

B. Procurement Plan and StandardDocuments

13.     The agreed project Procurement Plan (including contracts with community) for the first 18
months o f the project will be agreed prior to negotiation, and will be included inthe PIP (Project
ImplementationPlan). The procurement plan will be updated annually, and should obtain the Bank's no
objection by the end of September for the following government fiscal year.

14.     The standard Request for Quotations (for works and goods), and the Bank's standard Requestfor
Proposals (RFP) and contracts for the selection o f consultants (July 1997, Revised April 1998 and July
1999 and March 2002) will be used The W P s required duringthe first year o f implementation were
agreed during appraisal.

C. Procurement of Subprojects under KelurahanGrants (US$93.8million equivalent, including
    contingenciesand overhead) and the Poverty AlleviationPartnershipGrants (US$64.9 million
    equivalent,includingcontingencies and overhead).

15.     About 70% of Bank financing will be for subproject proposals made by communities either
independently (for the kelurahangrants) or jointly with local governments (for the Poverty Alleviation
Partnership grants). These will consist o f contracts between the government and the respective
communities to deliver certain outcomes. Therefore, the rates under the contracts shall bejustified and
agreed at the time o f approval of the community proposals. To enhance transparency, the list o f vendors
and their corresponding committed/paid amount will be disclosed in the public domain, at least on the
information board and inthe public accountability meetings. After signing the contracts, procurement
will be managed and executed by communities usingforms and procedures that have beentested and
reviewed as adequate by the Bank under UPPl and UPP2. These will be contained inthe project
manuals. OCs will ensure that regular quality assurance and supervision will be enforced. These
procedures will be included in the project manuals and the contracts with each community group.




                                                      54

16.     Under the kelurahan grants, each community group (BKM) may receive up to a total o f Rp.500
million (US$ 58,800 equivalent) per kelurahaddesa to finance subprojects and micro credit sub loans.
The ceiling for any single subproject (to K S M groups) or micro credit sub loans (to K S M groups) i s
Rp.30 million (US$3,550 equivalent). Individual procurements will be small and widely dispersed.
Procurement procedures will therefore consist o f special procedures using Community Participation, and
the assignment o f Individual Consultants. These procedures are defined below and will be detailed inthe
project manual.

17.      The PAPG will finance subprojects that are preparedjointly by BKMs and local govemment
(through their dinas offices). The amount o f PAPG for individual subproject will range from Rp.30
million (US$3,550 equivalent) up to Rp.200 million (US$23,550 equivalent). These funds will constitute
up to 50% of the total cost ofthe subproject, as communities, dinas or other private sponsors will be
required to provide the other 50% as matching funds. The subprojects must be inthe form of
development o f public facilities/infrastructure/services that will directly benefit the community and that
can be completed within 6 months. Individual procurements will be small and widely dispersed.
Procurement and selection procedures will therefore consist o f special procedures usingCommunity
Participation. These procedures are definedbelow and will be detailed inthe Project Manual.

         a) CommunityParticipationfor Works under the sub projects

18.      For the development o f infrastructure and other small works (less than US$50,000 equivalent),
works may be conducted through contributions from communities, which may be inthe form o f labor and
materials, but may also include land. For contribution o f labor, communities may choose to include full
or partial labor cost in the proposals and/or pay salaries for work done on the project. Construction using
a labor-intensive arrangement with community members i s subject to the following provisions:

         The architectural plans and engineering designs for the above very small civil works shall be
         based on Government-approved plans and designs
    0    The implementatiodsubprojectagreement covering these works shall include the following: (i)
         specified lump-sum,fixed price amount based on a written estimate o f work to be rendered by
         identified laborers from the community; and (ii)   description inreasonable detail, including basic
         specifications, required completion date, and relevant drawings where applicable.
    0    The wage rate for community labor shall follow Government standards for the location and type
         of labor as established by the Ministry o f Settlement and Regional Infrastructure (Kimpraswil)

19.      Inareas where the community does not have the capacity to construct works themselves, the
community may (with GO1prior agreement as established inthe subproject implementation agreement)
procure small civil work contracts (for individual contracts less than US$ 50,000 equivalent) following
procurement of small works procedures. These contracts will be contracted under lump sum, fixed price
contracts awarded on the basis o f quotations obtained from three qualified contractors inresponse to a
written invitation. The invitation includes basic specifications, requiredstart and completion dates, an
agreement format acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings. The quotations will be opened inpublic
accountability meetings and read aloud. The award will be made to the contractor who offers the lowest
price quotation for the works. No restriction on participation inthe bidding i s allowed.

         b) Community Participationfor Goods under the sub projects

20,      Goods procured under the Kelurahan Grants or PAPG include purchase of goodsiequipment as
agreed inthe subproject implementation agreement. Goods shall be procured through comparison o f
prices from at least three reputable local suppliers. The request for quotation includes a basic description
and quantity o f the goods, required date and place of delivery, and an agreement format acceptable to the


                                                       55

Bank. The quotations will be opened inpublic accountability meetings and read aloud. The award will
be made to the supplier who offers the lowest price quotation. No restriction on participation inthe
bidding is allowed. For subprojects located inremote areas where it is not economical to obtainprices
from suppliers located far from project sites, less than three quotations i s acceptable, as i s direct
contracting. The group proposing the subproject, however, needs to justify these methods, and
verifications by project staff must be placed on record.

21.      Goods valued at less than Rp.15 million each (USS1,800 equivalent) may be purchased from
local suppliers/stores after conducting a price comparison `survey' by visiting at least three local
suppliers. Price comparisons o f less than three are acceptable whenever there i s a lack o f altemative
suppliers. The price survey shall be conducted by two members o f the community who are trustedby the
community as having the required independence and integrity.

22.      Subprojects may also include the purchase o f goods provided/installedby the community or other
community groups (acting as "suppliers").     These shall have reasonable rates as compared to prices of
similar goods obtained from other stores nearby. The K S M shall provide acceptable technical
specifications to the "suppliers" and allow adequate time for delivery and installation.

23.      Subprojects may also include the purchase o f goods provided/installed by the community or other
community groups (acting as "suppliers"). These shall have reasonable rates as compared to prices o f
similar goods obtained from other stores nearby. The K S M shall provide acceptable technical
specifications to the "suppliers" and allow adequate time for delivery and installation.

        c)   CommunityParticipationfor Selectionof Consultantsunder the sub projects

24.     Procurement o f consultants under Kelurahan/PAF' Grants may involve hiringo f individual
experts/engineers or firnis through service delivery contracts. These will be very small contracts (up to
US$20,000 equivalent per contract); therefore, competition has no added value. Individuals will be hired
following the Selection of Individual Consultants, and Single Source Selection procedures for firms.

D. ConsultingServices for ImplementationSupport and Capacity Building(US$24,4million
    equivalent, including contingencies,of which Overhead for PMU (USU.2 million) is not Bank
    financed)

25.     The remainder ofprocurement actions will be for consulting services, which will be managed
centrally by the Government (the Project Management Unit). The main consulting contracts are the
National Management Consultants (NMC), Oversight Consultants (OCs),and Evaluation Consultants
(EC). Overall, there will be 20 main consultant service packages selected at the central level (1 NMC, 15
OCs, and 4 Evaluation Consultant packages) as well as some ad-hoc evaluation studies to be procured on
an as-required basis duringthe implementation period. A few individual consultants (about 5 contracts)
will also be hiredunder the project as the technical advisors.

National Management Consultants (US2.5 millioi? including contingencies).

26.     The P M UinJakarta will assign a National ManagementConsultants (NMC) to provide assistance
for overall project management, monitoring and reporting. This NMC package will be procured based on
the LCS procedures with thejustification mentionedinthe paragraph Executive Summary above. This
total contract will be subject to annual performance review, based on which, the Client may have the right
to terminate the contract at any time ifperfonnance i s unsatisfactory.




                                                      56

27.      The following actions will be taken to minimize risks related to corruption:

    (i)TheTORforthisassignmenthasbeenpreparedtobequiterigid,suchthattheconsultantswill
         only need to propose qualified individuals and their best estimates o f travel and other
         reimbursable expenses.
    (ii)BasedonthesurveyoftherelatedcoststothisassignmentinthepreviousUPPs(including
         comparison o f costs associated to relevant items as proposed by OC and NMC), the average cost
         for N M C in executing this assignment can be estimated, such that the cost survey will serve as the
         reference for negotiatingthe total contract cost.
    (iii) socializationandtrainingactivities(bothforOCandotherskilledtraining) willbepre-
         The
         determined inthe TOR, and will be regularly modified by the Client based on an annual review.

28.      The NMC contract included inthis amendment scenario will initially be for a 3 year period, with
a provision for a possible extension untilproject completion subject to satisfactory performance and with
prior approval from the Bank. The possibility o f such an extension shall be clearly outlined inthe TOR
and RFP (including in the Special Conditions o f Contracts), and shall be factored during the evaluation.

29.      The NMC contract amount will consist o f the following:

    e    The feedunit rates for individuals involved to support this assignment;
    0    The reasonable fees, with breakdown, to cover the consultant's efforts inmanaging and
         coordinating the socialization and training activities. The estimated costs for these activities will
         be provided, such that the consultant would be functioning as the "fund manager" only; and
    e    The actual reimbursable to cover travel and other expenses.

30.      To enhance their capacity in carrying out the above assignment, the consultants may associate
with other consultants/providers in accordance with para 1.12 o f the Bank Consultant Guidelines. Insuch
cases, the submitted proposal shall be clearly identify and describe this association.

Oversiaht Consultants (US$I7.6million)

3 1.     There will be 15 Oversight Consultant (OC). As described for the NMC, the TOR for this
assignment have been prepared to be quite rigid, such that the consultants will only need to propose
qualified individuals and their best estimates for travel and other reimbursable expenses. Based on
experiences inUPPl and 2, the average cost for OCs in executing this assignment can be best estimated,
such that the OC will be procured following the LCS procedures with a budget ceiling.

32.      The estimated cost for each single contract packageranges from US$0.4million to US$1.7
million. OCs will be hired for a 2-year period with a provision o f a possible extension until project
completion subject to satisfactory perfomiance and with prior approval from the Bank. The possibility o f
such an extension shall be clearly outlined inthe TOR and RFP (including in the Special Conditions o f
Contracts), and shall be factored during the evaluation.

33.      The contracts for the OCs will includethe selection and hiringo fkelurahan facilitators and other
training and socialization activities that are not included inthe NMC contract. Facilitators will be hired
by OCs based on the required qualifications as described inthe TOR and agreed contract terms and
conditions. The facilitators are key to the supervision o f the Project at the community level. They consist
of local individuals who are familiar with the physical and social conditions of the respective
Kelurahan/Community where the Project i s beingimplemented. Their role i s mainly to assist the




                                                       57

community inpreparing and implementing the project, in addition to assessing the quality and readiness
o f particular Community incarrying out the project.

34.      Based on previous experience under the Indonesian environment for projects involving
communities, the facilitators are normally recruited from a certain pooligroup o f people within the
1ocalKelurahan areas. Those facilitators normally maintain their own network such that any project will
compete for facilitators from the same pool. In addition, any difference in facilitator salaries (with the
same qualifications) may create social problems within the facilitators' network. Therefore, facilitator
salaries will be pre-determined as established by a market survey in local areas by the Government carried
out by the Project Preparation Team and acceptable to the Bank. The cost component for the OCs will
therefore include the facilitators' salaries (estimated at US$6.2 million), the cost o f training conducted by
OCs (estimated at US$6 million), and socialization costs (estimated at US$3.1 million). To enhance their
capacity incarrying out the above assignment, the consultants may associate with other
consultants/providers inthe form o fjoint ventures in accordance with para 1.12 of the Bank Consultant
Guidelines, inwhich the expressionof interest shall be submittedby this association.

Evaluation Consultants KJSa2.2nzillion)

35.      There will be four main packages for Evaluation Consultants for a total estimated contract
amount o f US$I.88 million. The first package will be to carry out a base line survey shortly after loan
effectiveness, and the three consecutive contracts will be for evaluation at three different stages during
project implementation. The consultants for each contract package will be procured by the PMU,
following QCBS procedures. The consultant who has been hiredunder the previous contract package
may be allowed to participate to compete for the following and subsequent packages subject to meeting
the eligibility requirement, and as long as the P M U ensures that para 1.10 of the Consultant Guidelineson
"Unfair Competitive Advantage" will be exercised. Inaddition, there may be evaluation studies required
(a total aggregate amount o f US$0.4 million) which may be assigned to a firm or NGO, or to Individual
Consultants. Each contract for a firnV"G0 i s expected to be small (less than US$lOO,OOO up to an
estimated aggregate amount o f US$200,000), and, therefore, will be selected following Selection Based
on Consultants Qualification (CQ) procedures. Each individual consultant contract i s estimated to be
small (less than US$25,000 up to an estimated aggregate amount o f US$lOO,OOO) and the selection will
follow the Selection o f Individual Consultants.

Technical Advisors (US$l.O nzillioni

36.      There will some individual experts hiredby PMU. These individuals are expected to assist PMU
inmonitoring the project on the technical aspects, as well as providing technical and policy advice o fthe
necessary actions that will be required to enhance the performance o f the project. They will also assist
the P M U to continue enhance the concept o f the UPP. Furthermore they are expected to assist DG
Human Settlement to strategize the integration o f all community poverty alleviation programs in
Kimpraswil. It i s expected that the individuals, who are currently working for the project for UPP 1 and 2
will bepart o f these technical advisors.

Prior review thresholds
It is expected that about 12% o f total expenditures would be subject to prior review. The Ministryo f
Finance has issued a decree to state that the exchange rate to be used for determining the threshold for
prior review i s IDR 9,50O/US$. This understanding will be updated from time to time with Bank's prior
agreement. The following prior review thresholds have been established:
     e   Works: U S $ 50,000
     e   Goods: US$20,000
     0   Consultant Services: U S $ 100,000 (firms) and US$ 50,000 (individuals), and TORSfor all
         contracts.

Contracts which are subject to prior review shall be determined from procurement plans acceptable to the
Bank that are updatedby end o f September each year for implementation for the following GO1fiscal
year.

The OCs are required to randomly review, prior to countersigning, contracts implemented by community
which are NOT subject to the Bank's prior review.

The following issues should be addressed regularly during supervision:
     e The capacity o f project staff in implementing procurement.
     .The level of enforcement o f the agreed procedures and documents.
     e The effectiveness o f provinces/districts in solving procurement problems, including complaint
         resolution.
       An assessment o fthe effectiveness o f the Borrower's monitoring and supervision implementation
         with respect to procurement.

                              Annex 9: Economic and FinancialAnalysis
                              INDONESIA: Third UrbanPoverty Project

1,       The objectives of the project will be achieved through three components. First,the project will
support the development o f community organizations in each kelurahan (Community Development and
Local Govemment Capacity Building). Second, these community organizations will receive block grants
that they will use to provide services to the members o f the community according to the community's
preferences (Kelurahan Grants). These preferences will be revealed through the process o f preparation o f
the Community Development Plan. Third, these community organizations will partner with local
governments to develop and deliver secondary level public services (Poverty Alleviation Partnership
Grant). All three steps will be supported by project investments. Traditional, ex ante economic analysis
for all three investments i s either not possible or their credibility i s no more than the assumptions made.
However, an analysis o f the possible outcomes does provide an opportunity to carry out an indicative
analysis regarding the economic benefits o f the investments.

Community Development and Local Govemment Capacity Building
2.       The first component o f the project helpsbuildcapable and resilient community organizations.
The essential goal i s to buildcapacity for collective action incommunitiesthat leads them towards
collective action and allows them to aggregate and prioritize their demands. Higher community capacity
for collective action i s a positive outcome inand o f itself. The stream o f benefits that flow from
collective action goes much beyondproject investments. For example, an organized community i s able to
pressure local government to respond to their needs or be accountable to them or help in conflict
resolution. The overall benefits o f increasing community capacity for collective action are not possible to
capture through a cost-benefit analysis.

3 .      However, community involvement in design and delivery o f public services has two other direct
economic benefits. First,public investments that systematically respond to aggregated community
demand are more effective. Top-down, supply-drivenservice provision often over-supplies services that
people do not want, and under-supplies services that people really want, causing a waste o fpublic
resources, Furthermore, when communities are able to aggregate and articulate their collective priorities,
it becomes possible for local governments to develop more efficient and focused plans to address the
concerns at a city level. Second, public investmentinurban services that involve community
involvement in design and delivery are more efficient. Services delivered in this fashion are not only able
to stretch every dollar invested by substantial community contribution, but are also more sustainable.
This process of service provision and c o q u n i t y contribution increases ownership o f the services
delivered, This inturn creates incentives for communities to manage and maintain infrastructure created
for the services appropriately. Such local management of infrastructure allows the services to be
available duringthe true design life o f the investment. In the Indonesiancontext, where operations and
maintenance o f even primary infrastructure i s minimal at best, premature failure o f infrastructure i s
widespread. Sustainable infrastructure, inrelative terms, i s highlyeffective public investment. Thus,
economic benefits accrued through investments usingthe above process generally have higher economic
benefitcompared to traditional practices o f service provision. The specific investments and their
respective economic benefits are discussed below.

Kelurahan Grants
4.       The second component o f the project providesblock grants to communities to finance sub-
projects for service provision at the community level. The project follows an open-menu policy for
decisions regarding use o f these grants, meaning that communities will choose how they want to use the
funds. Hence, actual investment choices are impossible to predict accurately at this time. However,



                                                       62

experiences from UPPl and K D P l suggest that most communities choose a package o f services that
includes small infrastructureimprovements (roads, drains, water, sanitation, etc.) and revolving funds for
providing micro-credit services to community members.

5.       There i s extensive experience inIndonesia regarding investments in small community level
infrastructure improvements. The World Bank supported these investmentsunder the Kampung
Improvement Programs (KIP). KIP delivereda package o f basic infrastructure to neighborhoods as
required. A simplified approach o f measuring land values was usedto quantify the economic benefits.
Land values in kampungs which were improved, and those o f similar kampungs which were not
improved, were compared. Appraisal and completion reports o f these projects indicated 20% to 70%
economic internal rate o f return (Implementation Completion Report, Ln.3246-IND). OED's KIP Impact
EvaluationReport (June 1995) confirmed this by re-evaluating the impact o f KIP invarious Bank
projects. OED found that the EIRRs under these projects ranged from 26% to 31% over a usefullife o f
15 years.

6.       Ifcommunities choose to invest inarevolvingfund, it is expected that these wouldprovide loans
for productive economic activities to community members. The assumption i s that access to credit with
lower transaction costs and no collateral requirement will allow petty traders and small manufacturers to
be more productive or encourage the unemployedor underemployedto start profitable small enterprise.
The requirement o frepayment o f credit with prevailing commercial interest rate for one-year loans
(currently between 24-33%), should provide nominal returns at least that highper year and an expected
positive economic returns inreal terms. The project returns will be higher the faster the revolving
proceeds. The project assumes a one-year loan period, often for small loans, and shorter cycles are
common. The assumptions have provenmostly true inUPPl. The project so far has about 550,000 loans
out o f which 60% are for small trade, 15% for services and about 10% for manufacturing. A survey o f
sample businesses shows that most borrowers (72%) experienced an increase in income and repaid their
loans from income from their enterprise (92%). The repayment rate for UPP1, though relatively good,
can be substantially improved. This project will ensure better repayment rate by ensuring: (i)  better
support to communities to prepare sensible and profitable business proposals; (ii) UPKs inappraisal
                                                                                    train
o f loan applications so that they make loans to people that they think would be able to pay back; and (iii)
make loan information more transparent to community members to enhance social pressure for
repayment  I




Poverw Alleviation Partnership Grant
7.       The third component o f the project will allocate funds competitively to finance sub-projects
jointly proposed by local government agencies and community groups. The project will follow an open
menufor this component as well. The project assumesthat most ofthese investments would bephysical
infrastructure (e.g. roads, bridges, drains, and water, outside or betweenkelurahans) or social
infrastructure (e.g. school repairs). Experience from VIPI and I1and KDP I,    which have similar
investments, show relatively highEIRRs. Extensive economic analysis was carried out prior to the
appraisal o f both VIPI and VIPII. The main investments in these projects displayed an EIRRranging
from 22%-90% with the mean o f 35%-40%. InK D P Iindividual villages and project proponents chose
their own subprojects from an open menu, similar to UPP3. Nevertheless, about 50% villages chose all-
weather roads and bridges, and inthese cases the technologies and methods were the same as those inVIP
projects. These investments had EIRRsranging from 20%-40%. Similarly, K D P 2, which also follows
an open menu at the kecamatan level, assumes an average EIRRo f 25%. The overall objective o f this
component i s to ensure that local governriients partner with communities inthe provision o f urban
services. The objective i s also to encourage local governments to continue this relationship in other
investmentsbeyondthe project investments. As a result, a growing number o f city level investments will
be more responsive to the needs o f the community.

Introduction

This project is an expansion ofUPPl and UPP2 to new provinces inthe country. UPPl and UPP2 were
Category B projects with regard to environmental issues. They also triggered the Bank policy on
Involuntary Resettlement. Therefore, Environmental Guidelines and a Land Acquisition and
Resettlement Policy Framework were agreed with the government for bothprojects, and procedures put in
place for their application should the need arise. InUPP2, with the expansion o f the project to
Kalimantan, a Framework for the Treatment o f Indigenous People was also agreed with the government.

Implementationi s complete for Phase 1 o fUPP1. Phase I1i s under implementation, with sub-projects
currently beingdiscussedby BKMs and community groups (but not yet implemented). UPP2 has just
started, but BKMs have not yet been formed, and there i s no activity on the ground yet. The safeguard
measures put inplace have so far been adequate to mitigate any safeguards issues. The following
summarizes the experience under Phase 1 o f UPPl with regard to safeguard policy issues:

EnvironmentalIssues

     0   About 5,600 infrastructure sub-projects have been financed, at a total cost o f US$lO million,
         indicating an average size o f sub-project o f US$1,800 (Rp.15 million). These have consisted
         mainly o f tertiary roads and bridges improvement (64%), drainage activities (22%), public toilets
         (lo%), sanitation activities (9%) and water supply (5%). The table below provides a breakdown
         of a sample o f 63 kelurahan
     0   The small size and nature o f these activities have meant that there have been no adverse
         environmental impacts, and standard operating procedures for environmental mitigation (as per
         the Environmental Guidelines) have proved to be adequate.




LandAcquisition andInvoluntaryResettlement

     0   N o involuntary resettlement has occurred under the UPP Phase 1 or 2 thus far.
     0   For infrastructure projects (which constitute less than 10% o f total disbursements under Phase l),
         there has been a highlevel o f voluntary contributions from communities inthe form cash
         (towards investmentcosts), in the forni o f labor, and inthe form o f land. Inthese cases,



                                                        64

       contributions have beenrecorded inthe project proposals, which have beenreviewed by the OCs
       and ratified by the BKM.Since the average cost o f sub-projects i s so low (US$1,800), voluntary
       contributions have also beenminor, mainly for alignment o f roads. Thus far, there have been no
       land related complaints or grievances.
    0  With the PAPG introducing slightly larger sub-projects (though evenPAPG sub-project ceilings
       are fairly l o w at US$23,SSO), monitoring of voluntary contributions o f land will need to be
       enhanced.


IndigenousPeoples

    0  Ithas not been necessary to use this framework yet under UPP2 as activities have not yet started
       on the ground.
       Because UPP3 focuses on urban areas, it i s unlikely that the project will have a significant impact
       on indigenouspeoples. Ina few islands like Papua and Kalimantan, Indigenous Peoples (IPS)
       like native Papuans and Dayaks, may be affected by the project. The nature o f the project, with
       its emphasis on community development, empowerment and participation, and i t s use o f local
       facilitators and volunteers for implementation, i s such that there is unlikely to be a negative
       impact on IPSdue to project activities or that IPSwould be deprived o f benefits. Therefore, a
       specific Indigenous People's Development Plan was not considered necessary for UPP3.
    0  However, due to socio-political sensitivity and the history o f conflict inthese islands, IPSmay
       need special attention to ensure that their voices are heard and that they are included in decision-
       making. As a result, the Framework for the Treatment o f IndigenousPeople developed for UPP2
       will also be usedinUPP3. Because the dynamics o f the sensitivity will be different and specific
       to local circumstances, a "situational analysis" will be carried out prior to implementation o f the
       project in Papua particularly, to determine whether any design changes may be necessary. Any
       requiredchanges will be incorporated inthe ImplementationManual. Feedback will also be
       sought from the Kecamatan Development Project operating inthe same areas to determine the
       most effective way o f ensuring the full participation o f Ips inthe project.




The Environmental Guidelines, the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework, and the
Framework for the Treatment o f Indigenous or Isolated Vulnerable People are attached as Annexes 10A,
10B and 1OC.

                                   Annex 10A: EnvironmentalGuidelines

Introduction

1.       As a highly decentralized project, UPP3 will support a large number of small sub-project
investments inurban areas. It i s expected to provide micro loans for income generating activities, and
finance small-scale infrastructure and other services (the ceiling for individual sub-projects or micro loans
per group i s Rp.30 million or US$3,550), through the kelurahangrants. Through the Poverty Alleviation
Partnership Grant, the project i s expected to finance small-scale infrastructure and services (the ceiling for
individual activities i s Rp.200 million or US$23,550). The low ceiling for individual activities,
combined with the types o f activities expected to be financed (roadibridge improvements, tertiary
drainage, water supply to individual households, garbage collection through handcarts) indicate that none
o f these investments i s expected to have any large scale, significant or irreversible impacts.
Environmental impacts would come mostly from poor site management duringthe project construction
activity.

2.       Theproject has been classified as a Bank environmental category B. This annex outlines the
environmental screening procedures and guidelines to ensure to identify, review, and "red-flag''
procedures to ensure that problems are corrected. Indonesia's environmental review procedures are
generally consistent with the Bank's and will form the framework o f UPP3's approach to environmental
management.

Basic Principles

3.       The basic environmentalprinciples are:

         (i)     proposals should avoid or minimize negative environmental impacts, and they should
                 have explored viable alternative designs to minimize any negative environmental impact;
         (ii)    the proposal should fit into the General Spatial Plan (RUTR)and avoidprotected areas so
                 designated by the Ministry o f the Environment (see below).
         (iii)   Any proposal entailinga negative environmental impact shall be complemented by an
                 environmental plan to mitigate the impact.

EnvironmentalScreeningCriteria

4.       Subprojects will be checked against Government o f Indonesia (GOI) screening criteria to ensure
that no project would necessitate a fdl environmental assessment. Inan initial screening, the project
type, scale, location, sensitivity, and the nature and magnitude o f potential impacts, will be identified to
classify the proposal inone o f 4 categories:

         (0      Those that requireANDAL (full Environmental Assessments) for which the Ministryo f
                 Environment has set criteria (see below). These will be eliminated from consideration for
                 UPP3 financing.
         (ii) Thosethatrequireenvironmentalmanagementandmonitoringplans(UKLandUPL)
                 based on limited but site-specific studies. The Ministry of Public Works has set criteria
                 to determine the need for UKL/UPL (see below). It i s expected that           o f the
                 proposals submittedunder either the PAPG or kelurahan grants would fall under this.
                 criteria.
         (iii) Thoseforwhichstandardoperatingprocedures(SOP)suffice,wheregenericgood
                 practice would protect the environment adequately. The DGHuman Settlements and
                 Urban and Rural Development have SOP guidelines for some types o fprojects (including


                                                       66

                   measures to control dust, noise and traffic at construction sites; specifications for
                   backfilling and revegetating disturbedareas to preventerosion; and procedures to control
                   negative impacts at solid waste transfer stations; etc.). It i s expected that some sub-
                   projects may fall under this category.
         (iv)      Those that require no environmental study, where no construction, disturbance of land or
                   water or discharge o f pollutants are involved. It i s expected that some sub-projects may
                   fall under this category.

5.        Special screening will be applied on the following cases:

          (i)      Fisheries. Standards from the Fishery Service Agency (Dinas Perikanan) will be applied
                   to all fishery subproject proposals.
          (ii)     Pesticide, ozone-depleting substances, tobacco or tobaccoproduct. N o subprojects using
                    or producing these materials will be financed.
          (iii)    Asbestos. N o asbestos-containing materials will be financed. Special mitigation
                   measures to address any issues with existing asbestos inany proposed sub-project (e.g.,
                   renovation o f school buildingsthat may have used asbestos) will be applied.
          (iv)     Sub-projects that produce liquid or gaseous ejjflzieizts or emissions. N o manufacturing or
                   processing operations will be financed that would produce pollutant-bearing effluents or

                                        the                                       the
                 reviews the design and certifies that it meets applicable water and air pollution control
                  standards.
                 Hazardous inaterials and wastes. No sub-project will be financed that uses, produces,
                  stores or transports hazardous materials (toxic, corrosive or explosive) or generates "B3"
                  (hazardous) wastes.
                 Logging. Sub-projects involving logging operations or procurement o f logging
                  equipment will not be financed.
                 Developinent onprotected areas. The Decree or the Minister o f the State for the
                  Environment o f the Republic o f Indonesia Number KEP-l7/MENLH/2001, entitled
                  Concerning the Types of Businesses Activities Required to Complete an Environmental
                 Impact Assessment, prescribes that any business or activity that is located in a protected
                  area or that may change the purpose and/or designation o f a protected area shall be
                 required to prepare an ANDAL (see above). This includes: forest protection area; river
                  edges; marinelfreshwater conservation areas; nature tourism park; peat areas; areas
                  surrounding lakes and reservoirs; coastal mangrove areas; water catchment areas;
                 national parks; coastal edges; forest parks; cultural reserves; areas surrounding springs;
                  scientific research areas; nature conservation areas; and areas susceptible to natural
                  hazards. No new settlement or expansion of settlements will be supported in protected
                  areas under theproject. Where settlements already exist, and if it is the policy o f the
                  local government to allow the settlement to remain, proposals for funding under UPP 3
                  m a y be used by the existing residents using standard UPP2 procedures and in compliance
                  with any local regulations on land management which are defined by the protected area
                  management plan. No road construction or rehabilitation of any kind will be allowed
                  inside delimited or proposed protected areas.

6.       Design specifications including environment management consideration for water supply, public
toilets, urban roads, TPS, markets and bridges will be applied to UPP3 inthe form o f Standard Operating
Procedures. Since these types of activities are most likely to be financed under the PAPG, the SOP used
by the participating local government will be applied.

EnvironmentalScreeningProcess

Kelurahan Grants

7.       Community groups (KSMs) will prepare a subproject proposal o n a standard fonnat provided by
the kelurahan facilitator, signed by the group members. The standard format will include all items
identified above that are not eligible for financing as part o f the negative list. The proposals will include a
description o f the activities proposed and compliance with any applicable guidelines o n environmental
impacts (as well as landasset acquisition and impact o n indigenous people). Project staff for their
feasibility, technical soundness, and compliance with guidelines will review all proposals, before they are
considered by the kelurahan organization (BKM). Project staff will specifically screen proposals for any
environmental impacts based o n the guidelines above, which will be included inthe project manuals.
These will include special screening for all sub-projects involving land and water use changes (Le.,
reclamation, irrigation); economic projects with environmental impacts to be sure that alignment, effluent,
etc., meet best practice standards. BKMs with the assistance o f facilitators will ensure that adequate
mitigation measures are taken. The selection o f proposals by the BKM for the kelurahan grant shall be
made in a meeting publicized in advance and open to the public.

Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant (PAPG)

8.      Proposals for the Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant will be evaluated by a PAPG Selection
Committee established by the local govemment (with the assistance o f project staff) consisting o f a panel
of representatives from the local govemment, the BKM Forum, and NGOs/universities/privateindividuals
concerned about poverty issues. Sub-project proposals will be prepared on a standard format that will
include the negative list. The Selection Committee can seek the help o f technical experts from the
Oversight Consultant (OC), from other government offices or hire outside experts to carry out technical
reviews of proposals ifnecessary. All proposals will be screened for any environmental impacts based on
the guidelines above that will be includedinthe project manuals, and the OC will be in charge o f ensuring
that adequate mitigation measures are taken. The process o f selection o f proposals by the PAPG
Selection Committee will be transparent, with clear criteria for selection.

Reporting

9.       Facilitators and OC staff will aggregate and review environmental reports and flag them in their
quarterly reports. The project manual will include a matrix o f likely environmental impacts and steps
with which to address them. An experienced environmental consultant will be hiredto summarize
progress, monitor and measure the impact o f the project on the environment as part o f the performance
evaluation o f the project.

                  Annex 10B: LandAcquisition and ResettlementPolicy Framework

I. ProiectCharacteristics

1,      A s a highly decentralized project, UPP3 will support a large number o f small sub-project
investments, mainly inurban areas. Through the Kelurahan Grants component, the project i s expected to
provide micro loans for income generating activities, and to finance small-scale infrastructure and other
services (the ceiling for individual sub-projects i s US$3,550 or Rp.30 million). Through the Poverty
Alleviation Partnership Grant (PAPG) component, the project i s expected to finance small-scale
infrastructure and services (the ceiling for individual activities i s US$23,550 or Rp.200million). None o f
the sub-projects i s expected have a significant impact due to land acquisition andor resettlement.

2.      UPP3 i s also a community-based demand-driven project. Sub-projects will not be identified in
advance. The identification o f the number o f people affected by a sub-project can thus only be defined
once sub-project proposals are evaluated by the community organization (BKM) for the Kelurahan
Grants, or by the PAPG Selection Committee for the Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant.

3.       Since participatory planning and decision making form the basis for the project, the entire project
approach should guarantee that people affected by the project will be involved in the decision making
process.

4.       Should any sub-project involve any land acquisition or resettlement, this Policy Framework
provides procedures and guidelines for agreeing o n compensation for those persons w h o are affected by
the sub-project in order to ensure that they are not unfairly treated by being given l o w compensation, or
benefit unfairly by being given compensation that i s significantly higher per square meter than other
owners who sell similar nearby land on the free market.

11. Definitions

5.      The definitions used inthis Policy Framework are:

                 "Census" means the head count o f those persons under a proposed Sub-project that
                 qualify as Displaced Persons. The date o f the Census is the latest cut-off point to record
                 the persons in the Sub-project area that will receive compensation, resettlement and/or
                 removal and rehabilitation assistance.
                 "Compensation" means the compensation at replacement cost as determined in Section V
                 o f this Framework given in exchange for the taking of land and building, in whole or in
                 part, and all fixed assets on the land and buildings and crops and trees.
                 "Land acquisition" means an activity that requires obtaining land, buildings or other
                 assets from Displaced Persons for purposes o f the sub-project against provision o f
                 compensation and assistance.
                 "Displaced Persons" means persons who, on account o f the involuntary taking o f land
                 and other assets as part o f the execution o f the Sub-project resulting in a direct economic
                 and social adverse impact, whether or not said Displaced Persons must physically
                 relocate, had or would have their: (i)  standard o f living adversely affected; (ii) title,

                 interest in any house, land (including premises, agricultural and grazing land) or any
                 other physical asset acquired or possessed, temporarily or permanently, adversely
                 affected; (iii)access to productive assets adversely affected, temporarily or permanently;

                 "Displaced Person" means any o f the Displaced Persons;




                                                       70

                "Physically DisplacedPersons" means persons who are forced to move from their
                previous location because (i)ll or a significant portion (50% or more) o f their land or
                                                a
                buildings are affected by the sub-project; or (ii) than 50% o f their land or buildings
                                                                    less
                are affected by the sub-project ifthe remaining portion is not economically viable or
                habitable.
                "Rehabilitation Assistance" means the provision o f cash or assets or other forms o f
                support to enable Displaced Persons without legal rights to the assets taken by the Project
                to at least equal or improve their standard o f living, income levels and production
                capacity to the level prior to the project.
                "Resettlement" means an effort /activity to relocate the Displaced Persons into a good
                new settlement as mentioned in section Vb so that they can develop a better life.
                "Involuntary Displacement'' means any o f the following actions, when they occur without
                the DisplacedPerson's informed consent or power of choice; (a) the taking o f land
                resulting in: (i) relocation or loss o f shelter; (ii) assets or access to assets; or (iii)
                                                                     lost                                loss

                move to another location; or (b) the involuntary restriction of access to legally designated
                parks and protected areas resultinginadverse impacts on the livelihoods o f the displaced.
                "Sub-project" means a specific infrastructure investment project carried out with funds
                from Kelurahan Grant or PAPG components o f the project.

111. BasicPrinciples

6.      Involuntary resettlement may cause severe long-term hardship, impoverishment, and
environmental damage unless appropriate measures are carefully planned and carried out. For these
reasons, the overall principles for this Framework are the following:

                Sub-project proposals should minimize land and asset acquisition and involuntary
                displacement. Groups proposing sub-projects should have explored viable alternative
                designs to minimize displacement.
                The group proposing the sub-project will use a transparent and participatory process to
                ensure that all Displaced persons agree on any proposed sub-project that involves land
                acquisition or resettlement.
                The group proposing the sub-project will have to agree to incorporatethe costs for land
                acquisition andor any involuntary resettlement intheir sub-project proposals as part o f
                sub-project costs. The compensation costs will be covered through the communities'
                own funds or government funds (World Bank Loan proceeds shall not be usedto finance
                compensation).
                Inaccordance with traditionalpractice, community members may elect to voluntarily
                contribute land or assets and/or relocate temporarily or permanently from their land
                without compensation. Voluntary in this context will mean the donation or granting o f
                land and other assets with the full knowledge o f the purposes for which the asset i s being
                made available and the economic, social and legal consequences that such an act would
                have on the person providing the asset and which act i s exercised freely and voluntarily,
                without any type o f cohesion.
                Displaced Persons shouldbe assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and
                standards o f the living or at least to restore them, inreal terms, to pre-displacement levels
                or to the levels prevailing prior to the beginning o f the project implementation, whichever
                i s higher.

IV. Framework

7.      Inthe event that a sub-project proposal requires any land acquisition, buildings, crops, trees,
and/or resettlement, the sub-project proposals have to indicate the need for land acquisition, the number
and names o f persons affected, and the estimated budget required for compensation.

8.      Proposals that would affect 200 persons or more would normally entail long lead times, and are
expected to be beyondthe scope o f the project. Inthe highly unlikely event that more than 200 persons
will be affected and require compensation, the Oversight Consultant will ensure that the proposal is
complementedwith a full Land Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plan (LARAP). The L A R A P will
include: (i) survey to identify the socio-economic characteristics o f the DisplacedPersons including a
            a
census; (ii)a comprehensive plan for the acquisition o f land and/or resettlement; and (iii) compensation
                                                                                              a
package in accordance with the compensation guidelines set out in Section V and acceptable to the
Displaced Persons and the groups proposing the sub-project (under the PAPG component, this would be
the BKMs and a district level local government agency). The sub-project proposal will also indicate the
budget source for the required compensation (Bank funds cannot be used for compensation). The
OC/NMC shall seek the Bank's approval o f the LARAP and budget, and seek modifications incase the
Bank finds they are needed. Further details on the LARAP are provided inthe attachment to this annex.

9.      For any sub-project that requires resettlement o f less than 200 persons, the BKM, supported by
the OC staff assisting with proposal preparation, will ensure that the following steps are followed:

                 The group proposing the sub-project carries out a Census o f the persons that would be
                 affected by the proposed sub-project and that would qualify as Displaced Persons.
                 The Displaced Persons agree on the sub-project proposal, and have negotiated agreement
                 on either voluntary or compensated contribution with the group proposing the sub-
                 project.
                 The agreement i s made through a participatory and transparent process.
                 Displaced Persons are made aware that they have the right to compensation and/or other
                 assistance according to the compensation guidelines provided in Section V.
                 Incaseswhere voluntary contributions ofland or assets are indicated, these are clearly
                 agreed with all Displaced Persons; the name(s) o f the contributor(s) and details o f the
                 contribution(s) are included in the agreement; and these are verified by the Oversight
                 Consultants.
                 A simple format on the agreement is incorporated inthe sub-project proposal. This
                 agreement should clearly indicate individual land plots needed for land acquisition and/or
                 resettlement, the number and names o f the affectedpersons, scheme o f compensation
                 and/or resettlement, and estimated cost for land acquisition and/or resettlement
                 compensation. Inthe case o f voluntary contribution, the agreement should state the
                 rationale for it and the fact that the person had the choice o f not providing the asset, and
                 inthe case ofinvoluntary contribution, the manner followed for valuation o fthe assets
                 whichmustbe incompliance with Section V below.
                 The agreement should indicate that any compensation would come from the community
                 or government's contribution to the sub-project. It would be possible to use World Bank
                 Loan proceeds to construct small works and initiate employment opportunities for the
                 group members who are to be resettled. This has to be agreed by the group proposing the
                 sub-project and put in the agreement (see assistance guidelines in Section V). However
                 World Bank Loan proceeds cannot be usedto finance payment o f cash compensation or
                 land acquisition.




                                                        72

                  The details o f the agreement will be verified by the OC/facilitator incharge o f the
                  affected communities prior to consideration by the BKM or the PAPG Selection
                  Committee for financing. Inthe event that no consensus has been reached on the form
                  and amount o f compensation, the sub-project will not be considered for financing.
                  No DisplacedPersons shall have their land or other assets taken before they have
                  received the compensation and the resettlement site, ifthat i s the case, as agreed upon
                  and detailed inthe sub-project proposal.
                  Payment o f compensation, displacement o f people, or preparation o f a resettlement site as
                  agreed upon should be completed before the construction o f the respective sub-project i s
                  started.
                  A monitoring and evaluation system for compensation will be introduced to ensure that
                  DisplacedPersons have receivedtheir compensation as agreed upon. The monitoring
                  will be undertaken by the Oversight Consultant and will be a full survey or sample survey
                  depending on the number o f households affected. A report on the results and
                  recommendations will be publishedby the OC and disseminated to the community and
                  the NMC.

V. Guidelinesfor Compensation,Resettlementand Other Assistance

10.      Based on agreements reached duringthe negotiation, Displaced Persons can choose to receive
cash compensation, resettlement, or other options. Other options include serviced sites, land [swap] o f
equal size or equal productive capacity, low cost housing, apartments, real estate housing with credit
facilities, or other schemes. Among those options, Displaced Persons will be provided the opportunity o f
having a resettlement site where they do not have to pay more than their present routine expenditure. In
all cases, the amount o f compensation, resettlement or other options must be sufficient to achieve the
objectives o f improving or at least maintaining the pre-project level o f standard of living, income
generation and production capacity o f the Displaced Person.

          a. Compensation

11.      Displaced Persons have the right to receive real replacement cost compensation. Real
     replacement cost means:

          (i>     for land in urban areas, the pre-displacement market value o f land o f equal size and use,
                  with similar or improved public infrastructure facilities and services and located inthe
                  vicinity o f the affected land, plus the cost o f any registration and transfer taxes;

          (ii) foragriculturalland,thepre-sub-projectorpre-displacement,whicheverishigher,market
                  value o f land o f equal productive potential or use located in the vicinity o f the affected
                  land, plus the cost of land preparation to levels similar to those o f affected land, plus the
                  cost o f any registration and transfer taxes; and

          (iii) forhousesandotherstructures,themarketcostofthematerialstobuildareplacement
                  structure, or to repair a partially affected structure, plus the cost o f transporting building
                  materials to the construction site, plus the cost o f any labor and contractors' fees, plus the
                  cost o f any registration and transfer taxes. Indetermining the replacement cost,
                  depreciation o f the asset and the value o f salvage materials are not taken into account, nor
                  the value o f benefits to be derived from the sub-project deducted from the valuation o f an
                  affected asset. Compensation for trees, crops and other assets will be based on the
                  replacement value usingexisting market prices per tree preparedby relevant agencies.




                                                         73

12,      The extent of the compensation will depend on the tenure situation o f the Displaced Person as set
out in Section VI.

13,      Displaced Persons whose: (i)remaining land and buildingcannot be used for housing or
workplace; or (ii)   whose remaining land i s less than 60 sq meters; or (iii)whose remaining agricultural
land is less than 50% of its initial size or i s not economically viable; or (iv) whose remaining building IS
less than 2 1 s q meters; have the option o f being included as Physically Displaced Persons and
compensated for the taking o f the affected asset. Displaced Persons whose remaining land i s less than 60
sq meters and remaining buildingi s less than 2 1 sq meters, will have an option to move to a new lot o f 60
sq meters and buildingof 21 sq meters. They will be provided with compensation for the difference in
area between what they lost and what i s beingprovided to them.

              b. Resettlement Sites

14.       The resettlement site provided for the DisplacedPersons will include infrastructure and public
facilities so that it i s good for living and enables the development o f a good social and economic life,
including: (i)  road or footpath as necessary; (ii)drainage system; (iii)water supply (if a piped water
distribution network i s not available, there should be shallow wells that comply with health standards);
(iv) electricity; (v) health facility, education facility, work places, religious services, and sport facilities,
inaccordance with the size o f the new community; and (vi) public transport facility to perform a good
life.

15.       The Displaced Persons will move to the new site after the infrastructure and facilities at the
resettlement site are completed and feasible to live in as confirmed by the OC and the BKM. The
Displaced Persons will be informed o f the completion o f the resettlement site at least one month before
displacement, and they will be invited to survey the new site. The resettlement site would be available
prior to the start-up o f works under the relevant sub-project.

 16.      The location reserved for resettlement will be widely publicized so that the general public will be
informed.

              c.   Other Assistance

 17.      Displaced Persons who lose their income sources or means of livelihood as a result o f the sub-
project will receive assistance to restore it. The types o f assistance will be defined by the BKM and local
government (in case of the PUG) and confirmed by the OC. Training and assistance that can be
provided include: motivation development; skill and vocational training; assistance to start and develop
small businesses; small scale credit; marketing development; assistance duringtransition period; and
strengthening o f community based organization and services. In implementing the assistance, care should
be taken to harmonize the newly resettled people and the host community inthe resettlement area through
assistance and integration efforts. The assistance can be linked to existing programs and resources.

                  rehabilitation assistance for the land or for the structures built and crops planted therein.

VII.     Consultationand Complaint Resolution

19.      This general framework will be included inthe Project manuals and guidelines, and OC staff and
facilitators trained inits implementation. The overall project approach inenabling transparency and
consultation should allow solutions to local problems locally, quickly, and effectively. If any Displaced
Persons or other community members have a complaint regarding the framework or its application in
practice, the project has an established systemo f complaint handling at the kelurahan and kota/kabupaten
as well as provincial and national levels, with dedicated staff incharge o f handling and following up on
complaints. Complaints which cannot be solved locally through the BKMcomplaint system will be
referredto the OC, and, ifnecessary to the N M C and the PMU. However, inthe event that the
deliberations have been repeatedly conducted over a long period o f time, but not exceeding one year, to
reach a consensus butno consensus has been reached on the form and amount o f compensation, dispute
resolution will follow Presidential Decree No. 55 o f 1993. The Decree stipulates that after failure to
reach agreement with sub-project group, the owner has the right to object to the Governor (see clause
20(1)), who may conduct further negotiations (see clause 20(2)). Ifthe owner i s still not satisfied, the
governor must refer the case to the Minister o f Home Affairs and Ministero f Justice (see clause 21 (1)
and (2)), for consideration and referral to the President o f the Republic o f Indonesia for a final decision
(see clause 21 (3) and (4)).

20.      The progress o f implementationo f any requiredland acquisition, resettlement, and assistance will
be reported to the Bank regularly by the O C B M C . Ifrequired, an independentreviewer may be retained
to carry out extemal monitoring and evaluation o f the implementation o f specific LARAPs. Such an
agency or agencies will have qualified and experienced staff and terms o f reference acceptable to the
Bank.

              Requirements for a LandAcquisition and ResettlementAction Plan (LARAP)
                      for sub-projects under the Poverty AlleviationPartnershipGrant
                                         affecting more than 200 persons

1.       Ifa sub-project proposal indicatesthat more than 200personswillbe affected by the sub-project,
the groups proposing the sub-project (BKMs and district level local government agency), assisted by the
Oversight Consultant, will be requiredto conduct a Census and socio-economic survey to: (i)determine
the number ofpersons involved; (ii) collect data about the social and economic condition ofthe people,
                                        to
and the physical condition o f the Project area; and (iii)to determine the potential impact o f the sub-
project.

2.       The date o f this SurveyKensus will be the latest cut-off point to recordthe persons inthe sub-
project area that will receive compensation, resettlement and/or removal and rehabilitation assistance.

3.       The detailed census and socio-economic survey (hereafter referredto as the socio-economic
survey) will cover among others:

         (i)     the size, condition, legal status o f land and buildings (listed in impact groups o f 0-25%1,
                 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-100% affected);
         (ii)    the number o f Displaced Persons and households;
         (iii)   relevant social characteristics o f the Displaced Persons (age, gender, education, etc)
         (iv)    relevant economic Characteristics o f the DisplacedPersons such as livelihoods (including,
                 as relevant, production levels and income derived from both formal and informal
                 economic activities); standards o f living (including health status)
         (v)     the magnitude o f the expected loss - total or partial - o f assets, and the extent o f
                 displacement, physical or economic; and
         (vi)    information on vulnerable groups or persons for whom special provisions may have to be
                 made

4.       Based on the results o f this socio-economic survey, the Oversight Consultant will assist the
groups proposing the sub-project to prepare a comprehensive plan on the taking o f assets for purposes o f
the sub-project, and the provision of compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation assistance for the
Displaced Persons in accordance with the principles o f this Policy Framework. This will be described in
a LandAcquisition and Resettlement Action Plan (LARAP) to be furnished to the Bank for approval.

                        Annex 1OC: Frameworkfor Treatment of Indigenous or
                                         Isolated VulnerablePeoples

Objectives

1.    ' The design o f this project i s structured to ensure the participation and inclusion o f various groups
within communities inlocal level decision making over resource allocation. However, the project
recognizes that Indigenous People form a particular group that merits a different approach and specific
support. Therefore, in accordance with OD4.20, the following framework for addressing indigenous
people will be adopted for the project.

2.      The objectives of this framework are to:
        (i)      Ensurethat indigenous people participate inand benefit from the project; and
        (ii)     Avoid or minimize potentially adverse effects o f the project on indigenouspeople.

Definition

3.      "Isolated vulnerable peoples" i s the term used officially by the Indonesian Government to
describe groups that have the characteristics of "indigenous peoples" as usedin O D 4.20. This document
will hereafter use the term "isolated vulnerable peoples".

4.      For the purposes o f this project, isolated vulnerable peoples are defined as those that present
varying degrees o f the following characteristics:
        (i) acloseattachmenttoancestralterritoriesandtothenaturalresourcesintheseareas;
        (ii) self-identificationandidentificationbyothersasmembersofadistinctculturalgroup;
        (iii) anindigenouslanguage,differentfromthecommonregionallanguage(e.g.Javanese);
        (iv)     the presence o f customary social and political institutions; and
        (v)      primarily subsistence-oriented production

Framework

5.      Isolatedvulnerable people are not prevalent in all the project sites-they     are likely to be found in
particular kotakabupaten o f particular provinces. The following steps will be taken to ensure that, where
isolated vulnerable groups exist, the project caters to their specific needs.


        (1)      Duringthe facilitator training, facilitators will be trained inthe identification of isolated
                 vulnerable people. Through the Community Self Survey exercise and poverty
                 reflections, facilitators will identify the presence and numbers o f isolatedvulnerable
                 groups inthe community and report this to the OCs.
        (ii) Fortheareaswhereisolatedvulnerablegroupsareidentified,OCswillorganizean
                 orientation training for relevant facilitators in how to work with isolated vulnerable
                 groups ina useful way to identify mechanisms for effective participation, and address
                 specific challenges in workmg with such groups, for example, how to deal with groups
                 that may be in conflict with the larger community, etc.
        (iii) Sincefacilitators willbehiredlocallytotheextentpossible,theyareexpectedtobe
                 familiar with such groups. They will also be rotated as necessary to ensure that those that
                 have been trained inworking with isolated vulnerable groups, or have specific skills that
                 would be beneficial in working with such groups, are made available in the rightplaces.
                 Management o f facilitators will be handled by the OCs.




                                                        80

        (iv)      Where isolated vulnerable groups are identified, efforts will be made to ensure that at
                  least one Community Cadre i s from the group and able to communicate easily with the
                  group.
        (v)       Where the isolatedvulnerable group speaks a language different from Bahasa Indonesia,
                  relevant brochures and documents will be translated inthe appropriate language.
                  Provision has been made inthe project budget to allow for additional translations o f
                  relevant project documents.

6.      These steps will be aimed at ensuringthat isolated vulnerable people participate fully inthe
project, are aware o f their rights and responsibilities, and are able to voice their needs duringthe
Community Self Survey exercise and in the foimulation o f the Community Development Plan. In
addition, they will be encouraged to submit sub-project proposals that cater to their group's needs.

Monitoringand GrievanceProcedures

7.      The Terms o f References for the OC and N M C include the responsibility for monitoring the
treatment o f isolated vulnerable people in the project. Where isolated vulnerable people are identified,
the OCs will berequiredto report on their participationinthe project. Provisionswill be made inthe
MIS systemto monitor the involvement ofisolated vulnerable people. This will be followed bythe NMC
as well as monitored during supervision missions.

8.      The project has a complaint systemthat allows community members to raise issues or complaints
at various levels-at   the kelurahan level, at the OC level (either at kota/kabupaten or province level), and
at the national level. There are designated staffs at the OC and N M C responsible for following up on
complaints and ensuring that they are handled adequately. Where isolated vulnerable people are
concerned, the facilitatoriOC will ensure that grievance redress mechanisms are developed in culturally
appropriate ways in close collaborationwith the relevant group.

9.       Project evaluation studies will include monitoring and evaluation o f the impact o f the project on
isolated vulnerable people.

Supervision Strategy

1.       The large number o fkelurahan covered under the project and their geographically dispersed
locations require an innovative approach to supervision. The presence o f the Bank team inthe field office
inJakarta is critical, and this teamwill be incharge of supervision. Since three similar projects are in
operation, a programmatic supervision approach will be used usingthe same team members to ensure
consistency o f strategy and policies amongst the projects.

2.       The first two years of implementation are the most critical. Duringthisperiod, the Task Team
will field at least two full supervisionmissions for the entire UPP program. Inbetween, the Task Team in
the field office will carry out two brief supervision follow up visits to various areas o f the project. Key
issues that supervision missions will focus on will be consultant management and performance), and
activities at the kelurahan level. The strategy will be to visit as many kelurahanand OCs as possible
duringthe critical part of the project implementation. It is expected that annually, the team will carry out
a thorough review of all OCs, at least 30 local governments, and 120 BKMs,and interview about 1,100
poor households. At least 3% o f the total participatingkelurahanwill be visited annually, and over 15%
o f kelurahanby the end o f the project.

3 .      This approachhas beentested duringUPP 1Phase 2 and has been found to be effective. The
Bank i s proposing to open new field offices in the regions. A member o f the Task Team could potentially
be located inthe proposed Maltasar office to supervise the eastern regions under the project. This will be
further assessed during implementation. The Task Team intends to collaborate with other Bank
supervision teams such as K D P to carry out joint supervision missions.

4.       At the central management level, a monthly meeting will be carried out betweenthe Task Team
with the PMUand the NMC to review the status o f the agreed actionplan as well as progress o f the
program based on the monthly update o f the MIS.

5.       The Task Team will also establish a network with NGOs at the central and local level. Under
UPP1, the Task Team hiredan NGO with a large network in the regions, to carry out random supervision
inabout 100ltelurahans. The outcome was extremely useful,particularly inre-orienting the direction of
UPP and giving rise to the new approaches applied under UPP2. This strategy will continue under UPP3.

Human Resources Required

6.       The Task Team will consist mainly of Bank staff located inWBOJ and one HQstaffthat will
provide strategic assistance on technical matters and evaluation. In addition, at least five short-term
national consultants will be hired annually to carry out various specific activities o f the project. They will
include a community development specialist, poverty expert, data analysis expert and micro credit expert.
On an annual basis, an expert from ESSD will be invited to provide a technical review o f the project. This
will be carried out within the context o f Bank funded CDD projects across Indonesia. For the impact
evaluation, an expert from the Development Research Group (DEC) will be included as part o f Task
Team.

                           INDONESIA: Third Urban Poverty Project

        Increasingthe outreach of prudentialmicro credit services for low-income groups
                                   through community organizations

1. How to ApproachBKMMicrocreditinUPP3

Like in the Second Urban Poverty Project (UPP2), the entry point and focus o f the UPP3 approach i s
the BKM. Aiming at contributing to improving the welfare of the urbanpoor, UPP3 focuses on
enabling BKM and communities to deliver and utilize services that are responsive to the needs and
demand of the poor. Based on the identification o f beneficiaries and their needs, BKMs may choose
to provide micro credit to low-income groups and a revolving fund for this purpose.

Ifthis choice were made, UPP3 successwould hingeon the capacity ofBKMto manage credit and
revolving funds, and on the capacity of credit groups and their members to plan and manage loan use.
Whether or not the BKMcan sustain its revolving fund will depend on credit quality and financial
management capacity. UPP3 gives BKM and community groups the opportunity choices among
various poverty reducing activities. Zf BKM and community groups opt for micro credit, however,
UPP3 will require them to observe project rules and prudential micro credit standards. The UPP3
micro credit approach will focus on ensuring the quality of both the lender and the borrower side. On
both sides the approach has two entry points: (i)  clearly defined eligibility criteria for BKM,the
manager o f any revolving fund operation (an UPK designated by the BKM), and Community groups
to start credit activities; and (ii)
                                  project support to strengthen BKM,U P K and community groups in
their function to manage credit activities.

UPP3 rules and support services will reflect different organization and management needs depending
on the size o f revolving funds. The approach makes a pragmatic distinction between BKMwith
revolving funds smaller than IDK 100 million (=BKMA) and BKMwith revolving funds larger than
IDR 100million(=BKMB).

2. Objectives and Support Strategy

BKMshould aim at decreasingthe demand-supply gap of institutional micro finance. This requires
that low-income groups without access to institutional micro finance are well targeted and provided
with services that reflect their real demand. Therefore, the development objective o f the UPP3
micro credit support strategy will be: BKM have increased outreach to low-income groups with
prudential credit sewices and revolvingfund nzanagenzent.

The direct target group o fthe micro credit support strategy is the BKWUPK. The indirecttarget
group are low-income groups to which BKMAJPK provide credit services. The target group
definition of the micro credit strategy is: Low-income groups withprofitable business opportunities
and adequate repayment capacities who have no current access to institutional credit providers or
other prograin credit.

To ensure that the micro credit development objective will be achieved, project implementation will
focus on producing five micro credit support outputs:

             BKMare eligible andpreparedto usekelurahan grants for revolvingfundactivities.
         0   Credit groups and members are eligible and prepared to use credit effectively.
             BKM/UPK capacity to manage credit and revolving funds is strengthened.
             BKM/UPK information and supervision system is well functioning.

3. Approach for Targeting Low-income Groups in UPP3

While UPP3 targets poorer kelurahan, it provides room for flexible community "self-targeting" o f
project beneficiaries. This approach will be generally maintained, but credit targeting requires
unmistakable information, guidelines and eligibility criteria to ensure increasing outreach to and
preventing negative effects for low-income borrowers.

The definition of "low-income borrowers" mustbepragmatic and easy enough to serve as a
guideline for "self-screening" by community members, and it must be broad enough to include access
poor with business opportunities who do not fall under the poverty line o f the extremely poor. The
definition proposed here is: Borrowersfrom households with ala aizizualper capita income plus
savings lower than the value of 1,000 kg rice per capita calculated at localprices.

The UPP3 credit targeting approachwill consist of credit eligibility criteria and three indirect
targeting steps:

           (i)  Identifying community members for new credit group formation: information
                disseminated about credit functions, target group and eligibility criteria; potential
                credit group membersidentified through community self-screening process; eligible
                candidates select their peers to start with the credit group formation process.
           (ii)Screeningcrediteligibilitythroughcreditgroupformation.Creditgroup
                formation (both new and existing groups) will be about supplying evidence for credit
                eligibility. This includes a) becoming capable o f analyzing and planning household
                economy, businesses and credit, and b) ensuring that groups and members are eligible
                for submitting loan proposals.
           (iii)Indirecttargetingthroughlendingpolicies.Discourageborrowersoutsideofthe
                target group by lendingpolicies: loan approval dependent on compliance with credit
                eligibility criteria; maximum loan ceiling for first time borrowers to IDR 500,000 and
                for subsequent loans to IDR 2 million; maximum loan term o f 12 months but in line
                with loanuse; at least monthly installment frequency and interest payments; interest
                rates that reflect current rates o f local banks, operating and loan loss costs, and the
                need to sustain the net value o f capital.

8. Organization and Management of UPP3 Microcredit Support Strategy

8.1 Actors and Roles
                     Community cadres together with kelurahanfacilitators are the key persons for
                     ensuring quality on the borrower side. They will be involved in carrying out
                     credit group training, assisting the groups inplanning and monitoring activities,
                     and monitoring credit eligibility.
                     Kelurahan facilitators manage UPP3 field implementation. For the micro
                     credit support system, they have to manage credit group support and to assist the
                     community cadres. They are responsible for ensuring and evaluating credit
                     group eligibility.
                     OC and regional micro credit expert. The OC micro credit expert will be
                     managing all inputso f the micro credit support system. He/she will cooperate
                     with and supervise the SKM/UKM CS provider. He/she will cooperate with the
                     central micro credit team, especially inmonitoring, evaluating and improving the
                     UPP3 micro credit system. Two database operators will assist the OC micro
                     credit expert.
                     External S K M / U K M consultancy and supervision provider will ensure that:

                     Central micro credit team. The team will consist o f at least three micro credit
                     experts and will be steering all activities (design, planning, training, technical
                     assistance, monitoring and evaluation) o f the micro credit support system. For
                     this purpose, the team will closely cooperate with the OC micro credit expert and
                     the regional SKMLJKM consultancy and supervision institutions. Two database
                     operators will assist the team.

8.2 Monitoring & Evaluation of Microcredit Support Performance
Project monitoring and evaluation aims at measuring project performancebased on planned
objectives, outputs, activities and inputs.The monitoring and evaluation o f micro credit support
performance will be based on the logical framework presented below. It includes 29 performance
indicators that will be used to assess whether or not the objective and five outputs o f the support
strategy are achieved. The regional and the national consultants will cany out M&E o f micro credit
support performance. The central and OC micro credit experts will provide major inputs.

8.3 Monitoring & Evaluation (Supervision) of S K M K J K MPerformance
Revolving fund monitoring and evaluation aims at improvingthe quality o f S K M L J K M services and
management. The monitoring and evaluation o f SKMLJKM performance will be based on a


                                                  98

standardized accounting and financial reporting system. Information that can be derived from the
systemincludes information about credit transactions and quality, loanportfolio quality, and
SKM/UKM soundness with regard to management and financial aspects.

To ensure reliable and complete credit information as well as reliable assessments o f SKM/UKM
soundness, monitoring and evaluation o f SKMIUKMperformance will be made an element o f
SKMKJKM supervision. The project will hire capable extemal CS providers, who will work on the
basis o f standard terms o f reference and instruments prepared by the project. The CS providers are
responsible for delivering good quality data and carefully prepared reports on SKMAJKM
performance to the project. The OC micro credit expert and the central micro credit team for project
management and reportingpurposes will process this information.




                      A note on micro enterprise development approaches and
                            the heterogeneity of the micro enterprise sector
Micro enterprise support may comprise approaches such as capacity building for micro entrepreneurs,
production and marketing support, micro credit services, and institution buildingo f both micro credit
providers and micro entrepreneur organizations. Micro enterprise development projects differ with
regardto the emphasis given to one o f these approaches and, depending on the approach, with regard
to outreach scope.
Direct micro enterprise developnieiit approaches support the expansion o f micro enterprises and
their graduation to the small enterprise sector. They may provide the whole range o fassistance
required and are able to facilitate sustainable enterprise growth, but they reach only a small number o f
micro entrepreneurs because they must focus on the development o f individual businesses.
Poverty-oriented approaclres aim to integrate low-income people into the micro enterprise sector and
are more concerned with the formation o f family-based micro businesses. Either outreach i s limited
by the complex and direct support needed for enterprise formation, or the aim o freachingas many o f
the poor as possible reduces the quality of direct support services.
Group-oriented approaches try to cope with this challenge by delivering services and strengthening
micro entrepreneurs indirectly through their groups and associations. While this approach allows for
increasing outreach, it requires considerable investment in the institutional development o f micro
entrepreneur organizations.
Minimalist micro credit approaches focus on providing credit and often use group lendingto channel
credit. They have the advantage o f reaching a large number o f low-income people by focusing on one
service, but they must neglect the multi-facetedneeds o f micro entrepreneurs.
Micropitarice imtitutiori developinelat approaclies focus on the development o f institutions that are
able to sustain financial services to a growing number o f low-income people. These approaches can
meet demand with good quality services, but they also lack attention to the complex development
needs o f micro businesses.
All mentioned approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. The preference for one ofthe
approaches or a combination o f approaches depends on development objectives and expected
outreach to the heterogeneous micro enterprise universe. The micro enterprise sector covers a great
diversity o f businesses, technology, and organization o f production, market linkages, entrepreneurial
attitude, and local economic conditions. The heterogeneity o f the micro enterprise sector results in a
highvariance ofneeds, which require different types of assistance. This makes it impossibleto
standardize support strategies and difficult for large projects that are not specialized inmicro

enterprise development to effectively support the development o f many individual micro
entrepreneurs.
Options for UPP3
UPP3 i s a large project interms o f area covered and beneficiaries targeted. Project implementers at
the local level are burdenedwith many tasks other than micro credit and micro enterprise
development, and usually lack the skills requiredfor supporting micro enterprise development. This
situation limits the choices for the UPP3 micro enterprise development approach. It i s not realistic to
envisage a direct approach for assisting individual micro entrepreneurs.
The UPP3 micro credit strategy takes an indirect approach and includes the minimalist micro credit
and the group-oriented approaches mentioned above:

             0        ifthey opt for micro credit, BKM-UPK will beassistedto provide credit services
                      that meet the real demand o f low-income borrowers and their micro businesses;
             0        credit eligibility criteria try to ensure that borrowers with profitable businesses
                      are reached; and
             0        the credit group formation processwill be directed at ensuring that loanproposals
                      are prepared on the basis o f the real business opportunities o fborrowers, and will
                      include capacity building for borrowers to analyze and plan their businesses.
Beyond this micro credit and group approach, UPP3 will apply the following approaches to support
the development o f micro enterprises:

             0        Local consultants, kelurahan facilitators, and BKM will be trained to identify
                      micro-enterprise development needs, and to assist micro-entrepreneur groups
                      through facilitating access to governmental and non-govemmental service
                      providers.
             0        Inselected cities, UPP3 may start pilot programs by sub-contracting capable
                      micro-enterprise development organizations that focus on providing services to
                      the project's target groups. This requires that such organizations exist, and have
                      intimate and local knowledge o f the micro-enterprise sector.
             0        A major constraint for micro-entrepreneurs is the lack o f information. A possible
                      pilot would be to support BKMindeveloping information centers where the
                      kelurahan community can exchange information and has access to product and
                      marketing information. Also such a pilot would have to be out-sourced to capable
                      micro-enterprise development organizations.
                      UPPl has had little knowledge on the micro-enterprise activities o f its target
                      group. An asset for UPP3 in developing adequate approaches such as the ones
                      mentioned above would be to conduct a series o f studies on the business
                      constraints and opportunities o f credit group members.

                                 Annex 17: Monitoring and Evaluation
                              INDONESIA: Third Urban Poverty Project

1.       Monitoring and evaluation i s a key feature o f projects that are community driven and widely
dispersed. A number o f important lessons have been learned through the experience with monitoring and
evaluation inUPP1. The two main issues in UPPl were the following:

         (i)      Independent monitoring and evaluation consultants (M&E consultants) were hired for the
                  duration o f the project. The National Management Consultant (NMC), which was in
                  charge o f project management, was also assigned monitoring tasks. This created some
                  confusion on who was responsible for project monitoring. The N M C relied on the M&E
                  consultants to monitor performance, and since there was little ownership by N M C o f the
                 results, monitoring reports were not consistently usedby the NMC to make management
                  decisions.
         (ii)    The N M C was in charge o f setting up a computerized Management Information System
                  (MIS). The Oversight Consultants (OCs),who came onboardprior to the NMC, had
                  already developed their own monitoring systems by the time the M I S was set up, with the
                 result that some OCs had dual monitoring systems. This sometimes made it difficult to
                  obtain consistent data for project monitoring.

2.       These lessons have been incorporated into a revised M&E system for UPP3. Like in UPP2, in
UPP3 the monitoring and evaluation tasks will be separated, with monitoring made the responsibility o f
NMC, while evaluation tasks will be contracted out to separate consultants on a task-by-task basis.

ImplementationMonitoring

3.       InUPP3,project monitoringwill be the full responsibility of the NMC. The N M C will be hired
prior to the OCs, and the OCs trained by the NMC, including training inthe use o f the MIS. Monitoring
will be done with a view to analyzing and improving project management and the results used to make
management decisions.

4.       The MIS systemhas been redesignedfor UPP2 to streamline data collection and the method o f
collection o f the UPP1. Because there will three projects operating at the same time, the M I S for all these
projects will have to be integrated and standardize. A team under PMUwill be established to integrate
the M I S under UPP1, UPP2, and UPP3. Currently, the team i s developingthe integrated MIS.
Monitoringinfonnation will be entered into the system usingweb-based data entry screens (a paper-based
system will also exist as a backup and for areas that do not have easy access to Computerized systems).
Facilitatorswill enter kelurahan specific information into the system, for which they will receive training.
Community cadres and BKMs will also be assisted in usingthe monitoring systems, which they will be
able to continue to use once the project has concluded. The information will be transferred electronically
to the OC and NMC. OCs will provide assistance to facilitatorsiBKMs to operate the system and, where
technical resources are insufficient, enter the information provided by the facilitators/BKM into the
system. OCs will also enter their process implementation monitoring data into the system. Monitoring
data will be available at all levels, allowing for BKMs to benchmark their performance with those o f their
neighbors. The systemwill be set up so that it can generate reports for local governments at each level.

5.       The monitoring system will take account o f the open menunature o f the project while, at the
same time, generating comparable information for investments which are frequently chosen by BKMs.
For instance, if the BKM chooses to allocate part o f their funds as a revolving fund for micro credit, they



                                                      102

will be requiredto fumishmonitoring information for this component using the centrally designed
system. The thematic teams in the hTMC in charge o f the project components (community development,
micro credit activities, the PAPG, and socialization and training) will utilize the information generated
through this system.

Project Evaluation

6.       Project evaluation will consist o f a series o f impact evaluation studies and a number o f studies to
be determinedover the course o f the project. Evaluation Consultants will be hired on a periodic basis,
first to carry out a baseline survey, and subsequentlyto carry out follow-up surveys and evaluation studies
at least three times over the project period. The surveys will investigate the project-govemance-poverty
linkinaddition to the project-investment-povertylink. A control group o furbankecamatans which are
not included in UPP3 will be included in the surveys. The objective o f the studies i s to determine the
effectiveness o f the intervention and the underlying causes. A combination o f data from the Management
Information System and the above- described surveys will be used to provide an analysis o f the impact o f
the project. The studies are scheduled such that they can feedback into the project design.

7.       The studies will aim at measuring the impact o f the UPP intervention on local level governance
and poverty. A control group o f urban sub-districts will be included inthe survey to obtain the
counterfactual. The 2003 village census data will be usedto find similar control sub-districts. Although
the excluded sub-districts are excluded because they score the highest on a welfare indicator (also
constructed from the village census) it i s expected that it will be possible to find matches which are
similar to the treatment group. The reason i s that the exclusion o f the richest sub-districts was done by
district. So also in poor districts, some sub-districts have been excluded increasing the likelihood that we
are able to find appropriate control group sub-districts for poor treatment sub-districts. Any remaining
selection bias will be dealt with by applying differences in differences and possibly instrumental
variables. The advantage o f having a baseline survey i s that one i s able to apply difference in differences
and, inaddition, test for the validity o f instrumental variables to be used in later impact studies.

8.        The instruments and methodology to be applied will be developed inclose cooperation with the
P M U and the World Bank. The Evaluation consultant will needto obtain approval from these institutions
before fielding the surveys.

9.        There will be a separate allocation o f funds to hire local NGOs, universitiesor qualified
individuals to carry out ad-hoc evaluations or surveys on an as-needed basis. An example could be case
studies to study the reasons for success o f the best performing BKMs. The project will also seek to
establish independent "watchdogs" for the project, for example, newspapers which could be contracted to
write articles about how UPP3 operates on a regular basis. This has been done successfully in KDP. The
project will provide full access to monitoring, financial and evaluation data to these "watchdogs".

                          DraftTerms of Referencesfor EvaluationConsultants

1,        National Evaluation Consultants (NEC) will be charged with carrying out a baseline survey at the
beginning o f the project, and 3 impact evaluations, before the mid-term review, after the mid-term review,
andjust before project completion. Evaluations will focus o n measuring project impact o n the ground.
Consultants will b e hired initially for the baseline survey with a provision for sole sourcing for the
subsequent contracts depending o n their Performance.

2.        The responsibilities o f NEC are to:
                 (i)      Conduct a baseline survey and study (early 2005).
                 (ii)     Conduct subsequent follow-up impact evaluation survey and studies (3 over a 5
                          year project cycle)

NECwill be independent and hire its own staff. It will not rely on project staff for implementation.

3.        The objective o f the UPP project is to increase the capacity for collective action inurban
communities and to increase the level o f urban services. The studies will investigate the success o f the
three components o f the UPP project, that is: (i)   community development; (2) the kelurahan grant
program; and (3) the PAPG program. The success i s evaluated by: (i)the targeting o f the program (did
the program reach the poor?); (ii) impact o f the program (did the beneficiaries benefit from the
                                    the
program?); and (iii)expected sustainability o f the component. Sustainability will be measured by
investigating whether the UPP interventions has an impact o n local level governance and community
empowerment (outside o f the UPP project).

4.        Besides measuring the impact, the studies will also:

                 (i)      describe the level o f the performance indicators. A set o f easily quantifiable
                          performance indicators i s listed at the end o f this TOR. Inaddition, a second set
                          i s provided o f indicators which are more subjective for which the consultant will
                          need to develop an appropriate measure:
                 (ii)     collect and analyze the factors which may effect the impact o f the UPP
                          interventions;
                 (iii)    collect and analyze data regarding the implementation o f the UPP project (for
                          pre-mid temi review and project completion impact evaluation);
                 (iv)     analyze the causal factors o f the impact results; and
                 (v)      provide recommendations for improvements inproject design and
                          implementation.

5.        The studies will be based on data from the project management information system and surveys
to be designed and fielded by NEC. NEC may use existing statistical data sources collected by the bureau
o f statistics.

6.        The surveys will also collect information from a control group o f urban kecamatans from the
same provinces as where the UPP3 operated but which did not enter into the project. The control group
kelurahans should be selected o n the basis o f similarity pre-intervention characteristics with the
kecamatans which will participate in UPP.




                                                       104

7.      NEC will make all reports, completed questionnaires, survey design, training documents,
documented data files and programs used for the study available to the PMUupon completion o f the
assignment.

Baseline survey

8.      The objective ofthe baseline study is to document the levels ofpoverty at the start o f the project
as measured by the performance indicators. The consultant i s expected to develop questionnaires to
measure the indicators in close cooperation with the PMU and the World Bank. Before each survey, the
N E C will submit the instruments and a methodology document to the PMUand the World Bank. The
N E C will need to obtain approval from these institutions before fielding the surveys.

9.      It is expected that the survey will apply both structured questionnaires as well as participatory
methods. Inaddition to the performance indicators, the survey will collect information on background
characteristics which could also influence the performance indicators, historic ability to obtain credit and
grants from other programs and presence and participation in existing community programs. Households
and key informants will be interviewedto assess the voice that the poor and community organizations
have inlocal decision-malting.

10.     The baseline survey will also sample from households innon-UPP3 (and non-KDP) urban
kecamatans inthe provinces where UPP3 operates, This sample will form the control group.

11.     The baseline survey will collect information from 3,300 households living in 110 kelurahans.
The sample will be drawn according to the following stratificationrules. 22 strata are defined by the
kotas and other urban areas ineach o f the provinces where UPP3 will be active. From each o f the strata 2
kecamatans inwhich UPP i s active will be selected. In each o f the kecamatans 2 kelurahans will be
randomly selected. Inaddition, from each o f the strata 1 control group kelurahanwill be selected. Ineach
kelurahan 30 randomly selected respondents will be interviewed. The survey will also survey 2 key
informants ineach kelurahan. This will add about 220 people to the sample size.

Impact Evaluation Studies

12.      Subsequent impact evaluation studies (approximately every 1.5 years) will collect the same
information as the baseline survey. In addition, the survey will collect information on the implementation
o f UPP and the beneficiaries o f the kelurahan grant activities. It will also collect infonnation on the
success o f the PAF activities to that date. The consultant will work from the questionnaires which were
developed for the baseline survey with additions for the new coniponents. New components will be
developed to interview grant and credit beneficiaries. The questionnaires will also be adjusted to measure
the success o f the implementationo f the UPP components. The surveys will be developed in close
cooperation with the PMU and World Bank and approval needs to be obtained from these institutions
before fielding the survey.

13.     The surveys will be fielded in the same kelurahans as the baseline survey. The survey will
interview the key informants which were also included in the baseline. Inaddition, one UPP facilitators a
BKMmemberwill be included a key informant. As inthe baseline, the survey will sample 30 households
ineachkelurahan. The samplingwill be adjusted to the broadened scope by selecting household as
follows:
                 (i)     10 households drawn at random from the kelurahanpopulation;
                 (ii)    10 households drawn at random from those who have obtained micro credit; and
                 (iii)   10 households drawn at random from those who directly benefited from demand
                         driven grant activities.


                                                     105

14.     For the final survey, prior to project completion, households will be re-sampled (possibly also
beneficiaries). The design o f the questionnaire will be adjusted by the consultant to collect information
on expected sustainability o f the project.

                        Annex 18: Strategy to Reduce Fraud and Corruption
                              INDONESIA: Third Urban Poverty Project

I.ExecutiveSiininzavy

1.       The objective o f the UPP 3 Anti-Corruption Action Plan is to identify corruption risks and
mitigation measures beyond the standard control systems employed by the Bank. While more detailed,
program specific control systems are outlined in Annex 7: FinancialManagement & Disbursement
Arrangements and Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements, this Action Plan: (i) potential risks o f
                                                                                   maps
corruption; and (ii) presents program activities to address these risks inthe form of an Action Plan.

2.       The project follows a learning approach and implementation experiences will be continually
incorporated into the implementationprocesses. The Anti-Corruption Action Plan should therefore be
seen as a starting point and not an all-inclusive list o f mitigation measures.

3.       CorruptionMapping. The matrix includedinthis action plan identifies some potential risks o f
corruption and specifies some appropriate mitigation measures that have been agreed to by Kimpraswil
(see table below: Corruption Mapping Matrix). The mapping exercise i s repeated during the lifetime o f
the project to incorporate innovations and lessons learned.

4.       The Action Plan. The strategy of anti corruptionhas been developed for two separate entities,
i.e., one at the central level (involving Kimpraswil as the Executing Agency), and one at the community
level (as the beneficiaries o f the Project as well as the implementing units o f the sub projects).
Community level participation and empowerment are crucial to the success o f the project. Together,
these factors will inspire greater accountability and better governance. This Project empowers the
community (the beneficiary o f this Project) to officially manage the sub projects and be responsible for
the technical quality o f deliveries and output at the Kelurahan level. The design o f the project
incorporates careful socialization and transparent management techniques that enable the necessary
participation and empowerment. Active participation from within the members o f the community i s
requiredinplanning and developing sub projects. Inaddition, the Program provides funds channeled
directly to the community, i.e., to the BKMaccount inthe case o f Kelurahan Grants and to the
Dinas/BKMjoint account inthe case o f the Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant. Once the beneficiaries
fulfill the draw down conditions, the fLnds are remitted from the Special Account within a few days.
Simple, standard formats are used for recording and reporting the use o f funds. This simplification
reduces the need for special skills whilst malting the system more transparent and accountable. Through
active participation, there i s a greater likelihood o f communities to demand services o f the urban local
governments and ensure that resources earmarked for effective management and to iniprove their
livelihoods are transparently accounted for.

5.        Some o f the most important aspects o f the anti corruption action plan can be summarized into the
five key elements that follow. Undeqinning each o f these elements is the careful consultative process that
ensures participation and empowerment.

              A) EnhancedDisclosureProvisions and Transparency. The program will take the Bank's
                  new disclosure provisions one step furtherby simplifying disclosed material and making
                  them readily available through public information centers. Salient information will be
                  made readily available to communities by a range o f other means, including public
                  meetings and notice boards. Specific disclosure measures will include, but not be limited
                  to:




                                                         109

         Public disclosure o f annual procurement plans and schedules (and their updates),
         bidding documents and requests for proposals.
         Disclosure to all bidders o f the summary o f the evaluation and comparison o f bids,
         proposals, offers, and quotations, after the successful bidder i s notified.
   0     Disclosure o f audit reports.

B) Civil Society Oversight. The programrecognizes that greater oversight by civil society
   i s likely to reduce the risk o f corruption and misuse o f power. The program involves a
   highdegree of formal participationby community groups within the areas o f
  beneficiaries, the private sector, and traditionalladat and religious leaders, through the
   monitoring o f the projectdend results, memberships of the tender committee, and the
   evaluation o f the quality o f delivery procured services/products.


   0     Existing NGOs and other civil society organizations will be involved in a variety o f
         ways, inter alia: (i)through participation in the regional workshops; (ii)   as key
         resource persons for the development o f CDPs where possible; (iii) members o f
                                                                                   as
         the PAPG Selection Committee; (iv) as evaluators on an ad-hoc basis; and (v) as
         training providers inparticular skill areas.

C) Mitigating Collusion,Fraud & Nepotism, Opportunity for collusion and fraud exist in
   any project. However, since the central theme of this project i s improved and more
   responsive governance, many o f the possible risks are mitigated as a result o f the design.
   Transparent and well-advertised procurement under the program with appropriate
   oversight will reduce this form o f corruption. Additional auditing and procurement
  procedures are proposed, such as oversight by technical assistance and capacity building
   TA procurement and financial management specialists mappedto eachregion. At the
   central level, there will be a committee to be formed to regularly evaluate the
  performance o f the consultants who are hired under the Project, and make the results
   circulated to the relevant technical parties. Cases o f collusion, fraud and nepotism will be
   reported directly to the authorized agency mandated under the Indonesianlaw, which i s
   the attorney general office. Inthe case o f collusion, fraud and nepotism within the
   community, the cases will first be reported, discussed, and decided at the community
   meeting (RembugWarga) prior to their submission to the attorney general office.
   Experience in other CDD projects indicates that many risks can be mitigated by the threat
   and use o f community-based sanctions such as those used under UPP Iand 11.

D) Complaints HandlingMechanism. Complaint handlingprocedures as currently defined
   inthe Keppres 80/2003 will be strictly followed by also assigning authorizedofficials to
   be responsible for maintaining a database o f complaints and the follow up actions. While
   the program i s designed to encourage local complaint resolution through formal channel,
   as well as the pressure from public, in some cases local elites mightmisuse power and
  program activities. For these cases, an altemative system has been established through a
   feedback mechanism at the national level. A special unit designated for handling o f
   complaints will be made available inthe NMC and OCs. The complaint-handling unit
   will investigate and facilitate the resolution o f complaints and problems. The database o f
   complaints, follow-up actions being taken, and sanctions applied will be publicized to
   increase participants' involvement and to increase the likelihood o ftheir lodgingprotests,
   thereby raising the social costs o f misuse o f funds. This mechanism handles complaints
  brought to their attention. These complaints will be acted upon in a professional and
   timely fashion, and without risk o f reprisal to 'whistleblowers'inthe public. The
   complaint handling mechanism developed under the Project also provides wider access


                                           110

                      for the community for raising and monitoring the complaint through the establishment o f
                      an address to mail complaints, which will be posted in the kelurahan's signboards.

  6.       Sanctions & Remedies. Clear sanctions andremediesare important final steps inthe effort to
  fight corruption. As already exercised inUPP 1and 2, this program has a low tolerance for corruption.
  Communities are encouraged to impose reasonable sanctions on citizens who abuse the power that has
  been entrusted to them. There i s an increasing wealth o f anecdotal evidence suggesting that such
  sanctions can be more easily applied and more effective than protracted legal proceedings, especially in
  smaller cases o f corruption. The project does not endorse vigilantism or extreme community sanctions,
  but inmany cases the communities can reach amicable resolutions without resorting to the slow and over-
  burdened legal system (see box for example). That said, fomial sanctions might also be applied. For
  example, any official (government, non-government, etc.), community members, or private sector entity
  participating inthe project can be prosecuted if sufficient evidence i s available. In all procurement
  contracts, evidence o f corruption, collusion or nepotism will result intermination o f the relevant contract,
  possibly with additional penalties imposed (such as fines, blacklisting, etc.) in accordance with Bank and
  Government regulations. Draw down o f funds from the project Special Account to BKMs will be
  suspendedincases where significant misuse o f funds is suspected. At a larger scale, entire Kota (s) may
  be excluded from participation inthe subsequent phase ifmisuse o f funds i s suspected to occur widely in
  the respective Kota (s). Information regarding successful cases, where lessons are learned and funds are
  retrieved, will be widely disseminated.

~~           ~
  Box 1: typicalexample of community action against corruption
  Inone recent case the community decidedto holdamotorcycle, owned by the local treasurer, as collateral
  untilmissingfunds (Rp.3 Million or $375) were accountedfor andretumed. The treasurer was given a
  week to returnthe funds. This was far faster than entering into a legal battle that might well cost far more
  than the missing amount and take months to resolve.

  7.       Limitingthe occurrence o fcorruption inthis Project starts with identifying potential riskareas -
  this is called corruption mapping. This corruption incentive mappingand identification o f opportunities
  for corruption will be repeated at least every six months as the project progresses and lessons are leamed.

had lent Rp 10million to some friends to start a business trading inginger. A group of community
members decidedto form a team-Tim PenyelamatDanaP2KP or `Team to safeguard UPP Funds' .
Their primary objective was to remove the old BKM. One strategy was to socializethe problemto the
broader community and gainer their support to this end. A second strategy was pushing for the support
o f the Bappeda, the chair of the Government Coordinatioii Team for UPP. After a series of meetings at
the Bappeda, the old chaimian BKMagreedto step down.

BKMCipadung,Bandung:The treasurer was accusedof embezzlingaroundRp. 100millionofthe
funds. The money was usedto buildaprivate Islamic school. The treasurer created two fictitious
KSMs,markingup the amountsrequestedby the KSMs,andhoarding repayments. The community
formed a Tim PenyelamatDanaP2KP (Teamto SafeguardUPP Funds). This team with the help of the
facilitator, acted as a pressure group to solve this case. However, the problemcould not be solved at the
community level. Eventually, the case was formally reported to the police and the suspect was
detained.

organizations that truly represent all people in the community. It i s also important for providing services

mainstreaming and equality.

                                       Annex 21: TargetingStrategy
                              INDONESIA: Third UrbanPoverty Project

1.        The initial target group o f poor people i s approximately 1,736 kelurahans in all provinces in
Sumatera, East Kalimantan, East Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, Malulcu archipelago, and Papua. UPP3 also
targets 660 existing B K M s the district/municipality o f U P P l and UPP2, which are West Java, East Java,
Central Java, West Nusa Tenggara, West Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, and Central Sulawesi.
Targeting will be carried out using differentmeans:

2.       Experiences with various poverty targeted programs across Indonesia show that the particular
design o f a program has limited impact o n the effectiveness o f targeting. The effectiveness o f targeting
was more dependent o n the nature o f the service/goods being delivered than the project rules. The project
uses a two-stage targeting method. The process inthe first stage tries to reach poor kelurahan, and in the
second stage, it tries to reach the poor within these kelurahan.

I. TargetingofNewLocationsforKelurahangrants

First Order Targeting

3.        Based o n simulation exercises carried out for UPP3 provinces and inthe spirit of decentralization,
this project chose to operate inall kelurahan inthe selected provinces, and useda simple exclusionary
strategy. The selection o f targeted location nomination i s illustrated inthe diagram below.

4.        All district/municipalities already participatinginUPP1and UPP2 were excluded. All kecamatan
already participating inKDP were excluded. From the remaining, the kelurahans regarded as the top 20%
richest, as ranked by a composite score derived from PODES, and which have less than 35% pre-
prosperous (poor) families were excluded. Kelurahans outside the 20% richest kelurahans and have more
than 35% pre-prosperous families were eligible to participate. Ifthere are still funds available, kelurahans
which fulfill only one prerequisite (whether outside 20% richest kelurahans or have more than 35% pre-
prosperous families) were allocated as reserve kelurahans to participate. This reserve list will be sorted
based o n ascending order on an average composite score and percentage o f the number of pre-prosperous
family. Further, those reserved kelurahans are weighted again based o n the criteria o f non 20% richest
kelurahans and more than 35% pre-prosperous family, to get eligible kelurahans.

5.        The lists were verified with each local govemment and some adjustments made depending o n
current infonnation from local govemment. For example, some kelurahans in the final list may have
merged with other kelurahans, therefore, some reserve kelurahans are nominated to be targeted
kelurahans.

6.        The final number of target ltelurahan will depend o n funds available. Each participating
kelurahan will be allocated a grant, the value o f which depends o n the size o f the population, as illustrated
inthe table below. For Sumatera, NTT, and East Kalimantan, the minimumamount o f the ltelurahan
grant i s Rp.200 million (US$23,550)/kelurahan.        For Maluku and Papua, the minimumamount i s Rp.300
million/ kelurahan.

Second Order Targeting

8.       Second order targeting to reach the poor within the ltelurahan will be done by the BKMrather
than by project staff or a priori selection. The following measures will be taken to ensure that the BKM
targets project benefits towards the poor in communities.

                     CoiiziizunityDevelopnient Plans. Awareness raising/socialization at the community
                     level will be geared towards identifying poor groups within the kelurahan and
                     planningprograms to support them. The CDPs, which will be developed following a
                     Community Self Survey process using participatory planning methods, will be pro-
                     poor and will be evaluated by project staff to ensure that the process used intheir
                     formulation included the voices o f the poor, thus enabling the community to
                     understand the specific nature o f poverty intheir areas. The CDPs will set the
                     framework for the kinds o fproposals that will be eligible for grants and for revolving
                     funds.

                  0  Revolving F Z ~ I ZRevolving funds will not be targeted directly to the poor. They
                                            ~ S .
                     will rather target community groups (KSMs)with profitablebusiness opportunities
                     and adequate repayment capacities, who have no other access to credit. This i s based
                     on the fact that credit may increase rather than decrease the indebtedness o f very poor
                     households who do not have profitable business opportunities. Indirect means will be
                     used to ensure that the poor benefit more from loans by: (i)      requiring potential
                     borrowers to form groups for loans, and providing loans on group eligibility rather
                     than only individual eligibility; and (ii)loan terms and conditions to discourage
                     borrowers who may have other access to credit (e.g., restricting loan size to small
                     amounts o f Rp 500,000 or US$ 58 for first time borrowers; loan duration inline with
                     loan use with a maximum o f one year; usually monthly installments; and interest
                     rates that reflect credit interest rates o f local banks as well as the cost of operating
                     and maintaining revolving funds).

                     Grant assistancefor poorest and most vulnerablegroups. The CDP may identify
                     extremelypoor or vulnerable groups (e.g., disabled, widows, elderly) whose needs
                     may not be met through improving infrastructure or micro-credit services. Ifthe
                     CDP identifies specific individuals for special grant assistance (such as

  medicinesihealth care, scholarships, food supplements, etc.), up to 10% o f the BKM
  allocation may be used for these targeted populations.

e Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant. This grant will target the partnership
  committee. The committee i s comprised o f district'municipality offices and
  community organization (BKM),which are acceptor o f assistance at targeted
  locations. Targeted location i s districtimunicipality o f implemented UPP location.
  However, due to the limitation o f funds, only some district/municipality will be
  targeted by PAPG grant. Since proposals are beingjointly prepared with BKMs,who
  have already identified priority action for alleviating poverty in their community
  development plans, it i s expected that proposals for the PAPG will also be o f a pro-
  poor nature. A key criterion for evaluating proposals for the poverty Alleviation
  Grant will be the numbers o f poor benefiting from each sub-project.

  Fiirther streizgtlieizing ojexistiiag BKMs. This grant will be targeted to certain
  kelurahans, which have fulfilled the qualification o f self-sufficient performance for
  financing activities in more advance poverty activities. This plan i s targeted the poor
  through its principle o f pro-poor good governance. It will assist the BKMto
  implement few reforms at the Kelurahan level affecting the poor and improve
  various access to the public discussion process, as well advocacy to the rights o f poor

11. Targetingof the selected UPPl and UPP2Kelurahansfor the 2"O grants

9.      All the UPPl and UPP2kelurahan were originally selected usinga similar method as for the
selection o f kelurahans for the initial grants under UPP3 described above. For the 2'ldgrants under UPP3,
which will be offered to selected UPPl and UPP2 kelurahan, the following methodology will be used.
Firstorder targeting will be through the selection o f "well performing BKMs" selected usingthe
following criteria; BKMhas satisfactory financial performance (regular annual audit) and has undergone
second term election (2ndelection) from their o w n initiative, in line with the UPP guidelines, with a
minimumo f 20% ofthe adult population inthe kelurahan casting their ballots for BKMelection.

10.     Second order targeting, will try to reach poorest kelurahans among the selected kelurahans o f
UPPl and UPP2. Any kotaikabupaten selected under the above process with more than five eligible
kelurahans will be qualified. It i s expected that about 20% o f the participatingkelurahans o f UPPl and
UPP2 or about 660 kelurahans will be selected to receive further technical assistance and the 2'ldgrants.
Incase the number of targeted kelurahans resulting from this process is above the available budget, the
kelurahans with the highest number o f poor households will be prioritized.

11.     The final number o f target kelurahan will depend o n funds available. Each participating
kelurahan will receive additional grants o f Rp. 150 million (US$17,650).
