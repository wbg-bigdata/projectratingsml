MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Peru
Sixth Power Project (Loan 2179-PE)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Peru - Sixth Power Project (Loan 2179-PE)"
prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office. The Borrower contributed Part II of
the PCR.
The project objectives of strengthening the major institutions in the power sector, assisting in the
financing of the expansion of electricity production and distribution, and in preparing priority studies for
the sector were partially met. The poor financial performance of Electrolima, the Borrower and principal
beneficiary, and of Electroperu and Hidrandina, borrowers of Electrolima, reflects the Government's
failure to increase power tariffs in line with inflation, and an accelerated growth in operating expenses.
Poor finances, in turn, led to delays in counterpart funds and loan disbursement and impaired
project funding. A plan to redress non-compliance with loan covenants by the Borrower was not
implemented because of the debt service moratorium by the Peruvian Administration which triggered
suspension of disbursement on all Bank loans in May 1987.
Tight financing conditions allowed Electrolima to complete only about 72% of its distribution
network expansion with a delay of three years, part of a major dam and most of the proposed studies,
but only a minor part of the training program. Electroperu discontinued the preparation of an important
hydro scheme, did not show interest in improving its financing planning, and delivered limited training
to the regional companies. Hidrandina completed the study of a major hydroelectric development.
The project cost was US$164.1 million or 64% of the original cost estimate and US$56.3 million
of the US$81.2 million Bank loan was canceled. The negative value of the re-calculated project's rate
of return reflects the very low electricity price taken as a proxy for the project's benefits. The PCR did
not quantify those benefits.
The outcome of the project is rated as unsatisfactory. Despite the crisis faced by the country,
a significant part of the physical objectives were achieved but the project impact on institutional
development was negligible. The sustainability of the project is rated as likely because the reform
initiated in 1992 (inter alia triggered by the crisis) is now nearly complete and the ongoing privatization
of the power sector is likely to remove the uncertainty which surrounded the future performance of the
power sector.
The PCR presents a good account on project implementation and results.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(Loan 2179 - PE)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sixth Power Project, for which Loan
2179-PE in the amount of US$81.2 million was made to Electricidad de Lima (ELECTROLIMA)
with the guarantee of the Republic of Peru. The project was designed to strengthen the major
institutions in the power sector by supporting management and financial reforms, and to assist in
the financing of investment needed to expand production and distribution of electricity. The
project also included preparation of priority engineering studies for the sector.
Although the loan was approved on June 15, 1982 and signed on September 17, 1982, the
Bank did not declare its effectiveness until May 12, 1983, due to the slow authorization of the
Loan Agreement by the Government of Peru and delays in the signature of the subsidiary
agreement between the Borrower, ELECTROLIMA, and the other two agencies,
ELECTROPERU and HIDRANDINA, which had responsibility under the project.
Because Peru discontinued payment of debt service, the Bank suspended disbursements
on all loans to Peru in May 1987. The loan was closed on June 30, 1988. The last disbursement
was on August 17, 1987. The Bank canceled the undisbursed balance of US$55.3 million(68%
of the loan amount) on October 12, 1989.
The PCR was prepared by the Energy and Industry Division of Iatin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and M). A draft of this report
(Part I and Im) was sent to the Borrower and beneficiaries. Their comments were incorporated
into the PCR Part II.
Preparation of the PCR started in October 1992 and is based inter alia, on the data
obtained during a mission to Peru in November 1992, and on the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Credit and Guarantee Agreements for the loan, Project Supervision Reports, correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower, interviews of Bank staff involved in the implementation of
the project, and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(Loan 2179 - PE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The principal objectives of the project were to: (i) strengthen the major institutions in the
power sector by supporting management and financial reforms; (ii) assist in the financing of
priority investments needed to expand production and distribution of electricity; and (iii) support
the preparation of priority engineering studies for the sector, particularly the Mantaro Transfer
project. The project included three main components that were to be executed by
ELECTROLIMA, ELECIROPERU AND HIDRANDINA, respectively and were the following:
(a) construction of ELECTROI.MA's 1982-1986 electricity distribution program and of the
Yuracmayo dam, final design and preparation of bidding documents for expanding the
Transandean tunnel, needed in order to carry out the Mantaro Transfer project, feasibility studies
of two hydroelectric projects and carrying out ELECTROLMA's 1982-1986 staff training
program; (b) preparation of the final design and bidding documents for the Mantaro Transfer
project, technical assistance to improve ELECTROPERU's financial management and carrying
out ELECTROPERU's 1982-1986 staff training program; and (c) preparation of the final design
and bidding documents for the Hidrandina's Mayush hydro project.
Implementation Experience
The project was identified in January 1981. The Government of Peru requested Bank
assistance in financing the development of the hydroelectric resources in the vicinity of Lima and
to accelerate the preparation of several studies of other hydroelectric projects, in order to
minimize the need for new thermal capacity. The project was prepared by ELECTROLIMA and
the engineering components were prepared in connection with the Power Engineering Project
(Loan 1215-PE) and the Water Supply and Power Engineering Project (Loan S-l1 of 1978)
(paras. 7.05-7.06). The loan was approved on June 15, 1982, and signed on September 17, 1982
but did not become effective until May 5, 1983, eight months later than expected during appraisal.
This delay was due to slow authorization of the Loan Agreement by the Government and
additional time needed to allow for the signature of subsidiary agreements between the Borrower
ELECTROLIMA and the other agencies, ELECTROPERU and HDRANDINA, which also had
responsibility under the project. During the project implementation, as a result of non-compliance



with the financial covenants, and pursuant to Section 6.02 of the General Conditions applicable
to the Loan and Guarantee Agreements, the Bank suspended disbursements in November 1986.
The Bank lifted the suspension on disbursements on April 1987, when the Government presented
to the Bank a satisfactory Plan of Action for improvements of the financial situation of the power
sector. The Closing Date was originally scheduled for June 30, 1987, however as a result of
discontinued payments of debt service by the Peruvian Government, the Bank suspended
disbursements on all loans to Peru in May 1987, and the loan was closed on June 30, 1988. The
Bank approved two extensions of the Closing Date before the cancellation, from June 30, 1985
to June 30, 1987, and finally to June 30, 1988 (para. 7.08).
ELECTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU, and HIDRANDINA were responsible for the overall
execution of their respective components of the project. From the US$81.2 million loan,
ELECTROLIMA would retain US$65.3 million and would relent US$12.3 million to
ELECTROPERU and US$3.6 million to HDRANDINA under the same terms as those of the
Bank loan. ELECTROLIMA entered into subsidiary loan agreements, satisfactory to the Bank,
with ELECTROPERU and HIDRANDINA (Section 3.01 (b) and (c) of the Loan Agreement).
The loan was made on standard Bank terms, with 17 years maturity, four years grace period and
the interest rate prevailing at the time of loan approval (assumed to be 11.6% for financial
forecast purposes).
The project began very slowly due to unavailability of local funds. However, this situation
slowly improved until 1984, when some of the studies under the project were contracted and some
of them initiated their execution. Implementation continued slowly during the following years as
result of an unusual number of bureaucratic and legal obstacles to the contract for most of the
studies and for the bidding documents for the acquisition of training equipment. The project
included about US$6.7 million for financing consulting services for the execution of the final
design and for the supervision during the construction of the Mantaro Transfer Scheme. Due to
postponement of the project component (para. 7.03), it was decided that the contract with the
respective consultants be cancelled, after the completion of the first stage of the study, and the
balance of about US$2.0 million available were used for technical assistance supporting the
regionalization process of ELECTROPERU, after the appropriate changes were made to the Loan
Agreement.
ELECTROLIMA's Component. The implementation of its distribution program was
delayed by more than three years due to lack of local funding and to the much lower-than-
expected growth of energy sales. The construction of the Yuracmayo dam was divided in two lots
and a local contractor started construction of Lot I in January 1984. The preselection process for
the construction of Lot II was completed in December 1986. Bidding documents were prepared
with the assistance of consultants and construction was expected to start in September 1987 and
to be completed by March 1990. The expansion of the Huinco power plant, which was dependent
on the implementation of the Mantaro Transfer Scheme, was postponed. The implementation of
the training component was very slow and was estimated to be completed by 1989. The fellowship
training program started in 1984; however, due to strict Government control for all trips abroad,



- iv -
no foreign training was provided during 1985-1986. All the equipment and materials for adapting
the existing installation in ELECTROLIMA's headquarters for a provisional trining center were
not purchased.
ELECTROPERU's Component. The final design and bidding documents for the Mantaro
Transfer Scheme were completed in 1984. However, the Government decided to postpone its
implementation and based upon Bank advice, ELECTROPERU discontinued the engineering
studies under contract with the foreign consultants. The implementation of the staff training
component was slow and only limited training activities were carried out for the regional
companies, due to budget limitation; in ELECTROPERU and the lack of professionals and
technicians to fulfill their responsibilities. Despite the constant efforts by the Bank, there was no
interest by ELECTROPERU in using the technical assistance funds assigned for the financial
planning component.
HIDRANDINA's Component. Studies for the Mayush hydroproject progressed
satisfactorily and its final design was completed in 1984. During implementation of the Mayush
study, which included the evaluation of the Pativilca River hydro potential, it was revealed that
a large hydro potential of five plants with a total installed capacity of about 600MW could be
developed in the basin. The Bank assigned great importance to these findings, due to the scarcity
of hydro resources in the Pacific watershed and to the lack of projects with studies sufficiently
advanced to be considered as options for the Central-North System development programs.
Project Cost. The total project cost was estimated at US$255.3 million, of which
US$91.4 million was the direct and indirect foreign exchange component (plus the US$1.2 million
front-end fee). The Bank loan, amounting to US$81.2 million, would cover about one third of the
total estimated project costs, and about 89 % of the project foreign exchange costs. The local costs
about US$163.9 million, would be financed from intemnal cash generation of ELECUROLIMA
(IJS$151.9million); ELECItOPERU (US$10.5 million); and HIDRANDINA (US$1.5 million).
The local cost included taxes and duties on imported goods, estimated at 10% of the total project
cost.
The actual total cost of the project reached US$164.1 million (see annex 4), of which
US$25.9 million equivalent (16%) was financed by the Bank, including US$1.2 million of front-
end-fee, and the remainder by ELECrROLIMA, ELECTROPERU and HIDRANDINA. This
represents a US$101.1 million lower cost than the appraisal estimate, which was mainly due to
the indefinite postponement of the Mantaro Transfer Studies and to the loan cancellation by the
Bank of the underdisbursed balance of the loan, as already explained above.
Procurement. The heavy administrative and procurement constraints imposed by the
Contralorfa General de la Republica, were among the general factors for the slow project
implementation. The low quality of ELECIROLIMA's bidding documents was common at the
initial stage of project implementation, with a small improvement during the following years.
Bidding documents were issued by several departments within ELECTROLIMA. To assure
standardization of the general conditions and compliafice with the Bank's procurement guidelines,
a single unit (Division de Compras within SubGerencia de Abastecimiento) was created by



v 
ELECTROLIMA, which was in charge of preparing the general conditions and the draft contracts
for all procurement. However, the technical areas (Gerencia Tecnica and Gerencia de
Distribuci6n) continued to be responsible for the technical specifications. Another procurement
related problem was the dividing of some procurement by ELECIROLIMA, as a result of yearly
budget restrictions imposed by CONADE, which forced ELECTROLIMA to purchase smaller
quantities than technically desirable. This problem was eliminated when CONADE excluded from
budget limitations all the items that were totally financed by Bank loans (paras. 7.09-7.10).
Project Results
ELECTROLIMA's Distribution Program. A total of 12 substations of 60/10 Kv were
constructed, seven fewer substations than estimated at appraisal, due to reduced demand.
Construction of 49km of 60 Kv lines, 579km of 10Kv transmission lines and cables, and
acquisition and installation of 1450 transformers of 220V were successfully carried out.
Additionally, approximately 94,000 new clients were connected with electricity, compared with
the projected 130,000. ELECTrOLIMA has continued the expansion of it's distribution program
during the last few years, adding more than 700km of 60Kv and 10Kv lines to the network and
connecting about 28,000 new clients with electricity service (see annex 7).
Studies. Under ELECTROLM's component the following studies were prepared: (i)
Salto Bajo Scheme, of which the most promising development would be Jicamarca with installed
capacity of 104 MW and expected generation of 270 GWh during an average year; (ii)
Transandean Tunnel Expansion, which included modifications of the Marcapomacocha canal; (iii)
Yuracmayo Dam, whose construction was divided in two lots, but only construction of Lot 1 was
initiated; the dam study concluded that no major negative environmental effects were expected
from the dam construction. HIDRANDINA carried out the Mayush Hydro Project Study
successfully. Two alternatives (ow and high pressure) were considered for the design of the main
tunnel, however, the general conclusion was oriented toward the low pressure alternative due to
smaller technical risk in the construction. The study found a large hydropotential of five plants
with a total installed capacity of about 600 MW could be developed on this basis. This project
component achieved its objectives partially.
Training Components. Only four professionals from ELECTROLIMA received training
abroad. ELECTROLIMA with its own funding, has continued staff training and initiated the
installation of a new staff training center at the ELECTROLIMA's headquarters. Approximately
4,000 workers received training annually in several fields of electricity maintenance, distribution,
etc. ELECTROPERU's training program did not progress as scheduled (para. 7.03). A fellowship
program was prepared but not implemented. Only small training courses and teaching materials
were provided to the staff from regional companies. This project component achieved its
objectives partially.
Financial Aspects.
The financial performance of ELECTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU and RIDRANDINA
reflect the deteriorated financial situation of the power sector during the project implementation



-vi -
period (annexes 7-9). The Government's country failure to increase tariff levels in line with
inflation, lower than expected sales growth and higher than expected operating expenses were the
main problems. The inadequate tariff increases reflected the effect of populist political pressures
on the Government. Tariffs fell in real terms, e.g., during 1983 cumulative tariff increases
amounted only 79% while the cost-of-living index rose 135%. The power utilities reduced their
capital-expenditures programs period to minimal levels and they did not have enough cash
generation to cover their debt service. Also adversely affecting the financial performance of the
power utilities was the inordinate growth in operating expenses as a result of overall real increase
in employment costs, caused pardally by staff increases.
During 1985, the rate of return of the three public utilities was less than 1.5%, compared
with the covenanted rate of 10 %. The Bank reminded the Government of these non-ompliances,
but did not threaten suspension of disbursements in 1984-1986, due to the project situation and
the country's economic considerations. It was not until May 1986, that the Bank alerted
ELECTROLIMA of the possibility of suspending loan disbursements, and finally the lack of
action by the Government in tariff matters caused the Bank to suspended disbursements in
November 1986. After a satisfactory Plan of Action submitted to the Bank, whereby the
Government and the power sector established a comprehensive set of actions (para. 8.04) to
improve the financial situation of the sector, the Bank lifted suspension in April 1987. But due
to the deteriorating economic conditions of the country and the discontinuing payments of its debt
service, the Bank suspend all loans to Peru in May 1987 (paras. 9.01-9.05).
Based on actual investment costs, and operating costs, and net marginal revenues, the
internal rate of return on the main (LCTROLIMA) component of the project was -6 % (Annex
8E). This negative level when compared to the appraisal's rate (16.6%) reflects the low level of
actual tariffs and the high labor and operating costs of the project. However, it does not measure
the economic impact of the project.
Lessons Learned
The principal lessons learned from this project experience can be summarized as
follows:
(a) The implementation schedules for complex projects in difficult
conditions should not be faster than available implementation profiles
(genera4.
*0.   (b) Fundamental reforms within the power companies, as well as and in the
policy and regulatory framework, were needed to improve the decision-
making process and accountability and make the power sector agencies
more autonomous. More recent far-reaching power sector reforms, should
make a more lasting contribution to sustainable power sector development
(para. 2.17).
*0.   (c) During project preparation, the different steps needed to obtain legal
clearance for subsidiary contracts and agreements should be clearly



-vii -
established in order to avoid implementation problems. If necessary, clear
exceptions to local laws should be discussed during loan negotiations and
have them incorporated into the Guarantee Agreement (para. 6.02).
(d) Sector training needs are usually very large; and therefore, sector
agencies should encourage the creation of adequate staff training units, with
broad mandates, not only to assess needs, but also to define and fund long
term plans to properly address them. The Bank should use the existing
institutional training infrastructure, and should ask for advice from an
outside independent consultant. In no case should the Bank finance a
training component without the wholehearted concurrence of the Borrower
(paras. 6.11 and 7.02).
(e) Even under difficult macroeconomic conditions, the Bank should
enforce compliance with financial covenants and suspend loans when non-
compliance persists. Otherwise the credibility of the Bank is subject to
doubt (paras. 7.05; 7.06; 9.01 and 9.02)
(f) The Bank should insist on better and more comprehensive preparation
of institution building components, mainly those related with management
and financial issues, especially for institutions such as ELECTROLIMA
and ELECIROPERU, which do not have proper financial discipline or
independence from political influence (para. 9.01).
(g) For countries like Peru, which have weak macroeconomic conditions,
a firm commitment of local funding should be a condition for proceeding
with the loan negotiation, to assure viability and successful implementation
of the project. Realistic evaluation of the possible local contribution, which
can be obtained from the beneficiaries, should be determined during project
preparation and appraisal, as well as their legal implications and the
procedures for their collection. Only a fraction of the potential contribution
should be considered realistically for project funding evaluation (paras.
7.03; 7.07).
(h) Special attention and continuous efforts should be devoted to assist the
borrowers in using the Bank's procurement guidelines. A close review of
country laws, regulations and practices should be made before project
appraisal to identify any problem areas and to seek before hand their
solution during loan negotiations. In the event of conflict between local
laws and Bank procurement guidelines, Government agreement to obtain
a waiver of such local laws with respect to Bank-financed project should be.
a requirement for proceeding with the project (para. 7. 09).

2.-         Background
2.01.-      Economic Overview.- The 1980's turned out to be a lost decade for Peru. Growth
during 1983-1988 was largely based on stimulus to consumption expenditure in the context of
stagnation in domestic investment. The discouraging performance was attributed to inconsistent
macroeconomic policies within a strategy that was inward looking and heavily interventionist. The
Government applied no effective remedy beyond reducing public investment to historically low
levels, real GDP and fixed investment both fell by 16% in 1989-1990, per capita incomes in 1990
were 23% lower than in 1985, declining to the levels of 30 years earlier. On taking office in
August 1990, the new government inherited an economy destroyed by inflation and falling output
and real wages. On taking office, the new authorities launched a major stabilization and structural
reform program involving trade, price and exchange rate liberalization, together with fiscal and
monetary measures to reduce the deficit and inflation. The Government quickly implemented an
emergency stabilization package, designed to open up the economy and increase competition,
including a sharp reduction in tariffs. Such measures have already given encouraging results:
inflation has been diminished to one digit, the exchange rate has stabilized, albeit with Centrl
Bank intervention, net foreign reserves have increased and there is the beginning of relative
confidence in economic policy. Real GDP grew by nearly 3% in 1991, on the strength of a
moderate recovery in manufacturing. Peru has made substantial progress in reestablishing
relations with its external creditors. A debt workout prograrn was also initiated in 1991. Arrears
with the IDB were eliminated and the Bank approved the application to Peru of its policy for



-2-
lending to countries with protracted arrars. Under this policy, Peru has been required to agree
with the Bank and the IMF on an eternal financing plan, adopt a Fund stabilization program and
a Bank-supported adjustment program, and to continue making current debt service payments to
the Bank. At the same time, the Paris Club creditors have provided substantial debt relief to Peru
and currently business contacts with commercial banks have been resumed. While positive growth
could be taken as a sign that the process of economic recovery has started, such a conclusion is
premature since the war on inflation is not over yet. The program for 1992 has been designed to
assure a continued reduction of inflation and to advance the structural transformation of the
Peruvian economy.
2.02 Over 100 governmental decrees were passed in mid-November 1991, under congressional
mandate that authorized the executive branch to legislate on private investment. Decree 757 sets
the framework rules for local and foreign private investors. It allows prices to be determined
strictly by market forces, with the exception of those regulated by public agencies. Decree 693
promotes private investments in the electricity sector and allows private companies to invest in
all kinds of electric projects including generation, transmission, distribution and marketing of
electricity. Concessions will be granted by the Ministry of Energy and Mines and will guarantee
national and foreign investors profitable import duties, tax stability, rights to market electricity
freely and no cxchange rate discrimination.
2.04.-      Bank Lending to the Sector.- Since 1960, the Bank has provided eight power
development loans to Peru toalling US$222.2 million; and since 1980, the Bank has made three
petroleum loans amounting to US$119.0 million. The first five power loans were to
ELECTROLIMA, the utility serving metropolitan Lima. The loans helped financed 220 MW of
hydropower, as well as expansion of the transmission and distribution systems. The sixth loan was
for the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1215-PE), which helped to finance ELECTROLIMA's 1976-
1979 distribution program. The loan also helped to finance a much smaller but important part of
the project: technical assistance and staff training components to assist the Govemment entities
in strengthening the sector's organization and planning. The seventh loan (2018-PE), amounting
to US$25 million, was made in 1981 mainly to finance prefeasibility and feasibility studies for
12 hydroelectric plants. The beneficiaries were ELECTROPERU, ELECTROLIMA,
HDRANDINA and CENTROMIN, a stated-owned mining company, which has developed its
own electric power generation system. The eight loan (2179-PE), which is the subject of this
PCR, amounting to US$81.2 million, was made in 1982 to help finance: ELECTROLIMA's
1982-1986 distribution program, construction of the Yuracmayo dam and expansion of the Huinco
plant; ELECTROPERU's final design for the Mantaro transfer scheme, which would increase its
hydro electric production; and BIDRANDINA's final design for the Mayush hydro project.
2.05.-      Execution of the first five power projects was generally satisfactory. Most of the
projects were completed about a year late and with small cost overruns. The Fifth Power Project
(1215-PE) was completed by the end of 1982, approximately three and half years later than the
targeted completion date, due to the lower-than-expected demand increase, and also to
inexperience in procurement matters and in consultant selection procedures. The cost of the
project was lower by 21% than the original estimate, but the original cost had been understated,
because of the method of inventory valuation used by ELECTROLIMA. However, the project
succeeded in meeting its objectives of providing facilities to meet increased system demand, and
also succeeded in connecting about 90% of the low-income consumers estimated at appraisal.



-3-
2.06        Sector Overview.- Peru has a diverse and as yet largely untapped energy resource
base, consisting of hydroelectric power, crude oil, natural gas, coal, some geothermal power, and
renewable resources, such as firewood and bagasse. Commercial sources include petroleum,
hydroelectric power, natural gas, and coal. The major resource identified is hydropower, whose
potential is only beginning to be exploited by 4% (2,378 MW of an estimated potential of 58,000
MW). There is also potential for electric power generation on the basis of biomass, geothermal
energy and solar power. Most of the hydro resources are located on the Atlantic watershed far
from consumption centers. The Government has concentrated its efforts on developing the
electric power and petroleum subsectors. Peru's public electric power service is currently
suffering its severest crisis in the last three or four decades. The rationing of capacity and power,
as well as a very poor supply reliability, is common in almost the entire country. This situation
is reflected in the low quality of service, the poor efficiency of the public utilities, and the sector's
financial problems. The quality of the public electricity service has heavily deteriorated during
the last years, with frequent and lengthy service supply interruptions, low reliability and high
level of losses (13 % in Lima and 22 % elsewhere). Power restrictions in 1990 reached up to 20-25
percent of demand. The existing installed capacity is not sufficient to cover adequately the current
demand, due to lack of investments in the recent past; since new generation added to the public
systems in the period 1980-1992 was only 330 MW compared with 630 MW of increase in
demand. Transmission and distribution networks are generally in bad shape. However,
considerable portion of the power installations are underutilized due to inadequate maintenance
and lack of properly trained staff. Additionally, a severe drought reduced energy available to the
system in 1989-1991. Terrorism has compounded the problem. Public utilities reported that in
1980-1992, about 1,900 high voltage power towers were damaged, to such extent that public
agencies abandoned one major transmission line (Mantaro-Pisco). The 1985-1992 losses due to
terrorist attacks on transmission lines are estimated at US$615-1,168 million, when the cost to
society of the energy not supplied due to these acts is considered. The overall efficiency of the
utilities is poor.
2.07        The characteristics of the present critical situation of the Peruvian power sector are
similar to those of most LAC countries: after a period of assets nationalization and availability
of abundant capital in the 1970s, during which facilities and service coverage grew significantly,
the sector underwent a serious institutional and financial crisis during the 1980s, because of
inadequate macroeconomic and sector policies being applied while capital became scarce. As in
all LAC countries, where electricity demand grows at a faster rate than the economy, the power
sector in Peru will face during the 1990's a major need for new investrnents. This situation has
been further compounded by the poor maintenance practices, delays in investments because of the
severe institutional and financial crisis, and terrorist attacks to the sector installations. There is
a clear danger of further shortages, if electricity demand growth continues as high as in 1991
(8 %) and could be higher in the future if the economic growth resumes as formally expected. The
sector could then become a major constraint to development, if radical reform of sector policies
and institutions is not implemented in line with the reform of macroeconomic policies especially
those regarding decentralization, deregulation and private sector participation.
2.08        The present administration found the power sector of Peru in deep crisis at the end
of the 1980s, mainly because of the total macroeconomic mismanagement of the previous
administration. The legal and regulatory framework of the sector was not only outdated, but did
not favor economy and efficiency. Lack of autonomy had greatly inhibited corporate dynamics,



-4-
thus reducing the utilities efficiency. Government intervention, political interference and financial
constraints had resulted in non-competitive employment conditions, reflected in a total lack of
capacity for attracting and retaining highly qualified and motivated staff. Still, the monolithic
structure of the sector continues to be represented by ELECTROPERU, the largest government
owned utility, which governs most sector activities. The present Government is thoroughly
committed to the privatization of all state concerns, and Decree 674 authorizes private investment
in state firms, allowing them to: (i) sell their shares through the stock market, by public bidding
or direct transactions; (ii) issue new shares using the same mechanisms; (iii) form joint ventures
with private capital; and (iv) sell assets through public offering or direct transactions. This decree
also has established a Commission to Promote Private Investment (COPRI), which is responsible
for the implementation of the privatization program, and the creation of a private investment fund
(FOPRI). The decentralization effort conducted by the Government has resulted first, in the
creation of several regional utilities, and secondly, in a transfer of a portion of their shares to the
local governments.
2.09        Existing Facilities.- The total electric public service installed capacity in the
country amounts to 3,352 MW, of which 2,316 MW is hydro based and 1,036 MW is thermal.
About 91 % of this capacity is instaUlled in interconnected systems, and the remainder resides in
isolated centers. The most important interconnected system is the Central-North System, which
covers from Marcona to Piura (2,515 MW). The other interconnected systems are the South-East
System, which covers Cusco-Tincaya-Puno-Juliaca (163 MW); and the South System, which
covers Arequipa-Tacna (410 MW). Additionally, several mining and industrial companies own
a capacity of about 1,290 MW, of which 290 MW is hydro and 1,000 MW is thermal. Public
service is supplied by a national utility, ELECTROPERU, and eleven regional utilities which are:
ELECTROLIMA, HIDRANDINA, and eight ELECTROS (Norte, Nor-Oeste, Norte Medio,
Centro, Sur Medio, Sur-Este, Oriente, Sur plus Sociedad Electrica del Sur-Oeste).
2.10        Supply & Demand Facilities .- Though access to electricity in Peru increased
from 34% in 1980 to 42% in 1991, it is still low when compared with other Latin American
countries'/. Per capita electricity consumption at 522 KWh/year in 1991, is also low compared
with the South America average of 1,200 KWh/year. As a result of the lack of response from the
public supply system to increases in demand, many industries, commercial enterprises and even
domestic consumers have been investing in a large number of small back up thermal generating
plants operated with diesel oil or gasoline. Despite the severe recession that the country is
currently experiencing, there is in many areas considerable electricity demand not yet supplied
by the public service utilities. During the last few years, electric power generation has not
particularly grown. Total generation in the country apparently declined only from 13,785 GWh
in 1987 to 13,736 GWh in 1989, that is by 1.75%, with a slow recovery since 1989. The
aforementioned recovery was mainly due to autogeneration by the private sector, while public
utilities reduced generation by 5% during the last few years. This reduction is as much a
reflection of the fall in demand in certain areas, but mainly due to the technical and financial
deterioration of the public enterprises. Future supply and demand for the three public generation
systems is summarized as follow:
1. For example, access to electricity is estimated to be 72% in Brazil, 85% in Argentina, 90% in
Costa Rica, 70% in Mexico and 75% in Colombia.



-5-
a) Central North System.- The installed capacity through 1991 was 2,515 MW,
which includes the Mantaro hydro system with 798 MW ; Electrolima hydro plants
with 650 MW (Huinco, Matucana, Callahuanca, Huampani, Moyopampa and the
thermal plant of Santa Rosa); Hidrandina hydro system with 190 MW (Cahua and
Cafion del Pato). Actual maximum demand is only 1600 MW. Projected demand
for 1995 is expected to be 1859 MW. The supply situation for 1995 is expected to
increase an additional 200 MW (100 MW from Electrolima plant and 100 MW
from a Thermal plant to be installed by ELECTROPERU).
b) South East System.- The installed capacity through 1991 was 163 MW,
which is divided between a 110 MW hydro plant and 53MW thermal plant. Actual
maximum demand is only 70 MW. Demand is expected to increase to 163 MW by
1995. The supply situation for the same year is expected to increase with an
additional plants of 110 MW.
c) South System.- The installed capacity through 1991 was 466 MW. The
system includes a 344 MW hydro plant and an 122 MW thermal plant. Demand
for 1995 is expected to be around 451 MW, while supply will be increased by 81
MW. Most of the additional capacity is expected to be installed during 1997-2000,
with the Quishuarani Plant (81 MW).
d) Other Systems.- The installed capacity through 1991 was 119 MW, which
includes isolated systems (diesel generators, and small hydro plants). Most of these
systems provide services for only a few hours during the day. An additional 40
MW are expected to increase the capacity of the system.
2.11        Sector Organization and Legal Aspects.- The Ministry of Energy and Mines
(ME    is responsible for formulating subsector policy and supervising the activities of the state
electric utilities. During the last three decades, the electric power sector has been regulated by
three different laws: the Electric Power Industry Law of 1955 (No.12378), the Electric Power
Subsector Standard-setting Law of 1972 (No.19521), and the General Electricity Law of 1982
(No.23406). Recently, a new Law of Concessions for Electricity Operations was approved in
November 1992, which will result in free contracting between autonomous producers and
distributors, creation of a supply pool (Comite de Operaci6n Econ6mica del Sistema
Interconectado) and guidepost regulations of electricity pricing.
2.12        The first Law regulating the Electric Power Industry established a system of private
concessions, which were responsible for all the technical phases of the electric power service and
its commercialization. The Standard-setting Law of the Electric Power nationalized all the electric
power services and created ELECTROPERU as a stated-owned company in charge of all the
public service activities in the areas not served by the main existing private companies
(ELECTROLIMA, SEAL, and others), with exclusive rights on national generation expansion.
Thus, ELECTROPERU assumed total responsibility for activities as diverse as implementation
and operation of large power stations, planning of national power systems and the electric power
service in hundreds of small localities. The law of 1982 had the main objective of establishing a
decentralized structure. Although essendally maintaining a state owned system, the law of 1982



-6 -
established a decentralized systems with several regional companies and ELECTROPERU acting
as the main governing power. The process of decentalization received a significant political
support during the last govemment.
2.13         Institutional Aspects.- Since the public administration of the electric power
subsector was established in 1972, its organization has been modified several times. None of these
reorganizations, however, has had any success in improving the subsector's technical,
administrative and financial returns. ELECTROPERU, a company formed on the basis of four
nationalized public utilities, could never manage to satisfy its managerial objectives and with a
few ecceptions (ELECTROLJLMA and SEAL) all the subsector's public utilities are very weak.
The centrl government's view of the electric power subsector has been to consider it as a
strategic public operation, frequently used as an economic policy instrument to implement
subsidies and/or control inflation, instead of managing it as a commercial operation. Broadly,
current subsector problems are tied to its organization and legal framework as described above.
Such a notably state controlled structure presents severe limitations, which impact on its efficiency
and effective administration, as well as, the need to decentralize the system. Among these
limitations the following should be mentioned:
emonopolization of electric power development by only one state
company (ELECTROPERU).
*lack of clear, stable and economically effective tariff setting
procedures. Although the Tariff Commission is an institutionally
adequate organization, its little autonomy and political leverage,
have made it inoperative.
sirrational tariff setting and excessive government intervention in
the utilities, make it impossible to value them objectively, that is,
by their performance. This has enabled a variety of administrative
inefficiencies to remain in the utilities, such as excess personnel, a
poorly used technical capacity, bureaucratization and dilution of
relevant decisions.
2.14         Financial Aspects.- The General Electricity Law (1982) requires an overal rate
of return of 12 % from state electric power utilities on their net investments. This aim, however,
was never achieved. During 1984-1985 the rates of return were 4.0% and 5.0%, respectively; and
from 1986 onward they have been negative, reaching to a minimum of -13.9% in 1989. The main
reason for this financial deterioration has been the decline in electricity tariffs. In real terms,
tariffs in 1989 were only 20% of their 1985 levels, and in current values they have decreased
from an average of US$0.042 per KWh in 1985 to US$0.014 per KWh in 1988. Beginning in
1986, the electricity services have depended on capital contributions from the Public Treasury to
finance operating deficits and capital investments. One modality to provide this kind of support
has been debt service relief. The most significant initiative was the 1987 Economic-Financial
Recovery Program for the Electric Power Subsector, a prerequisite for obtaining the MDB sector
credit. The long period of deficit shown in the table below, has exerted a negative impact on the
economical, financial and technical returns of the utilities as shown by:(i) earnings, which cover
only personnel expenditures; (ii) rationing of fuel consumption at the cost of a decline in quality



-7-
of electric service; (iii) declining maintenance and repair programs during the last five years, thus
reducing the availability and reliability of the electric power supply installations; and (iv) lack of
funds to implement, and in some cases to complete essential rehabilitation projects of immediate
benefit to the system.

*Forecast Data
2.15         It should be noted that the serious problem originating from current tariff setting
policy does not only refer to the level of tariffs but also to their structure. The stucture does not
coincide with the supply costs but rather opposes them. Thus domestic tariffs, whose supply cost
is about 25% higher than the cost of commercial supply, and almost 100 % higher than the cost
of industrial supply, remained at an average of US$0.003 per KWh during 1989-1990, while the
average tariffs for commercial and industrial consumers were US$0.046 per KWh and US$0.024
per KWh, respectively. This marked distortion has without doubt been the cause of the excessive
and inefficient level of electricity consumption by the household consumers. By continuing the
current tariff setting policy, the deterioration of the utilities will continue to be aggravated, and
clearly reveals the need to adopt a rational power tariff-setting policy, which would allow to
increase tariffs to a level that would bring reasonable economic efficiency in electricity
consumption and supply decisions. Electric power tariffs should be established approximately at



-8-
their Long-Run Marginal Cost (LRMC), that is, US$0.8 average, with some tax to be applied
to the high residential consumers, while exonerating the smallest consumers from that tax.2/
2.16        Sector Strategy .- The severity of the above problems and the urgent need to
resolve them has justified an strategy with short and medium term actions. The objectives of this
strategy are geared to obtain the following:
*resolving the sector's urgent problems, that is, the financial crisis
of the electric power utilities and the service technical constraints.
*proposing conditions that promote economically efficient electric
power sector operation and development in the future.
2.17        The Government has designed a rehabilitation program, which includes a series of
low-cost priority measures. These measures includes, besides the generation and distribution
rehabilitation projects, maintenance improvement and a load management program in the
metropolitan Lima area. In view of the emergency situation, it is essential to implement the
rehabilitation program in the most efficient way possible, without long delays or excessive costs.
Tlhe Government and the Bank have negotiated a privatization adjustment loan of US$250 million
equivalent, which will support the privatization program and related sectoral policy, as well as
the legal and regulatory reforms being implemented by the Government of Peru. Basically the
program is designed to promote competition and private investment, and improve economic
effliciency and fiscal performance. Privatizaton and related sectoral reforms are expected to have
major benefits by restoring private sector confidence in the economy and in the Government's
commitment and ability to reduce the public sector size.
3.          Preparation and Appraisal
3.01        The Peruvian authorities had been studying the Mantaro Transfer scheme for 17
years, mainly as a solution to the water supply problem affecting Lima. A foreign consultancy
firm prepared the feasibility study under the supervision of a small commission. They estimated
the cost of improving the Mantaro River water quality to the point at which it could be used as
drinking water.
3.02        The project was prepared in line with the Government of Peru main objectives for
expanding the power subsector and in line with the Bank's strategy of supporting Government
efforts to strengthen the power sector in Peru to make-up for years of underinvestment. The
conceptual foundation for the project was clear and consistent with the Bank objectives of
supporting the power subsector policies of the Government. The timing of the project was also
appropriate because of the urgent need to improve the power subsector by strengthening its major
institutions.

UNDP/Worid Bank (ESMAP). Washington D.C. December 1890.



-9-
3.03        A Bank mission identified the project in January 1981, and its principal components
were prepared by ELECTROLIMA during the first half of 1981. The engineering components
had been prepared in connection with the previous Power Engineering loan (1215-PE), and the
Water Supply and Power Engineering Project (Loan S-1l of 1978). Relying on the draft of the
consultant's feasibility study, the Bank carried-out preparation work in June 1981. The project
was appraised during the period of August/ September 1981, identifying a number of difficult
issues (paras. 6.07-6.12) requiring resolution prior to loan negotiations and board approval. Legal
opinions on behalf of the Guarantor and the Borrower were provided to the Bank after several
delays, but these were not satisfactory to the Bank, which resulted in three postponements of the
loan effective date from the original date of December 20, 1982, first to February 21, 1983, then
to March 22, 1983, and finally to May 12, 1983
4.          Project Objectives.-
4.01        The primary objective of the project was to support the Government's decision to
give high priority to improving the power sector by: (i) assisting in strengthening the major
institutions in the sector, particularly ELECTROPERU; (ii) assisting in the financing of priority
investments in the distribution of electricity, so that unsatisfied demand would be met; and (iii)
supporting the preparation of priority projects for the sector, particularly the Mantaro Transfer
project.
4.02        The project included three components to be carried out by ELECTROLIMA,
ELEFCTROPERU, and HIRANDINA. These were:
ELECTROLIMA's Component.-
*     xELECTOLIMA 's 1982-1986 dismbunion progrwn, which consisted of
expanding the Lima distribution network to meet expected demand
increases for the period. Main works were: (i) construction or expansion
of 19 substations of 60/10 Kv with a total of about 390 MVA of additional
tansformer capacity; (ii) construction of about 700 km circuit lines of 60
and 10 Kv cables and lines; (iii) acquisition and installation of about 1700
additional 10,000/220 V transformers, and the corresponding control and
protection equipment; (iv) installation of 400 circuit-km of urban lines for
220 V, and the corresponding street lighting connection to 130,000 clients.
I
*     Yuracmayo Dan, a hydroproject located in the upper Rimac basin, which
would regulate and upgrade the water volume used by the Matucana hydro
plant, and the existing 120 MV plant, thus increasing its production by 88
GWh/year of dry-season energy. The dam, an earth dam, would be 44 m
high and would form a 40 million cubic meter lake. As the project's
engineering work was still underway, there was not a definitive design nor
a final cost estimate for this component, although the feasibility studies
showed that no major technical problems existed and preliminary cost
estimates showed that it would be economically attractive, and still would
leave enough room for a cost increase without jeopardizing the economic
feasibility of the project.



- 10-
*    Huinco Hydro Plant Erpansion, which consisted of the addition of a fifth
60 MW unit that would be located in a cavern adjacent to the existing
underground powerhouse. The expansion would permit better use of the
water diverted from the Mantaro Transfer Scheme, by increasing energy
production through greater availability, and also gaining some 35 MV of
power output.
*     Salto Bajo Scheme, which was a generic name for the utilization of the
hydro potential still existing downstream from Huinco. Increased water
flow from the Mantaro river diversion scheme would make this project
economically viable. Alternatives that would be considered were: (i)
expanding certain plants (Callahuanca, Moyopampa, and Huampani), and
(ii) developing one or more new plants. The proposed feasibility study
would select the most economic development alternative and produce a
feasibility study to be included in the central-north system generation
expansion studies.
3     The Transandean Tunnel Expansion Study, which also included
modifications of the Marcapomacocha canal, which was part of the
Mantaro Transfer Scheme. The studies carried out under this project
indicated that the tunnel expansion would be done at the same time, and
following the same scheme, as the Mantaro Transfer Scheme, that is, final
design and bidding documents preparation and construction design.
Stff Training Progrwm, which was defined with the Bank assistance, and
would contribute to improve and complete SLECTROLIMA's training
center facilities, through equipment acquisition and technical assistance.
The program included new equipment for the training center, upgrading of
instructors, technical assistance and a fellowship program. Consultant
sevices would be sought for the implementation of procedures to improve
ELECTROLIMA's procurement and inventory control procedures.
ELECTROPERU's Component.-
*     Mantaro Transfer Scheme, which showed to be the optimal combination of
a least-cost solution for the supply of electric power to the central-north
grid and for increasing the supply of water for the city of Lima, which
included several civil and electromechanical works, whose objectives were
to increase the water discharge of the Rimac basin by diverting water from
the Mantaro basin. The work included the construction of a hydraulic
circuit with two pumping stations, two dams, a diversion dam, a new canal,
the raising of the level of an existing lake, and the enlargement of the
eisting canals and tunnel. The water thus diverted would be used to
increase energy production in the existing hydro plants, to develop a new
300 MW hydro plant (Sheque) in the Pacific watershed, and to supply
additional water to Lima.
*     Staff Taining Program, which was defined with the Bank's assistance, and
would contribute to improve ELECTROPERU's training capability. It



- 11 -
included the acquisition of training equipment for the training center
(CEFOCAP); technical assistance for improving manpower planning,
defining training needs, instructor training, the preparation of programs and
teaching aids and evaluation systems; and a fellowship program for
professionals and managers at various levels.
Financing assistance, which consisted of services of investment bankers
and other financial advisers to provide advice to ELECTROPERU
management on devising a financing plan, including restructuring of
existing debt, and assistance in obtaining additional financing.
HDRANDINA's Component.-
*     Mayush Hydro Project Study, with an installed capacity of up to 130 MW
and 930 GWh of mean annual production, would complement the existing
40 MW plant at Cahua on the Pativilca River. The feasibility study was
financed under the Loan 2018-PE. The proposed loan would finance
preparation of the final design and bidding documents for the Mayush
project, provided the feasibility study would show its technical and
economical feasibility within the framework of the Central-North system
expansion study.
5.    Project Cost and F-nancing.-
5.01 The total project cost was estimated at US$255.3 million, of which US$91.4 million
represented the direct and indirect foreign exchange component. Including the US$1.2 million of
a front-end fee, total financing would amount to US$256.5 million. The Bank loan, amounting
to US$81.2 million, would cover about one third of the total estimated project costs, including
the front-end fee, and about 89% of the project foreign exchange costs. The local cost of the
project, about US$163.9 million, would be financed from each of the involved institutions'
internal cash generation. US$151.9 million would come from ELECTROLIMA, US$10.5 million
from ELECTROPERU, and US$1.5 million from HIDRANDINA. The local cost included taxes
and duties over imported goods, and were estimated at 10% of the total project cost. The
Government agreed to provide any additional funds necessary to carry out the project.
5.02        Costs were estimated as follows: (i) the cost of ELECTROLIMA's distribution
program was based on prices of materials and equipment estimated at that time; (li) the cost for
the construction of the Yuracmayo dam was based on the consultant's progress report; (iii) the
cost of consultant services for ELECTROLIMA's studies (Huinco, Salto Bajo, and Transandean
Tunnel expansion and for the financial assistance to ELECTROPERU) were based on actual
prices charged by consultants for similar works, of about US$11,000 per staff-month; (iv) the cost
of ELECTROLIMA training, was based on a study made by ELFECTROLIMA in consultation
with the Bank; (v) the cost of engineering services for the Mantaro Transfer Scheme were based
on a negotiated contract with foreign consultants for about US$9,600 per staff-month; (vi) the cost
of ELECTROPERU training were based on an study prepared by ELECTROPERU in
consultation with the Bank; and (vii) the cost of the IIDRANDINA component was estimated
by BIDRANDINA's staff in consultation with the Bank. Physical contingencies were calculated



- 12 -
by the Bank at a rate of 10% for ELECTROLIMA's distrbution program and 15% for the other
components, which had a higher uncertainty. The use of the international inflation rate for the
local costs reflected the assumption that Peruvian exchange policy would recognize the difference
between local and worldwide inflation.
5.03        The US$81.2 million loan would be used to finance the following:
the direct and indirect cost components of the ELECTROLIMA
Distribution Program for 1982-1986;
the estimated direct and indirect foreign cost component of the civil works,
as well as consultant services, for the Yuracmayo Dam;
consultants services for: (i) the Huinco Expansion Study, and for the Salto
Bajo Study, and for the Transandean Tunnel Expansion Study under
ELECTROLIA's part of the project; (ii) the Mantaro Transfer Project
Studies for the Technical Assistance Program under ELECTROPERU's
part; and (iii) the Mayush Hydro Project Study under HIDRANDINA's
part of the project;
the foreign cost component of teaching materials, technical assistance and
fellowships for both ELECIROL]MA and ELECTROPERU Staff Training
Programs;
the front end fee of US$1.2 million.
5.04        From the US$81.2 million loan, ELECTROLIMA would retain US$65.3 million,
and would relent US$12.3 million to ELECTROPERU and US$3.6 million to BIDRANDINA,
under the same terms as those of the Bank loan. The Bank loan was made on standard Bank
terms, with 17 years maturity, four years grace period and the interest rate prevailing at the time
of loan approval (assumed to be 11.6% for financial forecast purposes).
6.          Project Design and Organization.
6.01        The project was designed in line with the Government of Peru policies for the
power plants and its objectives for the power subsector. It was aimed at strengthening the
management and organization of the key sector institutions, particularly lCI ROPERU, so that
the Government's policy of promoting decentralization and increasing institutional autonomy
could be implemented effectively. Also, the project was aimed at supporting and assisting in the
preparation of complex hydroelectric studies, which were needed to expand power generation,
without recourse to thermal schemes that required burning costly petroleum, and promoting the
introduction of rational tariff policies so that the sector's large investment needs could be financed
without dependence on the national budget. This project would reinforce these objectives through
its support for institutional improvements, including more rational tariff levels and for
preinvestment studies. The project would provide access to electricity to about 130,000 families.
ELECTROLIMA took adequate care of environmental effects in the design of the distribution
network. The engineering studies to be included in the project included environmental impact
assessments. With respect to the. engineering studies for the Mantaro Transfer project, two
particular environmental issues would be addressed, so that the final design would be able to deal
with them: (i) control of the pollution, which entered the Mantaro River; and (ii) the potential
ecological effect of raising the water level in Lake Junfn.



- 13 -
6.02        The project was identified in January 1981. The Government of Peru requested
Bank assistance in financing the development of hydraulic resources in the vicinity of Lima and
accelerate the preparation of several studies of hydroelectric projects needed to expand power
generation, in order to minimize the need for the installation of new thermal capacity. Since the
preparation and execution of hydro projects were seriously delayed, as a result of lack of
planning, the Master Plan for electricity prepared in 1982 would demand an increased
participation of hydroelectric potential in power production, and increase the amount of electricity
availability to the population, particularly in rural areas. The project was appraised in August
1981 and negotiated in April 1982. The loan was approved on June 1982, and signed on
September 1982, but did not become effective until May 1983, eight months later than expected
during appraisal, because of the delays to allow for the signature of subsidiary agreements
between the Borrower ELECTROLIMA and the other agencies, i.e. ELECITROPERU and
HlDRANDINA, which also had responsibilities under the project. The delays were caused by the
need to clear with the Government the legal constraints for the approval of the contracts and
subsidiary agreements between ELECTROLIMA and the other agencies. To avoid these problems
it would have been appropriate to discuss these matters and clearly establish exceptions to local
laws during loan negotiations.
6.03        ELECTTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU, and IEDRANDINA would be responsible
for the overall execution of their respective components of the project. ELECTROLIMA would
enter into subsidiary loan agreements, satisfactory to the Bank and on the same terms as the Bank
loan, for onlending US$12.3 million to ELECTROPERU and US$3.6 million to HIDRANDINA
(Section 3.01 (b) and (c) of the Loan Agreement). Signing of these agreements were conditions
of disbursement of their corresponding components of the project. ELECTROLIMA would
execute the physical works included in the project, and its engineering staff would carry out the
planning of these works, supervise engineering designs, and prepare specifications for equipment,
materials and works.
6.04        Procurement.- The procurement requirements of the Bank were discussed during
appraisal and agreed upon with ELECTROLIMA. Civil works, materials and equipment to be
financed with funds from the loan would be procured through international competitive bidding
procedures. Local suppliers and those purchased from Cartagena Agreement member countries
(or any other regional trade agreement acceptable to the Bank of which Peru was member) would
be accorded a preference representing the difference between the prevailing duty actually
applicable and the duty applicable to goods imported from non-member countries, or 15 % on the
C.I.F. price, whichever was lower. The regional preference would not be applicable, however,
if a domestic manufacturer was determined to be the lower bidder after application of domestic
preference. An additional US$11.3 million in minor civil works, which were not suitable for
packaging, and which were too small to be of interest to international tendering, would be
procured through local competitive bidding in accordance with procedures agreed with the Bank.
Limited international tendering would be used for a few items, which had to be compatible with
existing equipment, each not exceeding US$150,000 and estimated not to cxceed US$1.5 million
in total. Consultant's services financed under the loan would amount to about US$19.5 million,
the consultants would have qualifications acceptable to the Bank, and would be hired under terms
and conditions acceptable to the Bank (Section 3.02 (a) of Loan Agreement and 2.02 (a) of both
Project Agreements).



- 14 -
6.05        Disbursements.- The loan would be disbursed over a six-year period -from mid-
1982 to mid-1988- in accordance with the following eligible expenditures: 100% of foreign
expenditures for goods procured abroad, and 100% of the ex-factory cost for any locally
mnanufactured items, which would be acquired through ICB; 100% of foreign expenditures for
consultants from abroad and 90 % of local expenditures for local consultants; 30 % of expenditures
for civil works; 100% of foreign expenditures for training fellowships; and 100% of the front-
end-fee. Retroactive financing for up to US$1.0 million was proposed for payments of
consultants' fees incurred after September 30, 1981, to cover advanced expenditures related to
the Mantaro Transfer Project studies and the Transandean Tunnel Expansion study.
6.06        During preparation and appraisal of the project, several important issues arose such
as: (a) organization of the executing agency (b) cost sharing of consumer electricity and water
quality of the Mantaro Transfer Scheme; (c) electricity tariff levels; (f) ELECTROPERU
management; (g) staff training component; and (h) external audit of the project and of the
executing agencies operations.
6.07        Organization of the Executing Agency.- During project appraisal the
Government created by Decree the Mantaro Project Commission (MTC) and gave it responsibility
for the preparation of the study, and for contracting and supervising the works. However, the
commission did not have the necessary staff for overseeing the latter two phases -contracting and
work supervision. Furthermore, ELECTROPERU issued a mandate entrusting ELECTROLIMA
with part of the project's final design for the Transandean Tunnel and Marcapomacocha Canal,
which was contradictory to the MTC's legal responsibilities. To avoid future implementation
delays, the Bank proposed to solve the organizational problems by creating within
ELECTROPERU an executive unit, which would be based on the MTC technical staff. This
solution would fit better within the newly created power organization agency. The implementation
of a suitable institutional structure for the management, construction and operation of the Mantaro
Transfer Project was presented and accepted by the Bank during negotiations. The Mantaro
Transfer Unit was created as a legal part of ELECTROPERU, but also reported to a committee
consisting of representatives of the three public utilities
6.08        Mantaro Transfer Scheme: Cost Sharing of Common Elements and Water
Quality.- During project preparation, it was cause of discussion among the beneficiaries the cost
sharing of common elements of the scheme for water supply and electricity. Also, the feasibility
study of the Mantaro Transfer Scheme contained an estimate of the cost of improving the Mantaro
River water quality. However, neither the implementation of the water treatment program, nor
the monitoring of water quality was planned. The Government proposed that the electric sector
should assume about 50% of the costs, and this would be reflected in the financial forecast of the
corresponding institutions. To avoid delays, the Bank suggested that the project could be
appraised with alternative financial forecasts, but loan negotiations should be contingent upon a
definition of cost sharing arrangements for the construction of the Mantaro Transfer Scheme. An
acceptable plan for pollution control and monitoring was presented before negotiations, as well
as, the cost sharing arrangements for the construction of the Mantaro Transfer Scheme (50% for
the power sector and 50% for the water supply sector).



- 15 -
6.09         Electricity Tariff Levels.-During the years previous to the project appraisal, the
power sector earnings were lower than needed to finance its investment program. Even though
the electricity law permitted an 11% return on utilities' equity, during 198-8 1 the net income of
ELECTROPERU and ELECTROLIMA was about zero. An agreement was reached during
appraisal with the Government to improve this situation. It was agreed that: (i) tariff levels would
be raised about 8% monthly from September to December 1981; (ii) tariff levels during 1982
would be set to produce a 6% return on the basic rate; (iii) from 1983 tariff levels would permit
a 12% return on the basic rate. Combined with the recently imposed increases on the taxes for
electricity sales (from 5% to 25%) to the final consumer, the level of earnings of the utilities
would provide an acceptable self-financing capability to the power sector. During loan
negotiations, the Government presented to the Bank the 1981 proposed increases, and in the Loan
and Guarantee Agreements adequate covenants included the annual rate of return of 12 % and the
incremental 20% tax dedicated to new developments in the electric-power sector. Also, it was
agreed that since MEM had the responsibility for setting rates and tariffs, the commitments should
have dealt with the draft Guarantee Agreement, and additional time was provided for the agencies
to achieve the targeted 12 % rate of return.
6.10        ELECTROPERU Management.-During project appraisal, the weak organization
and poor management of ELECTROPERU was the main Bank's concern . ELECTROPERU's
organization was inefficient, having twelve working groups under the General Manager's direct
supervision. More importantly, with few exceptions, its management staff (executive president,
general manager, and departmental managers) were not capable of running a large public utility.
Based upon Bank recommendations, the Government agreed during appraisal that a functional re-
organization of ELECTROPERU was needed, and it had to be done under a more effective top
management. Fundamental changes were required, and the Bank suggested the replacement of two
top management positions with other staff acceptable to the Bank, prior to negotiations, to make
sure that ELECTROPERU would become a well run utility. The Ministry of Energy and Mines
(MEM) agreed to the above recommendations. During negotiations,it was agreed to include in the
ELECTROPERU Project Agreement, additional improvements in its accounting procedures,
satisfactory to the Bank, by the end of 1982.
6.11        Staff Training Component.- ELECTROPERU had a very poor track record for
staff training, mainly because of the absence of clear policies, lack of interest shown by the
managers, and lack of efficiency of CEFOCAP-the training unit within ELECTROPERU. On
the contrary, ELECTROLIMA had developed through the years a very good organization for
training its staff which included: open support from management, yearly programs for in-house
training and courses and fellowships in Peru and abroad, plus an efficient Training Department.
HIDRANDINA had a good level of staff training and a well organized training school for
hydromechanic, which was attached to the maintenance workshop in Chosica. The Bank's main
concern was ELCFTROPERU, which resulted in the inclusion of a training component that would
require close supervision, in view of ELECTROPERU's weakness in this field. During appraisal,
the Bank suggested to ELECTROLIMA additional training in the areas of manpower and planning
and also suggested to modernize, replace and complete the equipment of the Technical Training
School (EFET). Additionally, the Bank recommended a better coordination between
ELECTROLIMA and ELECTROPERU for planning staff training needs and any training



- 16 -
expansion programs. The above recommendations and components were later included as part of
the project.
6.12        External Audit.- Peru's Contraloria General nominates external auditors forpublic
sector enterprises. However, during project appraisal, the Bank was concerned that the nominated
firm would not have sufficient experience in dealing with public utilities to do a satisfactory audit
of ELECTROLIMA. Based on the Bank's recommendations, it was agreed that the Contraloria
General and ELECTROLIMA would accept terms of reference drafted by ELECTROLIMA and
reviewed by the Bank for the selection of external auditors. This Bank recommendation was
ratified during loan negotiations and served as the basis for identical procedures to be followed
by ELECTROPERU and HDRANDINA.
7.          Project Implementation.
7.01        The project was scheduled to be completed by December 31, 1986.
ELECTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU and HIDRANDINA were in charge of carrying out the
respective project components. The project begun very slowly due to unavailability of local funds,
however, this situation started to improve after 1984, when some of the studies under the project
were contracted and some initiated their execution. Implementation continued slowly during the
following years, as a result of the unusual number of bureaucratic and legal obstacles for
contracting most of the studies and for the acquisition of training equipment. The project included
about US$6.7 million to finance consulting services for the execution of the final design and for
the supervision during the construction of the Mantaro Transfer Scheme. Due to the postponement
of this project component (para. 7.03), it was decided that the contract with the respective
consultants be canceled after the completion of the first stage of the study. The balance of about
US$2.0 million was used for technical assistance supporting the regionalization process of
ELECTROPERU, after the corresponding changes were made to the Loan Agreement.
7.02        ELECTROLIMA's Component. The implementation of its distribution program
was delayed by more than three years with regard to the appraisal, due to a lack of local funding
and to the much lower-than-expected growth of energy sales. Consumption growth rate was about
5.5% yearly, as compared to the appraisal estimate of 9.4% for 1981-90. ELECTROLIMA
presented to the Bank a new program schedule later-on in 1984, but the Bank discovered that the
new program mainly reflected the expansion needed for the entire electric system in Lirna. The
construction of the Yuracmayo dam was divided in two lots and a local contractor started
construction of Lot I by January 1984. The preselection process for the construction of Lot II was
completed in December 1986. Bidding documents were prepared with the assistance of specialized
consultants, and construction was expected to start in September 1987 and to be completed by
March 1990. The expansion of the Huinco power plant, which was dependent on the
implementation of the Mantaro Transfer Scheme, was postponed. The implementation of the
training component was very slow and was estimated to be completed by 1989. This delay was
due to a lack of proper evaluation of the training facilities and capabilities of ELECTROLIMA.
The fellowship program did not start until 1984, with the travel of four engineers to Switzerland.
However, due to strict Government control for all trips abroad, no foreign training was provided
during 1985-1986. All the equipment and materials for adapting the existing installations of
ELECTROLIMA's headquarters for the construction of a provisional training center were not
purchased.

7.03        ELECTROPERU's Component. The final design and bidding documents for the
Mantaro Transfer Scheme were completed in 1984. However, the Government decided to
postpone its implementation. Based upon Bank advice, ELECTROPERU discontinued the
engineering studies already under contract with foreign consultants. The implementation of the
staff training component was very slow and only lirnited training activities were carried out for
the regional companies. This was due to budget limitations experienced in ELECTROPERU, and
the lack of professionals and technicians to fulfill their responsibilities. Despite the constant
pressure exerted by the Bank on ELECTROPERU's management to use the Banks's available
financial assistance, there was no interest shown by ELECTROPERU in using the technical
assistance funds assigned to the financial planning component.
7.04        HIDRANDINA's Component. Studies for the Mayush hydroproject progressed
satisfactorily and its final design was completed in 1984. During implementation of the Mayush
study, which included the evaluation of the Pativilca River hydro potential, it was revealed that
a large hydro potential of five plants with a total installed capacity of about 600MW could be
developed in this basin. The Bank assigned great importance to these findings, due to the scarcity
of hydro resources on the Pacific watershed, and the lack of projects with studies sufficiently
advanced to be considered as options for the North-Central System development programs.
7.05        During the project implementation around November 1986, and as a result of non-
compliance with the financial covenants, pursuant to Section 6.02 of the General Conditions
applicable to the Loan and Guarantee Agreements, the Bank suspended the remaining
disbursements of the loan'/. However, the Bank notified the Borrower that the cancellation of the
loan would not be effective until January 1987, in order to give additional time to the MEM,
ELECTROLIMA and ELECTROPERU to prepare a satisfactory Plan of Action to improve the
power sector finances, so as to avoid the final cancellation of the loan. The above plan would
include: (i) details regarding Government assumption of the power sector debt; (ii) draft
agreement on cost reduction to be agreed between CONADE, the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF), ELECTROPERU, and the Electric Utilities; (iii) rationale for reducing the
sector's fixed assets by 35%; (iv) rationale for reducing the sector's rate of return to a minimum
of 4 %; (v) rationale for the creation of a proposed maintenance fund; and (vi) updated and
consistent financial projections for 1986-1996 -in 1987 value- for the power sector, reflecting
the changes proposed in the draft Decreto Supremo and the 1986 actual results.
7.06        In view of the Borrower's efforts in preparing the above mentioned Plan of Action
for the sector, during a Bank mission that took place in March 1987, the Bank provided to
ELECTROLJMA an extension of three months of the deadline for the submission of a satisfactory
Plan of Action. With the enactment on March 31, 1987 of Decreto Supremo No. 065-87-EF and
the signing of the Acaa de Acuerdo between the MEF and the Power Sector, in which the
Government demonstrated its commitments towards the institutional and financial improvement
of the power sector, the Bank lifted the suspension of disbursements of the loan effective April
17, 1987. In addition, pursuant to the ELECTROLIMA's request, the Bank extended the Closing
Date of the loan to June 30, 1988. However, due to arrears in Peru's servicing of its foreign debt
3. In May 1986, the Bank had alerted ELECTROCIMA that corrective actions had to be taken,
otherwise the Bank would suspend disbursements under the loan.



- 18 -
and the lack of progress in normalization of relations between Peru and the Bank, and pursuant
to Section 6.03 (c) of the General Conditions, the Bank canceled the undisbursed balance of the
loan (US$55.3 million) on October 12, 1989.
7.07        Disbursements. Disbursements were made against 100% of foreign expenditures
for the engineering and consultant services related to (i) hydroelectric studies, (ii) foreign costs
of the component for teaching material and equipment, and (iii) the staff fellowship programs for
ELECTROPERU and ELECTROLIMA. However, disbursements were made against normal
documentation. Disbursements of the loan did not take place for almost a year (July 15, 1983)
after project approval, mainly due to the slow authorization of the Loan Agreement by the
Government and the additional delays needed to allow for the signature of subsidiary agreements
between the Borrower and the other agencies. To encourage and to accelerate the use of the loan,
the Bank established an Special Account for several ongoing operations in Peru, which enabled
the use of revolving funds and provided faster access to immediately available funds in those
accounts. In July 1985, as a result of the severe shortage of funds and the slow pace in the
execution of the distribution program- disbursements under the loan lagged well behind the
appraisal estimates, and amounted to only US$14.7 million or 39.4% of the SAR estimate.
Meanwhile, ELECTROLIMA requested the Bank for an increasing participation in the financing
of one of the Project's component: the Yuracmayo Dam. The construction of the dam was very
delayed and the efforts made by the Borrower for obtaining financing from other sources were
unsuccessful, because of the reluctancy of commercial banks to lend to a country with a very poor
economic situation. Based upon these facts, plus the need to produce additional energy by the
construction of the dam during the dry season, the Bank accepted the request and the financing
was increased from 30% to 90%, from the unallocated category of the loan, to permit a faster
loan disbursement. The increase was achieved by transferring US$10 million from the unallocated
category to the civil works category. The funds transferred from the unallocated category did not
result in the Bank's financing of local costs of the project as a whole, because the Bank's loan
originally covered only 88 % of the foreign cost. The final disbursement was made on August 17,
1987 (see annex 3).
7.08        Project Cost. Comparing actual costs and those estimates at appraisal is not fully
useful since the loan was canceled and some project components were postponed or not carried
out. Based on data supplied in November 1992 by ELFECTROLIMA, the total actual cost of the
project reached US$164.1 million (see annex 4), of which US$25.9 million equivalent (16%) was
financed by the Bank, including US$1.2 million of front-end-fees, and the remainder US$138.2
million equivalent (84%) was financed by ELECTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU and
HIDRANDINA. This represents a US$101.1 million lower cost than the appraisal estimate, which
was mainly due to the indefinite postponement of the Mantaro Transfer Studies and to the
cancellation by the Bank of the undisbursed balance of the loan, as already explained above.
7.09        Procurement. Procurement-related problems also slowed down the project
implementation. The heavy administrative and procurement constraints, imposed by the
Contraloria General de la Republica, were among the general factors for the slow project
implementation. It was agreed during appraisal, that materials which were not suitable for ICB-
such as concrete poles-and which were not financed by the Bank, could be locally procured
without significant effect on the project costs. It is noteworthy, that the project was the first
project processed after the creation of the Reglamento Unico de Licitaciones y Contratos de Obras



- 19 -
Publicas (RULCOP), whose procedures and guidelines were not satisfactory to the Bank.
However, assurances were given to the Bank that procurement of goods and services financed
with counterpart funds were to be exempted of any RULCOP regulations. ELECTROLIMA had
only limited success in having its interpretation prevailing over those of the Decree 22740, against
the Contralorfa's interpretation, which assumed exemption from RULCOP only for the Bank-
fnanced portion of the contracts for which the Bank was financing the projects. This situation
later deteriorated with the Ley de Presupuesto enacted on December 30, 1983, which confirmed
that all works not directly financed by international organizations should be procured under
RULCOP regulations. Additionally, the Decree 612-83-ESC Medidas de Austendad enacted on
January 8, 1984 established that any investment work should had a prior approval of the MEF and
from CONADE. These approval processes could take as long as three months. The Bank pursued
the solution of the above problems and recommended that the most efficient and economic way
of procuring a large number of small contracts, which were not financed by the Bank, was LCB.
7.10        The low quality of ELECTROLIMA's bidding documents was common at the
initial stages of project implementation, with a smaller improvement during the following years.
Most bidding documents were issued by several departments within ELECTROLIMA. To assure
standardization of the general conditions and compliance with the Bank's procurement guidelines,
a single unit (Division de Compras within the SubGerencia de Abastecimiento) was created within
ELECTROLIMA for preparing the general conditions and the draft contracts for all procurement.
However, the technical areas (Gerencia T&nica and Gerencia de Distribuci6n) continued to be
responsible for the technical specifications. Another procurement related problem was the sub-
division of some of the procurement by ELECTROLIMA, as a result of yearly budget restrictions
imposed by CONADE, which forced ELECTROLIMA to purchase smaller quantities than
technically desirable. This problem was eliminated when CONADE excluded from budget
limitations all items that were totally financed by Bank loans.
8           Project Results
8.01        ELECTROLIMA's Distribution Program. A total of 12 substations of 60/10 Kv
were constructed, which represented seven substations less than the number estimated at apprisal,
due to reductions with respect to market requirements for extending the 10kv/220 grid throughout
metropolitan Lima. Construction of 49kn of 60 Kv lines, 579km of 10Kv transmission lines and
cables, and the acquisition and installation of 1450 transformers of 220V were successfully carried
out. Additionally, approximately 94,000 new clients were connected with electricity, compared
to the projected 136,000. ELECTROLJMA has continued the expansion of it's distribution
program during the last few years, adding more than 700km of 60Kv and 10Kv lines to the
network and connecting about 28,000 new clients with electricity service (see annex 7).
8.02        Studies. The project included adequate financing to prepare several studies to
increase the electricity supply in the power sector. Under ELECTROLIMA's component the
following studies were prepared: (i) Salto Bajo Scheme, whose most promising development
would be the Jicamarca plant with a proposed installed capacity of 104 MW and expected
generation of 270 GWh during an average year; (ii) Transandean Tunnel Expansion, which
included modifications of the Marcapomacocha canal; (iii) Yuracmayo Dam, whose construction
was divided in two lots, although only the construction of Lot 1 was initiated. The dam study



- 20 -
concluded that no major negative environmental effects were expected from the dam construction.
HDRANDINA carried out the Mayush Hydro Project Study successfuUy. Two alternatives (low
and high pressure) were considered for the design of the main tunnel, however, the general
conclusion was oriented toward the low pressure alternative, due to smaUer technical risks during
the construction. The study found that a large hydropotential of five plants existed, with a total
installed capacity of about 600 MW, which could be developed in this basin. This project
component achieved its objectives partially.
8.03        Training Components. Only four professionals from ELECTROLJMA received
training abroad and the new staff training plan was revised for 1988-90. ELECIROLIMA with
its own funding, has continued staff training and initiated the installation of a new staff training
center at the ELECTROLIMA headquarters. Approximately 4,000 workers received training
annually in several fields of electricity maintenance, distribution, etc. ELECTROPERU's training
program did not progress as scheduled (para. 7.03). A fellowship program was prepared but not
implemented. Only small training courses and teaching materials were provided to the staff of the
regional companies. This project component achieved its objectives pardally.
8.04        Other Results. During project implementation, the Bank pursued with the
Government a policy for the achievement of a better and healthy financial situation of the power
utilities. As a result, several actions were agreed by MEM and the Power sector, as follow: (i)
the Government assumed the total existing debt (local and foreign) of the power sector, in the
amount of about US$1,360 million, and refinanced it to the sector over 20 years; (ii)
ELECTROPERU and CONADE would enter into an agreement to reduce the sector's operating
costs, personnel costs, and energy losses; (iii) the sector's annual investment program would be
analyzed by CONADE to be consistent with the countries possibilities; (iv) from 1988 on, the
sector's rate of return would be no less than 4%; (v) MEM, CONADE, and ELECTROPERU
would jointly prepare a plan for optimizing crude oil and power consumption, aiming at energy
conservation and diversification; (vi) CONADE and the power utilities would enter into an
agreement to improve the sector's management procedures and efficiency; (vii) ELECTROPERU
and its subsidiaries would have their fixed assets revaluated by consultants as of December 31,
1986, and would make the necessary adjustments in their respective accounting books; (viii) the
Tariff Commission together with ELECTROPERU would start to implement in 1987 a tarff rate
structure based in Long Term Marginal Costs (LTMC); (ix) a fixed percentage of the power
companies income would be allocated for equipment and maintenance, such percentage to be
annually establish by MEM. Nevertheless, due to the deteriorating economic conditions of Peru,
it became almost impossible to implement all the above agreements.
8.05        Rate of Return on the Project. Based on actual investment and operating costs,
and net marginal revenues, the internal rte of return on the main (ELECTROLIMA) component
of the project was -6% (Annex 8E). This negative rate when compared to the appraisal rate
(16.6%) reflects the low level of actual tariffs and the high labor and operating costs of the
project. However, it does not measure the economic impact of the project.
9           Flnancial Performance



- 21 -
9.01        The financial performance of ELECTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU and
HIDRANDINA reflect not only the deteriorating financial situation of the power sector during
the period of project implementation (annexes 7-9), but also the Government's failure to increase
tariff levels in line with inflation. Besides, during this period the power sector experimented lower
than expected sales growth and higher than expected operating expenses, which were the main
financial problems faced by the sector. The inadequate tariff increases reflected the effect of
populist political pressures on the Government. Tariffs fell in real terms, e.g., during 1983
cumulative tariff increases amounted to only 79 %, while the cost-of-living index rose 135 %. The
power utilities reduced their capital-expenditures programs during the period to minimal levels
and they did not have enough cash generation to cover their debt service. Also adversely affecting
the financial performance of the power utilities was the inordinate growth in operating expenses,
as a result of overall real increases in employment costs, caused partially by large staff increases.
During project preparation, the Bank should have investigated more toughly the financial situation
of the power sector vis a vis the country's economic situation, and consequently it would have
been necessary to have an agreement with the Government, reflected in the Loan Agreement,
whereby the financial problems of the power institutions could have been resolved or avoided.
9.02        During 1985, the rate of return of the three public utilities was less than 1.5%,
much lower than the covenanted rate of return of 10%. Despite the Bank's request for the
preparation of new yearly financial projections, the sector's return were below appraisal. The
Bank reminded the Government of these non-compliances, but did not threaten suspension of
disbursements in 1984-1986 due to the project's situation and the country economic
considerations. It was not until May 1986, that the Bank alerted ELECTROLIMA of the
possibility of suspending loan disbursements, and the lack of action by the Government in tariff
matters caused the Bank to finally suspended disbursements in November 1986. After a
satisfactory Plan of Action submitted to the Bank, whereby the Government and the power sector
established a comprehensive set of actions (para. 8.04) to improve the financial situation of the
sector, the Bank lifted disbursements suspension in April 1987. But due to the continued
deteriorating economic conditions of the country and the discontinuing payments of its debt
service, the Bank suspended all loans to Peru in May 1987.
9.03        ELECTRO LI MA. The 1982-1991 financial situation of EILCTROLIMA is shown
in Annex 8. During 1982, ELECTROLIMA's performance was slightly better than expected in
the appraisal. Net profits amounted to US$4.3 million compared to US$0.1 million at appraisal.
Higher than expected tariffs more than compensated for lower sales and higher operating
expenses, much of which was accounted for by exchange rate adjustments. Lower than expected
level of sales continued during 1983-84, including lower industrial sales due to the depressed state
of the Peruvian economy, which resulted in net losses of US$22.1 million and US$24.3 million,
respectively. During 1985, GWh sold were 14% less than the appraisal forecast, while purchase
of energy was 12% higher than in previous years, resulting in a net loss of US$23.2 million.
Despite increases in electricity tariffs, ECTROLIMA's financial situation worsened the
following years, as a result of higher operating expenses, higher purchases of energy (petroleum)
due to the severe dry season, and a new tax Impuesto de Solaridad introduced by the Government
in 1988 to help financing the public deficit. Net losses amounted to US$107 million in 1988.
ELECTROLIMA's financial situation, however, has started to improve in 1991 because of higher
tariff levels and a reduction in the administrative expenses, as a result of a reduction of its staff.
Net profits reached US$5.4 million.



- 22 -
9.04        ELECTROPERU. The 1982-1991 financial situation of ELECTROPERU is shown
in Annex 9. During 1982, FLECTROPERU's financial performance was poor, sales were 5 % less
than at appraisal. Operating expenses exceeded the appraisal estimates by 23 %. The net result of
the foregoing was that its net income was only US$5.8 million, 21 % of the appraisal's forecast.
As it was the case of ELECTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU's financial performance deteriorated
sharply during the following years. Net losses were US$49.0 million and US$40.3 million in 1983
and 1984 respectively. Total sales decreased more than 60% compared to the appraisal's estimate
of US$146.9 million (4,013.0 GWh) in 1982, and of US$57.0 million (3,135.8 GWh) in 1985,
as a result of decreases in the tariff levels in real terms, when ELECTROPERU started the
regionalization process and became only a generation-transmission institution. Current assets
covered about 80% of current liabilities. Another contributing factor of ELECTROPERU's poor
performance was its overstaffing and higher than anticipated expenses because of the
reconstruction costs needed to repair the damage caused by terrorist activities. By 1986, due to
low tariff levels its base rate was -1.6%. Its poor financial situation continued to deteriorated
during 1989-1990 and losses reached US$103.9 million. ELECTROPERU has experienced an
improvement in its finances during 1991, its net profits amounted to US$10.9 million as a result
of a 30% increase in electricity sales, higher level of tariffs, and a 29% reduction of the total
staff.
9.05        HIDRANDINA. The 1982-1991 financial situation of BIDRANDINA is shown in
Annex 10. Beginning in 1982, HIRANDINA was a low-cost producer, its rates were set not by
its own revenue requirements, but by the first application of Peru's uniform tariffs.
HiDRANDINA's construction program was lower than expected at appraisal, principally because
of the deferrals of works on its upstream Pativilca regulation project and on the Mayush Hydro
Project Study. Because its debt service was very low, it had been able to finance its investments
with its scarce cash flow, the Bank loan and other small borrowing. During 1984, HIDRANDINA
was transformed under the new electricity law (Decreto 23406 of May 28, 1982) into a regional
subsidiary of ELECTROPERU, and as such received a transfer of assets and personnel from
ELECTROPERU. HIDRANDINA's financial situation greatly deteriorated with the
transformation, and although its sales were more than 50% than at appraisal, the operating
expenses were 97% higher, resulting in a net loss of US$0.4 million. The high operating expenses
can be explained because HIRANDINA changed its scope from a bulk supplier to a regional
generation, transmission and distribution company. The negative financial performance continued
towards 1986-89, and total net losses reached US$14.2 million, as a result of lack of adequate
rates and higher than expected operating expenses.
10.         Bank Performance
10.01       Taking into consideration that this was the sixth Bank project to the Peruvian power
sector, the overall performance of the Bank was mixed, strong on some issues and weak on
others. At the time of preparation and appraisal of the project, the Bank correctly highlighted the
following issues: (a) poor organization and weak execution capacity of ELECT ROPERU; (b) need
to increase electricity tariff levels to improve the financial situation of the power utilities; (c) lack
of experience of the nominated audit firm in dealing with public utilities to do a satisfactory audit
of ELECT ROLIMA. The Bank's efforts were useless and not convincing regarding the use of
funds assigned for strengthening ELECTROPERU's financial planning, despite the fact that the
regionalization process conferred a function of holding company to ELECrROPERU.



- 23 -
10.02       The objectives set in the SAR concerning the institutional and financial
strengthening of ELECTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU and HIDRANDINA were rather optimistic.
The covenants related to improving the financial conditions of the Borrower and the other
beneficiaries, as well as those needed for improving project execution through the establishment
of an executive unit were appropriate. Nevertheless, the Bank staff pursued with tenacity the goals
of maintenance of an adequate level of tariffs and to push for adjustments in the institutional
aspects of the power sector agencies. The Bank relied upon the Government to implement an
adequate tariff policy, which would assure the financial performance of ELECTROLIMA,
ELECTROPERU and IDRANDINA. During the project implementation, particularly in 1985,
the Bank called the attention of the Govemment to the financial losses of the three institutions by
the application of a negative pricing policy. As the financial situation worsened for the Borrower,
ELECTROPERU and BIDRANDINA, the Bank suspended disbursements in November 1986 for
non-compliance of the financial covenants. The suspension was lifted in April 1987 upon the
presentation of a satisfactory Plan of Action to the Bank for improving the power sector utilities
finances. Unfortunately, failure in achieving the project's financial and institutional objectives
were in large measure due to the Government's inability or unwillingness to support the required
adjustment, because of political and economic considerations (paras. 6.07; 7.04)
10.03       Regarding procurement procedures, the Bank was persistent with the Government
to allow ELECTROLIMA, HIDRANDINA and ELECTROPERU, to approve contracts for Bank-
financed projects against the Contralorfa's interpretation of Decree 22740. Additionally, to avoid
delays in project implementation, the Bank was helpful in providing support and advice to the
Borrower in convincing CONADE for the elimination of the budget's yearly restriction to
ELECTROLIMA, therefore avoiding subdividing the procurement of some goods and works
(para. 7.08).
10.04       The Bank was strongly committed to assist Peru in developing the electric power
sector and strengthening the management and organization of its key power sector institutions.
The Bank, ELECTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU, HIDRANDINA, and the Government maintained
a good relationship and understanding concerning some of the constraints affecting the project.
The Bank was very helpful in providing technical assistance to resolve the economic problems of
the country (mainly high inflation and severe balance of payment problems). To sustain project
momentum, the Bank continued to finance most of project components through December 1987,
almost seven months after the general suspension of all loan disbursements to Peru, but without
having received any payment on the rapidly accumulating arrears.
10.05       The number of Bank staff supervision mission appears to have been adequate for
the size and complexity of the project (see annex 6). Supervision efforts were sustained through
full or partal missions from Project Effectiveness to Closing Date. There was an average of 2.5
missions per year. Bank supervision of the project started even before the loan became effective
(May 1983). This was possible because the Bank was already carrying out supervision on other
operations. Four of the project supervision missions were combined with supervision for other
Bank projects. The major supervision weakness was the lack of more positive actions on the
financial aspects of ELECTROPERU, ELECTROLIMA, and in some respects to procurement,
as well as to monitoring and supervision procedures, in spite of the more than adequate attention
paid in the field to technical matters. Supervision mission reports made no reference to the



- 24 -
worsening macroeconomic situation, insofar as it affected the project objectives. Comments on
the economy were only made in relation to loan disbursement flows. The Bank only tried to
speed-up the project implementation, rather than to asses properly ELECTROLIMA,
ELECTROPERU and HIDRANDINA's reasons for the delays, and make the procurement process
more efficient. The Bank insisted several times that the review of bidding documents should be
done in one unit within ELECTROLIMA to assure standardization of general conditions and
compliance with basic principles of the Bank's procurement Guidelines. In the case of
ELECTROLIMA, the Bank also requested its management to avoid dividing equipment
procurement into small packages to speed up the procurement process and project implementation.
10.06       The legal agreements and the SAR were adequately prepared and generally of a
comprehensive nature. Supervision reports provided a good and complete picture of the technical
issues concerning the project, but not enough information in relation to the financial and
institutional aspects of the Borrower and the beneficiaries.
10.07       During the supervision phase, the Bank appears to have been too lenient in
accepting delays in the submission of inadequate audit reports, late progress reports, inadequate
subproject indicators, and inappropriate information on procurement and approval procedures
from ELECIrROLIMA, HIRANDINA and ELECIROPERU. However, the Bank supervision
missions provided a good opportunity to supply specalized technical assistance to the Borrower's
staff, as well as to ELECI1ROPERU and HDRANDINA's staff, which was helpful during project
implementation.
10.08       Finally, the very large overrun of time employed to start the project
implementation, compared to the appraisal estimate, is difficult to explain; since there was
considerable experience at the Bank on actual implementation time-spans for a project such as the
Sixth Power Project. Fortunately, the Bank exhibited flexibility in extending the Effective Date
of the loan from the original date of September 20, 1982 to May 12, 1983. Nevertheless, US$55.3
million of the loan funds were canceled on October 12, 1989.
11.         Borrower and Beneficiaries Performances
11.01       The project was properly identified and prepared. Project preparation and design
were satisfactorily carried out by ELECTROLIMA's staff, with adequate assistance from the
Bank. The performance of ELECrROPERU, 1IDRANDINA and ELECTROLIMA were
financially and technically weak, although strictly in relation with the project there were some
positive achievements (paras. 11.03-11.04)
11.02       ELECTROPERU and ELECTROLIMA's financial performance were
discouragingly poor due mainly to the pricing policy imposed by the Government. The lack of
sufficient available financial resources led to serious delays in the project implementation and to
the deterioration of ELECTROPERU and ELECTROLIMA's operating capabilities. This poor
financial performance of the two agencies, and their low efficiency, were tied to issues related
to the dual role of the Government as policy maker, and sector regulator, and at the same time
owner/operator of ELECTROPERU and ELECTROLIMA. Also, ELECIROLIMA was slow in
complying with the main conditions of effectiveness and also its complex and time consuming
procurement procedures delayed project implementation. The low quality of the bidding



- 25 -
documents provided by several departments within ELECTROLIMA, and the unfamiliarity of its
staff with Bank's Guidelines, aggravated project implementation. The creation of the Purchasing
Division improved its procurement process (paras. 6.02; 7.08; 7.09; 9.0).
11.03       Throughout the project implementation period, ELECTROLIMA developed
satisfactory appraisal procedures and capabilities for this kind of project. ELECTROLIMA's
management information system was greatly improved and presently is capable of processing data
from its different operational areas. ELECTROLIMA performed an important restructuring of
its accounting, budgeting and information systems, introducing a new accounting and budget
planning, which facilitates the preparation of forecast of revenues and cost information for each
of ELECTROLIMA's network and activities, and complies with the standard industry practices.
ELECTROLIMA has become a well managed electricity company with highly trained and
experienced professionals. ELECTROPERU's accounting system and financial planning capability
improved, but additional strengthening is needed. ELECTROPERU's organization underwent
major modifications to improve its technical, administrative and finance areas, however, to some
extent, the shortcomings of its higher managerial staff still persist. Its Board of Directors
intervenes often in operational aspects of the institution. There were some improvement in the
administration and control of the subsidiary companies and more administrative autonomy was
extended to these companies.
11.04       ELECTROLIMA and ELECTROPERU have improved their procurement
procedures and knowledge of the Bank Guidelines. After its initial delays in procurement, because
of the unfamiliarity of their staff with Bank's procurement procedures, notable progress took place
during 1986-1987. Consultants were selected on the basis of short lists approved by the Bank and
the evaluation of the technical proposals received from those invited to participate. The Borrower
progress and audit reports were not received on time and did not reflect its true financial situation.
ELECTROLIMA complied with its obligations under the loan agreement, except for the financial
covenants (see annex 5)
11.05       HIDRANDINA managed its operations with satisfactory results. Particular mention
deserves the agile reaction of its management for the execution of the Mayush study, which was
supervised directly by HfDRANDINA's management with the help of a small group of part-time
professionals. During project implementation, the company underwent major changes, caused by
the regionalization of the sector. Under the influence of CONADE, its headquarters were
centralized in Trujillo. The operating division was split in to one division responsible for
generation and transmission, and the other division for distribution and sales. However, given the
future role of BIDRANDINA as a regional utility, the company has to develop and expand its
managerial capability.
12.         Project Relationship
12.01       Over the full period of project implementation, ELECTROLIMA,
ELECTROPERU, HIDRANDINA and the Bank maintained a close relationship and a good
understanding concerning the main constraints of project implementation. Bottlenecks and
constraints were removed efficiently and expeditiously without negative impacts on the Bank-
Borrower relationship. However, this relationship was characterized by the lack of continuity of
staff and managers working on the project both in Peru and at the Bank. However, the open



- 26 -
working relationship was beneficial to the partial achievement of the Project's objectives, where
the Bank responded in a flexible way to the Borrower's requests.
12.02       The Bank's relationship with other national agencies and participating institutions
was also very cordial. The Bank had no problem gaining access to the highest level of
Government for sector policy dialogue and for rendering professional advice.
13.         Consultant's Services
13.01       Contractors, consultants and suppliers both local and foreign, generally performed
rather well. The consultants contracted to conduct the Mayush study, did high quality work and
proved to be efficient in assisting HIDRANDINA'S Project Unit. Their performance, both in
terms of technical quality and compliance with schedules was very satisfactory. Consultants hired
by ELECTROPERU were useful and on the basis of their studies an active geological fault was
found crossing the head trace of the tunnel of the proposed conceptual design for the proposed El
Chorro hydroplant. Consultants contracted for the Yuracmayo studies were less than satisfactory
at the initial stages of the studies. During the preparation of the feasibility studies, they used an
inadequate approach for the estimates of flood and spillway design, costs estimation and economic
evaluation. However, with the advice of the Bank, the consultants adequately revised their work
and later on produced tender documents, which correctly followed the Bank's Guidelines. In the
case of the Salto Bajo studies, rearrangements of the work and extension of the implementation
schedule were needed due to the indefinite postponement of the Mantaro Transfer Scheme.
14.         Project Documentation and Data
14.01       Project documentation and data included legal documents, the staff appraisal report
(SAR), the mission back-to-office reports, supervision reports, and progress reports provided by
the Borrower.
14.02       The Legal Agreements and the SAR were adequately prepared, generally very
comprehensive and served satisfactorily during project implementation. They adequately reflected
the Bank's interest for the satisfactory execution of the project. However, the Borrower progress
reports were submitted with some delays and did not reflect a complete picture of the financial
situation of the Borrower, neither of the other executing agencies. Supervision reports provided
a good comprehensive picture of the technical matters of the project , but rarely of the
institutional-financial aspects of the Borrower. The analysis of such aspects improved in later
supervision reports. There is lack of continuity between several supervision reports, and it is
sometimes difficult to get a clear idea of the evolution of the situation between supervision
missions.
14.03       ELECTROLIMA and ELECTROPERU are currently organizing a management
information system, where the data for project costs and accounting matters will be integrated to
serve as a useful tool for project management and monitoring in the future.
13.04       The data required for the preparation of the PCR were not always readily available
because of incomplete correspondence files, missing back-to-office and supervision reports, as



- 27 -
well as Borrower progress reports and other project data. Some of this shortcomings are due to
poor filing practice in the Bank.
15.        Lessons Learned
15.01       The principal lessons learned from this project experience can be summarized as
follows:
*     (a) The implementation schedules for complex projects under difficult
conditions should not be faster than available implementation profiles
(general).
*.   (b) Fundamental reforms within the power companies, as well as in the
policy and regulatory framework, were needed to improve decision-making
process and accountability and make the power sector agencies more
autonomous. More recent far-reaching power sector reforms, should make
a more lasting contribution to sustainable power sector development (para.
2.17).
(c) During project preparation the different steps needed to obtain legal
clearance for subsidiary contracts and agreements should be clearly
established in order to avoid implementation problems. If necessary, clear
exceptions to local laws should be discussed during loan negotiations and
incorporated into the Guarantee Agreement (para. 6.02).
(d) Sector training needs are usually very large; and therefore, sector
agencies should encourage the creation of adequate staff training units, with
broad mandates, not only to assess needs, but also to define and fund long
term plans to properly address them. The Bank should use the existing
institutional training infrastructure, and should ask for advice from an
outside independent consultant. In no case should the Bank finance a
taining component without the wholehearted concurrence of the Borrower
(paras. 6.11 and 7.02).
(e) Even under difficult macroeconomic conditions, the Bank should
enforce compliance with financial covenants and suspend loans when non-
compliance persists. Otherwise the credibility of the Bank is subject to
doubt (paras. 7.05, 7.06; 9.01 and 9.02)
(f) The Bank should insist on better and more comprehensive preparation
of institution building components mainly those related with management
and financial issues, especially for institutions such as ELFECTROLIMA
and ELECTROPERU, which do not have proper financial discipline or
independence from political influence (para. 9. 01).



- 28 -
(g) For countries like Peru, which have weak macroeconomic conditions,
a firm commitment of local funding should be a condition for proceeding
with loan negotiation, to assure viability and successful implementation of
the project. Realistic evaluation of the possible local contribution, which
can be obtained from the beneficiaries should be determined during project
preparation and appraisal, as well as their legal implications and the
procedures for their collection. Only a fraction of the potential contribution
should be considered realistically for project funding evaluation (paras.
7.03; 7.07).
(h) Special attention and continuous efforts should be devoted to assist the
borrowers in using the Bank's procurement guidelines. A close review of
country laws, regulations and practices should be made before project
appraisal to identify any problem areas and to seek before hand their
solution during loan negotiations. In the event of conflict between local
laws and Bank procurement guidelines, Government agreement to obtain
a waiver of such local laws with respect to Bank-financed project should be
a requirement for proceeding with the project (para. 7. 09).

SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(Loan 2179 - PE)
PART 11 PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
The Borrower's contribution to the PCR was prepared by ELECTROLIMA (Technical
Advisory Unit from the Technical Department). The text below is as received from the
Borrower and its contents are not attributable to the Bank. The original report was in
Spanish and has been translated to English and edited to achieve stylistic consistency with
Part I.



- 30 -
1.         Features of the Loan
1.01       Execution of the Sixth Power Project began in 1982 and lasted until 1988.
The total cost of the project was estimated at US$256.5 million. Total foreign cost was
estimated at USS92.6 million. Electrolima became the beneficiary of World Bank Loan
2179-PE.
1.02       The total loan amount was US$81.2 million, from which funds were to be
onlent to Electroperu and Hidrandina for subsidiary projects. The subsidiary loan amounts
were as follows:
Loan Amount
(US$ million)
ELECTROLIMA   46.7
ELECTROPERU    9.0
HIDRANDINA        2.5
Front-End Fee     1.2
Contingencies    21.8
TOTAL            81.2
1.03       The loan was signed on September 17, 1982, and became effective on May
12, 1983, after signature of the respective contracts with the subsidiary companies. The
Closing Date took place on June 30, 1987, and all Bank disbursements were definitively
suspended on June 30, 1988.
2.-        Project Cost
2.01       The main components of the Sixth Energy Project, most of whose foreign
exchange costs were to be covered by the loan, were as follow (see Annex 4 of Bank
Report)
3.-         Project Execution
Background.
3.01       At the time the loan was obtained, it was ELECIROLIMA's traditional
practice to conduct its studies and works programs with financial assistance from the
World Bank, which was chiefly used to finance purchases of materials and electrical
equipment from abroad. The Sixth Energy Project included expansions of the various



31 -
transmission, distribution and support systems and execution of the Yuracmayo dam
project, which had been studied under the previous loan, 2018-PE.
3.02       All the works to be executed, except for the Yuracmayo dam, were
incorporated in the programmed activities that ELECTROLIMA executes each year as part
of its investment program. The Yuracmayo dam was subject to other restrictions of a
political/economic nature which led to its postponement, despite the fact the Bank had
agreed to introduce certain changes in the use of the loan proceeds that would have
financed up to 90% of its cost. Consequently, ELECTROLIMA made maximum use of
the loan by acquiring imported electrical equipment and carrying out studies with foreign
consultants, using funds released prior to the suspension of loan disbursements.
3.03       The current review of the general management of ELECTROLIMA between
1985-90 indicates that this was a period of serious loss of autonomy, reflected also in a
loss of the ability to secure Bank disbursements at a time when these resources were
available. In the second half of the period in question ELECTROLIMA significantly
reduced its execution of investments.
3.04       We are in agreement with the assessments in Part I of the Bank's report
regarding Electrolima's limitations and shortcomings deriving from Electroperu's
monopoly, the inappropriate tariff policies of the Tariff Commission, and the excessive
State intervention in the electricity sector.
Changes to the Project.
3.05       Demand. The Sixth Energy Project was prepared to handle an average
annual increase in demand of some 8 % forecasted for the period 1982-86. However,
demand actually declined by some 3 % in 1983, which led to postponement for one to two
years of the works planned for 1984, principally distribution works. There was another
decline in demand in 1988, which also caused some rescheduling of works and extended
the project until 1991.
3.06       Execution of Works. The works lagged behind the original estimates not
only because demand was lower than expected, but also because of delays in execution,
which postponed completion of the works for two to three years. There were no significant
changes in the original plans and consequently it can be said that the original targets were
not obtained on time.
Execution Capacity.
3.07       Annual execution of works during the period of loan availability was slow,
and so was utilization of the loan proceeds. There were a number of reasons for this, but



- 32 _
most of them involved administrative delays and alterations in legal requirements, both
within and outside the company.
3.08       The decision of the previous government to discontinue debt service
payments sharply curtailed progress on works execution. This situation was aggravated by
political interference in the electricity sector, which resulted in the company's taking on
responsibilities that did not corresponded to its objectives. This interference took the form
of pressure on the company to perform tasks involving the creation of jobs to eliminate
unemployment and to provide general tariff subsidies. From 1987 onwards, after Bank
disbursements had ceased, only strictly essential works were executed and efforts were
focused principally on the 1OKv and 60Kv distribution systems.
3.09       Things changed with the arrival of the new government in the second half of
1990, and the company was then able to exercise its management autonomy.
4.         Project Achievements
Results Obtained
4.01       From Electrolima's point of view, project preparation and the approval of
the loan can be regarded as a success. Although project execution was affected by the
economic crisis of the 1980's, leading to delays in the execution of all works, the
following achievements can be recorded:
(1) Transmission and Distribution Program. The distribution system was
expanded throughout the metropolitan region of Lima: consisting of 60/10Kv substations,
lOKv primary distribution and 220v secondary distribution networks. The transmission
system was also significantly expanded, involving installation of the 100 MVAR reactive
energy compensation system, expansion and renovation of 60/1OKv substations, 60Kv lines
and cables, implementation of the 22OKv, 60Kv and 1OKv line protection systems, and
introduction of remote control of the 1OKv feeders.
(ii) Program of Studies. The studies for the Yuracmayo dam were
considerably delayed. Nevertheless, the retention of the project in the program enabled a
fairly flexible relationship to be maintained with the hired consultants, which permitted
completion of the feasibility studies for the Salto Bajo scheme and the expansion of the
Huinco hydro station.
(iii) Yuracmayo Dam Project. This project was also considerably delayed.
Work was only begun on Lot 1 of the works, including the drainage gallery, access gallery
and encampments.



3 3 -
(iv) Training. This program was not fully implemented and the number of
professionals that received any training was relatively limited.
Financial Results
4.02       The progress pertaining to the financial execution is shown in Graph No. 1.
The financial results are the following:
(i) Part A (Transmission and Distribuaion Programs andAuriliary or Support
Services). Execution of the subprojects, for this part of the loan agreement accounted for
some US$19 million, as compared to the US$41 million initially planned. This amount
was the largest single item among those of the loan proceeds.
(ii) Part B (Yuracmayo Darn). Construction of the dam did not begin during
the period of loan effectiveness, therefore the loan agreement was not complied with.
(iii) Parts C, D, E and F (Consultants, Training).
Some 45 % of the specified loan amount was applied to these items, or
approximately USS2 million.
Physical Results
4.03       The physical results are described in considerable detail in Parts I and m of
the Bank's report. They were smaller than anticipated, and progress came to a halt in
1988. This outcome is attributable to local currency financing difficulties and the
economic crisis in Peru, reflected in lower than expected demand, especially in the years
i!M, and 1988.
5.         Project Supervision and Monitoring
5.01       Project achievements, both physical and in terms of disbursements, were
described in the semestral reports prepared by Electrolima. A total of 10 such reports
were submitted during the period of loan effectiveness. As regards supervision, all the
project works formed part of ELFECrROLIMA's annual budgets and operating plans.
Loan execution was therefore subject to the same degree of supervision as all other
company investments.
6.         Finanncia Aspects
6.01       As already noted, Loan 2179-PE was to finance the greater part of the
foreign currency costs of the works included in Electrolima's Sixth Energy Project. The
local currency costs of these works and studies were to be financed almost entirely from



- 34 -
ELECTROLIMA's own resources. The Government's recourse to subsidies for its
economic programs meant that tariffs could not be used to maintain the company's
financial equilibrium, with the result that in general terms its local currency resources were
too small to permit the loan proceeds to be used at the rate or in the amounts originally
planned.
7.         Lessons Learned
7.01       We would like to add the following comments to the conclusions reached by
the Bank:
(a)   We agree that the conditions that prevailed during execution of the
project financed by the Bank's loan were difficult, but we do not
regard the Sixth Energy Project as a complex one. Decision making
was complicated by excessive interference by the State, which resulted
in corporate objectives being ignored. A point was even reached
where different approaches were adopted to similar problems, while
execution of the project was marked by constant and exaggerated
requests for information, from different institutions, for unclear
reasons and without any apparent results.
(b)   We agree that reform of the policy and regulatory framework for the
electricity sector is necessary; these measures have already been taken
by the present Governrnent.
(c)   As regards the need for clarification of the legal aspects of contracts,
we believe that this requirement will be better defined as a result of
the measures referred to in (b) above.
(d)   The training of professionals was not fully effective because of the
lack of proper plans. More training is needed both in technical and
administrative areas.
(e)   As regards the conditions for loan negotiations in the context of a
weak economy: this matter is being addressed in Peru's current
economic policy vis-a-vis the international lending organizations.
(f)   We agree with the Bank's views regarding the lack of financial
discipline and the need for freedom from political interference.
(g)   We agree with Bank's view regarding the need for firm commitments
in relation to local funding if beneficiaries are to gain from Bank



- 35 -
lending. The recently established regulatory framework may be able
to mobilize private local capital for electricity sector projects.
(h)   We agree with the Bank's view regarding the efforts that are needed
to reconcile the Bank's requirements and Peru's legislation so that
solutions can be identified beforehand for purposes of future loan
negotiations.
