SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Zaire
Smallholder Maize Project (Credit 1040-ZR)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Zaire - Smaliholder
Maize Project (Credit 1040-ZR)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office. The Borrower did not
submit Part II.
Tle project did not achieve its objective of increasing maize yields on a sustainable basis.
Due to an inadequate technology package, scarce supplies of fertilizer and seeds and severe
counterpart funding constraints, the envisaged improvements in farming practices did not materialize.
The project is rated as unsatisfactory. Institutional initiatives were short lived, and implementation
was undermined by misprocurement and other abuses.
The Project Completion Report is of acceptable quality. Nevertheless, an audit is planned
given the pervasive deficiencies experienced in project design and implementation.

SMALLHOLDER MAIZE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1040-ZR)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report for the Smallholder Maize Project, for which Credit
1040-ZR, in the amount of US$11.0 million equivalent, was approved on June 5, 1980.
The Credit was closed on June 30, 1990, 30 months behind schedule. The last disbursement
was on November 15, 1990. An amount of US$1,024,062 was canceled on January 22, 1991, and an
additional amount of US$4,289 was canceled on March 21, 1991, following the reconciliation of the
accounts.
The draft completion report was prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization
Investment Center and substantially revised by the Agriculture Operations Division of the South-
Central and Indian Ocean Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Part I and Part III).
This report is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit
Agreement and the Joint Project Agreement, supervision reports and correspondence. The report
was sent to the Borrower on February 20, 1992 with a request to prepare Part II, and to the major
cofinanciers, but no comments were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZAIRE
SMALLHOLDER MAIZE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1040-ZR)
Evaluation Summary
Background
1.     In 1979, about 75% of the population made their livelihood in agriculture. Three or four
million small-scale farmers produced food crops such as manioc, maize, plantains and rice, providing
about 60% of the agricultural goods consumed. The remainder came from large plantations that
produced palm oil, coffee, rubber and cocoa for export. The political upheavals of the 1960s, the
nationalization policy and transportation problems resulted in a decline in the output of both large-
scale and small-scale producers. As a result, exports declined and imports increased in order to satisfy
the needs of the ever-growing population. In particular, maize imports reached a level of 25% of
total consumption in 1978 (up from 14% in 1975), and the figure was expected to reach 45% in 1985.
In view of this, the Government of Zaire gave absolute priority to local maize production in order
to provide a substitute for imports and reduce the country's dependence on external sources of food.
Project Objectives
2.     The project aimed to improve existing farming systems in the Kasai Oriental Region,
increase maize production from about 80,000 tons to about 120,000 tons per annum, and increase
participating farmer's income. The expected increase in maize production, which was to substitute
for imports, was to be achieved through the development of inputs supply, marlketing channels and
extension services for about 53,000 farmers' families. Funds were included to develop basic
infrastructure -- notably roads and drinking water facilities. The project was intended to extend and
consolidate services introduced under previous projects financed by the European Development Fund
(EDF), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Zairian
Government. Total project cost was estimated at US$38.5 million. The Government was to provide
US$6.1 million, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) US$15.0 million, the
African Development Bank (AfDB) US$6.4 million and IDA US$11.0 million. The project was to
be implemented by the Kasai Oriental Maize Project (PMKO).
Project Implementation
3.     Implementation of the main component (provision of inputs) progressed well initially.
Other components (roads and water supply) encountered initial delays due to (i) a decision by the



- lv -
AfDB, which was financing the roads component, to suspend disbursements on projects in Zaire due
to repayment arrears and (ii) delays in the preparation of the water supply rehabilitation program.
Annual reports and regular project supervision missions recorded satisfactory implementation of the
major components until 1986, when problems started to emerge. This coincided with a change in the
supervision team. A detailed technical supervision took place in 1986 and a management audit
followed. The findings of the latter were released in mid-1988. The conclusions were devastating
and showed that the project had not met its targets and that there were serious managerial
deficiencies. Planned and actual physical project achievements are shown in Table 5, Part III.
4.      One of the major problems raised by the management audit was misprocurement. In two
instances fertilizer was bought following limited local tender at much higher than world market prices.
In a third instance, an eighty percent unsecured advance in the amount of US$695,200 was made by
IDA and IFAD, for the delivery of two thousand tons of fertilizer, and only five hundred tons were
eventually delivered. A confidential, internal Bank review was carried out following allegations by
the Bank of Zaire that IDA was in part responsible for the misprocurement. The review
acknowledged that, in the interest of facilitating project implementation, Bank staff had been
overindulgent in the processing of disbursement requests.
5.      Disappearance and theft of supplies funded by the project occurred throughout project
implementation. Although often suspected by Bank staff supervising the project, the full extent was
not documented until the management audit in 1988. Fuel and fertilizer were stolen by project staff
and sold for private profit. In addition, local Government authorities used or confiscated 75,000 liters
of fuel and a Land Rover.
Results
6.      Overall, project results were disappointing. The project was unable to achieve its objective
of increasing maize production on a sustainable basis and thus increase farmer's incomes. No
adequate extension package for this purpose was developed; extension activities concentrated on
encouraging the use of improved seeds and fertilizer while inadequate supplies of either were
available. Incomplete data shows that maize production increases were mainly due to an increase in
area planted and that actual yields for maize fell during project implementation. In the absence of
a suitable production package, the envisaged modification of farming systems and the introduction
of mixed cropping (including cash crops) was given insufficient attention. Farmer's incomes are not
likely to have improved as a result of the project. Despite agreements reached with the Borrower,
the practice of forced cotton planting continued throughout the project, albeit at reduced levels. This
had a negative impact on maize production, because the farmer was unable to spend sufficient time
on his maize fields. The experiments with animal traction had limited success and were finally handed
over to local non governmental organizations (NGOs). The project was successful in its rehabilitation
and construction of manual drinking water supply systems, which besides providing labor savings, also
had a public health impact. The extent and impact of the roads component is unknown.
7.      Despite the provision of training and technical assistance, the institutional impact of the
project was negligible.



8.      Based on available information, it is impossible to estimate incremental farm income due
to the project, or the project's economic rate of return. Information on maize production is
unreliable, as are annual cost data. Because of the limited impact on production and the high
investment costs of the project, the economic rate of return (ERR) is probably negative.
Sustainability
9.      Project activities have been shown to be unsustainable in the absence of donor financing.
In light of the present economic and political situation, it is unlikely that the Government can provide
sufficient financing for fertilizer imports and for support to project services (extension, research,
maintenance of roads, bridges and ferries, and the drinking water supply systems). Responsibility
for the maintenance of roads and village water supply systems was transferred to the appropriate
national services along with project assets. The national seeds service (SENASEM) took over seed
farm activities at Mpoyi. Extension activities in the area have been taken over by the Pilot Extension
Project (Cr. 2096-ZR), albeit with reduced staffing levels, and research activities will be supported
under the credit for the National Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 2292-ZR), which is not yet
effective. Support to animal traction activities was taken over by local NGOs.
Lessons Learned
10.     The following are the most important lessons learned from the project:
(i) Government's inability to contribute adequate funding should be much more carefully
considered at the design stage, so that its impact on project implementation can be
minimized. In this case, the high risk associated with having Government finance an
essential input was known in advance, but steps taken to mitigate the risk were
inadequate. A covenant was incorporated into the Credit Agreement requiring
Government to provide adequate fertilizer to the project. However, the available
remedies and supervision experience showed that this type of conditionality was not
practical. Upfront conditionality or conditions for disbursements might have been more
effective.
(ii) The PMKO project experience provides a clear lesson in the need to apply consistent
criteria in the application of credit conditionality, whatever the prevailing country
conditions.
(iii) Performance by the Bank suggests that in the Zairian context, there are advantages
from diversifying staff for supervision during project execution, even where there
appears to be satisfactory project execution. In this project, either by design or
coincidence, there was significant turnover in Bank staff responsible for the project,
which considerably improved the quality and impact of supervision missions.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.     Project Identity
Project Name:    Smallholder Maize Project
Credit Number:   1040-ZR
Region:          Africa
Country:         Zaire
Sector:          Agriculture
Subsector:       Extension; Foodcrops
2.     Backeround
2.1    In 1979, about 75% of the population made their livelihood in agriculture. Three or four
million small-scale farmers produced food crops such as manioc, maize, plantains and rice, providing
about 60% of the agricultural goods consumed. The remainder came from large plantations that
produced palm oil, coffee, rubber and cocoa for export. The political upheavals of the 1960s, the
nationalization policy and transportation problems resulted in a decline in the output of both large-
scale and small-scale producers. As a result, exports declined and imports increased in order to satisfy
the needs of the ever-growing population. In particular, maize imports reached a level of 25% of
total consumption in 1978 (up from 14% in 1975), and the figure was expected to reach 45% in 1985.
In view of this, the Government of Zaire gave absolute priority to local maize production in order
to provide a substitute for imports and reduce the country's dependence on external sources of food.
3.     Project Description and Objectives
3.1    The purpose of the project was to support the development of input supply and extension
services to farmers in the Kasai Oriental Region, principally in order to increase the production of
maize and improve its marketing. It was also designed to develop basic infrastructure -- notably roads
and drinking water facilities. The project was to extend and consolidate services introduced under
previous projects financed by the European Development Fund (EDF), the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Zairian Government; its principal objective was
to assist an estimated 53,000 farmer families to modify their farming systems and thus increase their
incomes.



- 2 -
3.2     The following were the main components of the project, which was to be implemented over
a six-year period:
(a)   improvement of input supplies to farmers, including:
(i)           provision of additional fertilizer;
(ii)          purchase and/or production and storage of improved maize seed; and
(iii)         development of storage  facilities, provision  of transport and
organization of services for the distribution and sale to farmers of
fertilizer and seed;
(b)    development of marketing facilities for maize through the sale of trucks to private
transporters;
(c)    development of improved extension, training and research facilities, including improved
facilities, staff and organization of extension services, a new training program for
extension staff, and research on farming systems and related labor-saving devices
(d)   improvement of about 1,150 km of farm roads, including reconstruction of bridges and
ferries;
(e)    rehabilitation and improved maintenance of drinking water systems for about 172
villages; and
(f)    provision of technical assistance in support of the above activities and to strengthen
project management services.
4.      Project Design and Organization
4.1     The design of the project was relatively simple and was in essence a strengthening and
merger of existing projects in the area. It did not, however, properly address the risks identified
during project preparation and did not seriously consider the effects of the macro-economic
environment on the project (pricing of fertilizer and maize, obligatory cotton planting by farmers, low
government salaries, etc.). The main risk was the lack of Government counterpart funding, which
had seriously undermined the effectiveness of the FAO funded National Fertilizer Program (PNE).
It was this risk that surfaced relatively early-on during project implementation. Government delayed
making funding available to the project and was unable to provide the project with the agreed
amounts of fertilizer. Project activities were, as a result, seriously hampered. In addition, theft and
fraud, which were other risks identified at appraisal, became a major problem during the latter part
of project implementation.
4.2     The organization of the project authority (Projet Mais Kasai Oriental, PMKO) was
patterned after the Kasaif Oriental Agricultural Commission (CAKO). A Regional Coordination
Committee was to be established to give guidance to the project director. The project management
unit was to collaborate with the National Institute for Agricultural Studies and Research (INERA)
for research activities, with the Roads Office for the mechanized construction and maintenance of
roads and with the Hydrological Service for the drinking water supply component.

5.     Project Implementation
5.A.    General
5.A.1.  Effectiveness
5.1    The Credit was declared effective on May 11, 1981, a delay of less than three months. The
main causes for the delay were the resolution of the debt of CAKO, Government's legal opinion on
the agreements with the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Intemational Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the appointment of project staff.
5.A.2.  Project Costs and Financing
5.2    Full details of actual project costs are not available, because of uncertainty about the
contribution by the Government. The project completion mission estimated the actual Government
contribution at US$5.1 million versus US$6.1 million estimated at appraisal. The first figure was
based on budgeted projections rather than actual fund releases. Government routinely only released
half of the allocated amount and this with great delays. This report therefore estimates the
Government contribution at US$3.0 million and actual project cost at US$30.0 million, compared to
US$38.5 million estimated at appraisal. The AfDB contributed US$3.15 million (US$6.4 million
planned), the IFAD US$15.0 million (US$15.0 million planned) and IDA US$9.98 million (US$11.0
million planned). Planned versus actual project costs and sources of financing are shown in Table
3, Part III.
5.A.3.  Disbursements
5.3    The disbursement lag was only minor through 1986. IDA disbursements were suspended
in 1987, pending Government agreement to proposed management changes to combat fraud and theft
and the restitution to the project of requisitioned items. The credit closing date was extended to
December 31, 1989, in order to allow for the orderly transfer of project activities to other
Government services and for the completion of the construction of the storage facilities. Earlier on,
the project had been affected by the suspension of disbursements by AfDB (1983) and IFAD (1987),
because of arrears on loan repayments by the Government. IDA disbursements were affected by the
IFAD suspension because of the cofinancing arrangements, in which disbursements for some
categories were split between IDA and IFAD, with a Government accompanying payment. The
closing date was further extended to June 30, 1990. The last disbursement was on November 15,
1990. An amount of US$1,024,062 was canceled on January 22, 1991, and an additional amount of
US$4,289 was canceled on March 21, 1991, following the reconciliation of the accounts.
5.A.4.  Procurement
5.4    A management audit in 1988 brought several serious problems to the surface. Notable
among these were fraudulent procurement practices, especially for fertilizer, and theft of project
materials, notably fuel.



- 4 -
5.5     Procurement problems with fertilizer started when responsibility for procurement was
transferred from FAO to the project unit in 1985, because of complaints by the project that the
arrangements caused long delays in the delivery of fertilizer. Subsequently, the project was given
permission by IDA to follow international and local shopping procedures, even though this was
contrary to procurement guidelines and the Credit Agreement. Fertilizer was purchased well above
prevailing world market prices (over eighty percent higher) in two instances, and in a third instance,
an eighty percent unsecured advance in the amount of US$695,200 was made by IDA and IFAD, on
the basis of insufficient documentation, for the delivery of 2,000 tons of fertilizer, of which only five
hundred tons were delivered. A confidential, intemal Bank review was carried out following
allegations by the Bank of Zaire that the extemal donors were partly responsible for the
misprocurement. The review acknowledged that, in the interest of facilitating project implementation,
the Bank staff had been overindulgent in the processing of disbursement requests.
5.6     Disappearance and theft of supplies funded by the project occurred throughout project
implementation. Although often suspected by supervision missions, and in some cases successfully
followed up, the full extent was only documented in the management audit in 1988. Fuel and
fertilizer were stolen by project staff and sold for private profit. In addition, local Government
authorities used or confiscated 75,000 liters of fuel and a Land Rover.
5.B.    Individual Project Components
5.7     Project management created the impression that the project was progressing well and that
most implementation targets were met or surpassed. Supervision missions rated project progress
satisfactory between 1982 and 1986. Minor financial, management and procurement problems were
noted but overall rating remained "2 minor problems' during this period. In late 1986, a new
supervision team visited the project area and noted some serious financial and technical problems.
After considerable delays on the part of Govemment, a management audit was carried out by an
independent firm of chartered consultants. The findings were released in mid 1988. The conclusions
were devastating and showed that the project had not met its targets and that serious managerial
deficiencies existed. Planned and actual physical project achievements are shown in Table 5, Part III.
5.B.1.  Improvement of Input Supplies to Farmers
Fertilizer
5.8     Fertilizer supplies fell short (55%) of implementation objectives. Only in 1981, did actual
supplies exceed planned supplies. In the following years, supplies fell short of planned targets and
the area adequately fertilized declined in five out of nine years. A 1988 supervision mission
estimated that only 10,000 farmers were served by the project, out of 53,000 projected. The main
reason for the shortfall was Govemment's inability to allocate sufficient foreign exchange to pay for
fertilizer imports Y. The same problem had plagued the PNE several years earlier (para 4.1).
1 Each year, the Government was to provide the foreign exchange to replace the amount of fertilizer that had been
sold by the project In the previous year.



-5 -
Seeds
5.9     The supply of improved seeds was unsatisfactorily due to the poor quality of the base seeds
and managerial problems. By 1986, only 11 percent of the appraisal target had been reached. In
addition, farmers did not have sufficient storage facilities for seeds, leading to a higher than normal
need for replacement seeds. Seeds could normally be reharvested for up to four years, before seed
quality begun to deteriorate. Management problems plagued the start-up of the project seed farm
at Mpoyi, which was later taken over by the National Seeds Service (SENASEM), with a view to
privatization of this service. However, the seed farm is still not operating satisfactorily nor has it
attracted private participation.
Input Distribution and Sales
5.10    Ten trucks for input transportation were purchased. However, only one of the five
warehouses was constructed, because of serious delays in counterpart funding, which greatly affected
the value of the contract, expressed in zaires, at a time when the national currency had started to
depreciate rapidly. None of the intermediary storage facilities were constructed or rehabilitated.
5.11    Fertilizer was to be sold at full cost to local farmers. In practice, the sales price was far
below the market price (at times as low as 17% of real market costs), because the cost of storage and
handling, and overhead and risk premiums for credit provision were not included. During project
design it had been expected that after the first two years of project implementation, fertilizer would
be sold primarily for cash. In practice, most of the fertilizer was sold on credit, with poor repayment
rates and further losses resulting from high local inflation during the entire implementation period.
Because of the large discrepancy between the price charged by the project and the official market
price, no private initiative developed which could take over the responsibility for fertilizer marketing
in the project area.
5.B.2.  Trucks for Marketing
5.12    The number of trucks to be sold to private operators through the intermediary of the
Development Bank (SOFIDE) was reduced from 45 to 12 during implementation. The main
assumptions, i.e. that the amount of marketed maize would triple from 20,000 to 60,000 tons per
annum and that 30 percent of this would be transported by truck, were not met. The lower than
expected increase in production, coupled with falling yields, sharply reduced the need for
transportation by truck.
5.B.3.  Extension. Training and Research
Extension
5.13    The Training and Visit (T&V) approach to extension was used. The project extension staff
took over agricultural extension activities from the local regional and sub-regional agriculture services,
which created some local tension between the well-equipped and well paid project staff and the
neglected agricultural services staff.



-6 -
5.14    The extension messages remained essentially the same during project implementation, and
focussed heavily on fertilizer use. Since most of the farmers did not have access to fertilizer, the
relevance of the extension effort was greatly undermined. Two technical papers were prepared in
1986/87, but they were general in nature and gave too much attention to maize cultivation. They did
not reflect the importance of mixed cropping and production systems. A special effort was made by
the extension service to organize the farmers in groups (about 5% of all farmers).
5.15    As the project came to an end and financial problems made themselves felt, most project
staff were made redundant. An attempt to integrate the project within the national agricultural
extension program ran into difficulties at an early stage, when it became clear to project staff that
the new national program was not in a position nor intended to maintain the high unsustainable
salaries and terms of employment previously enjoyed by the project.
5.16    Training. It is questionable that the overseas training offered to project staff was cost
effective. For example, overseas training of middle and lower level staff (junior accountants and
secretaries) could have been undertaken in Zaire at a considerably lower cost than paid by the
project. The training of extension staff was based on semi-monthly and monthly meetings in the field,
with the participation of service heads and sector chiefs. Several local seminars were organized to
improve the links between research and extension, but because of their lack of frequency and follow
up, they failed to meet their objective.
5.17    Research. The impact of research on extension (i.e. technical messages) and production
has been negligible. The few results obtained were not used to ensure that the available technical
messages were properly adapted. Similarly, after years of research into intermediate technologies,
it did not prove possible to use any of the results for making the necessary adaptations to the existing
preservation and processing equipment. In 1988, responsibility for research was transferred to
INERA and to the applied research and extension project (RAV), which was financed by the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID).
5.B.4.  Roads
5.18    The roads component suffered from  serious implementation delays.  Mechanized
maintenance did not start until 1985, because of late delivery of equipment as a result of the
suspension of disbursements by AfDB. In addition, the Government did not provide the necessary
funding for the operation of the equipment. This problem was resolved when AfDB agreed to
finance operating costs.  Towards the end of the project, the mechanical construction and
maintenance of roads was transferred to the national roads office (Office des Routes). No reliable
information is available on how many kilometers of road has been constructed and/or maintained.
5.19    Manual construction and roads maintenance never materialized because of the inability of
the Government to pay for salaries.
5.20    As part of the roads construction and rehabilitation program, 29 bridges were rehabilitated
and 4 rebuilt, which was twice the appraisal target. Three ferries were rebuilt and three new ones
purchased. The company responsible for assembling the ferries was the same company selected for
construction of the new PMKO headquarters (para 5.22). When this company went into technical



bankruptcy, assembly of the third ferry was stopped. To this date, work on assembling the third new
ferry has not been completed.
5.B.5.   Drinking Water                                                    l
5.21    Disbursement for this component were contingent on the Government working out a
detailed program, including satisfactory organizational and financial arrangements, for the
construction/rehabilitation and maintenance of the drinking water supply systems. As a result,
implementation was delayed by two years. The actual work was implemented by the Hydrological
Service operating in the Gandajika area. Costs were divided between IDA, IFAD, Govemment and
the beneficiaries. Actual rehabilitation and construction of 342 non-motorized village water systems
greatly exceeded the project target of 192. During project implementation, the project provided the
villages with spare parts for maintenance. Villages were expected to provide routine maintenance
themselves. No information is available on the actual maintenance situation.
5.B.6.   Project Management Unit
5.22    A new office headquarters with housing units was planned in Mbuji Mayi. Construction was
started, but never completed. The contractor ran into financial problems as a result of delayed
payments by the Govemment and the rapid devaluation of the Zaire. Government asked IDA and
IFAD to finance a larger share of construction, to which they agreed, but even then it was unable
to provide sufficient financing. The contractor had agreed to carry the foreign exchange risk on the
contract, but late payment by the Government caused unnecessary losses that eventually pushed the
contractor into default. To this day, the civil works are unfinished.
5.B.7.   Technical Assistance
5.23    The project had made provision for the following expatriate technical assistance: financial
and administrative officer (7 years); logistics officer (6 years); technical roads officer (5 years);
extension officer (4.5 years); and a research officer (4.5 years). Except for the financial advisor, the
technical roads officer, the logistics officer and some assistance in training, the project did not appoint
expatriate candidates to any of the other positions. The financial advisor was unable to devise and
implement a reliable accounting system. Because of delays in the roads component, the roads
officer's impact was limited. The logistics officer left the project after two years for personal reasons.
It was decided not to replace him, because local staff were able to take over his activities.
6.      Project Results
6.1     Project results have been disappointing. Although total maize production increased in the
project area this was primarily due to an increase in area planted, as actual yields fell for all but pure



- 8 -
stand maize. -J Extension activities concentrated on encouraging the use of improved seeds and
fertilizer while inadequate supplies of either were available. In the absence of a suitable production
package, the envisaged modification of farming systems and the introduction of mixed cropping
(including cash crops) received insufficient attention. As early as 1982, IDA supervision missions
flagged this problem. Farmer's incomes are, therefore, not likely to have improved as a result of the
project. In spite of agreements with the Borrower, the practice of forced cotton planting continued
during project execution, albeit at much lower levels. This had a negative impact on maize
production, because the farmer was unable to spend sufficient time on his maize fields. Moreover,
there are indications that fields that had been prepared for maize planting under the project, were
actually planted with cotton. The experiments with animal traction had limited success and were
finally handed over to local non govemmental organization (NGO). The project was successful in
its rehabilitation and construction of manual drinking water supply systems, which, besides providing
labor savings, also had a public health impact. The impact of the roads component is unknown (para
5.18). The rehabilitation of the bridges had a major impact on the local economy.
6.2     Despite the provision of training and technical assistance, the institutional impact of the
project was negligible.
7.      Rate of Return
7.1.    Based on available information, it is impossible to estimate incremental farm income due
to the project, or the project's economic rate of return. Information on maize production is
unreliable, as are annual cost data. Because of the limited impact on production and the high
investment costs of the project, the economic rate of return (ERR) probably negative.
8.       Sustainability
8.1      Project activities have been shown to be unsustainable in the absence of donor financing.
In light of the present economic and political situation, it is unlikely that the Government can provide
sufficient financing for fertilizer imports and for support to project services (extension, research,
maintenance of roads, bridges and ferries, and the drinking water supply systems). Responsibility for
road maintenance and maintenance of the drinking water supply systems was transferred to the
appropriate national services along with project assets. The national seeds service (SENASEM) took
over seed farm activities at Mpoyi. Extension activities in the area have been taken over by the Pilot
Extension Project (Cr. 2096-ZR), albeit with reduced staffing levels, and research activities will be
supported under the credit for the National Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 2292-ZR), which is
not yet effective. Support to animal traction activities was taken over by local Non Governmental
Organizations (NGOs).
2' Supervision missions reported yield Increases, but only for maize grown using Improved seeds and fertilizer (Table
5, Part 111). Since few project farmers had access to these -- i.e. fourteen percent during project start-up, falling to less
than ten percent later on -- total impact on production was limited. Yields for maize grown using mixed cropping
systems, actually fell slightly.

9.      Performance of the Bank
9.1     Early encouragement and praise to project management on the apparently positive early
results and unusually flexible interpretation of procurement and other credit covenants probably
contributed to the gradual breakdown in management discipline. Those were not picked up by Bank
supervision missions until 1986, the fifth year of the project. Mediocre levels of external technical
assistance and inadequate performance by project auditors perpetrated the impression by project
monitoring staff from the Ministry of Agriculture that the project was performing satisfactorily.
Following a change in supervision responsibility in 1986, IDA became aware of project shortfalls and
discrepancies and an in-depth audit of the project was carried out. When a 1988 supervision mission
announced its conclusions of major shortcomings by project management, the Ministry of Agriculture
and high level local political and administration figures reacted with indignation. On this and on
many subsequent occasions reference was made to the earlier glowing accounts by bank staff of
project management performance.
9.2     A supervision mission in 1988 identified a potential conflict of interest in the recruitment
of the project's external auditors to set up internal financial and management procedures. The
mission also listed other inconsistencies in the procedures for recruiting the project auditors.
Consequently, the Bank fielded a team of internal auditors to check on these allegations. No
evidence was identified to suggest unethical conduct. The project accounts were subsequently audited
by new external auditors.
10.     Performance of the Borrower
10.1    Shortages of counterpart funding from the borrower plagued the project since its inception.
Given the important financial contributions from the three other cofinanciers, Government repeatedly
gave priority for the use of its limited financial resources to projects which were fully funded from
local funds, arguing that PMKO had ample external funding. The Ministry of Agriculture also
expressed concern at the close relationship which developed between project management and
representatives of the external donors, maintaining that this privileged relationship reduced the
degree of control which the Ministry's own monitoring and evaluation services had over the project.
10.2    Once the external donors started to express reservations about project performance, the
Government was reluctant to accept the need for an independent audit of the project and later
rejected the conclusions of this audit. Geopolitical pressures became increasingly acute as the
reputation of PMKO foundered and rendered increasingly disagreeable and sensitive the ensuing
dialogue between the donors and the Government on the future of the project and of others projects
intended for the neighboring sub-regions (e.g. the Kabinda-Lubao development project).
11.     Performance of the Consultants
11.1    Performance of external consultants was mediocre. It has always been difficult to attract
high calibre long term technical assistants to remote rural postings in Zaire. The experience of
PMKO was no exception. The difficulties in finding the right profile for specialists for the posts of
research and extension advisors led to the recommendation to fill these two posts with local
candidates. The most disappointing performance was that of the Administrative and Financial



- 10-
advisor. The inability of the latter to perceive the problems which were mounting in physical and
financial performance or to help the project director to withstand local pressures in the use of project
resources, was incomprehensible.
11.2    It required a lengthy and detailed report from an international firm of auditors based in
Kinshasa to identify the weaknesses of the work performed by the project auditors during the first
five years. The latter benefitted from a considerable number of training contracts for project staff
in their home country during the project life and were employed to introduce a financial management
system, which was never satisfactorily implemented.
12.     Project Documentation
12.1    Implementation reports were available on a regular basis throughout the first six years of
the project. As financial problems increased, staff left the project and both financial and progress
reporting decreased. The reliability of the data collected and disseminated was queried by later
supervision missions. The information reproduced in this report was drawn from project files. There
was a notable absence of information on the progress of the road maintenance component.
