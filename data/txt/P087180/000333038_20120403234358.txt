                     Mauritania: HIGHER EDUCATION Project

                                   Restructuring Paper

1.       The closing date for Mauritania “Higher Education? is proposed to be extended
from March 31, 2012 until October 30, 2013. The original credit was in the amount of
SDR 10.20 million (US$15 million equivalent), approved by the Board on August 3,
2004 and became effective on January 12, 2005. The purpose of this extension request is
to: (i) allow for the completion of contracts that have already been entered into but have
not been completed; (ii) provide much needed higher education reform, civil works,
goods and equipments; and (iii) complete ongoing activities necessary to achieve the
Project Development Objective (PDO).

2.      Although actual disbursements only account for 35 percent of the credit,
disbursements plus commitments amount to 63 percent and are mainly comprised of civil
works activities. The remaining 37 percent will be used to procure pedagogical and
Information Technology software and hardware to equip the buildings currently under
construction. Delays in civil works have slowed down overall disbursements. Should an
extension be granted, the credit is expected to be fully disbursed. The main activities are:
(i) construction of part of the new campus and procurement of associated equipment; (ii)
assisting the Government in reforming its higher education system; and (iii) twinning of
three university departments with foreign universities to improve their academic program
to render them more labor-market oriented.

Progress to Date

3.       Higher Education law approved: Approved on July 21, 2010, this law lays the
ground for: (i) greater autonomy to higher education institutions; (ii) a more favorable
environment for the development of the private sector; (iii) setting up the standards for
academic programs; (iv) establishing the management body of public higher education
institutions; and (v) clarifying the status and career paths for all employees in the Higher
Education subsector (faculty, library staff, directors, etc.).

4.      Increased quality of teaching staff: In order to increase quality of teaching, the
project supported training/internships of university staff. To this end, 119 senior lecturers
and 379 faculty members were trained in three-month internships to meet or surpass
minimum qualifications. This is an impressive result as it led to triple the number of
qualified senior lecturers and almost double that of qualified faculty members.

5.     Twinning of three university departments (science, human resources and
economics) with foreign universities: Currently, 379 faculty members from the
University of Nouakchott are enrolled in twinning programs in three universities located
in Canada, Morocco, and France, respectively. As such, professors from these foreign
universities traveled to Nouakchott and trained Mauritanian faculty to upgrade their
programs into License, Master’s and Doctorate programs (LMDs – see next paragraph)
and adapt their teaching methods. The twinning program is still under way and could

                                             4
yield impressive results on the final number and quality of programs upgraded by the
science, human resource and economics departments.

6.      Introduction of License, Master’s and Doctorate programs (LMDs) and
certification: As part of the twinning program, and to better respond to employers’ needs,
the three above-mentioned faculties have upgraded or adjusted their academic programs
to meet LMD standards. To date, 51 academic programs have been upgraded (28
professional and 23 general academic programs), surpassing the initial target of 17 and
providing students with more flexibility in choosing a career (i.e., general medicine
program for all medical professions other than doctors). The demand for such programs
can be seen by the percentage of students currently enrolled: 14 percent of university
students are enrolled in professional programs, which also exceeds the initial target of 12
percent. A first cohort of students graduated in June 2011.

7.      In parallel, the government has been in negotiations with the “Bologna
Secretariat? to develop a National Qualifications Framework by which the new LMDs
will be evaluated to ensure their compatibility with the European Higher Education Area
framework (called the “Bologna Process?). If the process is successfully implemented in
Mauritania, Mauritanian graduates would be able to transfer to European Universities at
the same level and without having to repeat courses. Therefore, continuing to support the
twinning program, and hence the development of new programs that are likely to meet
the criteria of the National Qualifications Framework, would heighten chances for
improved quality at the higher education level.

8.     Leveraging support from other donors: The project was instrumental in shoring up
additional financial support for the university campus. So far, the Islamic Development
Bank, the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the State of Kuwait have
pledged support for the “Department of Science?, the “Department of Medicine? and the
“Department of Humanities and Social Sciences?, respectively.

Outstanding activities critical for PDO achievement

9.       In addition to completing the twinning program, the following activities will be
critical to ensure PDO achievement:

10.      Implementation/rollout of the Higher Education Law: Although approved, the
government will require assistance in implementing the law to help complete the process
of rendering the university fully autonomous. Only once fully autonomous can the
university sign performance contracts with the government generate its own resources
and prepare institutional development plans. Furthermore, the law will allow the private
sector to establish Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) and prepare their own
institutional development plans to be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and
Development (MAED). This, in turn, will help the MAED prepare its three-year
subsector strategy and hence contribute to the improved management of the Higher
Education sector. Also, the implementation of the law is needed for both the university
and IHE to prepare procedures manuals and set up their financial and accounting
management systems. These will support efforts to render them more financially efficient
and improve their financial management capacity.

                                            5
11.     Construction of the Central Library, Administrative buildings and Distance
Learning Center (DLC): The completion of these buildings (at 49, 75 and 25 percent
completion respectively) is essential for the effectiveness of the university as they are
linked to other investments. For instance, without the library, the university will not be
able to procure and install an Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
network to provide students with internet resource access. Equally, without the
Administrative buildings, the various budgeting and planning offices cannot be set up nor
can the required equipment be procured. This, in turn, would make it difficult to install an
integrated Management Information System (MIS) to improve overall efficiency and
planning capacity.

12.     Training of various non-teaching key university personnel: In order to facilitate
the transition from semi-autonomous to fully-autonomous status, non-teaching key
university personnel (such as rectors, vice-rectors, deans, librarians and IT staff) would
be trained. However, to identify the right people to train, the higher education reform law
must be implemented (i.e. human resource management, performance contract
negotiations and implementation, etc.) and the buildings established (i.e. to provide
hands-on training for IT staff, identify a maintenance program etc.).

Reasons for delays and remedial actions

13.     There exist several general reasons for the delays in implementation: (i) key
prerequisite studies (the environmental assessment, the campus master plan, and the
architectural studies), although financed under a previous credit, were not completed by
project effectiveness and prevented the immediate launch of the civil works component;
(ii) the Coup d’Etat led to the Bank’s suspension of all activities in Mauritania for 15
months until March 19, 2010; and (iii) the resolution of a complaint by a competing
construction company delayed the Bank’s no-objection issuance. To these reasons that
led to a first extension, the following reasons contributed to additional delays that require
a second extension: (i) the Bank team underestimated the time needed to implement the
Higher Education reform process; and (ii) both the Bank and the government teams
underestimated the time and physical resources needed to carry out the civil works, and
that equipment could only be installed once the construction was completed. In addition,
the Bank’s team was informed in October 2011 that works had almost completely
stopped due to problems with the contractor.

14.     Recognizing the serious implications on the success of the project and to
reconfirm its commitment to it, the government took the following steps to address the
issues related to the contractor performance: (i) establishment of a committee composed
of the State Minister of National Education, Higher Education, and Scientific Research
(MEENESRS), the Minister of Economic Affairs and Development (MAED) and the
Bank’s Country Office manager, which visits the campus on a monthly basis to track
progress and, in collaboration with the contractor, takes remedial actions if and when
necessary; (ii) obtained a letter of commitment and detailed implementation plan from the
contractor to allow easy tracking of progress; and (iii) received confirmation by the
company supervising the construction that the revised implementation plan and promised
resources are indeed adequate to finish works by December 31, 2012.


                                             6
Implications for PDO achievement and justification for extension

15. In order to achieve the PDO and support the government in its efforts to complete
higher education reforms and render the university and IHE more efficient, the
government requested a 19-month extension. This extension would have the following
advantages over a shorter extension: it would (i) safeguard the achievement of the PDO
from possible slippages in civil works, which would have a negative effect on equipping
and rendering operational key departments and would also undermine efforts to
strengthen pedagogical and financial management; (ii) provide enough time for the
government to complete its reforms and support the university and IHE to prepare
institutional development plans and performance contracts; (iii) allow for the completion
of the development and installation of an integrated MIS; (iv) provide opportunities to
conduct studies to evaluate the effectiveness and relevance of LMD programs; and (v)
allow enough time to complete training of all key staff (both teaching and non-teaching).
All of these aspects would also contribute to the improvement of quality and relevance of
higher education instruction.

16.     Furthermore, an extension would send a positive signal to other developing
partners about IDA’s commitment to continue supporting higher education. Given that
IDA only supports a few projects in higher education in Africa, supporting the
Mauritanian government in modernizing this subsector is also providing the Bank with
valuable lessons. Lastly, failure to grant an extension could cause serious reputational
harm to the Bank not only in terms of lack of commitment but also by leaving buildings
unfinished and creating safety hazards for the population (especially children who might
use the construction site as a playground).

17.     There are no changes to the PDO description as mentioned in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD). As such, the project aims at: (i) improving the quality of the
learning environment and the relevance of courses to the labor market; and (ii)
establishing pedagogic, administrative and financial management systems in the IHEs.

18.     In order to better measure progress towards achieving the PDO during the
extension period, however, the Results Framework has been adjusted to ensure: (i) full
compliance with IDA core indicators and those included in the PAD; (ii) refinement of
the wording of certain indicators to make them clearer and more concise; (iii) removal of
duplicates and indicators rendered irrelevant following the introduction of the Higher
Education (HE) law; (iv) adding new indicators to measure impact of the HE law; and (v)
inclusion of adequate indicators to measure progress towards all aspects of the PDO. No
changes are proposed to the indicators included in the grant agreement at this stage.

19.      The extension of the closing date satisfies OP 13.30, paragraph 3 on Closing
Dates, namely that: (i) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) the
performance of the Recipient and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and
(iii) the Recipient prepared a specific action plan acceptable to IDA to complete the
existing contracts and agreements. The project continues to comply with all legal
covenants; financial management is satisfactory, with no outstanding audit and financial
report.


                                           7
20.     This will be a second extension of the closing date. A first extension of 21 months
was granted on March 19, 2010 to compensate for the Bank’s inactivity in Mauritania
following the coup d’état in August 2008. If the present request for a 19-month extension
is granted, the cumulative extensions will add up to a total of 40 months.
