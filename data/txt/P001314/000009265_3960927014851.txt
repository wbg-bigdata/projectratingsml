MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA FOR A
GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY PREINVESTMENT PROJECT
1.      The following report on a proposed development credit to Kenya for SDR
31.6 million (US$40.7 million) is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit
would be on 35 year IDA terms. Up to US$9.7 million of the Credit would be made
available for the Kenya Power Company (KPC) as equity contribution; the remaining
bulk of the Credit would be onlent to KPC at not less than 7.592 for a term of
20 years, including a seven year grace period, and would help finance the
purchase of equipment and materials, and technical assistance. KPC would carry
the foreign exchange risk. Bilateral sources would provide cofinancing on a
grant basis to MOE for a total of US$9.4 million equivalent. Participation in
project financing by KPC would total US$9.5 million equivalent.
2-.     Background. Wood energy, in the form of fuelwood and charcoal, amounts
to about 732 of total end-use energy, petroleum fuels to about 23Z, most of which
is imported as crude oil for refining at Mombasa, and electricity amounts to
about 3X. Eight-four percent of the modern sector's energy needs are ret by
petroleum products, 1X by electricity, and 42 by coal. Energy consumption in
1987 totalled about b million tons of oil equivalent.   Consumption by the
domestic sector accounted for 592 of the total, industry for 152, transport for
122, agriculture (including processing) for 102, and comnerce for 41.
3.      A development plan from 1986 to 2006 for the power subsector was
prepared under the joint Bank/UNDP ESMAP program, with funding from CIDA. It
identifies geothermal generation as the generally least-cost form of electrical
energy available in Kenya, by a significant margin, but includes one hydro
investment as well and for peak demand some thermal capacity.   Installed
geothermal power is currently about 45 MW or 82 of total supply, but is projected
to increase to 325 MW or 212 by the year 2006. The next expansion is planned
for 1994 with 60 MW and four units of 55 MW each every two years thereafter.
Activities to date have focussed on the Olkaria field, where the existing 45 MV
are located and which is expected to yield the next 60 MW as well. Exploration
for subsequent development will continue in the Olkaria field but will also step
out to the Eburru field. The currently identified geothermal areas are in the
rift valley about 80 km north of Nairobi, and the Olkaria development is the
first of its kind in Africa. KPLC have undertaken much of the exploratory and
production drilling over the last ten years but drilling progress has been below
international standards. Progress has improved in the last two years. Problems
with procurement occur from time to time which could undermine development in
the geothermal subsector and the proposed project will address both the issue
of acceptable progress and efficient procurement.
4.      An ESMAP study of October 1987 oa the urban woodfuel sector concluded
that supply of charcoal/fuelwood to urban markets is presently adequate but that
by the mid-199Os sustainable sources of fuelwood close to the townships need to
be established.   An associated key policy issue is the pricing regime for



-2-
charcoal. Pricing is also a key issue in the petroleum subsector where product
cost to end-users appears to be high and savings could be achieved along the
procurement and distribution chain. Electricity tariffs cover the sector's basic
cash flow needs, and are generating a return on revalued assets in operation of
about 52. The power sector has had a satisfactory financial performance, but
the economic cost of power is increasing with the ongoing development of Kenya's
relatively costly hydro sites. Also, Government is trying to keep tariffs down
and it is therefore critical to maintain least-cost development. In the longer
term KPLC and Government will need to consider increasing their reliance on the
low-cost hydro-generated imports of power when these become reliable and
available.
5.      The Ministry of Energy (tOE) is responsible for overall energy planning
and policy formulation.   KPLC, which is 40? privately owned, is the sole
distributor of electricity, and purchases in bulk from KPC (geothermal and hydro)
and Tana River Development Company CTRDC) (hydro) and will also purchase from
Tarda and Athi River Development Company (Kiambere hydro) and Kerio Valley
Development Authority  (Turkwel hydro).    It also operates  all  generating
facilities, and staffs and manages KPC and TRDC, which are both fully Government-
owned. KPLC is a competent utility with increasing expertise in geothermal
matters. Subsidiaries of six multinational oil companies, two private Kenyan
companies, and two parastatals under MOE operate in the petroleum subsector.
Four of the multinational companies operate and co-own with Government (502) the
Kenya Refinery Company Ltd. One parastatal, the Kenya Pipeline Company, operates
a white products pipeline from Mombasa to Nairobi; the other, National Oil
Corporation of Kenya, is overseeing petroleum exploration. NOCK's mandate has
recently been broadened to include the procurement of up to 30S of Kenya's crude
requirements. Government is further considering acquisition of interests in the
petroleum products distribution and retail business. The Government has been
very open to private foreign investment in oil exploration, and a number of firms
are exploring without discoveries as yet, but some promising areas have been
indicated.
6.      Proiect Obiectives.   The Project's principal objective is to assist
Kenya in preparing the necessary expansion of its electricity generating capacity
at least cost through utilization of indigenous energy resources. This includes
in particular the mobilization for a major geothermal program to be implemented
over the next 20 years.   It also includes comprehensive evaluation work on
several potential hydro sites. Another important objective is to develop options
for energy pricing policies which encourage more efficient use of fuels and
achieve savings and resource mobilization for sector investments. The Project
will also address selected aspects of rural electrification policy and household
fuel supply and distribution.
7.      Project Description.   The proposed Project would  include in its
geothermal component (i) drilling supplies and materials for about 32 geothermal
exploration, production, reinjection and make-up wells; (ii) procurement of a
drill rig with a rated capacity of 3,000 m; (iii) associated drilling
infrastructure including Moi South Lake Road; and (iv) scientific equipment,
engineering, training, and technical assistance.  The energy component would



include (i) feasibility and comparative reconnaissance work on promising
hydrosites; (ii) an energy pricing study to define policy options for pricing
energy products;  and  (iii) studies on selecte. rural electrification and
household fuel aspects.  The total estimated project cost is US$59.6 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of about US$48 million (812). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Kenya are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached, as is the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7392-KE, dated
December 2, 1988.
8.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.   The Project supports the least-cost
solution to Kenya's medium-term energy requirements and helps to define pricing
and investment options, both crucial areas of sector policy.   As such, it
reinforces IDA's country strategy in three specific areas, i.e. (i) the efficient
provision of least-cost energy for key productive sectors (agriculture and
industry); (ii) support for public expenditure rationalization and efficient use
of scarce financial resources; and (iii) continued foreign exchange savings by
avoiding utilization of more expensive imported fuels.
9.      Agreed Actions.  Agreement has been reached with GovernmenttKPC on the
following principal actions: (i) IDA will be informed about the drilling program
*    for each well based on approved overall drilling program; (ii) drilling program
and performance will be reviewed semi-annually, with resulting action plan(s),
acceptable to IDA, to be prepared by KPC within one month of such review; (iii)
IDA will be informed and have the opportunity to review and comment upon any non-
IDA funded geothermal drilling in Kenya; (iv) KPC will maintain the Coordinator
for Geothermal Development during the project implementation period; (v) the
power sector will contribute through internal cash generation to its annual
investments not less than 251 in FY89, 272 in FY91, and 30? in FY94 and
thereafter; (vi) the power sector will maintain a current ratio of not less than
1.1, a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 and a debt/debt plus
equity ratio of not more than 75:25 in FY9C and 70:30 in FY91 and thereafter;
and (vii) as conditions of effectiveness IDA would require (a) recommendation
for award by KPC of contract for purchase of the drill rig; (b) signature of IDA-
approved contracts for strategic procurement packages; (c) the second complement
of drill crews is fully recruited and in training; and (d) Government to conclude
*         subsidiary credit agreement with KPC, acceptable to IDA; and (e) appointment of
Coordinator for Geothermal Development.
4         10.            Justification.   Geothermal power is the least-cost generating
option by a significant margin. The unit cost in Kenya for energy generated by
geothermal steam is estimated at about US$0.O36IkWh, 20-40? lower than electrical
energy from other sources. The economics of future power investments based on
successful geothermal drilling will therefore be robust.
11.           Risks.  Project management weaknesses and implementation delays
are risks which are addressed through agreed organization, staffing, and training
arrangements as well as procurement conditions.   The risks associated with



. 4 -
geothermal drilling "der the Project are lower than usual because much of the
drilling takes place over reservoirs already delineated. Drilling is also phased
with regular performancelresults reviews.
12.            Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
