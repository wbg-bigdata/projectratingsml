YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
APPRAISAL OF TEXTILE REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) has requested an
IDA Credit of US$7 million to help finance a project to rehabilitate a cotton
spinning and weaving mill located at Sana'a, the capital city (Map IBRD
13418), and belonging to the fully Government-owned Yemen Textile Corporation
(the Company). The Sana'a mill was completed in 1967 with assistance from the
People's Republic of China. Its design capacity was 10 million linear meters
(lm) per year of 100% cotton fabrics. Production near full capacity was
reached and maintained through 1974, after which it began to decline to a
level of 4.9 million lm in 1977, or about 50% of the mill's capacity. The
main reason for the decline in the production was that dramatically changed
economic circumstances in the country, which led to an explosive increase
of labor cost and high staff turnover, coincided with the discontinuation of
the Chinese technical assistance. The project constitutes the first part of a
program of modernizing the mill. It aims at returning the mill to full
capacity utilization and restoring the mill's profitability through (i) the
introduction of labor-saving equipment, (ii) an incentive scheme to increase
productivity, (iii) expansion of its capacity to 14.4 million im per year,
(iv) modification of the product mix to increase profitability and (v) intro-
duction of new products such as sewing thread and cotton wool. The project
provides for replacement or modernization of some of the mill's equipment,
expansion of its spinning and weaving capacity and for management and operating
assistance and training. Total financing required for the project is estimated
to be US$25.5 million, of which US$19.0 million (74.5%) in foreign exchange.
Besides the IDA Credit (US$7.0 million), the OPEC Special Fund would provide
US$1.5 million, and the Government the remainder (US$17.0 million) of the
financing required.
1.02      YAR has a second textile mill; this is a very small, but also
integrated cotton spinning and weaving plant with a capacity of 2.1 million
lm per year, also owned and operated by the Company and located at Baijil,
about 60 km inland from the port city of Hodeida (Map IBRD 13418). The mill
was built in 1955 by a French supplier but due to political difficulties
which forced the departure of the supplier's representatives, the mill did
not start operations until 1973, when only some of its spinning equipment was
brought into production. The weaving and finishing equipment has never
operated. Rehabilitating the Baijil mill was studied in detail in 1972, but
found not viable. It is, therefore, proposed to gradually phase out opera-
tions of the Baijil mill.
1.03      The project resulted from an earlier Government request to IDA to
help finance a new textile mill for which a prefeasibility study had been
prepared (para. 2.04). A review of this study by IDA led to the conclusion
that the proposed project would not be economically viable and that in any
case efforts should first be concentrated on rehabilitation of the Sana'a
mill. The results achieved under this rehabilitation program will provide
important insights into the feasibility of future textile mills in YAR.



1.04      The project was prepared and appraised in December 1977 by a mission
comprising Messrs. Becher (Chief) and Dy of the Industrial Projects Department
and Messrs. Wassef and Doss (consultants). A follow-up mission comprising
Messrs. Becher and Oteifa (also of the Industrial Projects Department) visited
YAR in February 1978 to discuss with the Government the final scope of the
project and the financing plan.
II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY
A.   The Industrial Sector
2.01      YAR's industrial sector (manufacturing only) is very small, con-
tributing no more than 4% of GDP and employing in 1975 a total of about
8,000 people in the modern sector. Yemen Textile Corporation which employs
about 1,600 people is YAR's only large industrial employer, providing 20% of
total employment in the modern industrial sector. There are only few other
manufacturing enterprises in the public sector. Since the end of YAR's civil
war (1969), private investors (traditionally merchants) have become increas-
ingly active in industry and have established some small- and medium-scale
plants in the manufacturing of consumer goods and construction materials.
B.   The Textile Industry
1.   The Public Sector
2.02      The Company, with its two plants, is YAR's only textile manufac-
turer (paras. 3.01-3.14). As noted above, the current design capacity of the
Company's Sana'a mill is about 10 million lm per year, but actual production
in 1977 was only 4.9 million lm.  The Government's Five Year Plan (1976/77-
1980/81) foresees an annual production of 22 million lm towards the end of the
Plan period.
2.03      Besides the proposed project which is intended to return the Sana'a
mill to full capacity utilization and expand the annual capacity to 14.4
million lm, there are currently two other projects under discussion.  The
first one is a cotton spinning and weaving mill to be supplied by the People's
Republic of China and to be built 18 km east of Hodeida.  The mill would be
similar to the Sana'a mill, but have a slightly larger capacity of about 11
million lm per year.  A protocol between the two Governments exists, but im-
plementation is currently being reconsidered since the mill, with its labor-
intensive Chinese equipment, would likely face the same problems as are now
being encountered by the Sana'a mill.
2.04      The second project is a polyester/viscose weaving and finishing
mill, using imported yarn, to produce 4 million lm per year of suiting mate-
rials. The project, for which a prefeasibility study exists, is to be built
in Damar, a town 140 km south of Sana'a. IDA reviewed the prefeasibility



study for this mill and concluded that because of the relatively small size of
the mill, its high cost due to the generally high cost of implementing
projects in YAR, and the country's high cost of labor, the project would not
be economically viable.
2.05      The managerial capabilities of the Company would also be overtaxed
if it were charged with the implementation of these two projects in addition
to the rehabilitation of the Sana'a mill proposed in this report. Therefore,
assurances were obtained (i) from the Government that it will not authorize
implementation in the public sector of any project in the textile industry
beyond the one proposed in this report and estimated to cost more than US$1
million without prior consultation with IDA, and (ii) from the Company that it
will not undertake any project or expansion other than the one proposed in
this report and involving an expenditure in excess of US$1 million, without
prior submission to IDA of evidence satisfactory to IDA that such project or
expansion would not adversely affect the Company's managerial and financial
position.
2.   The Private Sector
2.06      Currently only one small knitting plant exists.  The private sector
is, however, showing interest to become more active in knitting (underwear,
socks, sweaters) and manufacturing of ready-made garments. Since these
industries can employ mostly women, they are not as seriously affected by the
high cost and availability of labor in YAR as other industries. At least
one project for a knitting plant is under preparation and a project for
shirt-making is being discussed. There are no prospects for private investment
in spinning and weaving.
3.   The Traditional Sector (Handlooms)
2.07      Handweaving used to be a fairly important activity in YAR, par-
ticularly in the Tihama region (coastal plain) where cotton is grown. The
normal product consists of rectangular decorative pieces of relatively heavy
cloth ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 m in width and between 1 to 3 m in length and is
of traditional geometric design and fringed at both ends. Generally, cottpn
yarn of Nm 17 and 34 is used, giving a fabric weight of 250 to 400 g per m
There has been no survey of handweaving, and therefore estimates of the
number of people involved and the quantity produced are not very reliable.
However, some estimates p2t the number of people at 6,000 to 10,000 and the
production at 1 million m per year, which, at an assumed average weight of
350 g per m , would imply yarn requirements of 350 tons per year (tpy). The
Baijil mill sells its yarn production exclusively to handweavers and supplied
161 tons in 1975 and 91 tons in 1976.1/ A small quantity of yarn is also sold
by the Sana'a mill, and the remainder, about 200 tpy, is imported. The yarn
is dyed by private merchants who sell it to the handweavers and subsequently
buy the cloth.
1/   The rated capacity of the Baijil mill is 550 tpy of yarn.



- 4 -
2.08      In recent years, the traditional sector has been declining.  This
is attributed to migration of workers to the cities, emigration abroad to
higher paying employment opportunities and a shift in consumer taste to
imported products. Today, handweaving has changed largely from a subsist-
ence activity to a leisure-time activity of women and children. The yarn
requirements of the traditional sector have already declined and are expected
to continue to do so. Handweaving will, however, retain a certain role to
supply the tourism industry.
4.   Factors Affecting the Textile Industry in YAR
(a) Cost of Labor
2.09      The most important factor contributing to the current difficulties
faced by the Company and affecting the future prospects of the textile indus-
try in YAR is the high cost of labor. Following the emigration of an esti-
mated 0.6 to 0.7 million Yemenis (out of a total population of about 6.0
million at present) to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States and an economic
boom in YAR fueled by workers' remittances (estimated to have reached a
level of US$1 billion in 1976/77) as well as an inflow of bilateral and
multilateral development assistance, wage rates throughout the economy, but
particularly in the construction industry and other parts of the private
sector, have been increasing rapidly. An unskilled laborer, who received YR 9
(US$2) per day in July 1975, earned YR 27 (US$6) per day, or three times as
much, two years later. A skilled worker (e.g., mason) who earned YR 27 per
day in 1975, received YR 110 (US$24) per day in July 1977. The Company made
an effort to follow these wage increases so as to retain its workers and
increased basic wages five fold between 1972 and 1977, from a level of YR 147
(US$32.7) per month to YR 700 (US$155.6) per month for a semi-skilled worker.
Annex 2-1 shows the basic wages (per month) paid by the Company for all job
levels in the years 1972 through 1977 and indicates that the largest increase
took place in the lower job levels. Fringe benefits equivalent to 40% are
added to the basic wage.
2.10      Annex 2-2 compares the average wage (per hour) in the textile
industry of various countries with the per capita GNP of the same countries
and confirms the relatively high level of wages in YAR's textile industry.
At an hourly rate of about US$1.2, wages in YAR's textile industry are about
3 times as high as in Syria and 2 times as high as in Algeria.
2.11      The explosion of nominal income in YAR was accompanied by a very
high rate of inflation, estimated to have been at least 30% p.a. in recent
years. The increase in real income has, therefore, been considerably smaller
than that of nominal income. In particular, the cost of housing in Sana'a
has increased tremendously. A section manager who, including fringe benefits
earns about YR 2,000 per month (US$445) may spend between one half and two
thirds of his salary on housing. The Government's Five Year Plan, therefore,
includes several housing projects. A contract was recently signed with a
foreign firm for one such project providing for the construction of about
2,000 housing units of which about 800 will be reserved for the workers of
,he Sana'a textile mill.



-5-
(b) Competition from Abroad
2.12      YAR has a surplus in its balance of payments.  There are no restric-
tions on imports other than poorly enforced import duties, averaging a nominal
35% ad valorem (para. 4.12). As a result, it is difficult for the domestic
manufacturer to meet competition from imported textiles whose prices are
depressed through the worldwide recession in the textile industry and through
European restrictions on textile imports.
(c) Availability of Local Cotton
2.13      Cotton has been grown in YAR's coastal plain, the Tihama, for many
years, and following the end of the civil war (1969) the quantity of raw
cotton produced increased from 1,900 tons in 1969/70 to 27,200 tons in 1974/75
(Annex 2-3). Since then production has dropped sharply to a low of 5,300
tons in 1976/77. A slight increase to 8,000 tons is projected by the Govern-
ment for 1977/78. The decline in cotton production resulted from (i) the high
cost of labor for cotton picking and (ii) low prices relative to other crops.
2.14      The Government's Five Year Plan projects an increase in production
of raw cotton from the present 5,300 to 32,500 tons per year at the end of
the Plan period (1980/81). This assumes a four-fold expansion in cultivated
area from 6,000 hectares (ha) in 1976/77 to 25,000 ha and an increase in yield
from currently about 1 ton per ha to 1.3 tons per ha. It is not certain that
these targets can be achieved. Unless picking can be mechanized, which would
be difficult on YAR's small plots, cotton growing is a labor-intensive ac-
tivity and given the high cost of labor, cotton is likely to continue to be
a marginal crop. In an effort to encourage farmers to grow more cotton, in
1978 Cotton General Company (CGC), which is the sole buyer and exporter of
cotton, raised the price paid to the farmers for raw cotton from US$389 to
US$541 per ton, equivalent to an increase in the price of ginned cotton from
about US$1,167 to US$1,623 per ton (assuming 1 ton of ginned cotton to be
equivalent to about 3 tons of raw cotton). The price for raw cotton supplied
by CGC to the Company is currently YR 2,043 per ton (US$454) and the price for
ginned cotton YR 6,205 per ton (US$1,379) which is in line with the export
price achieved by CGC this year (US$1,300/ton) and with the comparable import
price (US$1,308/ton) (Annex 2-4). The price now paid to the farmer (US$1,623
equivalent) is, therefore, already about 25% above the export price and about
18% above the price paid by the Company.



- 6 -
2.15      The two textile mills require about 2,500 tpy of raw cotton at their
current level of production so that in 1976/77 there remained some cotton to
be exported. However, under the proposed rehabilitation program, raw cotton
requirements would-increase to about 9,000 tpy. In the analysis of the
project it has been assumed that 80% of this quantity (7,200 tpy) will be
supplied by CGC in the form of raw cotton at the current average price for
Grades I to 3 of YR 2,000 per ton and that 20% will be supplied as ginned
cotton at the current price of YR 6,205 per ton. Assurances were obtained
from the Government that the Company will be free to purchase cotton from the
most economic source.
2.16      In previous years, CGC imported cottonseeds of the so-called ACALA
type, a medium-staple variety, and it is, therefore, generally assumed that
cotton grown in YAR is of the ACALA type. However, since the handling and
separation of seeds by the farmers and CGC is poorly organized, the actual
cotton grown represents a mixture of different varieties. Tests show that it
is generally medium-staple, but with large variation in fiber length. Cotton
is graded by CGC into three classes, with Grade 1 being cotton of above 29 mm
fiber length, Grade 2 of 27 to 29 mm fiber length and Grade 3 below 27 mm.
However, because of the shortage of qualified cotton graders, tests also show
great variation even within one grade.
2.17      YAR has three operating ginneries, all equipped with sawgins:  one
each in Hodeida and Zabid, owned by CGC, and one in the Sana'a textile mill.
All ginneries are poorly maintained and operate far below rated capacities.
The Hodeida ginnery (build in 1952) has a rated capacity of 1.7 tons per hour
of ginned cotton or about 40 tons per day in 3-shift operation, but produces
only 5 tons per day. The Zabid plant (1950) has a rated capacity of 1.25
tons per hour or 30 tons per day, but also produces only about 5 tons per day.
The Sana'a ginning plant which was supplied in 1967 as part of the textile
mill, has a capacity of about 0.5 ton per hour of ginned cotton or 12 tons
per day. The present output is only 4 tons per day. The combined actual
output of the 3 ginneries is, therefore, only 14 tons per day of ginned
cotton. This is sufficient to gin 5,300 tons of raw cotton in a 126 day
ginning season.
(d) Employment of Women
2.18      The future prospects of YAR's textile industry depend to a signif-
icant degree on the extent to which women can be employed. To date only 25%
of the labor employed in the Sana'a mill are female (Annex 2-5), representing
the majority of the day shift (6:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m.) in the spinning and
weaving department and in the ready-made garment department which operates one
shift only. The evening shift (2:30 p.m.-10:30 p.m.) is all male. The mill
currently operates only two shifts. There are strong social and cultural
barriers to female employment outside the private home and female employment
after dark is impossible at present. Education levels of women also currently
limit their employment in administration (only 3% in the Sana'a mill), but
this should be the first area where the number of women could be substantially
increased. There are no differences in pay scale for male and female workers,



-7-
but women are generally paid less through lower job classification. The
management of the Company reports that the women are very diligent workers
with a productivity often higher than that of their male colleagues. At the
same time since obviously no women emigrate for work abroad and most Yemenis
leave their wives in YAR, there is a potentially significant group of female
workers available. Assurances were obtained that by October 31, 1978, the
Government will employ consultants on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA
to carry out a study of the social, economical, cultural and educational
aspects of increasing employment of women in the textile industry.
III. THE COMPANY
A.   Organization and Management
3.01      Yemen Textile Corporation (the Company), a 100% Government-owned
company and YAR's only textile manufacturer, was established in 1973 1/
with a share capital of YR 17.6 million (US$3.9 million) to operate the two
existing plants, one in Sana'a (para. 3.03) and the other in Baijil (para.
3.04). The Company operates as a legal entity under the general supervision
of the Ministry of Economy. The Company's Board of Directors is appointed for
a period of three years by the Prime Minister and consists of the Chairman,
a Vice Chairman and a representative each of the President's Office, the
Prime Minister's Office, the Central Planning Organization and the Ministry
of Economy. The Board appoints the General Manager, who attends the meet-
ings of the Board.
3.02      At the end of February 1978, the Government replaced the Company's
Board of Directors. The previous management of the Company was very weak and
had lost all credibility in the eyes of the Company's personnel because of the
serious deterioration in the Company's performance and financial condition
(paras. 3.07-3.09). There are a few good people at the level of Department
and Section Manager. YAR has few qualified people in the textile industry,
and there are no experienced managers available. Therefore, even the new
management will require intensive management and operating assistance, and
this will be provided as part of the proposed project (paras. 5.21-5.24).
B.   The Sana'a Mill
3.03      The Sana'a mill started operations in 1967.  It was supplied and
built by the People's Republic of China who also trained the personnel and
provided technical assistance through 1974. The total cost of the project,
financed through a loan to the Government, was established at US$5.5 million
1/   Prior to 1973, the Sana'a mill operated as a Government department.



- 8 -
of which US$3.3 million in machinery and equipment. 1/ The mill has its own
ginnery, spinning, weaving and finishing plant, and its own power generation,
water supply system and workshops, including a small foundry and pattern-
making shop. 2/ Its rated capacity is about 10 million lm per year of 100%
cotton fabric. Originally it was equipped with 10,816 ring spindles to
produce about 4 tons per day of carded yarn of counts Nm 24 to 85, and 360
looms for about 33,000 lm per day of fabric of up to 1 m width in 3-shift
operations. The looms operate at 180 picks per minute and have an automatic
shuttle-change system. The finishing plant originally had a daily capacity
for 50,000 lm of bleached, dyed and handprinted fabric of 1 m working width.
The mill has 4 diesel generators of 550 kVA each, and 3 light-oil fired steam
boilers of 8 tons per hour each. Water is supplied from four wells of about
200 m depth. Water consumption at full capacity is about 1,000 tons per
day or 30 liters per meter of fabric, which is about double the standard of
modern textile mills. This represents a particularly serious problem in
Sana'a where water is in short supply, and some measures will be taken as part
of the proposed project to reduce water consumption (para. 5.19).
C.   The Baijil Mill
3.04      The Baijil mill was built by a French supplier in 1955.  The sup-
plier was forced to leave the country before being able to start the plant,
and it lay idle until 1973, when some of the spinning equipment was started.
The weaving and finishing plant never operated. The fully integrated plant
had 2,580 spindles for a production of about 1.8 tons per day of coarse yarn
and 90 looms for about 7,000 lm per day of cloth. The finishing department
provided for bleaching only. The Baijil mill has no repairshop. The mill was
originally equipped with three diesel generators, but two new generators had
to be purchased in 1973 in order to start the spinning department. 31
3.05      The engineering of the Baijil mill was extremely poorly done.
The buildings are completely unsuitable: they are roofed with galvanized iron
sheets without false ceiling, and window areas are also too large and walls
not suitable for proper insulation. There is no provision for air-conditioning
or even ventilation.  Baijil is at the edge of the coastal plain where tempera-
tures rarely fall below 200C and are generally above 30 0C, and the relative
1/   This is the cost of the mill as established between the two Governments
for the purpose of determining the loan amount and does not represent its
actual cost.

- 9 -
humidity is in excess of 50% nearly all year round. Temperature inside the
buildings with their noninsulated corrugated iron sheet roofing is generally
10 C above the outside temperature. The equipment, including that which never
operated is in very poor condition, and so are the floors which are made of
sub-standard concrete mix. Most accessories are missing, and there are no
spare parts in stock.
3.06      The possibility of rehabilitating the Baijil mill was studied in
detail in 1972 by a consulting firm financed by the Kuwait Fund. The project
was found financially and economically not viable. Since then, the condition
of the Baijil mill has further deteriorated and economic factors have become
much more disadvantageous. Yemeni labor cost began its explosive increase in
1973/74. The market for coarse yarn, used by handweavers and supplied by the
Baijil mill, is gradually decreasing as this handicraft is slowly disappear-
ing. There is no demand in YAR for the heavy cloth for which the Baijil
mill was originally designed. The employment of the Baijil mill of currently
122 people, already about double what it should be, given the mill's yarn
production, is relatively insignificant, and people from Baijil can find
employment opportunities in the port city of Hodeida. Some of the skilled
people may also be willing to work in the Sana'a mill. The Baijil mill is
currently loosing about YR 900,000 (US$200,000) per year. Therefore, it is
planned that the Baijil mill will gradually phase out its production and close
down by the end of 1980. Yarn requirements of the handweavers will then be
supplied from imports and from the Sana'a mill.

3.08      Through 1974, the Sana'a mill operated near its rated capacity, pro-
ducing about 1,200 tpy of yarn and 9 to 10 million lm of fabric. An oil ex-
traction plant was added to the ginning plant in 1974 to extract oil and oil
cake from the cotton seeds. A small garment manufacturing unit, employing
about 80 people and making about 300 pieces per day of ready-made garments
(mainly uniforms and shirts) was also supplied by China in 1974.



- 11 -
3.09      Starting with 1975, the production of the Sana'a mill began to
decline and has now fallen to an annual level of about 4.9 million lm, one
half of the mill's rated capacity. In 1976, the third shift was discontinued.
The Company achieved small profits through 1975 (see table below), but in
1976, when the production level had fallen to 55% of design capacity, a loss
of YR 4.0 million was incurred, and this increased to YR 7.5 million in 1977.
Total labor costs increased from YR 3.8 million in 1972 to YR 14.4 million in
1977 (an average increase of over 30% p.a.) while employment declined from
about 1,700 to 1,581 1/.
3.10      The main reasons for the decline in production are:  (i) departure
of the Chinese experts; this coincided with (ii) increasing difficulty to
retain or attract new suitable personnel and rapidly increasing staff turn-
over, since wages paid by the Company, although drastically increased in
recent years, have fallen behind those paid by alternative employment oppor-
tunities in the private sector in YAR and abroad (para. 2.09); (iii) increas-
ing absenteeism which now amounts to an average 20% of total employment; 2/
(iv) a poorly planned and even more poorly implemented modernization program,
without Chinese assistance, that caused further disruption and decline in
production rather than bringing it back to or beyond the previous level; and
(v) a management that had been incapable of exercising authority and taking
the kind of measures needed to restore working morale and bring production
back to a profitable level. The Government, therefore, replaced the Company's
Board of Directors at the end of February 1978 (para. 3.02).
3.11      The Chinese had provided detailed training to the Yemeni workers and
overall technical assistance through 20 to 30 of their own experts. Although
the training was excellent, the performance of the mill started to decline in
1975 because of the departure of many of the Company's skilled people to other
employment opportunities. In summary, the Company now faces the following
problems: (i) lack of manpower at all skill levels, from management and
administration down to production workers; (ii) the extremely high cost of
labor in YAR today having particularly serious implications because of the low
labor productivity; (iii) no restrictions (other than poorly enforced customs
duties) on the importation of textiles of all kinds, this in turn being a
situation which would require the Company to operate at maximum efficiency in
order to be competitive; (iv) machinery in the Sana'a mill that operates at
low speeds and is, therefore, labor-intensive; (v) machinery and equipment in
the Baijil mill that is in a dilapidated state for which spare parts are no
longer manufactured and none are in stock, and buildings and a location that
are unsuitable. Furthermore, the modernization program which was begun in
1974 by the Company's management in order to overcome some of these problems
(para. 3.12-3.14) and which was financed on a cash basis, together with the
1/   While average employment on record was 1,581 in 1977, actual employment,
because of absenteeism which now amounts to an average of 20%, was only
about 1,265.
2/   Occasionally, civil works contractors come to the Sana'a mill and hire
workers on a daily basis, offering them up to YR 67.5 (US$15) per day.

losses incurred in 1976 and 1977 have absorbed all funds that had been ac-
cumulated from profits in the past. As a consequence, the Company now has
short-term debts to local banks and accounts payable (largely to CGC) total-
ling about YR 20 million. The liquidity crisis is so severe that during
recent months insufficient funds were available to pay wages on time contri-
buting further to absenteeism and demoralization of the personnel.
E.   The Recent Modernization Program of the Company
3.12      In order to reduce some of the problems faced by the Company
through the rapidly increasing labor costs and the labor-intensive Chinese
equipment, the Company embarked on a modernization program in 1974. The
program provided for (i) purchase of 100 Czech looms of conventional tech-
nology, but with pirn-changing system and operating at 190 picks per minute,
(ii) conversion of 6 carding machines into 3 high production tandem cards,
and (iii) purchase of 5 open-end spinning machines together with 2 drawing
frames and 3 automatic pirn winding machines. The total cost of the new
machinery, including erection, was US$1.5 million. The 100 Czech looms were
to replace a corresponding number of Chinese looms. Likewise, 5 of the 26
Chinese ring spinning frames were removed to make room for the new open-end
spinning machines.
3.13      The new equipment arrived in 1976 and the converted cards and
the new spinning equipment were operating satisfactorily by the end of 1976.
Of the new Czech looms, however, only 39 have been erected so far, and only
26 have undergone some test runs and are not operating properly. At the same
time 20 Chinese looms were dismantled so that the Sana'a mill at present is
left with only 340 Chinese looms. The problems in operating the Czech looms
result from poor quality of the yarn, poor weaving preparation, lack of some
accessories and inadequate training of Yemeni workers to properly operate
these looms. As part of the proposed project, all 100 Czech looms will be
erected and brought into production.
3.14      In 1974, also as a step towards modernization, a rotary screen
printing machine was purchased from the Netherlands to supplement the slow,
labor-intensive handprinting installation in the Sana'a mill. The new machine
has a working width of 162 cm while the remainder of the processing equipment
provides for a working width of only 100 cm. It operates at a speed of up to
80 m per minute or about 27,000 m per shift and, therefore, would provide
ample capacity for printing. However, the machine prints at a repeat length
of 64 cm while, for the printing of sari 1/, a popular local type of cloth, a
repeat length of 2 m is required. With the declining production of the Sana'a
mill and with the need to retain handprinting for sari, the rotary printing
machine is being used only at about one quarter of its capacity. As part of
the proposed project, the machine will be reequipped to allow for printing of
larger repeats.

F.   Financial Projections Without the Project
3.15      The projected production level, income statement and balance sheet
for the Company, without the proposed project, are shown in Annex 3-1 and
summarized below.

a/   Actual
bi   Including 7 million lm of processed imported cloth
3.16      The production of the Sana'a mill would be expected to decline to an
annual level of about 4 million lm while the production of the Baijil mill is
to be phased out by 1980 (para. 3.06). In 1976, in order to make up for the
declining fabric production, the Company purchased 9 million lm of grey cloth
from Japan for finishing. Of this, 7 million lm will be processed (dyed or
printed) during 1978 and the remainder in 1979, and the projections assume
that the Company will continue this policy of importing grey cloth for
processing. This is expected to bring about a temporary reduction in the
Company's losses from YR 7.5 million in 1977 to YR 6.1 million in 1978, but
thereafter the losses, through further increased cost of labor, are expected
to once again increase and reach YR 19.9 million (US$4.4 million) by 1981.
3.17      The implications of the projections without the project are that
only if the Government were to be willing to cover the rapidly growing cash
deficit, would the Company be able to continue its operations. The need to
liquidate the Company, therefore, becomes a real possibility. However, as
already mentioned, with an employment of approximately 1,600 people, the
Company is YAR's only major industrial employer (20% of total employment
in the modern industrial sector). The option of closing down the mill is,
therefore, politically not feasible.
IV. THE MARKET
A.   Size and Past Growth of the Market
4.01      Total production, consumption, imports and exports of textiles in
the past five years (1972-76) are shown in Annex 4-1. Since 1972 domestic



- 16 -
consumption of textiles has risen at an average rate of 13.5% per year or by
11.5% per capita and year from 25.0 million lm in 1972 to 41.5 million lm in
1976. Local production provided 42% of demand in 1972 but only 16% in 1976
due to the increase in demand and the 50% drop in local output. From 1972 to
1977, the value of YAR's total commodity imports grew annually by about 70%
but textile and clothing imports grew by about 80% or from YR 14.3 million
(US$3.2 million) to YR 265.6 million (US$59 million). In 1977, this repres-
ented a per capita import of about US$12.
4.02      In spite of the recent rapid increase in per capita income and tex-
tile consumption, the level of textile consumption in YAR is still below that
in other countries with comparable per capita income. Per capita consumption
in YAR in 1976 was 1.7 kg as compared with 3.3 kg for Morocco, 2.2 kg for
Cameroon, 2.2 kg for Sudan and 1.8 kg for Kenya, all recorded for 1974. The
textile market in YAR can therefore be expected to continue to grow at rapid
rates. Consumer preferences in YAR show considerable differentiation depend-
ing on the degree of urbanization and climatic variation among regions. In
the towns and cities of the midlands and central plateau (1,000 to 2,000 m
altitude), the use of western garments, e.g. shirts, jackets and complete
suits, is becoming more and more common. However, the majority of the pop-
ulation still wears the traditional garb.
B.   Future Market Growth
4.03      The future market for textiles in YAR has been projected on the
basis of a GNP growth of 6% p.a. and a per capita income growth of 4% p.a.,
both conservative assumptions in the light of recent actual growth. Income
elasticity for textile demand has been assumed to be 1.5 between 1977 and
1980 (as compared to about 1.2 in the past), to reflect the expectation that
in the next few years, with the still relatively low per capita consumption
of textiles, the growth of the textile market is likely to continue at a
relatively higher rate than GNP (namely 9% p.a. versus 6% p.a.). After 1980,
the income elasticity for textiles has been assumed to be 0.7 which is the
average income elasticity expected for developing countries. Total textile
demand (including clothing) would thus reach 50 to 55 million m in 1980, 70
to 75 million m in 1985 and about 90 million m in 1990.
4.04      The Sana'a textile mill produced 4.9 million lm in 1977 or about 12%
of estimated demand; if operated at design capacity, the mill could have pro-
vided 24% of demand. The proposed project would bring the mill's production
to 14.4 million lm per year by 1981 and, under a second modernization program,
to 18.2 million m by 1985, or about 25% of the projected demand in the
respective years. The proposed project will, therefore, just maintain the
mill's relative market share.
C.   Composition of Market Demand and Determination of Product Mix
4.05      Import statistics for 1972 to 1976 (Annex 4-1) show a decline in
the importation of pure cotton fabrics and an increase in the importation
of blended fabrics, largely cotton/polyester and 100% polyester fabrics.



- 17 -
This shift to blended and 100% synthetic fabrics in part reflects consumer
preference. The better wear and easier care of blended fabrics make these
preferable for certain applications, in particular for shirting, black satin,
sari and outerwear. Under the second part of the modernization program, to
follow the project after 1981, the Sana'a mill will therefore introduce the
production of blended fabrics. The shift to blended and 100% synthetic fabrics
is also due to the introduction by the Government in 1974 of an additional
import duty of 10% on all 100% cotton fabrics in order to protect the Company.
This has also resulted in some false customs declarations.
4.06      Currently, the Sana'a mill produces four products:  (i) an ordinary
cloth of about 130 g/lm which is sold as grey, bleached, printed or dyed and
used in many different household applications, and for simple shirting,
outerwear and underwear of traditional style; (ii) sari, a lightweight fabric
(52 g/lm) mostly handprinted with traditional designs and used for female
clothing, including veil; (iii) bandage (33 g/lm) and (iv) khaki drill (230
g/lm), the latter for army uniforms. In establishing the revised product mix,
an attempt was made to shift to products for which (i) there is a ready
local market and which sell at an attractive price, (ii) the medium-staple
Yemeni cotton is well suited (lightweight fabrics such as poplin and shirting),
and (iii) 100% cotton fabric is at least disadvantage or at an advantage
(towels, mattress cover, bandage) over blended fabrics. The production of the
heavy khaki drill will be discontinued. For poplin, shirting, sari and black
satin emphasis will be put on quality production through the spinning of
combed yarn (not currently produced by the Company) in order to be able to
compete with blended fabrics. The actual 1977 product mix and the product mix
projected for 1981, the first year of full capacity production after project
completion, are compared below. The mill's equipment will provide sufficient
flexibility to modify the product mix in order to respond to changing market
conditions.

4.07      The proposed project will also introduce as new items the production
of 170 tpy of sewing thread and 150 tpy of cotton wool. These two items are



- 18 -
found profitable because of their relatively high price in YAR, and because
some of the Chinese equipment, to be replaced under the proposed project, can
be used for their production. 1/ YAR's combined import of sewing thread and
yarn, which are not recorded separately, has been between 400 and 600 tpy
in 1972 to 1977. A reasonable asumption would be that 30% of the recorded
imports represent sewing thread, which would imply annual imports of 100 to
200 tons, or a per capita consumption of 33 g. The anticipated growth in
the domestic production of ready-made garments will bring about an important
increase in the local consumption of sewing thread. Therefore, there should
be no problem in selling the full production of 170 tons by 1981.
4.08      The major end-uses of cotton wool are for medical and cosmetic
purposes and as sanitary napkins. It uses low grade cotton and waste cotton
from spinning. Because of the large volume of this product, its transport
beyond 500 km is generally not justified so that it enjoys a natural protection.
The planned production of 150 tpy represents about 30 g per capita of resident
population. It is estimated that the consumption will be about 100 g per
capita by 1981, as urbanization increases and use of sanitary napkins becomes
increasingly accepted. The current consumption in Germany, for instance, is
about 500 g per capita.
D.   Marketing of Textiles
1.   Distribution
4.09      Locally produced fabrics are sold to eight private distributors who
function both as wholesalers to other retailers and as retailers. Three are
in Taiz, two in Hodeida, two in Sana'a and one in Damar. About 40% of the
product is sold in the Hodeida area and 30% each in the Taiz and Sana'a/Damar
areas. The main market is in the rural areas where the traditional products
with their local designs (prints) have maintained a stronger appeal than in
the cities. The distributors are also importers of textiles and garments with
imports supplying about 80% of their stocks. Another 20 or so wholesalers and
retailers carry exclusively imported goods. Most importers also import other
products.
2.   Prices and Sales Policy
4.10      Ex-factory prices of cotton fabrics and garments are established
by the Company's Board of Directors. It is difficult to estimate profit
margins of the distributors. They could be in the range of 10 to 15% for
wholesalers and 15 to 25% for retailers. Sales commission to distributors
is a flat rate of 5% regardless of the quantity of purchase or promptness
of payment. Term of payment generally is 30 days but this is not enforced
and actual payment terms are much longer. The Company currently has trade
receivables of YR 6.9 million, equivalent to 35% of 1977 sales (or about
4.5 months' sales). Given the Company's poor financial position, this is
a particularly serious problem. The Company's consultants will review the
marketing system and sales policy of the Company and help introduce appro-
priate changes. Assurances were obtained that by June 30, 1979, the Company
1/   For example, the old blow room equipment will be used for the opening
of waste for cotton wool production.



- 19 -
will submit the consultants' study of the marketing system and sales policy to
IDA for discussion and with assistance from the consultants will subsequently
implement the proposed changes as agreed between IDA and the Company.
3.   Import Licenses
4.11      Importers need licenses issued by the Ministry of Trade and Sup-
ply, but the licenses are issued freely and serve primarily the purpose of
record keeping. There are no import restrictions except custom duties.
4.   Custom Duties
4.12      Imported fabrics are subject to custom duties ranging from 10 to
40% ad valorem. In addition, all imports are assessed a 5% defense tax and a
2% "statistical" tax. An extra 10% ad valorem is applied to imports of 100%
cotton fabrics to protect the Company, as allowed under YAR's investment
law. However, an estimated 30% of the fabrics imported into the country enter
without duty through smuggling. Also, the extra 10% duty on 100% cotton
fabrics is often avoided through false declaration.
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Choice of Project
5.01      In order to identify the optimal rehabilitation project for the
Sana'a mill, three possible cases were considered in detail:
(a) minimum rehabilitation through replacement of only a few
machines in weaving preparation and overhauling of the
existing machinery and equipment, installation and start-
up of all 100 Czech looms (paras. 3.12-3.13) and provision
of technical assistance to bring the mill to production at
design capacity for the remaining life of the equipment;
(b) intermediate rehabilitation through replacement or moder-
nization of all original (Chinese) machinery and equipment
in spinning, 1/ overhauling of the existing machinery and
equipment in weaving and processing, plus adding some new
machinery in weaving in order to produce some new high value
items and better utilize the existing processing equipment,
and provision of the necessary technical assistance; and
(b) maximum rehabilitation through replacement or modernization
of all original (Chinese) machinery and equipment in spinning,
weaving and processing and provision of technical assistance
to properly utilize the new equipment.
1/   Modernization would have to start in spinning since (i) good yarn
is a precondition of efficient weaving and good quality production,
(ii) the spinning plant offers the best possibilities to increase
labor productivity and (iii) the Chinese looms and processing
equipment can still provide a few years of productive life.



- 20 -
5.02      The possibility of eliminating spinning and importing the mill's
yarn requirements was also considered but rejected for further analysis for
the following reasons. Firstly, the spinning operation of the Sana'a mill
offers the best opportunities to increase productivity through introduction of
new machines (e.g., the Chinese carding machines which produce 4 kg per hour,
will be converted to produce 25 kg per hour; the Chinese drawing frames which
operate at 40 m per minute will be replaced with frames operating at 320 m per
minute). The project will increase the mill's spinning capacity from ori-
ginally 1,200 tpy to about 2,300 tpy while slightly reducing the number of
workers in spinning. Secondly, since the mill even after rehabilitation will
spin only 100% cotton yarn, which commands a higher price than blended yarn in
the international market and for which local cotton is available, value added
will be substantial 1/. Thirdly, a fully integrated mill can respond more
easily to changing market requirements especially for outerwear fabrics
through adjusting its yarn production program to the changing requirements
of the weaving department.

duction costs (in 1977 prices) for each of the three cases of rehabilitation

5.04      A recently appraised new textile mill in Tanzania, 1/ is estimated
to cost about US$80 million (excluding working capital and int rest during
const uction) and has a production capacity of 21.5 million m , or US$3.72
per m . This provides an indication of the order of magnitud2 of the sunk
cost in the Sana'a mill. On the basis of project cost per m of incremental
production, the above comparison appears to indicate that minimum rehabilita-
tion represents the most advantageous case. This is not surprising since
minimal investment plus necessary technical assistance would temporarily bring
the mill back to full capacity. This possibility was therefore analyzed in
detail:

5.05      The projected income statement shows that the level of production
and the value of sales reached in this case will not allow the Company to
be profitable. In other words, although minimum rehabilitation would provide
a substantial incremental improvement over the mill's current state of affairs,
the level of output and productivity achieved does not suffice to return
the mill to a profitable situation. This will be achieved under intermediate
rehabilitation, the proposed project.
5.06      The analysis of the case of minimum rehabilitation also answers
the important question why the appropriate solution for the Sana'a mill
would not be a return of the Chinese technical assistance. From the above
1/   Staff Appraisal Report No. 1893b-TA, dated May 20, 1978.



- 22-
analysis it is clear that although the Chinese might well be able to return
the mill to full capacity operation, they would not be in a position to make
it profitable again, given the labor-intensity of their equipment and the high
cost of labor in YAR.
5.07      Minimum, intermediate and maximum rehabilitation do not really
represent alternative projects, but should be viewed as three phases of an
overall rehabilitation program to eventually completely modernize the Sana'a
mill. Minimum rehabilitation, the first phase, should take place immediately,
followed by intermediate rehabilitation, the second phase (replacement of the
original spinning equipment and minor expansion of the weaving capacity).
Maximum rehabilitation, the third phase (replacement of the Chinese weaving
and processing equipment) would follow after completion of the second phase.
This approach of carrying out full rehabilitation in three phases has several
advantages. Firstly, simultaneous replacement of all spinning, weaving and
processing equipment would cause serious disruption in the production of the
mill and, therefore, result in relatively low levels of output during project
implementation. Secondly, the management of the mill could well be overtaxed
to implement such a complete rehabilitation program. Management and operating
assistance would have to be substantially strengthened and increased beyond
what is now intended. Thirdly, it is difficult to predict to what extent
Yemeni laborers and technicians would be able to cope with the introduction of
new technology in all departments at the same time. Training efforts would
have to be substantial, and still, efficiency of machine utilization would
likely be low. Intermediate rehabilitation (Phase I and II) will permit to
fully familiarize the Yemeni labor with the new technology in the spinning
department and to evaluate the results before embarking on the next step of
modernization.
5.08      The results achieved from the proposed project will be an important
factor in deciding whether and when to proceed with Phase III. The Company's
consultants will study the exact scope and optimal timing. In principle,
Phase III would consist of replacement of the Chinese looms (340) and most of
the Chinese processing equipment. It is foreseen that wider, shuttleless
looms would be introduced, and the new processing equipment would be designed
for cloth of up to 160 cm width. The equipment would also provide for process-
ing of blended fabrics (polyester/cotton) for shirting and sheeting. Blended
yarns would be imported to weave blended fabrics and, additionally, grey
blended fabrics could be imported for processing. Assurances were obtained
that by not later than June 30, 1980, the Company will submit to IDA for
consultation a study on the exact scope timing and viability of further
modernizing the Sana'a mill.
B.   Project Scope
5.09      The rehabilitation program involves replacement of most of the
original equipment to achieve a production level of 18.2 million m per year,
which represents the maximum production achievable within the mill's present
production area and its limited expansion possibilities. It will be imple-
mented in three phases, and the proposed project comprises Phases I and II.
A detailed description of the work to be carried out under each phase is in
Annex 5-1.



- 23 -
5.10      Phase I (1978-79) will provide for some immediate measures, namely
(i) reconditioning of the existing machinery through overhauling and effective
regular maintenance, (ii) immediate replacement of a small number of machines
which cannot be economically or technically reconditioned or are excessively
labor-intensive, (iii) completing the erection and putting into operation of
all 100 Czech looms, (iv) controlling product quality and waste, (v) intro-
ducing a revised, more profitable product mix, (vi) introducing an effective
system of incentives based on reasonable work loads and improving both machine
and labor productivity, (vii) retraining of present skilled labor and training
of new labor and (viii) reintroducing production of a third shift, utilizing,
however, the same number of labor currently engaged in the first and second
shift through proper allocation of workloads and discouraging nonproductive
and unnecessary day shift work.
5.11      Phase II (1980-81) will provide for replacement or complete moderniza-
tion of all original spinning equipment, expansion of the weaving capacity by
adding 76 new looms in order to fully utilize the new spinning equipment, and
use of some of the old spinning machines for the production of cotton wool and
sewing thread.  Four combing machines will be added for the production of fine,
combed yarn. An extension of 4,200 m of the building housing the spinning
and weaving department will be required to accommodate the new spinning equip-
ment and additional looms and to allow installation of the 100 Czech looms
without having to remove any more of the Chinese looms except the 20 already
removed (para. 3.13). Annex 5-2 shows the mill's site plan and the proposed
expansion. A prefabricated building will be used. Only few machines will be
added in the processing department, such as a yarn dyeing and cotton bleaching
facilities required for the newly introduced fabrics, sewing thread and cotton
wool, and some machines will be replaced such as the fabric boiling and bleach-
ing range to economize on water and chemical consumption. The conversion of
the rotary screen printing machine was already mentioned (para. 3.14).
5.12      Upon completion of the project (Phase I and II), total annual pro-
duction in 1981 would reach 14.4 million lm of 100% cotton fabric, 150 tons
of cotton wool and 170 tons of sewing thread. Some new fabrics will be
introduced (terry towel, mattress cover, suiting and black satin) for which
there is a good market in YAR and which offer attractive profitability. The
weaving production program at full capacity, expected to be achieved in 1981,
was discussed in para 4.06 above. Weaving efficiency has been assumed at
75% for the Chinese looms and at 80% for the Czech and new looms.
C.   Raw Materials and Utilities
5.13      The main raw material required is cotton.  Until now, sufficient
cotton was available locally. As has been discussed (paras. 2.13-2.15), the
quantity of locally produced cotton has dropped to 5,300 tons of raw cotton in
1976/77, which would have been sufficient to meet the requirements of the mill
at its original design capacity (about 4,500 tpy). Because of the expansion
of the mill's spinning production to about 2,300 tpy and the introduction of
cotton wool, the mills cotton requirements, expressed in raw cotton, will be
about 9,000 tpy after completion of the project.



- 24 -
5.14       As mentioned before (para 2.14), the Government is making efforts to
bring local cotton production back to and beyond its previous peak level of
27,200 tons attained in 1974/75 and has increased the price to be paid to
farmers for raw cotton beyond the equivalent world market price. Even with
this effort it is not certain that sufficient quantity of locally produced
cotton will be available. The analysis of the project has assumed that the
mill will purchase its cotton requirements locally, 80% as raw cotton and
20% as ginned cotton. If local cotton is not available, the Company is
expected to be able to import cotton at prices comparable to current local
prices. There is no import duty on cotton other than the 7% defense and
statistical tax levied on all imports.
5.15       In the past, the Sana'a mill has purchased about 80% of its cotton
requirements in the form of raw cotton for ginning in its own ginnery.
Since all of the cotton is grown in the country's coastal plain, about 250 km
from Sana'a, a substantial cost of transportation is involved. As part of the
project, the Company's consultants (para. 5.21) will therefore study the
feasibility of moving the ginnery and oil extraction plant from the Sana'a
mill to the coastal plain to install it either in the Baijil mill or elsewhere
in the Tihama region. Also as part of the project, the ginning and oil
extraction plant will be completely overhauled.
5.16       All dyestuffs, chemicals and sizing materials are imported.  Like-
wise fuel for the generators and steam boilers, and virtually all other
materials are imported. Assurances were obtained that the Government will at
all times issue the necessary licenses and foreign exchange.
5.17       In 1981, when the project is expected to reach its full production
of 14.4 million lm, annual power requirements will be 18.3 million Kwh. The
capacity of the mill's four generators is 14.4 million Kwh. Currently, the
mill is not connected to the public grid of Sana'a. Under a project currently
being financed by the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development, the gener-
ating capacity of Yemen General Electricity Company (YGEC) is being substantially
increased, including a steam power station at Hodeida and a system connecting
YAR's three main cities. A project currently being appraised by the Bank
will provide for expansion of the distribution system within the three major
cities. Since most of the power consumption in YAR, and in Sana'a in parti-
cular, is currently for lighting purposes, YGEC is looking for industrial
consumers that would purchase electricity during daytime and thus provide for
a more even load. Therefore, the project will provide for a connection of the
mill to the city's public grid, with the objective of first buying the incre-
mental power required for the project (i.e., 3.9 million Kwh annually) and,
eventually, the entire requirements after phasing out the mill's own diesel
generators.
5.18       The cost of power currently charged by YGEC is YR 0.6 per Kwh for
all consumers; this is only slightly above the mill's own cost of power
generation of YR 0.57. As part of the project financed by the Arab Fund,
a study is to be carried out during 1978 of the appropriate structure and
level of tariffs to be charged by YGEC to different consumers. At its current



- 25 -
rate, YGEC is loosing money due to inefficient generating equipment, power
losses and a poor load factor. The analysis of YGEC by Bank staff indicates
that with the improvements in equipment and management to be brought about by
the ongoing project, YGEC should be able to keep its tariff at the present
level through 1981. Assurances were obtained that the Government will make
YGEC's tariff study available to IDA promptly upon its completion. At that
time, the Company, with the assistance of its consultants, will review its
present decision (para. 5.17) to purchase its incremental power requirements
from YGEC or whether to increase its own generating facilities. One possi-
bility that will also be explored will be whether the two generating units
purchased in 1974 for the Baijil mill (para. 3.04) should be moved from there
to the Sana'a mill.
5.19      As noted above (para. 3.03), the mill's water consumption is very
high, constituting a particularly serious problem in Sana'a where water is in
short supply. Therefore, as a first step, the project provides for replace-
ment of the fabric boiling and bleaching range to economize on water. Fur-
thermore, effluent water treatment by the mill is extremely primitive. Waste
water from processing is discharged into three flat basins on the mill site
where some of it evaporates, leaving behind the chemicals and dyestuffs, and
the remainder seeps into the ground. Sanitary sewage is not treated at all
and discharged into a sewer, that is supposed to take it some 2 km away from
the mill, but because of clogging of the sewer, the sewage is surfacing near
the mill. The Company's consultants will study the technical and financial
feasibility of installing a water recycling system. If recycling is not
feasible, an industrial water treatment plant will be provided as part of
the project so as to treat waste water prior to discharge. Discharge after
treatment would eventually be done into the sewerage system now being built
in Sana'a under an IDA-financed project.
D.   Ecological Considerations and Occupational Hazards
5.20      The plant site is located in the outskirts of the city of Sana'a.
No other industrial units exist in the area. However, provision will be made
to bring the discharge of liquid and gaseous waste to within internationally
acceptable limits. The existing steam boilers will be equipped with automatic
regulating devices to ensure maximum combustion thus controlling the discharge
of CO in the flue gases. The consultants will be asked to measure the sulphur
dioxide content of the air on the ground 3level, and provision will be made to
limit the average content below 0.1 mg/m if found necessary. The project
provides for replacement of the present airconditioning system in the spinning
and weaving plant to achieve better operational efficiency and working environ-
ment. Air filters will be provided to control fluff and dust being exhausted
into the atmosphere. Existing carding machines are equigped with floor waste
exhaust filters and dust will be limited below 0.5 mg/m . An efficient dust
suction system and proper ventilation will be provided in the cotton ginning
plant to improve the present unhealthy working conditions. The project will
also provide for the effluent from the processing plant to be treated in an



- 26 -
industrial water treatment plant (para. 5.19). The treatment plant will be
designed to keep the level of biological oxygen demand (BOD) and the pH values
for the treated water below 100 ppm and 6-8 respectively. The noise level
will be measured and operators will be required to wear ear plugs in working
areas where the noise level exceeds 90 decibels. Assurances were obtained
that the Company will operate its facilities with due regard to ecological
considerations and occupational hazards.
E.   Management and Project Implementation
5.21      A preliminary implementation schedule for the project is shown in
Annex 5-3. As the first step, at the end of March 1978 the Company employed
consultants -on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA- who will assist the
Company in implementing the project and also provide management and operating
assistance and training. The consultants' personnel will arrive in YAR at the
beginning of June. Formal responsibility for project implementation will lie
with the Chairman and the General Manager, but the consultants will prepare
the detailed engineering, carry out the procurement for machinery and equip-
ment and civil works and expedite and supervise the delivery and erection of
the machinery and equipment and execution of civil works. The consultants
will also be responsible for establishing a suitable system to record and
control the cost and progress of the project. Erection of machinery is
expected to be completed by June 1980 and test runs by August 1980. The
project will be considered as completed after successful operation of the
plant for a period of 12 months at an average rate of at least 90% of its
rated capacity. This completion test is expected to be achieved during the
second half of 1981 (para. 7.01).
5.22      The consultants will provide 204 man-months of management and
operating assistance through the following seven experts: Management Advisor,
Technical Manager, Weaving Manager, Finishing Manager, Maintenance Engineer
for Spinning, Maintenance Engineer for Weaving and Printing Expert. The
Government has agreed that, with the exception of the Management Advisor, who
will advise and assist the Yemeni General Manager, the consultant's experts
will have executive power. Provision has also been made for 36 man-months of
short-term experts of different specializations. The number of man-months
currently budgeted for provides for technical assistance through 1981. It is
expected that in 1981 a decision will be taken whether to proceed with Phase
III of the modernization program (para 5.08). In that case, the technical
assistance would be continued beyond 1981 under that new project. Assurances
were obtained that by not later than June 30, 1981, the Government and the
Company will consult with IDA on the need for the Company to continue the
technical assistance program beyond December 31, 1981.
5.23      As has been noted (para. 3.02), the Government had replaced the
Company's Board of Directors and the General Manager at the end of February.
The present General Manager is capable of implementing the project with the
technical assistance to be provided as part of the project.



- 27 -
5.24       One of the main tasks of the consultants to be carried out as part
of their management and operating assistance will be the preparation and
presentation to the Company's management of an incentive scheme by not later
than October 31, 1978 that determines worker remuneration as a function of
presence, workload (e.g., number of machines attended), quality and quantity
of output produced or other measures of productivity and with appropriate
penalties for absenteeism, and the Company confirmed its intention of promptly
thereafter introducing such an incentive scheme. Yemeni workers have a
reputation of being hardworking and responsive to appropriate incentives.
Currently, the Company has no incentive scheme, and it can be expected that
labor productivity will increase significantly through the introduction of
such a system. Other tasks of the consultants will be the implementation of
appropriate standards and systems of waste and quality control, of systems of
production planning and control, of an improved cost accounting and financial
planning system and of appropriate management reporting procedures.
F.   Staffing and Training
5.25      The consultants will establish the manpower requirements of the
mill on a year-by-year basis for a three-shift operation and prepare job
descriptions in appropriate detail. They will study the possibility of
establishing a small training center using machinery to be replaced under the
modernization program. They will also prepare a detailed training program
by identifying the number and kind of people to be trained in Yemen in the
new training center and on the job, as well as abroad in training facilities,
textile mills and suppliers' facilities. Assurances were obtained that the
Company will submit, by not later than June 30, 1979, a training program that
is acceptable to IDA and will carry out the program according to a mutually
agreed time schedule. The consultants will help the Company in recruiting
suitable personnel. They will provide continuous on-the-job training in all
fields during operation and during equipment erection. They will also assist
the Company in finding training facilities and textile mills for training
abroad. The special study, to be carried out as part of the project, on the
problems and possibilities of employing more women in YAR's textile industry,
was discussed in para. 2.18 above. In order not to have training efforts
frustrated through the departure of the trained personnel, it will be neces-
sary to reduce staff turnover. It is expected that this will be achieved
through (i) further increases in the wages paid by the Company (provided for
in the financial projections); (ii) the possibility of earning higher incomes
through increased productivity after the introduction of the incentive scheme;
(iii) improvement in staff morale through improved performance of the mill;
(iv) implementation of the housing project for workers of the Sana'a mill
(para. 2.11); and (v) through increased employment of women.
VI. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN

6.02      The project cost estimate was prepared by Bank staff using experi-
ence gained under recent textile projects financed by the World Bank Group.
It is based on end-1977 prices for machinery and equipment, technical assis-
tance and civil works. The cost of management and operating assistance has
been estimated to be US$5,000 per man-month plus local cost of US$50 per
man-day. A physical contingency of 10% has been included. Foreign exchange
costs have been escalated for 1978, 1979 and 1980 at 7.0%, 6.5% and 6% and



- 29 -
local costs at 25%, 20% and 15% respectively. 1/ In accordance with YAR's
investment law, all imports of machinery and equipment and material for
the project will be exempt from import duties. The total cost estimate,
including contingencies, for the project is considered reasonable.
B.   Financing Plan
6.03      The proposed financing plan for the project is as follows:
Proposed Financing Plan
US$ Million
YR Million    Equivalent        %
IDA                          31.50          7.0         27.5
OPEC Special Fund              6.75          1.5         5.9
Government Loan               38.25          8.5        33.3
Total Debt                  76.50        17.0         66.7
Government Equity             38.25          8.5        33.3
Total Financing              114.75        25.5        100.0
6.04      The proposed on-lending terms of the IDA Credit and the proposed
terms of the Government loan are 12 years, including 4 years of grace, at
7.5% p.a. interest plus 2.5% p.a. service charge or a total cost to the
Company of 10% p.a. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Company.
The Company currently has no long-term debt. The proposed terms are based on
the Company's projected ability to service its debts and on the remaining life
of that part of the Company's equipment which will not be replaced under the
project. The Government equity would be disbursed before the Government loan.
Assurances were obtained that the Government will make available the first
tranche of the equity of YR 10 million (US$2.22 million) by not later than
August 1, 1978. However in order to finance consultants' services and some
urgently required machinery and equipment, the Government has undertaken to
make every effort to make at least YR 2 million available prior to that date.
The second tranche of the Government equity of YR 28.25 million (US$6.28
million) will be made available by January 1, 1979. The Government loan will
also be disbursed in two tranches, the first one of YR 28.25 million due on
July 1, 1979, the second of YR 10.0 million on June 30, 1980. The amounts and
dates have been established on the basis of the financing requirements of the
project and in order to ensure that the necessary funds are available to the
Company when needed for the project. Assurances were also obtained that the
1/   The escalation rates used for local costs, although below those used in
other recent reports, are justified. Local costs have only a very small
civil works component (erection of imported prefabricated building).
The remainder is for local transport and local expenses of technical
assistance.



- 30 -
Government will make promptly available all additional funds if and when
needed to complete the project. The signing of a subsidiary loan agreement
between the Government and the Company governing the on-lending arrangements
for the proceeds of the IDA Credit, the signing of a loan agreement between
the Government and the OPEC Special Fund for an amount of US$1.5 million and a
loan agreement between the Government and the Company for the Government loan
are proposed as conditions of effectiveness for the IDA Credit.
C.   Procurement and Allocation of Funds
6.05    _The-foreign exchange c,`stofthe consultants' services (engineer-
ing, management and operating assistance) and of training, estimated to total
US$2.3 million, will be financed from the IDA Credit. Since the consultants
are expected to incur first eligible expenses in late May 1978, retroactive
financing of their services after May 1, 1978 and up to US$300,000 is proposed.
6.06      For purposes of procurement, machinery, equipment and spare parts
can be divided into four groups:
(1)  Spare parts that must be procured from People's Republic of
China (about US$0.25 million);
(2)  Accessories that can be procured from People's Republic of
China but could also be procured from other sources and should,
therefore, be purchased after prudent shopping (about US$0.15
million);
(3)  Machinery and equipment that is required under the immediate
rehabilitation (Phase I) and should, therefore, be purchased
after prudent shopping (about US$1.00 million), and
(4)  Machinery and equipment that is required under Phase II of
the modernization program and will be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding (about US$12.1 million).
The foreign exchange cost of machinery and equipment (including technical
installations) is US$13.5 million. Machinery and equipment under groups (1),
(2) and (3) will be financed from the Government funds. A list of machinery
and equipment to be financed from the IDA Credit was selected from group (4)
(Annex 6-1) and contains such items for which good competition exists in Bank
member countries. These items will be procured under international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Items estimated to cost less than
US$100,000 and which cannot be combined with other items, can be procured
after having obtained offers from at least three Bank member countries. The
total of items to be so procured and to be financed from the IDA Credit will
not exceed US$0.5 million. The remainder of the machinery and equipment in
group (4) will be procured through international competitive bidding.
6.07      The proposed allocation of the IDA Credit is shown below and the
schedule of estimated disbursements in Annex 6-2.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Production
7.01      The table on the following page shows the projected production
volume for 1978 through 1984. Erection of the new spinning and additional
weaving equipment is expected to be completed by August 1980, and full produc-
tion of 14.4 million lm is expected to be achieved during 1981. Full capacity
utilization in 1981, which appears to imply a relatively fast build-up of
production if compared with that of new mills in developing countries, can be
achieved because (i) workers of the Sana'a mill have already the basic skills
to operate textile machinery, even if of simple technology, and new equipment
will be introduced primarily in the spinning department so that training
efforts can be concentrated there, (i) by mid-1980, expected start-up of the
new equipment, the mill will already have benefitted from two years of manage-
ment and operating assistance and training, (iii) the incentive scheme will
have been in place for more than a year and should be well accepted and
(iv) design capacity has been calculated using realistic assumptions con-
cerning efficiency of spinning and weaving which the mill has already demon-
strated as achieveable during the years preceding 1975. The Chinese looms
have been assumed to operate at an efficiency of 75% and the Czech looms as
well as the new looms at 80% (Annex 7-1). Annual yarn requirements including
170 tons for sewing thread and 80 tons for sale as yarn to replace the produc-
tion of the Baijil mill, are calculated at about 2,355 tons.
B.   Sales Volume and Revenues
7.02      Sales volume, sales prices and sales revenues are shown in Annex 7-2.
Sales prices are actual prices achieved in the domestic market during 1977 and
escalated at the assumed rates of international inflation, since in the open
economy of YAR, international textile prices determine the level of domestic
textile prices. Through the increase in production volume, introduction
of new, higher-priced products (shirting, suiting, terry towel, cotton

wool and sewing thread) and the processing of imported grey fabrics, net sales
revenues of the Company are expected to increase from YR 19.7 million in 1977
to YR 102.3 in 1981 in constant prices and to YR 130.9 in current prices.
C.   Production Costs
7.03      Assumptions used in financial projections, including those to
calculate production costs, are listed in Annex 7-3. Production costs are
based on current costs of raw materials and other inputs such as diesel fuel
and dyes and chemicals, maintenance materials and labor. Some improvement in
efficiency and reduction in waste has been assumed in spinning and weaving
preparation, due to the introduction of new machinery and better controls
through the management and operating assistance. The cost of cotton (about
30% of production costs in 1981) has already been discussed (para. 2.15).
The cost of purchased power has been assumed to be YR 0.6 per Kwh, which is
the price currently charged by YGEC and only slightly above the cost of self-
generation by the Company (para. 5.18). Labor costs (33.7% of production
costs in 1981 in 1977 prices and 37.5% in projected 1981 prices) constitute
the largest element of production costs. The cost of technical assistance
is being capitalized and depreciated. All prices, except local cost of power,
labor and local project cost, were escalated at the assumed rates of interna-
tional price escalation. Cost of purchased power was assumed to escalate as
projected by Bank staff. Cost of labor was assumed to increase at 30% in
1978, at 25% in 1979 and 20% in 1980 and at 10% p.a. from 1981 to 1984 and at
6% p.a. thereafter.  The structure of total production costs (in 1977 prices)
in 1981, is projected to be as shown below and compared with the structure of
production costs without the project.

The above table shows that labor costs would decline from a level of 52.3% of
total production costs without the project to 33.7% with the project. This
is still above the share of labor costs in textile mills in other countries,
where it normally amounts to 20 to 25% of total production costs.

7.05      The financial projections show that the Company would continue
running losses through 1980, but starting with 1981, its operations would
become profitable again. Even during 1978 through 1980, total projected
losses would be reduced by YR 23.8 million over what they would be without
the project. After 1980, operating profit as percent of sales would reach
the satisfactory level of about 20% and profit after tax as percent of
sales the level of about 7%. The Company would not pay any taxes through
1982, since losses can be carried forward. The corporate tax rate is 30%.
7.06      The financial projections assume that the Sana'a mill will be able
to reintroduce operation of a third shift starting with 1979 and that it will
reach full capacity utilization in 1981. Both these assumptions are consid-
ered realistic. Through 1975, the Sana'a mill operated three shifts (para.
3.09) and it is expected that there will be no problem to reintroduce a third
shift given the measures to be taken as part of the project (e.g. technical
assistance, incentive scheme). If the mill were not to achieve third shift
operation, it would not become profitable and would continue to run losses of
about YR 7.0 million (6.5% of sales) after 1980. If full capacity utilization
would be delayed until 1982, 90% capacity utilization in 1981 would suffice to
reach profit break-even.

E.   Financial Covenants
7.07      The projected cash flow statement and balance sheet show that the
current ratio would reach its lowest level of 1.5 times in 1978 and 1980 and
the debt/equity ratio its highest level of 63/37 in 1980. The debt service
coverage would reach its lowest point at 1.5. In order to ensure a sound
financial situation for the Company, assurances were obtained that the
Company will maintain at all times a current ratio of at least 1.5:1, a
debt/equity ratio not exceeding 60:40 and a debt service coverage of more
than 1.5 times and that the Government will promptly provide or cause to be
provided to the Company all funds needed so that the Company maintains a
current ratio of at least 1.2. Assurances were also obtained that the Company
will not pay any dividends or make a cash transfer to the Government from
accumulated profits if doing so would reduce the Company's current ratio
below 1.5:1. Finally, the Company would not be allowed to make any additional
investment of more than US$1 million equivalent without prior submission to
IDA of evidence satisfactory to IDA that such project or expansion would not
adversely affect the Company's managerial and financial position (para. 2.05).
F.   Financial Rate of Return
7.08      The financial rate of return of the project in 1977 prices is about
15% (Annex 7-8). It was calculated by assuming that shut-down of the mill is
the alternative to the project. The sensitivity analysis is shown below.
Sensitivity Analysis of Financial Rate of Return
ROR
Base Case                                   14.6%
Sales down 5%                                8.0%
Sales down 10%                               1.4%
Sales down 15%                              (5.7%)
Project Cost up 10%                         13.0%
Project Cost up 15%                         12.4%
Project Cost up 20%                         11.7%
Labor Cost up 10%                            9.7%
Labor Cost up 15%                            7.4%
Labor Cost up 20%                            5.2%
The rate of return is very sensitive to reduction in sales and less so to
increases in labor costs. As for labor costs, it is not likely that they will
increase in excess of the rates assumed in this report. It is likely that in
future the supply of domestic labor seeking employment in the modern sector
will substantially increase as there will be a continuous turnover with some
migrants returning home and new workers emigrating from the subsistence sector.



- 36 -
Also, there will be an increasing number of graduates from the rapidly expand-
ing education system. As for sales volume, it has been explained above (para
7.01) that the assumptions concerning the build-up of production are consid-
ered realistic. Sales prices have been conservatively estimated by using
current actual prices and escalating them at the assumed rates of interna-
tional inflation. Therefore the probability of sales falling short of pro-
jections is low.
7.09      As has been stated (para. 7.08), the financial rate of return has
been calculated by assuming that the alternative to the project would be a
shut-down of the Sana'a mill. However, it is highly unlikely that the Govern-
ment will close down the Sana'a mill, even though the mill is running at a
loss and will continue to do so without the proposed rehabilitation project.
If one were to assume that the mill would continue to operate (paras. 3.16-
3.17), the incremental improvement achieved by the project would, of course,
be substantially larger. On this basis, the project's financial rate of
return would be substantially higher.
G.   Risks
7.10      The main risk of the project lies in the possibility that the
Company may not achieve the production level or the level of profitability
after project completion as projected. While the production volume and
production costs and sales are based on realistic assumptions that take
appropriate account of the difficulties faced by a project in YAR, adverse
developments could take place in three areas: (i) the new management of the
Company may not have improved adequately, and the management and operating
assistance to be provided under the project may not succeed in overcoming this
weakness, (ii) increases in labor costs in excess of the rates assumed in the
projections could not only increase costs but prevent reduction in the high
turnover of labor and, therefore, frustrate training efforts, (iii) low-priced
textiles from a depressed world textile industry could keep international
price increases below those assumed in this report. Through its recent
appointment of a new management, the Government has demonstrated its awareness
of the management problem and its readiness to take the necessary action if
required. The personnel of the mill is aware that they need technical assis-
tance and have expressed their keen desire for such assistance. Yemeni people
display an openess towards foreign technical assistance that substantially
enhances the chances of its success. The present high wage rates are essen-
tially due to the strong labor demand from the modern sector and from abroad,
and the very limited supply of domestic skilled or semi-skilled manpower.
However, this situation is likely to change over the next few years. The
supply of domestic labor seeking employment in the modern sector is likely
to more than double during the present Five Year Plan period. The principal
sources of this supply will be returning migrant workers and graduates from
the rapidly expanding education system. Even if the total number of Yemenis
working abroad continues to increase marginally over the next few years,
there will be a continuous turnover with some migrants returning home and new
workers emigrating from the subsistence sector. Finally, the assumption used
in this report with respect to international textile prices is that they will
increase by 15% in real terms in the next three years over their currently



- 37 -
depressed level. This is in line with the assumption used for other textile
projects and in line with the general expectation of textile experts. The
three risks listed above are, therefore, considered acceptable.
H.   Reporting and Auditing Requirements
7.11      The consultants to be appointed under the project will, as part of
their terms of reference, develop and implement improved financial planning
and control and management reporting procedures for the Company. They will
also prepare monthly progress reports, and after completion of the project,
a completion report on the progress and results achieved under the project
and the management and operating assistance. These reports will serve the
Company as monthly progress reports to be submitted to IDA no later than 45
days after the end of each month. In addition, quarterly reports will be
prepared on the financial status of the Company.
7.12      The statutes of the Company provide that the Minister of Economy
appoints the Company's external auditor for a period of three years.  He
audits the Company's books from time to time, and in detail once every year
after the end of the fiscal year. The largest Yemeni auditing firm 1/ has
been the Company's auditor since 1970. This firm is also the auditor of most
other public sector enterprises. The firm has a professional staff of eight.
The head of the firm, educated in Cairo, does not speak English, but has staff,
including Egyptian staff, who do. The firm appears to be competent. Assur-
ances were obtained that the Government will at all times appoint a qualified
external auditor acceptable to IDA to carry out a full audit of the Company at
the end of its fiscal year and make the full report of such audit available to
IDA within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Prices of Inputs and Outputs
8.01      Average import duties on imported raw materials, dyes and chemicals,
fuel and maintenance materials are 8%.  These have been deleted from financial
prices in order to arrive at economic prices.  Labor costs have been taken at
their financial level, i.e. there has been no shadow-pricing of labor.
8.02      Current world market prices (landed YAR) for textiles of the type
manufactured by the Sana'a mill are compared with the financial prices in
Annex 8-1. World market prices for textiles reached a peak in 1973 and since
then they have declined because of the widespread recession in the textile
industry. This decline in prices in the face of rising input costs is not
expected to continue once the recession is over and market distortions are
corrected bringing the world market prices back to the long-term trend line.
Currently, the extent of depression of prices varies from product to product.

It is particularly noticeable for the staple items which are commonly produced
by developing countries such as plain woven, light-weight fabrics (e.g. Calico,
Ordinary), shirting and poplin, which are also the main products of the Sana'a
mill. Therefore, it is assumed that world prices of such fabrics on average
would increase in real terms gradually by 15% over the next three years so
that they approach the long-term trend prices. Given below are the September
1977 world prices and the projected long-term prices used in the Morogoro
Textile Project 1/ in Tanzania; these prices have been used as the basis for
estimating the economic accounting prices for the Sana'a mill output:

B.   Economic Rate of Return
8.03      Using the above assumptions, the economic rate of return of the
project is about 13% (Annex 8-2). Like the financial rate of return, the
economic return is calculated by assuming that shut-down of the mill is the
alternative to the project. The sensitivity analysis of project's economic
rate of return is shown below.

/a   World market prices expected to increase by a total
of 15% over present level during next three years;
all other price assumption count from 1978 onwards.
8.04      Like the financial rate of return, the economic rate of return is
very sensitive to sales revenues. As has been discussed (para. 7.08) it is
not very likely that the sales volume will fall short of projections. The
main risk lies in the possibility that current world market prices would not
recover or not recover for a long time from their currently depressed level.
As the sensitivity analysis indicates, an increase in world market prices in
real terms of about 9% is required for the project to yield an economic rate
of return of 10%. A gradual increase in real terms by a total of 15% over the
next three years is the best estimate and has also been used for the evalua-
tion of other projects (para. 8.02). Therefore, the project's economic rate
of return is considered satisfactory. Finally, if the economic rate of return
were calculated by assuming that continued operation of the Sana'a mill was
the only alternative (paras. 3.17 and 7.09), the project's economic return
would be substantially higher.
C.   Other Economic Benefits
8.05      The Government intends to create employment opportunities at home so
that the Yemeni people can stay in their country or return home. Absorbing
the fast growing number of people willing and able to work in the modern
sector requires rapid expansion of this sector. The Five Year Plan envisages
such an expansion and the rehabilitation and indeed, expansion of the textile
factory is an integral part of the Government's development strategy. Failure
to implement this strategy would inevitably lead to a situation where Yemen's
growing skilled labor force cannot be absorbed by the modern sector. It is
clear that the Government will not permit its only existing major industrial
employer to close down. This would not only destroy 1,600 employment oppor-
tunities in YAR but would also have a dampening effect on any other private
or public investment plans. Therefore, the project, which will enable the



- 40 -
Sana'a textile mill to survive, is justified. Closing down the mill would
also reduce the possibility of increased employment of women in the future.
If it will be possible to draw increasingly on the female population for the
labor force, the future prospects of this mill and of new textile projects may
turn out to be more favorable than indicated in this report, since such trend
would further reduce staff turnover and have a dampening effect on escalation
of labor costs.
D.   Fiscal and Social Impact of the Project
8.06      The Corporation is a fully Government-owned enterprise.  The pro-
posed project aims at returning the Sana'a textile mill to full capacity
utilization and profitability after years of losses, thus having a positive
fiscal impact. The proposed project will also have a significant social
impact since it will help maintain about 1,600 employment opportunities,
improve working conditions and provide for a study on the social, economical,
cultural and educational aspects of employment of women and possible measures
to further enhance their employment.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      Agreement was reached on the following points:
(A)  that the Government will:
(i) not authorize implementation in the public sector of any
project in the textile industry beyond the one proposed in
this report and costing more than US$1 million without prior
consultation with IDA (para. 2.05);
(ii) permit the Company to purchase its cotton requirements
from the most economic source (para. 2.15);
(iii) employ by October 31, 1978, consultants on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA to carry out a study of
the social, economical, cultural and educational aspects
of increasing employment of women in the textile industry
(para. 2.18);
(iv) issue at all times the necessary licenses and foreign
exchange for the importation of all inputs required by the
Company (para. 5.16);
(v) make available to IDA promptly upon its completion YGEC's
power tariff study (para. 5.18);
(vi) consult with IDA on the need for the Company to continue
the technical assistance program beyond December 31, 1981
(para. 5.22);



- 41 -
(vii)  make available its equity contribution of YR 38.25 million
for the financing of the project in two tranches, the first
one of YR 10.0 million by not later than August 1, 1978,
and the second tranche of YR 28.25 million by not later
than January 1, 1979 (para. 6.04);
(viii)  enter into an agreement with the Company for a loan of
YR 38.25 million (US$8.5 million) and promptly provide any
additional financing that may be required to complete the
project, both on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA
(para. 6.04);
(ix)  make promptly available or cause to be made available to
the Company any funds needed so that the Company maintains
a current ratio of at least 1.2:1 (para. 7.07); and
(x) appoint a qualified external auditor acceptable to IDA
to carry out an audit of the Company at the end of its
fiscal year and make the full report of such audit
available to IDA within six months of the end of the
fiscal year (para. 7.12);
(B)  that the Company will:
(i) not undertake any project or expansion other than the
one proposed in this report involving an expenditure in
excess of US$1.0 million without prior submission to IDA
of evidence satisfactory to IDA that such project or
expansion would not adversely affect the Company's
managerial and financial position (para. 2.05);
(ii)  submit to IDA for discussion by not later than June 30,
1979, the consultants' study of the marketing system and
sales policy and subsequently implement the proposed
changes as agreed between IDA and the Company (para.
4.10);
(iii)  submit by not later than June 30, 1980, to IDA for con-
sultation the consultants' study of the exact scope,
timing and viability of further modernizing the Sana'a
mill (para. 5.08);
(iv)  operate its facilities with due regard to ecological
considerations and occupational hazards (para. 5.20);
(v) employ qualified consultants on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA;
(vi)  consult with IDA on the need for the Company to continue
the technical assistance program beyond December 31,
1981 (para. 5.22);



- 42 -
(vii) submit, by not later than June 30, 1979, a training program
acceptable to IDA, and carry out the program according to a
mutually agreed time schedule (para. 5.25);
(viii) at all times observe certain financial covenants (para. 7.07);
and
(ix) submit monthly progress reports and quarterly financial
reports to IDA no later than 45 days after the end of each
month or relevant quarter, and its audited annual financial
statements no later than six months after the end of its
fiscal year (paras. 7.11-7.12).
9.02      The following are conditions of effectiveness for the IDA Credit:
(i) the signing of a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory
to IDA for the IDA Credit between the Government and the
Company (para. 6.04),
(ii) the signing of a loan agreement between the Government
and the OPEC Special Fund for an amount of US$1.5 million
(para 6.04); and
(iii) a loan agreement satisfactory to IDA for the Government
loan of YR 38.25 million (US$8.5 million) between the
Government and the Company (para. 6.04).
9.03      Based on the above mentioned agreements, the project provides an
acceptable basis for an IDA Credit of US$7.0 million to the Government, to be
on-lent to the Company for 12 years, including 4 years of grace at 7.5% p.a.
interest plus 2.5% p.a. service charge.

TEXTILE REHABILITATION PROJECT
DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
General Project Scope
1.    The ultimate objective of the rehabilitation program for the Sana'a
textile mill is the complete replacement or modernization of 2all original
(Chinese) equipment and a production level of 18.2 million m per year.
It will be implemented in three phases of which the project now proposed
encompasses Phases I and II. A detailed description of each phase is
given below:
Phase I
2.    Detailed lists and cost estimates for machinery, equipment and civil
works required for this Phase are given in document B-3 in the Project File.
The expected production after completion of Phase I is as follows:
Yarn Production   =  1,361,000 kgs
Cloth Production = 11,770,000 Im
The same number of workers which is presently engaged in two shifts will be
sufficient for operating the present production facilities, including the
new 100 Czech looms in 3 shifts.
3.    Maximum utilization of the existing production facilities will be
made through: (a) reconditioning of productive machinery through over-
hauling and effective regular maintenance, (b) immediate replacing of a
small number of machines which cannot be mechanically salvaged or are
excessively labor-intensive, (c) completing the erection and putting into
production of the newly purchased Czech looms, (d) controlling production
quality and waste, (e) introducing a revised and more profitable product
mix, (f) implementing an effective system of incentives based on reason-
able work loads in order to improve machine and labor productivity, (g)
retraining of present skilled labor and training of new labor if required,
(h) resuming production of the third shift, utilizing, however, the same
number of workers presently engaged in the first and second shift through
proper allocation of workloads and discouraging of non-productive and
unnecessary day-shift work.

transport equipment and finished yarn storage
(c) Weaving Plant
Reconditioning of the present machines by mechanizal checking,
setting and overhauling where necessary
Replacing few weaving preparatory machines (e.g. warping and
sizing machines) due to the unavailability of their spare
parts or for quality reasons which affect also weaving
productivity
1/   The consultants will study the feasibility of moving the ginning
and oil extraction plant from the Sana'a mill to the coastal plain
where cotton is grown.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 3
- Introducing labor-saving machines (e.g. drawing-in
installation in areas where small investment would
result in sizable reduction in labor
- Replacing air conditioning system if modernizing the
present system proved not feasible
- Introducing grey fabric inspection and grading system
for cloth quality control
- Setting up and implementing an efficient maintenance
program and a proper system of quality and waste control
- Setting up and monitoring productivity standards
- Re-assigning workloads coupled with proper incentive system
- Introducing new product mix with some new more profitable
items but also continuing the production of most of the
items originally produced and readily accepted by the
market
(d) Processing Plant
- Reconditioning of the present machines through mechanical
checking, setting and overhauling when necessary
- Replacing most of the squeezing rubber rollers, steam and
water valves, and steam traps to economize on dyestuffs,
chemicals, water and steam consumption
- Setting up and implementing an efficient maintenance program,
and a proper system of quality and material consumption
control
- Re-assigning new workloads coupled with proper incentive
system
(e) Civil Works
- Minor repair of civil works is required and mainly for the
sanitary facilities in the production plants
Phase II
5.    Detailed lists and cost estimates for machinery, equipment and civil
works required for Phase II are given in document B-4 in the Project File.
The expected production after completion of Phase II is as follows:
Yarn Production for Weaving =  2,104,000 kgs
Yarn Production for Sale    =       80,000 kgs
Sewing Threads               =    170,000 kgs
Cloth Production             = 14,425,000 lm
Cotton Wool                  =    150,000 kgs



ANNEX 5-1
Page 4
The saving in labor due to the replacement/modernization of the spinning
plant will be used for the new production facilities in cone dyeing,
sewing thread and cotton wool. Only an additional small number of labor
will be required for the weaving extension.
6.    In Phase II the following measures will be taken:
(a) Replacement of spinning machinery which cannot be efficiently
modernized to ensure high productivity, labor saving as well as
better yarn quality which is the basis of efficient weaving and
good quality fabrics;
(b) Expansion of the spinning capacity to meet the additional yarn
requirements of this phase;
(c) Re-utilization of most of the replaced machines in other new
production facilities namely for cotton wool, sewing thread and
soft cone winding for yarn dyeing for which they are well suited;
(d) Expansion of the weaving capacity by adding 76 new looms which
will be allocated to the production of new profitable items.
Further replacement of the weaving preparatory machines will take
place.  All yarns will be wound on cones before weaving to be
cleared of major faults such as slubs, motes, thick and thin
placed, piecing, etc.  Also replacement of the remaining sectional
warping and inspection machines so as to cope with the new
weaving requirements;
(e) Introduction of new machines in the processing plant for yarn
dyeing on cones, yarn mercerizing and cotton bleaching required
for the newly introduced fabrics, sewing thread and cotton wool;
(f) Replacement of the fabric boiling/bleaching range to economize
on water and chemical consumption. Conversion of the printing
machine to print large repeats for sari to save the large number
of labor presently engaged in handprinting;
(g) Introduction of new installations for the production of sewing
thread and cotton wool;
(h) Replacement of transport facilities. Provision of industrial
water treatment plant to treat water discharged from the process-
ing plant. As water is scarce and expensive in Sana'a and the
cost of its softening and after treatment is even more expensive:
the feasibility of a water reclamation plant will be studied.
Also, the fire protection system will be extended to protect
all premises;
Mi)  Expansion of the spinning and weaving building by 4,200 mn2 to
house the new production facilities and the weaving expansion;

(j) The present looms and processing machinery will be retained
and operated until Phase III of the project.
Phase III-/
7.    This phase of the project will complete the rehabilitation of the Sana'a
mill through replacement of the Chinese looms and processing machinery which
by then will have reached the end of their economic production life (over
15 years). The expected production after completion of Phase III is as
follows:
Yarn Production for Weaving               =   2,104,000 kgs
Yarn Production for Sale                  =       80,000 kgs
Sewing Thread                             =      170,000 kgs
Cloth. Production:
100% cotton from local produced yarn  =  14,425,000 lm
blended from imported yarn              =   1,560,000 lm
total                                        15,985,000 lm  2
(18.2 million m  equivalent)
Processing of Imported Blended Cloth           3,000,000 lm
(4.5 million m2 equivalent)
Cotton Wool                               =      150,000 kgs
The saving in labor due to the replacement of the processing and weaving
machinery will be about 120 workers.
8.    In Phase III, the following replacements will be made:
(i)   Replacement of 340 narrow looms by 300 wide and narrow looms
enabling the production of sheeting, cretons and polyester
blended fabrics for shirting and suiting. Due to the larger
capacity of the new looms, 600 tons of yarn will have to be
imported as the spinning capacity will not be able to meet all
yarn requirements for weaving. It will be advisable that this
amount should be polyester blended yarn to introduce weaving
of blended fabrics for the first time in Yemen.
(ii) Replacement of most of the bleaching, dyeing and finishing
machines in the processing plant. The new machines will be
able to process wide fabrics and also polyester blended fabrics.
They will have an excess capacity to process an additional 3
1/   The outline given here of Phase III, which does not form part of the
proposed project, is only preliminary. The consultants will study
the exact scope of Phase III.

million lm of blended grey fabrics to be imported. It will
be recommended to import grey polyester/rayon suiting material
for processing in the mill along with the previously recommended
shirting and sheeting woven from the imported blended yarn.
(iii) Replacement of some of the technical installations will be
necessary as by then, most of them would have reached the end
of their economic production life. Workshop equip ent, boilers,
water pumps and possibly the  electric generators..    will have
to be replaced at this stage to ensure the continuity of
production without interruptions.
1/   Only in case that power requirements could not be purchased from the
Yemen General Electricity Company by the time Phase III is completed.
