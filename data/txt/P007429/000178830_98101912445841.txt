I. SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS RELATED TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Economic Background and Development Strategy
1.01      Jamaica's economy seriously declined during the 1970s despite
ample natural resources, proximity to North American markets, and a well-
educated labor force. The nation's per capita real GDP decreased every year
from its peak in 1972, for an accumulated decline of 26% by 1980. The economy's
decline can be attributed to reduced demand for bauxite and alumina (Jamaica's
most important exports), decline in tourism, neglect of agriculture, rising
prices for petroleum, state intervention in the economy which has led to
reduced foreign and domestic investment, and massive outflows of capital and
of skilled labor.
1.02      The new administration which came into office in 1980 is committed
to an export-oriented program of economic revitalization aimed at self-
sustaining growth by FY84. The Government's objectives 1/ are to promote
economic growth, reduce unemployment 2/, and increase the efficiency of the
supporting infrastructure. In order to meet these objectives, the Government
intends to focus its efforts on those economic sectors whose capacity
is currently underutilized so as to secure prompt and substantial foreign
exchange earnings, urgently needed to promote and sustain economic growth.
The targeted sectors include agriculture (which showed no growth from 1973-
1980), manufacturing (which in 1980 was below 40% of its capacity), tourism
(whose hotel occupancy was at 45% in 1980), and mining (bauxite and alumina).
The Government considers that with the plant and equipment now in place, real
growth of 3% can be achieved in 1981, 4% in 1982, and 5% in 1983.
Implications for Human Resources Development
1.03      With an average annual rate of economic growth of 4% and an
employment increase of 3%, it is estimated that between 1980 and 1990 there
would be about 450,000 persons entering the labor force. They would replace
workers retiring or migrating 3/ (estimated at 20,000 per year) or occupy
newly created jobs (estimated at 25,000 per year).  Excluding non-seekers of
jobs, this net increase in employment would bring the unemployment rate down
to 8%-9%.
1/   "Economic Policy Memorandum of the Government of Jamaica," Ministry of
Finance Paper No. 9, April 22, 1981.
2/   In 1980, 27% of the labor force were unemployed.  The rate of unemployment
is higher among females, which reached a peak of 44% in 1979, dropping
slightly to 39% by the end of 1980. These figures include non-seekers of
work, which if netted out from the labor force figures, would reduce the
unemployment rate by about half.
3/   The Department of Statistics puts net emigration for the 1970s at
182,300, which is nearly 10% of the total population. Emigration has
contributed to the low population growth, which, between 1976 and 1980,
fluctuated between 1.0% and 1.2% a year.



-2-
1.04      It is impossible to disaggregate Jamaica's manpower requirements
into specific occupations with precision because few occupational data exist.
However, the following comparison of a rough estimate of the employment
structure from 1980 to 1990 to the corresponding flow from post-secondary and
other skill training institutions reveals shortages of professional, managerial
and technical personnel, skilled craftsmen and production line workers. 1/

Personnel and Craftsman in the 1980s

Growth                                 3,500                  6,300
Total                       5,600                   8,800

Shortage                                    1,100                  4,600
The present number of graduates from higher institutions meet about 80% of the
projected manpower requirements at the professional, technical and managerial
level, while craft training institutions meet only about half of the
projected demand for craftsmen or skilled workers. The Government needs to
redirect and diversify its training programs and intensify its retraining
activities to respond adequately to the manpower requirements of the country
and to enhance employment possibilities.
1/   This shortage has been compounded by emigration, particularly among
professional and kindred personnel and craftsmen and production workers.
In the years 1975-78, it is estimated that about 3% of all the Jamaican
professional and kindred personnel, and about 2.2% of the craftsmen and
production workers migrated in each of these years.

II. VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL TRAINING I/
A. Assessment of the Vocational and Technical Training System
Overview
2.01      The Government's most urgent task in the education sector is to
streamline the technical and vocational education system to support its policy
of production expansion and employment generation. The training system has
the potential to meet the country's manpower requirements, but must settle
important issues before this potential can be fully realized. The system
needs increases in output in response to clearly identified needs; qualitative
improvements to bring its trainees up to standards of skill and productivity
required by the economy; and strengthening in management to ensure planning,
evaluation and coordination of its various skill training programs.
Institutions Involved in Vocational and Technical Training
2.02      The main institutions providing training at the professional,
technician and craftsman levels are shown below:

-5-
2.03      Two institutions stand out as the most important in industrial
training: the College of Arts, Science and Technology (CAST), and the
Vocational Training Development Institute (VTDI). The College of Arts,
Science and Technology (CAST), established in 1958, provides courses in
Engineering, Building, Commerce, Science, Institutional Management and Food
Science, Computer Science, and Technical Education. Students a4e graduates
of secondary schools, selected on the basis of an admission examination.
The full-time courses vary in length according to whether they lead to a
certificate (2 years), a diploma (3 years) or a professional qualification
(4 years) and provide for technicians, higher technicians, and technologists.
In 1980, 507 certificates, 288 diplomas and 4 professional diplomas were
awarded by the College.
2.04      The Vocational Training Development Institute (VTDI) was founded
in 1970 with assistance provided by the UNDP and the ILO. It is the principal
center for the training of instructors, senior instructors and chief instructors
for the Industrial Training Centers (ITCs), Government departments, and the
vocational streams of the secondary schools, and for the production of training
officers for industry to carry out in-plant training or act as apprendiceship
supervisors. Entrants to the one-year instructors' courses have occupational
competence including 3-5 years of industrial experience. At present, instruc-
tors' courses provide training in construction, mechanical and electrical
work, wood and metal work and hotel trades. The Institute trains about 100
instructors every year and provides in-plant industrial training and upgrading
to about 500 workers 1/ in the private and public sector every year.
2.05      The Government's interest in the promotion of technical and
vocational education and training is indicated by the comparatively high
level of the Government's recurrent expenditure:

were trained on the job or at the VTDI workshops.

Issues in Technical and Vocational Training
2.06      The training system must settle some important issues before its
full potential can be realized. These issues concern inadequate output, low
quality and poor management.
2.07      Inadequate Output.  There is a need for a modest expansion of the
training system to cover identified shortages in specific technical fields.
The estimated annual manpower requirements for 1980-1990 are indicated below:
Table 2.3:  Manpower Requirements, 1980-1990

(a) Estimated technical teacher requirements (1980-1995) are based on a
projected increase of 65,000 students by 1995, on the present teacher:
student ratio of 1:22, and on an attrition rate of 10%.
(b) A CAST assessment of market requirements for technicians during the
1980s has indicated a demand of about 250-300 computer technicians and
an equal number of chemical technicians specialized in such fields as
sugar technology, food processing and manufactured goods.
(c) VTDI has been under pressure from industry to provide in-plant and
institutional training in industrial electronics, air conditioning
and refrigeration, radio and television, mechanical repairs and auto
building and painting. VTDI estimates that in addition to students in
training institutions, about 20,000 workers would require such training
within the next 15 years. VTDI estimates that at least 70 instructors
would have to be trained every year to undertake, in their turn, the
training of workers and students in those trades.



-7-
2.08      Existing institutions lack adequate and proper facilities to meet
the above manpower requirements. CAST requires extension of workshops
for the Department of Technical Education. New accomodations are needed for
the Department of Computer Science, currently housed in a cramped and unsuit-
able accommodation in the Administrative Block. Additional laboratories
are required ior the teaching needs of the Department of Science. 1/ VTDI
also requires new workshop areas for instructor training.
2.09      In addition, it is urgent for the Government to ameliorate the
serious unemployment. The Government recognizes the need to give training
opportunities to encourage self-employment. It plans to give opportunities
in skill training, production and management to graduates of secondary schools
and ITCs so that they can eventually run their own small enterprises. Because
of the unique nature of the program, its implementation in an ITC or the VTDI
would be difficult. Therefore, some form of pilot project would be indicated.
The MOY proposes the establishment of two experimental Industrial Production
Centers (IPCs) for this kind of training.
2.10      Low Quality.  The quality of the training provided by the technical
and vocational institutions is adversely affected by lack of qualified staff,
appropriate curricula, learning materials and equipment, and evaluation
services. The following are some of the cases where qualitative improvements
are necessary:
(a)  Ninety percent of secondary school teachers are considered qualified.
However, in a study conducted by the Planning Unit of MOE in the
school year 1978-79 of 1,243 teachers of technical subjects, 2/
more than 40% of them had inadequate technical or vocational quali-
fications. 3/ As a result, the practical aspects of training are
improperly taught. CAST has a teacher diploma program for unqualified
teachers, operating every summer, but the completion of the diploma
course lasts too long (7-8 summers). CAST would have expedited the
completion of this course through a combination of summer courses,
and one-year intensive study at CAST for about 45 teachers annually,
but it has no facilities to implement this program;
(b)  CAST has become a training center for health technicians in response
to the growing requirements of the Government's health care programs.
CAST needs, however, to update and develop appropriate curricula for
its various allied health courses to fit local conditions;
1/   Due to lack of laboratories and equipment, the Science Department has to
make use of facilities off campus at the University Hospital and the
Government Veterinary Center.
2/   Representing about 60% of all technical teachers.
3/   Of 1,243 teachers, 522 (42%) had three years technical training and
200 (16%) had been trained as instructors; the remaining 521 (42%)
had technical knowledge ranging from some to little.



-8-
(c)  Shortages of appropriate learning materials for its various
vocational courses are evident in the case of VTDI, and marked
in the case of CAST. CAST has only 100 library places for its
3,300 students, as well as serious shortages of books for the
various subject areas, particularly reference books, journals
and publications, and other audio-visual equipment and software.
The present learning resources neither supplement adequately
the teaching of the existing courses nor encourage research and
individual learning;
(d)  There has been no other study related to vocational training,
with the exception of one tracer study of graduates of secondary
education in 1976. The lack of systematic evaluation studies
deprives the training system of needed assessment and subsequent
improvement of the quality of its programs and their relevance to
manpower requirements. It also deprives the students and their
parents of valuable information on employment possibilities.
2.11      Inadequate Managerial Services.  The efficiency of the training
system suffers because there is no overall coordination of the various skill
training activities and the MOY lacks planning capacity.
(a)  There is no comprehensive policy or common strategy for the devel-
opment of the training system, formal and nonformal, as a whole.
There is limited coordination among the government agencies and
their training institutions.  For instance, there are three Minis-
tries offering vocational training (MOE, MOY, and MOI). Even when
their courses cover the same skill area, they have different
admissions requirements, curricula, staff, duration, etc. There
are no clear levels of skill training which would support students'
transfer among institutions, especially from the nonformal to the
formal system. 1/ Left unrelated and uncoordinated, these insti-
tutions are unable to prevent duplication and waste. There has
also been a lack of communication between the training system and
the representatives of industry and trade unions; this undermines
the efficiency, effectiveness and coordination of the skill training
activities. Active participation of industry and trade unions in
the development of the training system, by means of a coordinating
agency for the various training activities, would promote the
relevance of the training programs to the needs of the economy, help
the placement of graduates, and contribute to the evaluation of
training and its improvement;
(b)  The MOY has administrative responsibility for most of the nonformal
training activities for out-of-school youth and adults--male and
female--for both employment and community development purposes.
However, it has no planning and evaluation services. Such services
are essential for the development of the Ministry's policies, plans,
programs and projects in accordance with the overall national plans,
and for their evaluation to assess their effectiveness and their
need for adjustments and improvements.
1/   Such a transfer is not possible at present.

B. Education Development Strategy
Government Sector Policy and Strategy
2.12      The Government's present educational policy emphasizes the central
role of education in the development of the Jamaican society. The policy
envisages:
(a) the improvement of existing training institutions, mainly
through the development of new relevant curricula, the
production of related learning materials, and appropriate
teacher training programs;
(b) the provision of educational opportunities for all children
through the age of 16, as available resources would permit;
and
(c) the streamlining of the training system to make it capable
of responding effectively to the manpower needs of the
economy and the employment needs of the population.
In light of the Government's present major objective to promote economic
growth, through a major production and export effort, with concomitant in-
creases in employment opportunities, the streamlining of the training system
has become the immediate objective of the Government in the education sector.
This involves its modest expansion in identified areas, the improvement of its
quality and productivity, and the strengthening of its managerial services
(paras. 2.07-2.11). The Government's major long-range priority in the area of
human resources development is the improvement of primary education. Primary
school curricula have already been prepared, but their effective implementa-
tion is hindered by lack of appropriate learning materials. The Government
intends to develop and test such materials as the first step towards the
production of better learning materials for all primary school students. The
Government has requested Bank assistance for the streamlining of its training
system, and also for the development and experimentation of learning materials
for primary education.
Bank Lending Strategy
2.13       Bank lending in Jamaica has included two education projects.
The First Education Project (Loan No. 468-JM) was completed in October 1973, 1/
and the Second Education Project (Loan No. 727-JM) in March 31, 1981. 2/
1/   The relevant Project Performance Audit Report, No. 649, was circulated
on March 4, 1975.
2/   The Project Completion Report was circulated on June 30, 1981.  The
Project Performance Audit Report is pending.



- 10 -
Both projects provided substantial assistance towards the development of
secondary education (junior and comprehensive) and post-secondary educational
institutions (the Teacher Training Colleges, the College of Arts, Science and
Technology (CAST), and the Jamaican School of Agriculture (JSA)). The projects
added about 50,000 student places to secondary schools, 1,175 student places
to teacher training colleges, 390 additional places in CAST, 390 student
places in JSA, and 320 student places in the Industrial Training Centers
(ITCs). The actual enrollments in these institutions exceeded initial plans
by 15%-30%. 1/ However, the projects encountered implementation difficulties,
related mainly to lack of counterpart funds and frequent changes of key
personnel. Also adequate budgeting arrangements could have improved the
maintenance of institutions. The implementation of both projects would have
benefited if the project implementation unit had clear lines of delegation
of authority and continuity of full-time qualified personnel.
2.14      The Bank's present strategy in Jamaica is to support projects that
bear a significant relationship to Jamaica's most pressing problems, i.e.,
those of the economy and employment. In the education sector, the Bank should
support the Government objective for streamlining the training system--i.e.,
increasing its productivity, improving its quality and strengthening its
managerial services--to meet effectively the manpower requirements of the
economy and to enhance employment possibilities. The Bank would also support
the development and experimentation of learning materials for primary education,
without which the new primary school curricula cannot be properly implemented
(para 2.12).
III. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Scope
3.01      The proposed project would address the issues of Jamaica's technical
and vocational education system by pursuing three objectives: selective
expansion, quality improvement and improved management. First, the project
would seek to expand the output of the system selectively to meet identified
manpower demands. This objective would be sought by means of:
-    expansion of technician and teacher training in selected fields
at the College of Arts, Science and Technology (CAST);
-    expansion of instructor training at the Vocational Training
Development Institute (VTDI); and
-    establishment of two pilot Industrial Production Centers (IPCs)
to train workers for self-employment.
1/   In the case of CAST, enrollments increased by 160% between 1973/74
and 1980/81. Because of this overcrowding has occurred and buildings
scheduled for replacement by the Loan 468-JM continue to be used.



- 11 -
Second, the project would seek to improve the quality of training at CAST
and VTDI. This would be accomplished through the:
-    development of new teaching programs;
-    improvement in the quality of teacher training;
-    provision of appropriate learning materials; and
-    establishment of evaluation systems to identify outcomes of the
training system.
Third, the project would help strengthen the managerial capacity of the
overall training system by supporting:
-    the creation of the National Industrial Training Board; and
-    the establishment of the Planning and Evaluation Division of MOY.
In addition, the project would finance a pre-investment study to assist the
Government in preparing better teaching materials for primary education and
the preparation of future education projects.
3.02      The project would include the following specific items:
A. Construction, equipping and furnishing of:

B.   Provision of technical assistance comprising about 84 staff-months of
specialist services and about 207 staff-months of fellowships; and
C.   A pre-investment study for the development of learning materials for
primary education and the preparation of future education projects.
The College of Arts, Science and Technology (CAST) (Proposed total outlay 1/:
US$3.6 million)
3.03      In order to improve the quality and increase the output of the
technician training system, the project would finance the improvement of
three departments at CAST--Technical Education, Computer Science, and
Science--as well as the Library and the Maintenance Unit.
3.04      Department of Technical Education (Proposed outlay: US$0.5 million)
The Department would be physically expanded to provide 105 additional places
for new teachers 2/ and 45 places for upgrading unqualified teachers (para.
2.10(a)). New teachers enrollments would increase as follows:
Table 3.1: Annual Enrollments and Output of
Technical Teachers in the 1980s
Enrollments
Area of Specialization    Existing       Additional      Total    Annual Output
Construction                  45             15            60           20
Electrical Technology         45             15            60           20
Mechanical Technology          45            15             60          20
Home Economics                45              -            45           15
Business Studies               60            30            90           30
Business Secretarial           60            30            90           30
Total         300           105           405          135
There is a reasonable supply of qualified applicants for the additional 105
enrollments from technical and other secondary schools. In addition to the
new trainees, there would be three groups of 15 unqualified teachers, i.e., a
total of 45, who through summer courses had attained credits equivalent to the
second-year diploma course; these teachers would attend the third-year diploma
course on a full-time basis. Project fellowships would be provided for staff
1/   This and subsequent figures for proposed outlay exclude contingencies.
2/   See para. 2.07(a) and Table 2.3.

upgrading. Increased student enrollments would require 11 additional staff
members. This staff is expected to be available. At.negotiations, the
Government presented an acceptable detailed staff development plan, covering
both recruitment and training, for the staff required by this and all project
institutions.
3.05      Department of Computer Science (Proposed outlay: US$0.2 million).
The project would convert the present CAST library building into the Department
of Computer Science. Appropriate furniture and equipment would be installed.
CAST already owns a proper computer with its ancillary equipment, but needs a
small educational computer and a small-business micro-computer for demonstra-
tion purposes. The new arrangements would enable the Department to extend its
activities, increasing its annual output of computer technicians from 10 to
25 (para. 2.07(b)), providing training service to up to 250 banking and
accounting students in the Department of Commerce, and performing general
administrative services for CAST, through the programming of accounting
records and functions, student transcripts, marking of examinations, etc. By
the completion of the project (1984/85) the academic staff would have to be
increased by 2, and the technical staff (programmers and operators) by 3. No
difficulties are expected in the recruitment of additional staff. A project
fellowship would enable a senior member of the academic staff to undertake an
upgrading course overseas in data processing management.
3.06      Department of Science (Proposed outlay: US$1.4 million).  The project
would include construction, furnishing and equipping of a new science wing,
which would include four laboratories and auxiliary accommodations. This
would allow the whole Department to be located on campus and expand its
internal activities and service to other departments. Programs in chemical
technology would be expanded and would provide third-year diploma options
in sugar technology, agro- and food industries, and the manufacture of products
(soap, edible oil, etc.) for export or import substitution. The planned
addition of 50 student places (para. 2.07(b)) would increase enrollments in
chemical technology from 40 (1980) to 90 (1985), and outputs from 20 techni-
cians to 35--15 technicians and 20 higher technicians. Enrollments would
increase as follows:
Table 3.2: Annual Enrollments and Output
of Chemical Technicians in the 1980s
Existing   Additional   Total No. of Students   Annual Output
First-year Students      20            15                   35
Second-year Students    20             15                   35                 15
Third-year Students      -             20                   20                 20

- 14 -
The curriculum for the certificate program in chemical technology Lia1ra i
been restructured by the staff of the Science Department to provide spe,ializa-
tion in more practical and applied science topics. Technical assistance,
however, would be provided for the curriculum development of allied health
sciences (para. 2.10(b)). On completion of the project in 1984, the Science
Department would have the capability to service adequately the other departments,
despite a projected increase of its workload by 20% within the Department and
13% in the provision of services to other departments.l/  Additional Department
staff requirements would be 11 professionals and 2 laboratory technicians.
This staff is expected to be available. New and current staff would be able
to improve their knowledge and skills through fellowships under the project.
3.07      Library/Learning Resource Center (Proposed outlay: US$1.3 million).
The project would construct, furnish and equip a new library/learning resource
center. The new center would have a seating capacity for 300 persons, and
facilities for about 45,000 books, periodicals and audio-visual aids. The
center would be used by more than 3,000 students of all the faculties and 200
teachers. The use of educational technology for teaching and learning at the
learning resource center would become part of the training of technical
teachers. The new Library/Learning Resource Center would require 2 additional
junior librarians, whose recruitment presents no difficulties, and 1 audio-
visual technician, who would be trained through the project. The project
includes fellowships in educational technology and polytechnic library
administration and operations.
3.08      College Maintenance Unit (Proposed outlay: US$0.2 million).  The
project would provide CAST with fully furnished and equipped maintenance shops
for the upkeep of the College and its laboratories. The new facilities would
enhance the teaching of practical maintenance to students, including science
equipment maintenance, for which one fellowship would be provided by the
project.
The Vocational Training Development Institute (VTDI) (Proposed outlay:
US$0.6 million)
3.09      The project would help the VTDI to increase its output of instruc-
tors and workers in specific trades to develop new teaching programs and to
establish systems to assess the effectiveness of its training.  First, the
project would include the construction, furnishing and equipping of 5 workshops.
This would enable the VTDI to add about 70 new places to existing accommodations
for the training of an equivalent number of vocational training instructors
every year (para. 2.07(c)). About 20 of the graduates of the instructors'
courses are expected to be employed by private industry and the Government
for the training and upgrading of workers, through in-service, in-plant and
apprentice training arrangements. About 50 others would be used as training
staff in industrial training centers, youth community training centers and
1/   The projected workload within the Department would be 416 hours (1984)
compared to 346 (1981), and that of the other departments would be
increased from 312 (1981) tb 352 (1984).

secondary schools. With the provision of additional training opportunities
for instructors, the VTDI would be expected to train and upgrade about 10,000
additional workers between 1985 and 1995. 1/ Second, new courses of special-
ization given by the VTDI would include mechanical repairs and maintenance
(including agricultural machinery), air conditioning/refrigeration, radio/
television, industrial electronics, and automobile repairs. Nine (9) senior
instructors, together with 6 workshop assistants would be required for the
additional programs. Local staff is expected to be available for the
agricultural and automotive courses. The project, however, would provide
technical assistance to train staff and develop curricula in the subject
areas of industrial electronics, radio/television, and air conditioning!
refrigeration, for which there is no qualified staff available. The third
objective, evaluation of training outcomes, is described in para. 3.14.
The Industrial Production Centers (IPCs) (Proposed outlay: US$3.0 million)
3.10      Programs to promote employment are urgently needed.  The purpose
of an IPC would be to train people for self-employment. An IPC would consist
of workshops for both training and production. The proposed project would
finance the construction, furniture and equipment for the establishment of
two pilot IPCs, the first in the country. The IPC in Kingston would train
140 students, and the IPC in Montego Bay 120. Trainees would be graduates
of secondary schools and industrial training centers, i.e., persons who
have already reached the skill level of a junior craftsman. The one-year
intensive courses offered by the IPCs are intended for persons interested
in self-employment or small cooperative ventures. A sufficient supply of
qualified, interested entrants is expected to be available. The courses
would include a common core curriculum focusing on the organization and
management of small businesses or cooperative ventures, including quality
control, accounting, marketing and credit. The rest of the curriculum would
emphasize the development of knowledge and skills required by senior
craftsmen. Particular emphasis in the curriculum would be given to modern
industrial production practices and techniques. While in training the
trainees would produce saleable goods and services, especially maintenance
services. The selection of crafts offered by each center would be guided
by local, regional and national needs. For instance, the Kingston Center
would house training courses and production work in automotive, auto body
repair, cabinet making, electrical maintenance, refrigeration and air
conditioning, sheet metal work, and welding. The Montego Bay Center would
give courses in food technology, masonry, automotive/agro-machinery, metal
work, woodwork/carpentry, and electrical/electronics. A total of 14
instructors and 14 workshop assistants would be needed for the operation
of both Centers. The teaching staff of IPCs would be recruited from among
experienced instructors and senior instructors trained by the VTDI. No
difficulty is foreseen in their recruitment. The staff of each Center would
be headed by a Production Manager, who would be trained through the technical
assistance program. The Manager would report directly to the Director of
Training of the MOY. IPCs would be able to meet a small part of their non-
personnel training costs from the goods and services produced at the centers.
1/   Starting from about 200 workers in 1985, when the new facilities would be
completed, and reaching about 2,000 in 1995.

Since this is a pilot project, it is not possible to determine at this stage
whether it would lead to a larger future program. However, this project
component has been carefully studied and the prospects for its successful
implementation appear good. If the evaluation of this pilot project points to
positive results, the Government intends to establish additional centers with
other resources.
Technical Assistance (Proposed outlay: US$1.2 million)
3.11      Management Improvement.  An important purpose of the project would
be to support the Government in strengthening the managerial capacity of its
training system. This would be accomplished through the establishment of:
(a) the National Industrial Training Board, and (b) a Planning and Evaluation
Division in the MOY. First, specialist services would be provided through
the project to help the Government establish appropriate organizational,
administrative and financial arrangements for the National Industrial Training
Board. This Board, to be actively suported by the Government, industry, trade
unions and the training institutions, would undertake an overall coordinating
role for all industrial training activities, and promote the development
of industrial training curricula, the establishment of trade standards and
testing for certification, and the monitoring and evaluation of industrial
training programs. In carrying out its activities the Board would utilize
the professional and supporting services of existing government agencies.
During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that the National
Industrial Training Board would be established as agreed by December 31, 1983.
3.12      Technical assistance, in the form of specialists and fellowships,
would also help the MOY to establish the structure and services of a Planning
and Evaluation Division. This division would adequately deal with the collec-
tion and analysis of statistical data; the carrying out of research; the
formulation of the Ministry's long term plans, intermediate strategies and
short term goals; the development of programs and projects for the various
components of the Ministry; and the monitoring and evaluation of their
implementation.
3.13      Overall, the project would finance the equivalent of about 84 staff-
months of specialist services and about 207 staff-months of fellowships. The
technical assistance program would include the following (Table 3.3):

3.14    Evaluation.  A plan would be prepared by the Borrower, with technical
assistance provided by the project, for the establishment of an evaluation
system. The purpose of the evaluation system would be to assess the effective-
ness of the training activities provided at CAST, VTDI and IPCs and financed
under the proposed project. The activities to be carried out by the MOY and
CAST, which might be eventually undertaken or coordinated and monitored by
the projected National Industrial Training Board, would include evaluation
of the effect of training on both the trained technicians and workers and
the industrial firms which provide employment to the graduates of the project
institutions. A tracer system would be established for the trainees to
record their employment opportunities and progress.  During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances that plans for the evaluation of the outcomes
of each project institution, with special emphasis on the experimental work of
IPCs (para. 3.10), would be prepared by MOY and CAST and submitted to the Bank
for review and comment by December 31, 1982.
Pre-Investment Study on Primary Education Learning Materials (Proposed outlay:
US$0.3 million)
3.15      Previous experience in Jamaica has shown that a revised primary
school curriculum cannot be introduced effectively, and students achievements
suffer, without appropriate supporting learning materials. The project would
help correct the present lack of teaching materials by financing the development
of new textbooks and teachers' guides. The project would finance the salaries
of researchers, writers and evaluators of the learning materials and the
supplies required for their preparation, field testing and editing. A sample
of about 10 representative schools with about 30 students in each grade would
be used for a full school year for the testing of each textbook. Textbooks
and teachers' guides would be developed under the project as follows:
Table 3.4: Development of Learning Materials for Primary Education
Teachers' Guides                 Textbooks
Subject Area      No. of Titles       Grades      No. of Titles    Grades
Language                 1             1-6              3            4, 5, 6
Mathematics              1             1-6              3            3, .4, 5
Science                  1             1-6              3            3, 4, 5
Social Studies           1             1-6              3            3, 4, 5
Total               4                             12
The above work would provide a sound basis for producing essential learning
materials for primary education in the near future. It would be undertaken
by the Core Curriculum Unit of the Planning and Development Division of the
Ministry of Education. A condition of disbursement for this item would
be the submission to the Bank of a detailed work plan for its execution by
the Unit, including schedule of textbooks and teachers' guides to be prepared,
staffing plan, sampling, testing and revision procedures, and estimated costs.
The pre-investment study would also include a component for the preparation of
future educational projects.

4.02     Base costs.  Base costs are expressed in estimated prices as of May
1981. Costs of civil works are derived from bills of quantities, showing the
full detail of the scope of work required in the region. Due to difficult site
conditions, site development costs for VTDI and the IPC at Montego Bay would
amount to about 25% of the building cost as compared to about 7% of the cost
of construction for site works of the other project buildings. Furniture and
equipment costs are based on manufacturers' catalogues on itemized lists
prepared for each project institution.  Prices for furniture and equipment
reflect recent price increases and procurement costs. Services of specialists
to assist with international procurement are estimated at about 2% of the cost
of equipment and furniture. Specialist services and fellowships are estimated
at US$8,500-8,950 and US$2,200-2,300 per staff-month, respectively. The
cost of project administration is equivalent to about 5% of the total cost
excluding technical assistance. These costs include salaries of project
staff, liaison officers, local procurement consultants, and operational
expenditures of the project unit. In the case of professional (architectural
and engineering) services, about US$330,000 had been incurred up to May 1981
for the preparation of construction plans, specifications and tender documents.
These preparation costs are not included in the total project costs shown in
Table 4.1 and Annex 3. Costs of professional services incidental to the
updating of building plans to include recommendations by the appraisal mission,
finalization of the bid documents and supervision of construction would amount
to about US$300,000 or about 6.7% of the cost of civil works.
4.03      Contingency Allowances.  Physical and price contingencies have been
added to the base cost to determine project costs. Due to the advanced stage
of project preparation, the physical contingencies are expected to be low,
i.e., 5% for civil works, professional services, and project administration,
and 2.5% for furniture and equipment base costs.  No physical contingencies
are expected for expenditures for technical assistance, fellowships and the
preinvestment study. Price contingencies for the period of project implementa-
tion are estimated as follows:

- 21 -
Price contingencies for the project are applied over the total of the base costs
and physical contingencies, and based on the assumption that (a) construction
and procurement would start by the end of 1981; and (b) that the project would
be implemented over a period of three years.
4.04      Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange co.ponent of the
project is estimated at about US$6.8 million and represents about 60% of the
total project cost net of taxes. Foreign exchange costs have been calculated
at 40% for civil works; 70% for furniture; 95% for equipment, educational
materials, technical assistance and fellowships; 85% for the pre-investment
study; and 20% for project administration and professional fees.
4.05      Duties and Taxes.  Local import duties and taxes, estimated at about
15% of the cost of locally procured furniture, equipment and educational
materials and about 10% of the cost of locally procured building materials,
would amount to about US$0.40 million (including contingencies) and have been
deducted to determine the cost to be financed by the Bank. Educational equip-
ment, materials and furniture imported for the project would be exempted from
custom duties and taxes.
4.06      Recurrent Expenditures.  The total recurrent expenditure generated
by the project in 1984-85 is estimated at about J$2.3 million (at May 1981
prices), which is about 0.7% of the Government's total recurrent budget on
education in 1981/1982. This amount is not, therefore, expected to cause an
undue strain on the Government's resources. The cost of consumable materials
included in the project-generated recurrent costs is expected to be partly
met by the services rendered at the Industrial Production Centers (IPCs).
Project Financing and Disbursement Plan
4.07      Financing.  The net project cost of US$11.3 million would be
financed as follows:
(a) the proposed Bank loan of US$6.8 million would finance 100% of
foreign exchange costs or about 60% of total project cost;
(b) the Government would finance the remaining cost of US$4.5 million,
equivalent to 40% of total project cost.
4.08      Disbursement Plan.  Bank financing would be as follows:  educational
equipment, materials and furniture - 100% of foreign expenditures and 85% of
local expenditures; specialist services, fellowships and pre-investment study --
100% of total expenditures; professional fees and project administration -- 20%
of total expenditures; and civil works -- 35% of total expenditures. Financing
of civil works has been calculated at less than the estimated foreign exchange
component of this item to offset local cost financing in other categories (i.e.
local costs of technical assistance, the pre-investment study, and ex-factory
cost of locally manufactured furniture).
4.09      Retroactive financing up to US$100,000 is recommended to cover
expenditures incurred prior to loan signing for professional services,
technical assistance and project administration after May 31, 1981.
4.10      The estimated schedule of expenditures and disbursements by calendar
and fiscal years are:

1/   Expenditures are shared almost equally by MOE and MOY.
The above disbursement schedule exceeds substantially the average disbursement
performance of previous education projects in Jamaica (Loans 468-JM and
727-JM). This is justified by the advanced stage of preparation of the
project, the effective contribution to project preparation of the agencies
involved in its implementation, and the priority accorded to the project by
the Government. Difficulties were experienced under Loans 468-JM and 727-JM
in provision; of sufficient counterpart funds for timely implementation. A
projection of counterpart fund requirements by category and ministry over the
life of the project was discussed and agreed upon during negotiations with
the Jamaican authorities in order to avoid similar difficulties arising during
project implementation.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Administration
5.01      The implementation of civil works and the procurement of furniture
and equipment would be undertaken by the National Development Agency (NDA) on
behalf of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Youth (MOY).
The NDA, which comes under the administrative jurisdiction of the Ministry
of Finance, has already demonstrated its capacity for project work in the
implementation of the civil works of the Second Education Project (Loan 727-JM)
and in the preparation of the proposed project. The implementation of the
educational aspects of the project, including evaluation of tenders for
furniture and equipment, and the selection of education specialists and
candidates for fellowships, would be the responsibility of the MOE and MOY.
To ensure the necessary coordination between the two ministries and the NDA
for the timely execution of the project, each ministry has appointed a liaison
officer to work closely with the NDA.



- 23 -
Implementation Schedule
5.02     Status of Preparation.  The proposed project has reached an advanced
stage of preparation. About US$700,000 was made available from the loan
proceeds of the Second Education Project (Loan 727-JM) for the detailed
preparation of the proposed project. Except for the site of the IPC at Montego
Bay, the Government owns all project sites, and site surveys have already been
completed. The Government has selected an alternate site for the Montego Bay
IPC because the originally proposed site has undesirable soil conditions which
would necessitate expensive foundations.  Final architectural designs have been
prepared by consultants commissioned by NDA. The designs have been reviewed
by the Bank and approved with minor revisions. Lists of furniture and equip-
ment for all project items, prepared by working groups of the two ministries,
have been reviewed and approved by the Bank. Draft terms of reference for the
specialists have been discussed.
5.03      In view of the advanced state of project preparation the project is
expected to be implemented over a period of three years (CY1982-84). The
agreed implementation schedule (Annex 4) would be reviewed and updated on a
regular basis by NDA, and used as project implementation and monitoring tool.
The Government completed the following activities before negotiations:
(a) final site selection for the Montego Bay IPC;
(b) civil works' final designs, and tender and contractual documents;
(c) final furniture and equipment lists, and tender and contractual
documents;
(d) terms of reference of specialists, and identification of their
counterparts and of the first year's candidates for fellowships; and
(e) prequalification of civil works contractors.
Procurement
5.04     Construction contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised-locally, following the procedures used in the Second
Education Project (Loan 727-JM), and satisfactory to the Bank. Foreign
contractors are not expected to participate in the tenders, but they would
not be precluded from prequalifying and submitting bids.  A list of prequali-
fied contractors has been compiled and approved by the Bank. This list would
be updated as more firms are prequalified. Construction supervision would be
carried out by the consulting firms responsible for design as well as by the
NDA's project architect and engineers.
5.05     Contracts for furniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines for procurement. However, furniture and equipment that cannot
be grouped into packages of at least US$100,000 would be procured through
local competitive bidding procedures (LCB) which are acceptable to the Bank.
Furniture, equipment and materials which cannot be grouped into packages of at
least US$10,000 would be purchased by invitation of quotes up to an aggregate
maximum of US$100,000. Procurement under LCB is not expected, in the aggregate,



- 24 -
to exceed US$800,000 equivalent or about 20% of the total cost of furniture,
equipment and learning materials to be procured. Contracts for procurement of
furniture and equipment of less than US$50,000 would not require Bank approval
prior to the award of the contracts. In the case of procurement under ICB
procedures, domestic manufacturers would receive a margin of preference of 15%
of the CIF cost or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower. The
Government would inform the Bank before agreeing to material modification of
contracts which would involve an increase in the aggregate of 15% or more of
the original contract amount.
Maintenance
5.06      The Government provided assurances at negotiations that (a) mainte-
nance manuals for the upkeep of the buildings provided under the project would
be completed by NDA by the time each building is commissioned; (b) supervisors
for each project building would receive training in appropriate maintenance
techniques; and (c) a three-year budget proposal for maintenance of all project
institutions, endorsed by the Ministry of Finance, would be submitted to the
Bank for. comment by March 31, 1984.
Disbursements
5.07     In general, disbursements would be made against full documentation.
Requests for disbursements or reimbursements out of the loan account would be
prepared by each ministry separately and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance
which would transmit to the Bank these applications and receive the disbursements/
reimbursements from the Bank. Disbursements against small local expenditures
by invitation of quotes and purchases less than US$10,000, would be made against
statements of expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documentation would, however, be
retained and made available for review by visiting Bank missions. Disbursements
against SOEs would be made on the basis of a summary of quarterly expenditures;
in any case, SOEs would be aggregated to amounts not less than US$10,000 per
withdrawal. The two ministries would provide NDA with the funds required for
implementation out of their own special allocations.
Accounting and Auditing
5.08      The MOE, MOY and NDA, whose accounting systems are acceptable to the
Bank, would each keep separate accounts for the project. Expenditures incurred
for each project element, i.e., the CAST components, VDTI, and the two IPCs,
would be recorded separately to facilitate monitoring of project costs. A
quarterly summary of each account reflecting cumulative expenditures incurred
by the end of the quarter would accompany quarterly progress reports sent to
the Bank for information. During negotiations the Government provided assur-
ances that project accounts and statements of expenditure of the two ministries
would be audited annually by qualified independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank, and a certified copy of the annual audit report would be sent to the
Bank by September 30 of each year during project implementation.
Reporting and Monitoring
5.09     To ensure the timely completion of the project, the NDA, MOE and
MOY would monitor project activities shown in detail in the project imple-
mentation schedule (Annex 4), where the responsibilities of NDA and each



- 25 -
ministry are indicated. Reports of quarterly progress in each project
activity and on expenditures for each category (civil works, furniture,
equipment, technical assistance, etc.) would be sent to the Bank by NDA at
the end of each quarter. Information on the progress of the pre-investment
study (para 3.15) would be included in the report. The MOE liaison officer
would ensure that NDA is provided with this information for inclusion in the
quarterly progress report.
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      The project would lead to an overall improvement of the training
system in terms of expansion of output, quality and management, enabling it
to support more closely the Government's strategy for an export-oriented
economy. The project would increase the supply of skilled manpower in areas
which have a high multiplier effect. By training 1,500 technical teachers
under the project between 1985 and 1995, it is expected that by 1995 about
35,000 secondary students, in about equal numbers of males and females,
would receive considerably more skilled preparation for employment than
with untrained teachers as at present. The instructors trained by VTDI
in previously untaught fields would enable about 10,000 workers by 1995,
half of the workers in those trades, to improve their productivity and
employment prospects. The special training provided by IPCs is expected
to generate about 260 new jobs every year, improve incomes of graduates
and provide a basis for future expansion.
6.02      The project would also help strengthen the managerial capacity
of the training system. The National Industrial Training Board would
promote efficiency and help avoid duplication of effort in future elabora-
tion of the training system. Out-of-school populations--male and female
and in all parts of the country--are expected to benefit from the estab-
lishment of a Planning and Evaluation Division at MOY. The Division would
help ensure proper development of new youth training programs, such that
more youth can be trained with available resources.
Risks
6.03      A number of risks are foreseen.  First, complications might arise
because of the involvement of three separate institutions in project imple-
mentation. To avoid these complications, liaison officers have been appointed
by the client-ministries (MOE and MOY) to ensure necessary coordination with
NDA. The specific duties of each of the above agencies regarding the various
project implementation activities have been specified to help ensure prompt
and timely action. Second, the training programs and production activities
of IPCs might require adjustment and modification in light of their
experimental nature, experience with them and changing conditions. The
work of the IPCs would be closely monitored by the evaluation services
of the MOY and the Bank. Third, Jamaica suffers from a chronic shortage
of skills (para. 1.04) in part because outmigration contains a high propor-
tion of the educated and trained. The proposed project would increase the
supply of skills by providing much needed additional training facilities.



- 26 -
However, it is beyond the scope of the project to address the complex problem
of "brain drain," which causes continued attrition in the skilled labor
force. The full solution to the problem of chronic skill shortages depends
on matters outside the project, i.e., in the capacity of the Government
and business sector over the long run to create adequate incentives for a
sufficient number of skilled technical manpower to remain in Jamaica. Two
risks of a general nature, which have been experienced in previous Bank-
financed education projects in Jamaica, should be noted:  availability of
adequate teaching staff and counterpart funds. These matters were discussed
at negotiations and would be kept under careful scrutiny during implementation.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01    At negotiations, the Government and the Bank agreed on (a) a detailed
staff development plan, covering both recruitment and training, for the staff
required by the project institutions (para. 3.04); and (b) a detailed projec-
tion of counterpart fund requirements (para. 4.10).
7.02    During negotiations, the Government gave assurances on the following
matters: (a) establishment of the National Industrial Training Board
(para. 3.11); (b) plan for the evaluation of project outcomes (para. 3.14);
(c) preparation of maintenance manuals for buildings provided under the project,
training of maintenance supervisors, and a proposal for a maintenance budget of
all project institutions (para. 5.06); (d) annual audit of project accounts of
the MOE and the MOY by qualified independent auditors acceptable to the Bank,
and submission of the annual audit report to the Bank (para. 5.08); and
(e) acquisition of the alternate site for the Montego Bay IPC (para. 5.02).
7.03      A condition of disbursement for the pre-investment study would be
the submission to the Bank of a detailed work plan for the execution of the
study (para. 3.15).
7.04      Retroactive financing not exceeding US$100,000 is recommended
to cover expenditures incurred after May 31, 1981 and prior to loan signing
(para. 4.09).
7.05      In view of the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project
would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$6.8 million to the
Government of Jamaica for a term of 17 years and a grace period of 4 years.
