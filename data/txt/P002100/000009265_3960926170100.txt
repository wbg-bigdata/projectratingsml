MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATlON OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA FOR A SECOND MULTI-STATE
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a propoaed loan to
the Federal Republic of Nigeria for US$85.2 mllicn is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for 20 years, including five years of
grace at the standard variable intarest rate and would be used to support
statewide Agricultural Development Projects (ADPs) in four Nigerian States,
the Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute (ARMTI), and the
Federal Agricultural Coordinat4ng Unit (FACU).
2.        Background.  In 1986, The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN)
instituted a Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) which should lay the
foundation for sustained agricultural development in the 1990s. The
centerpiece of the SAP has been the four-fold devaluation of the Naira,
from N1-US$1 in 1986 to N4.3-US$1 by March 1988. The government's
agricultural policies are becoming increasingly market and private sector
oriented; and the government has begun to restructure irs expenditures with
a view to improving their productivity.
3.        Agricultural production has shown a favorable initial response to
the SAP, helped by favorable reinfall. T4hereas overall GDP (measured in
1977 prices) increased by 2.5% in 1986, aSricultural GDP increased by 9.1%,
adding to a 3.8% increase in 1985. In 1987, overall GDP is estimated to
have fallen by 5.3%, and agricultural GDP by 3%, largely on account of
drought.
4.        Sustained agricultural growth is constrained by a number of
transitional and institutional factors. In the short run, there is the
sudden shock of increased input prices for a technology package accepted by
farmers for over a decade. In the medium term, supply response is con-
strained by rigidities arising from entrenched and extensive market fail-
ure. Other medium-term constraints include: an ineffective national
research system with poor linkage with the weak extension system;
inadequate marketing infrastructure and information system; inadequate
public investment in the sector; and lack of technological packages with
strong incentives to change under the price regime. Long-run supply
constraints include environmental degradation, and the limited ability oi
states to rationalize their institutional structures, maintain rural
infrastructure and sustain the momentum in agricultural development without
external assistance.
5.        Bank-assisted projects have funded statewide ADPs for improving
agricultural extension, strengthening adaptive research, developing
small-scale private irrigation, ensuring adequate and timely input supply,
and building essential rural marketing infrastructure and basic rural water
supply. Through 1987, the Bank had committed US$1018.5 million in support
of ADPs in 15 of Nigeria's 21 states and the government has proceeded to
establish similar core programs and structures in all states, in



-2-
anticipation of continued Bank support. Lessons learnt from the completed
and on;oing ADPs have been incorporated in the design of the project.
6.        The recent report by the Operations Evaluations Department (OED)
to the Board on rural developsent 1/ specifically covered the Nigerian ADP
experience. The report recomended a flexible approach to project design
and implementation (so-called "process 4pproach"), which provides for
continual appraisal from identification through completion. It questions
Lhe merits of the rate of return calculation in ADPs, as an ilndicator of
project success, noting that economic rates of return (ERRs) may convey
wrong signals to project sponsors about early production benefits which may
not be reliably estimated or conflict with important objectives of
institution development.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project fits with the Bank's
sector assistance strategy, and is the first in a future series of ADPs
which directly aim to support the objectives of renewed agricultural growth
with progress on long-run sustainability of agricultural expenditures and
institutions. The Bank's continued involvement, both financially and in
the articulation of strategies outlined above, is crucial to forging a
consensus among state and federal officials for this strategy and to its
successful implementation.
8.        Project Objectives.  The project's i"in objectives are to:  (a)
improve effectiveness and sustainability of agricultural services; (b)
stimulate agricultural production by the predominantly smallholder
community; (c) upgrade rural access roads; (d) improve village water
supplies; (e) strengthen state rural cooperative credit institutions; (f)
improve the availability of tarm inputs; (g) support two programs (rural
credit and environmental resource management) needed in Bauchi State where
the current loan is fully committed; (i) strengthen the planning and
expenditure implementation capacity of state ministries of agriculture; (j)
continue Bank support to ARMTI to enable it to train a larger number of
local managers in the agricultural sector; and (k) strengthen FACU's
capacity to guide and supervise ADP rural infrastructure programs.
9.        Project Description.  The proposed project is designed to
strengthen the delivery system for agricultural services by: (a) unifying
the extension services, and fostering closer linkages between extension and
adaptive research; (b) extending the coverage and up-grading the capacity
of local governments and farmer organizations for maintenance of rural
infrastructure; (c) strengthening the institutional capacity for delivery
of rural credit and mobilizing savings; (d) strengthening the capacity of
the state MANRs for planning, policy formulation and expenditure program-
ming, and providing financial support for the implementation of an agreed
1/   World Bank Experience with Rural Development 1965-1986, OED Report No.
6883, October 1987



agricultural expenditure program and a number of institutional reforms; (e)
strengthening and extending ARMTI's curriculum, accommodations, out-reach
activities and revenue base; and (f) financing the recruitment of four
additional rural infrastructure engineers and consultants by FACU. The
project, to be carried out over a four year period, provides funds for
civil works, vehicles, equipment, irrigation works, agro-chemicals,
technical assistance, road maintenance works, initial operating expenses
for Cooperative Financing Agencies (CFAs), a US$1.6 million line of credit
to Bauchi CFA (one of the best-funetioning CFAs in Nigeria), a limited
amount of program financing of agreed development programs yet to be fully
appraised to eligible states meeting performance criter4a, and incremental
eperating costs for the ADPs. The total cost of the project is estimated
at US$125.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$85.2 million (68%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursements schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Nigeria are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7087 dated May 30, 1988,
is also attached.
10.       Agreed Actions.  The Federal Government and the States have
agreed with the Bank on the following key actions: (a) unification of the
extension services and redeployment of redundant staff who would not be
needed for the implementation of the project from the payrolls of the ADP
before loan effectiveness; (b) agreement with the Bank by each state during
the Mid-Term Review (expected in December 1990), on the composition of its
agricultural expenditure program and certain institutional reforms as a
condition for eligibility for financing agreed additional developmert
programs; (c) institution of a system of sponsored adaptive research for
priority research topics between the ADPs and the relevant national
research institutes, by June 30, 1989; (d) a pricing policy for improved
seed, animal drugs and vaccines, and agricultural inputs sold by
state-owned farm supply companies operating in the states; (e) institution
of a system of standard road maintenance contracts between the ADPs and
Local Government Councils (LGCs), and the phasing out of ADP force account
road maintenance units as the existing equipment becomes obsolete; (f)
beneficiary contribution to 10% of capital and operating costs of rural
water supply, and establishment of Water Users' Associations (WUAs) around
the minor irrigation structures for maintenance; and (g) a Review of
Agricultural Institutions, to be completed in each state before the
Mid-Term Review (December 31, 1990).
11.       Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from: (a) imiroved effectiveness of the extension and adaptive
research services; (b) reduced transport costs and increased availability
of rural labor supply; (c) increased agricultural production and productiv-
,ty; (d) improved efficiencies in planning and budgeting by the state
MANRs; (e) improved reliability in the availability and quality of seeds;
(f) improved capacity of CFAs to mobilize rural savings and appraise
agricultural loans; (g) improved efficiencies in the distribution of



- 4 -
agricultural inputs; (h) strengthened revenue capacity and curriculum of
ARMTI; and (1) strengthened capacity of FACU to supervise rural
infrastructure programs of ADPs. The assistance to Bauchi ADP and CFA
would concentrate on immediately supporting key programs of environmental
resource managerent (soil erosion control, conservation and agro-forestry)
and rural credit in order to maintain the impact of previous investments.
The ERRs are estimated at: 18X for the project, 482 for the small-scale
(fadama) irrigation component; and 8% for the rural water component. The
rural roads sub-program meets a minimum 15S ERP, as indicated by average
daily traffic counts on roads to be covered by the project. Each
irrigation, water. and roads sub-program will be seoparately appraised by
consultants during implementation. The project is expected to lead to an
annual increase of food production of 140,00C tons (of which 82,000 would
be grains) in the fourth year of implementation, assuming a 51 success
(adoption) rate of the extension message and constant relative prices. A
minimum adoption rate of 3% is required for the project tc meet an ERR of
12%.
12.       Risks.  The difficulties invoivad in efforts to streamline and
urnify the extension serv'ces pose the greeest risks to the project's
agricultural program. These risks are countered by training, developing a
wage incentive scheme to motivate extension officers, and by improving
their mobility. The primary risk of the rural inf'-a, 'ucture program would
be failure to maintain project investments in gold repa.r This risk is
minimized by project assistance to strengthen tk, 'sa l.y of LGCs (who
have the constitutional responsibility for rural -oads,  and selection of
beneficiary communities for water supply according e^,  .se willingness of
each community to contribute to maintenance and at least 10% of the capital
costs. A minimum capacity for maintenance is kept in the ADPs in case LGCs
take longer than expected to discharge their new role. The main risks to
the project's commercial services component is the slow response of the
private sector to take up the input supply functions. This risk is
minimized under the project bv providing direct assistance to private
retailers. With respect to I nger term institutional development, the
major risk is the possible slippage of the Review of Agricultural
Institutions and even slower implementatioi, of the Review's
recommendations. The risk is hoped to be miinimized by internalization of
the Review itself, which should strengthen the sense of ownership and
commitment to implementation by the states' highest authorities.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
