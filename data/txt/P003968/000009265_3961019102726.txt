MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A BOOK AND READING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$132.5 million to help
finance a Book and Reading Development Project. The loan would be at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace.
2.    Background. Despite universal primary education in Indonesia, achievements in
reading, mathematics and science education are low. Within schools, easy availability and
intensive use of quality textbooks and supplementary reading books are critical issues in this
process. The supply of textbooks, however, is generally limited. In the past, the Ministry
of Education and Culture (MOEC) has tried to remedy this situation through production
and distribution of Government textbooks. In recent years, the private book industry has
become more competent and aggressive in their marketing strategies, but the school book
market is still hampered by time-consuming and, thus, costly Government policies and
procedures. Government is aware of the issues and willing to take corrective measures as
described below.
3.    Sector Issues. The current book policy provision and use are affected by the
following:
(a)   Textbook Availability. Government published schoolbooks continue to be
in short supply and are unequally distributed among the schools. Textbook
quantities fluctuate with the availability of government funding, but, even
during years of relatively high budgetary allocations, funding has been only
about 20 percent of the amount needed to provide all students with
textbooks for each subject. MOEC's Book Center has been responsible for
producing government textbooks to all schools on a 1:4 basis, but specific
distribution to individual schools is decided at the provincial level, and is
often uneven. The logistics of book distribution to schools in remote islands
and isolated areas is a problem in itself. Lack of Government textbooks in
private schools and some public schools is partially compensated by
textbooks privately published.
(b)   Private/Public Sector Relationship.  Policy and regulatory issues for
schoolbooks have hampered the private book industry, particularly through a
cumbersome book approval mechanism. With the introduction of the Book
Center-produced and Bank-supported textbook schemes, private publishers
were initially left out, and suffered badly. As in most developing countries,
the book industry in Indonesia is primarily engaged in educational publishing.



-2 -
Of all books published in the country, 71 percent consists of textbooks
(60 percent private, and 11 percent Government  textbooks).  School
supplementary reading books (privately published, but Government-
approved and funded) account for a further 7.5 percent. The number,
printing capacity, and technical capability of publishers has improved
significantly in recent years. After approval by Government, privately
published textbooks are largely sold directly from the publisher to the school
or the teachers via an elaborate and far-reaching sales force. Whenever there
is a market for school textbooks, publishers and distributors have been able
to reach it.
(c)   Role of Government.  Although the role of Government in  book
production and distribution has been clarified in recent years, and private
publishers have been encouraged to produce and sell textbooks for school
use, Government institutions need strengthening in order to carry out their
policy coordination role. The National Book Development Council brings
together all of the major participants in book publishing, including private
publishers, but as an advisory body, it does not play a pro-active role.
Within MOEC, the Book Center, reporting to the Secretary General, is
responsible for all school book matters and is gradually moving from a book
publishing to a policy development and monitoring agency with gradual
success.  Overall, the interaction between public and private sector
institutions has been strengthened in recent years and has resulted in the
private sector publishing and public institutions growing and modernizing in
positive ways.
(d)   Textbook Use in Schools. Although efforts at upgrading the quality of
primary school teachers are now underway, many teachers have only limited
skills in using the textbooks and other reading materials in the classroom.
Even when textbooks are available in the class, they are often underutilized.
Activities to promote reading interest and to make students spend time
reading inside and outside of school are seldom undertaken or emphasized.
4.    Government Strategy. Government school book strategy has promoted textbook
distribution primarily through Government production and distribution of books to
approximately 25 percent of the primary school population. The recent Repelita VI (1994
through 1999) confirms the importance of books as an essential input for quality
improvement in school performance. This is to be accomplished primarily by Government
providing a much larger budget for textbooks used in schools and by changing its own role
from being the producer and distributor to focusing on quality control and monitoring,
while letting the private sector take care of a larger share of book production.
5.    Lessons Learned and Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank supported
two textbook development projects in Indonesia from 1973 to 1988. OED's PPAR on
these projects rate both of them as satisfactory. OED's findings and other relevant
documents and recent missions show that:



(a)   the private book industry must be allowed to play a major role in the
production and provision of schoolbooks. Eventually, all textbooks and
other school books should be published and distributed by private firms;
(b)   the policy and regulatory environment is an important restricting influence
on the production and distribution of school books. Unacceptable time lags
in approval processes and complicated regulations and processes drive
publishers' costs up unnecessarily; and
(c)   to make a substantial difference in the quality of primary education,
textbooks in at least the core subjects should be available to all primary
school children. Government should continue to ensure that sufficient budget
is available in the future to allow for program sustainability. The previously
supported Bank projects did report problems with sustainability of funding.
6.    These lessons have been incorporated in the project as follows:
(a)   private publishers will become the major suppliers of textbooks;
(b)  increased attention and resources will be given to the evaluation and
approval process of textbooks, reducing unnecessary time lags, while
ensuring higher-quality books; and
(c)   government is committed to provide the necessary budgets for textbooks in
the future, through streamlining and consolidating the existing budgets and
through transferring some of the existing funds for school construction to
textbooks.
7.    The rationale for Bank involvement in textbook provision in Indonesia is
consistent with the overall Bank strategy for Indonesia's economic and human resource
development, focusing on the priority of basic education. Bank assistance for schoolbooks
would complement ongoing assistance for the Second Secondary Education and
Management, Primary Education Quality Improvement, and Primary School Teacher
Development Projects. Support for a better and larger book industry and availability of
good quality educational books would provide an essential element for primary education
quality improvement. Lessons from previous projects show that the Bank should assist the
Government of Indonesia to coordinate and finance the provision of good textbooks but not
to be a textbook publisher and textbook manufacturer.
8.    The Book and Reading Development Project supports the Bank's 1995 CAS which
was presented to the Board on March 21, 1995. It supports the emphasis on the
importance of quality in education, especially of basic education. Poor children will be
ensured of having the necessary educational materials they cannot afford. The project also
supports regional development, by placing textbook purchasing decision-making in the
hands of the provinces. Competitive procurement from private sector publishers fosters the
direction for increased privatization. The Bank's comparative advantage in textbook



-4 -
provision lies in its systematic overview and support of basic education, its complementarity
with ongoing and future projects in primary and secondary education-ncluding previous
textbook projects-and its global expertise with textbook production and distribution.
9.    Project Objectives. The project aims to improve the quality of education for
primary and junior secondary school children. In particular, the project would be expected
to contribute to improving the production and distribution of more and better quality
textbooks, their increased availability in the classrooms, and their increased use by teachers
in implementing the curriculum. These supply and demand objectives would be achieved by
assisting in the implementation of a textbook provision and distribution system to all
elementary and junior secondary school children on a sustainable basis; giving help to
teachers in how to use the books better in the classroom; and motivate and promote reading
habits among children. The efforts would be fully in line with the Government's inter-
sectoral objectives of deregulation, and decentralization, as well as increased privatization.
They also support the Government's intentions in Repelita VI, to improve the quality of
basic education.
10.   Project Description and Costs. The project will accomplish three major policy
changes with regard to textbooks: (i) the provision of textbooks to all students in all
subjects in all schools; (ii) the transfer of textbook production from the Government to the
private sector; and (iii) the selection and purchasing of textbooks at the provincial level.
11.   Apart from project management and monitoring and evaluation (US$13.8 million
base costs), the project would have three components as follows:
(a)   Improving Textbook Availability and Quality (US$294.4 million base
costs). About 250 million textbooks would be provided to primary (SD) and
junior secondary (SLTP) students in all schools on a 1:1 basis in all subjects.
During the project period, SD textbooks would be provided with
Government funds, while Bank loan funds would be largely (75 percent)
responsible for provision of SLTP textbooks. Selection for SLTP books
would be done through an improved approval process. The project would
also delegate the purchase of textbooks to the educational authorities at the
provincial level. During the project, the Government Book Center would
take on new functions as the Government body responsible for setting and
maintaining quality control standards for the educational publishing industry
and would substantially phase out its involvement in physical textbook
production.
(b)  Reading Promotion (US$5.5 million base costs). The promotion of reading
would be supported through media campaigns, and training for authors,
translators, editors, and other book industry specialists nationwide.
(c)   Teacher Education (US$1.2 million base costs). A series of video and
radio programs would be developed for in-service teachers, to assist them in
making better and more intensive use of textbooks and in improving the



teaching of reading, to be broadcast through the educational channels and to
be distributed in cassette.
12.   Project Impleentation.  The Director General for Primaiy and Secondary
Education (DGPSE) would be responsible for overall management of the project, with the
advice of the National Book Development Council. Implementation would be carried out
by the Book Center and project implementation units in all provinces for textbook
procurement and distribution. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 14016-IND
dated May 1, 1995, is being distributed separately.
13.   Project Sustainability. At the end of this project, GOI will need to continue to
provide textbooks on an ongoing basis, with a replacement every four years. To accomplish
this, the GOI budget allocation for textbooks during the project period will need to increase
from the current Rp 75 billion to an annual Rp 180 billion by FY2000/01. GOI has
indicated the feasibility and willingness to make these funds available on an increasing basis.
The procurement procedures, through technical assistance and necessary training,
established during the project would be firmly in place for further continuation after project
completion.
14.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the Government agreed to the following:
(a)   establishment of the National Textbook Evaluation Committee (NTEC) for
textbooks in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, not
later than October 1, 1995;
(b)   terms of reference for monitoring and evaluation activities to be prepared
and submitted to the Bank not later than October 1, 1995;
(c)   establishment and maintenance of the PMU with assigned responsibilities,
and of the Book Center PIU starting not later than October 1, 1995;
(d)   establishment of PLUs in all provinces, including related consultants'
services, and of procurement committees in each province by November 30,
1995;
(e)   mid-term review to be carried out, together with the Bank by March 31,
1998; and
(g)   technical audits of Project implementation to be carried out by April 1 in
each year, starting with April 1, 1997 (except for the mid-term and final
year).

15.   Environmental Aspects. The environmental impact of the project is expected to be
neutral (Class C). There are no civil works under the project.
16.  Benefits  Successful implementation of the project would result in increased
availability, improved quality, and greater use of textbooks for basic education. The
ultimate benefit would be increased educational quality and improvements in literacy in
schools. The immediate benefits would be quality enhancement of textbooks, increased
access to textbooks by all students, and stronger private sector book production in general
and of school books in particular. The project would provide a total of 250 million
textbooks, and will result in a major revision of the school book production and distribution
system. The latter alone is already of major benefit to the more rapid development of the
private book industry.
17.   Investment in textbooks in other countries has shown, through a substantial research
body, that improvements in quality are substantial, while textbooks generally represent only
a small proportion of the education budget (in Indonesia, 4 percent of the primary education
budget). Overall, investments in primary and secondary education achieve high social rates
of return, by comparison to other education inputs. The continuing provision of textbooks
will have a substantial quality benefit, at a relatively low cost. Other benefits are the
increase in private sector involvement and the purchase of books in large series, which
should result in a reduction in book prices, estimated at 20 percent.
18.   Risks. The project would be exposed to some risks, but those seem manageable.
(a)   There is strong Government commitment on the policy to provide complete
coverage of textbooks to all students, and to allocate sufficient budget to
become fully sustainable after project completion. The budget amount
currently allocated for SD school construction would be partly transferred to
allow procurement of textbooks, ensuring long-term sustainability.
(b)   Procurement procedures and involvement from the private sector will
require a great deal of adjustment, while improving textbook quality. The
procedures that will be followed provide for adequate quality control at the
national level, through a National Textbook Evaluation Committee.
Sufficient competition in the bidding process will also result in lower prices
for the textbooks.
(c)   The decentralization of procurement to the provincial level will require the
acquisition of skills and expertise in the provincial MOEC offices (Kanwil)
that currently may not exist or be inadequate. Kanwil offices will be
supported throughout the project period with technical assistance, to ensure
that provincial staff become capable in carrying out their new functions.



19.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
