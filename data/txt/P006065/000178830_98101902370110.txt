VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
BORROWER:     The Bahamas
t              Amount:        US$7.0 million equivalent.
Terms:        Payable in 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years at 9.6%
interest per annum.
Project
Description:  The project supports the Government's major objectives in voca-
tional and technical education, which are to improve the rele-
vancy of the system to the Bahamian priorities and needs, to
increase the number and quality of graduates and to strengthen
its institutional capacity.  It aims to achieve these through
the following means:
(i)   Development and improvement of relevant vocational and
technical programs and training and upgrading of tech-
nical teachers;
(ii)  expansion of the training capacity of the country's voca-
tional and technical institutions; and
(iii) assistance in the establishment and operation of a
National Industrial Training Council and the strength-
ening of the planning, evaluation, curriculum preparation
and supervisory *functions of the Ministry of Education
and Culture.
The project consists of:
(a)   refurbishing the Soldier Road Campus of the College of
The Bahamas in Nassau to create an Industrial Training
Center (ITC).  The ITC will provide 400 training places
for skills in craft, clerical and allied trades.
(b)   establishing new workshops and refurbishing existing ones
for four high schools in New Providence and eight on the
Family Islands to introduce technical courses responding
to local needs and requirements;
(c)   constructing and equipping an extension to the College of
The Bahamas at Oakes Field Campus in Nassau to establish
(i) a Division of Technical Studies, offering 200 places
for  post-secondary  school  technician  work,  (ii)  a
Division of Business and Administration Studies, offering
200 places for post-secondary commercial education, and

- ii -
(iii) a Technical Teacher Education Unit providing about
50 places for the pre-service and in-service training of
teachers to give technical courses in the high schools;
(d)   providing relevant facilities and equipment for about 330
places in the Hotel Training College to enable it to res-
pond effectively to the country's tourism development
plan;
(e)   providing facilities, and equipment for the Department of
Nursing Education for 180 training places for the training
of nurses in areas most relevant to the population needs;
and
(f)   financing specialist services (75 man-months) and fellow-
ships (489 man-months) related to the foregoing areas.
The project entails no special risks except perhaps that delays
may occur because of the complexity of the project and lack of
experience in The Bahamas to execute it. Hiring of experts and
close supervision by the Bank at the initial stage are expected
to minimize these risks.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE BAHAMAS
FOR A VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
for the equivalent of US$7.0 million to The Bahamas for a vocational and
technical education project. The loan would have a term of 15 years, includ-
ing 3 years of grace, with interest at 9.6% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report (Economic Memorandum on The Bahamas, Report No.
2975-BM, dated June 2, 1980) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
June 4, 1980. Annex 1 contains the basic country data.
Background
3.        The Bahamas economy is structured around its vast tourism resources
and its attractiveness as an international financial center.   The natural
beauty of its beaches and waters, and proximity to Florida, make it an attrac-
tive vacation spot for large numbers of North American tourists.  In recent
years, favorable movements in exchange rates (the Bahamian dollar is at a par
with the US dollar) have also attracted increasing numbers of European tour-
ists to its shores. Absence of most forms of direct taxation, a minimum of
regulation on offshore financial business, and the location of The Bahamas in
the same time zone as New York, gave the country an advantage over other
Eurocurrency centers for offshore banking. Chiefly as a result of these two
activities, an historically open attitude toward foreign private investment,
and political stability, the coantry attained a high per capita income rela-
tive to the rest of the Caribbean (about US$2,800 in 1979). Nevertheless, the
vast geographic dispersion of the Bahama islands, the rapid population
growth, in part the result of a steady influx of immigrants, and the heavy
concentration of the population on the island of New Providence, constitute
challenging development problems for the authorities.
Recent Economic Developments
4.        A high rate of foreign private investment generated rapid economic
growth during the 1960s,  averaging in excess of 9% per year.   The very
character of this development (services directly and indirectly account for
over 75% of GDP) determined that expatriates had a large role in the economy.
By the mid-1970s expatriates accounted for some 14-15% of the labor force, and
occupied top positions in tourism, banking and related services as well as in
the relatively large scale industrial enterprises established on Grand Bahama
island during the 1960s.  In an attempt to secure more of the benefits from
growth for Bahamian nationals, the Government introduced a system of work
permits for expatriates, with fees graduated according to skill level, as a
means of encouraging foreign firms to hire and train Bahamians.



- 2 -
5.        The 1970's saw a slowdown in economic activity as the construction
boom of the 1960s came to an end and economic recession in the United States,
the main tourist generating country,  reduced the flow of visitors.   Slow
growth resulted in increasing unemployment with the highest rates concen-
trated in the 14-24 age group.   The economy rebounded sharply in 1978/79
spurred by a resurgence of tourism and construction activity.  The upswing
highlighted the structural character of the unemployment problem. The con-
struction sector encountered shortages of skilled craftsmen, and while the
overall unemployment rate declined with the improvement in economic growth,
unemployment persisted at high levels in the younger age groups.   These
developments indicate the need to reorient the education system in order to
equip school leavers with marketable skills and to prepare Bahamians to assume
the specialized positions often held by expatriates. In carrying this out,
the Government is especially interested in benefiting from the wide
experience the Bank has had in this area.
Development Strategy and the Public Sector Investment Program
6.        Because of the country's natural advantages in tourism and the
labor intensity of tourism activities, a key element of the Government's deve-
lopment strategy is aimed at maintaining growth in tourism.  The Government
also intends to exploit further the agricultural potential of the islands both
to establish linkages with tourism and to reduce the country's heavy reliance
on imported foods. At the same time by directing more economic activities
away from New Providence, the Government expects to accelerate development of
the outlying less advanced members of the Family Islands. In the process, the
Government is addressing the issue of better preparing Bahamians for
positions of skill and management responsibility in the various sectors of the
economy.
7.        In light of these objectives, the public sector investment program
for the period 1980 to 1984 gives priority to expansion of economic infra-
structure needed to sustain tourism growth, and to support for directly pro-
ductive activities in agriculture and small scale industry, with emphasis on
the regional dispersion of economic activity. Accordingly, the program pro-
vides for tourism and agricultural projects in the Family islands, including
infrastructure development such as land preparation, irrigation and marketing
facilities.  A fuel conservation project to be executed by the Electricity
Corporation, is expected to generate substantial savings in fuel costs. New
equipment for Bahamasair and an interisland transportation project, are other
projects of central importance to the development of the economy in the medium
term.   In the education  sector,  the vocational  training  project  to be
supported by the proposed loan is given high priority. Finally, to alleviate
congestion, pollution and insufficient public services to low-income sections
of Nassau, the Government intends to seek the assistance of the Bank for an
urban development project.
Financing Public Sector Investment
8.        Financing  the  public  sector  investment  program,  envisaged  to
average 6% of GDP through 1984, is expected to present no serious problems.
The Government has exercised prudence in its fiscal management in the past. A
system of central control has kept current expenditures nearly in line with
budgeted amounts.   Rapid revenue gains associated with the strong economic
recovery in 1978 and 1979 together with expenditure restraint, improved the
Central Government current account, and tariff increases combined with
expanded and more efficient operations improved the financial performance of



the major public corporations. As a consequence, public sector savings which
averaged 3% of GDP in the slack years of 1975-77 rose to 5% and 7% in 1978 and
1979 respectively.
9.        There are good reasons for expecting continued fiscal prudence.
The Government in 1980 implemented a four-year old proposal for a business
license fee that is expected to yield about B$5 million annually.  Also in
1980 the Government completed an agreement with The Bahamas Oil Refinery
Company, which is expected to produce in excess of B$10 million annually in
fees.  These additional revenue sources will help the Government to finance
the new social programs, announced a year ago, for improving the condition of
the low income population.   Provided  such expenditures are contained at
manageable levels in future years, the overall fiscal management of the
Central Government continues to be sound and the savings of the public corpo-
rations in aggregate continue their favorable trends, public sector savings
could average 6% of GDP through 1984 and financing of the public sector
investment program should have to depend only minimally, as in the past, on
external borrowing.   The Government plans to obtain most of this limited
borrowing from the multilateral development institutions, mainly because of
the benefits that the country would receive from the technical assistance
provided by these institutions during the preparation and execution of devel-
opment projects financed by them.
Growth Prospects
10.       The performance of The Bahamas economy--growth, fiscal and balance
of payments--is closely related to tourism, which directly and indirectly
accounts for some 70% of GNP. Therefore, the economy is highly vulnerable to
adverse developments in the world economy, particularly in the United States.
11.       Preliminary data for the first three quarters of 1980 indicate an 8%
growth in tourism traffic compared with the same period a year ago. This is
strong performance, coming on top of the rapid recovery of the industry during
1978 and 1979. However, a further decline of economic activity in the United
States would be likely to alter this trend.   Moreover,  if tourism demand
continues to expand at the current rate, the industry could be expected to
encounter supply constraints in the early 1980s primarily in visitor accom-
modations in New Providence and Grand Bahama.   Chiefly on account of these
factors, a moderate short run GNP growth projection of 4% seems to be realis-
tic.   However,  provided the development program is executed  in a timely
fashion, and Government policies toward private sector investment continue to
be favorable, the expanded facilities warranted in the medium term by expected
tourism demand would be in place, and constraints to a higher rate of growth
would be removed. Government initiatives in 1980 augur well for the achieve-
ment of these conditions.  Concerning tourism, the Government resumed in late
1980 the approval of land acquisition by foreigners, thus removing one key
obstacle that briefly curtailed the inflow of private capital for tourism-
related real estate development.
Balance of Payments and External Debt
12.       The balance of payments derives- its basic strength from the large
tourism sector. The current account has registered surpluses averaging 8% of
GDP since the mid-1970s, a period which has seen sharply reduced investment



- 4 -
and related imports. For the medium term, the projected increase in tourism
capacity and other infrastructure implies a stepped-up rate of investment.
The increase in related imports and in world petroleum prices projected from
1980-84 could result in small current account deficits in the balance of
payments. The Government has adopted an energy strategy, the main thrust of
which is to promote fuel conservation through a policy of price pass-throughs.
Provided that the proposed fuel conservation project of the Electricity
Corporation is effectively carried out, and given continued adoption of other
conservation measures, the adverse impact of fuel price increases on the
balance of payments is expected to be manageable.  Investment-related capital
inflows can be expected to finance such current account deficits.
13.       The external public and publicly guaranteed debt outstanding and
disbursed at the end of 1979 was US$97 million, roughly equivalent to 12% of
GDP. Service payments on this debt amounted to approximately US$33 million,
or 3.5% of non-oil exports of goods and non-factor services.   Since the
external borrowing requirements to finance the public sector investment pro-
gram are likely to be marginal, the debt service ratio is not expected to
increase. Provided that economic growth materializes as projected, and that
the Government's policies affecting private investment continue to be favor-
able, and that public finances continue to be arranged in a sound manner, The
Bahamas may be regarded as creditworthy for borrowing on conventional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE BAHAMAS
14.       The Bahamas became a Bank member in 1975.  The proposed vocational
and technical education project would be the Bank's second lending operation
to the Bahamas. The first Bank loan for US$10.0 million was for a water and
sewerage project; it was approved by the Executive Directors on July 27, 1976.
In addition, The Bahamas has benefited from the Bank's lending to the
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). So far, a loan of US$2.3 million from IBRD
resources has been made by the CDB to The Bahamas, for a DFC operation.
15.       The Bank has maintained a continuing dialogue with the Government
on its economic policies and development priorities.  Under the auspices of
the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development, the Bank has
convened informal meetings of multilateral donors to discuss the financial
and technical assistance needs of The Bahamas.   At these meetings, donors
expressed substantial interest in financing specific priority projects and in
providing technical asssistance to this country.
16.       In the future, the Bank's lending to The Bahamas, either directly or
indirectly through the CDB, is expected to be mainly towards projects for the
urban rehabilitation of Nassau and in the agricultural sector. This would be
in line with the Government's policy to improve the living conditions of the
urban poor and to reduce the mounting bill of imported food while satisfying
the needs of the local population and tourism sector.
17.       It is estimated that by 1984 the Bank's share in The Bahamas' public
external debt outstanding and disbursed will be about 8%. The Bank's share in
the external public debt service will also be about 7%.

PART III - THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
Overview of the Education and Training Sector
18.       The Bahamas has a strong system of general education.  Virtually all
children (95%), are enrolled through the first nine years of primary and
secondary education and almost two-thirds of those eligible attend senior
high school.   The quality,  in general,  is good.   A high proportion of
teachers, 86%, are qualified. There is no disparity between male and female
enrollments, and teacher to student ratios, mainly due to the scattered popu-
lation of the Family Islands, are low (1:24 in primary and 1:19 in secondary
eduication). However, in contrast with general education, technical education
and training has traditionally been neglected.
Vocational/Technical Education and Training
19.       Major issues facing the education system concerning vocational/-
technical education and training are:   the output is below labor market
demands; its quality needs improvement; and, it requires better management
and coordination with the private sector. At present, the country is strongly
dependent on non-Bahamian  skilled labor which amounts to about 14% of the
total labor force and holds most of the higher level posts. Until recently,
high school education was based upon a uniform curriculum, which did not
provide for any technical  specialization at that level.   A comprehensive
approach to senior high school education was introduced in 1976, including a
common core curriculum and optional subjects in business, agriculture,
health, home economics, and in technical subjects such as technical drawing,
electronics and electrical installations.  Also it was as recently as 1973
when the three higher institutions of the country, which offer technical and
vocational courses--The College of The Bahamas, the Hotel Training College
and the Department of Nursing Education--were established.
20.       (a) Output of technical/vocational institutions.  The main insti-
tutions training manpower are the senior high schools (lower technicians),
the College of The Bahamas (business and industrial craftsmen and tech-
nicians), the Hotel Training CDllege (technicians in the hotel industry) and
the Department of Nursing Education (technicians in health services). With
the exception of the senior high schools, which have adequate numbers of
students but not adequate facilities for the effective implementation of
lower technician training, the institutions have neither the facilities nor
the number  of  trainees  required by the country's manpower needs.   For
*         instance, the 1979 output of craftsmen and technicians of the latter institu-
tions was about 400, while the average annual demand for these skilled per-
sonnel is estimated at about 1,000.
21.       (b) Quality of Technical Vocational Education and Training.  Sub-
stantial improvement in the quality of the vocational and technical education
system is urgently needed.  No training standards and trade tests have been
developed for the craft courses of the College of The Bahamas and the prepara-
tion of guidelines for the teaching of technical subjects in the high schools
is proceeding slowly as a result of  lack of adequate personnel  in the
Curriculum Unit of the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, there is a short-
age of local qualified personnel and a short supply of equipment and library
books on technical/vocational subjects in all the institutions.



-6-
22.        (c) Management and institutional capacity of the technical/voca-
tional system.   The Ministry of Education and Culture has two units,  the
Planning Unit and the Education Unit, which are involved in the development
and administration of the technical/vocational education system. Both units
are short-staffed and cannot meet the increasing demands of the system. For
instance, because of the absence of a manpower data base system, the Planning
Unit is not able to make any technical/vocational manpower projections. The
Evaluation Unit, consisting of only one qualified staff member, is not
involved in any activities related to technical/vocational problems. Super-
vision of technical subjects is provided by staff who are also involved in
curriculum development, as well as in administrative matters. In 1979, as an
initial step to organize the vocational training system on a new basis, the
Government set up an interim Industrial Training Council, with represen-
tatives from the Ministries of Education, Labor and the private sector, to
take responsibility for the industrial training courses at the Soldier Road
campus of the College of The Bahamas for the training and upgrading of skilled
workers. Under the Project, this interim arrangement will lead shortly to the
establishment of a permanent National Industrial Training Council (NITC),
responsible for all industrial training, and upgrading courses in the country
(para. 28). This permanent Council would be jointly financed by Government
and the Private Sector.
Government Sector Policy and Strategy
23.       The overall educational policy objective of the Government is the
development of a national school system oriented towards the country's deve-
lopmental needs and objectives. This would be achieved through the develop-
ment of a technical/vocational education system to adequately serve the man-
power requirements of the country, by increasing its output, improving its
quality and strengthening its institutional capacity.
Bank's Role in the Technical/Vocational Education and Training
24.       The proposed project is a major undertaking by the Government in the
education sector. The Bank has already played an important role in assisting
the Government in the formulation and the preparation of the project.   By
making a relatively modest financial contribution to the project the Bank
could further assist the Government in dealing with a variety of technical,
organizational and institutional improvements and with policy changes in the
technical/vocational system.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       A report entitled "The Bahamas - Staff Appraisal Report on a Voca-
tional and Technical Education Project" (No. 3217a-BM, dated Mach 2, 1981) is
being distributed separately. Annex III contains a timetable of key events in
processing the project and a description of the special conditions of the
proposed loan. Negotiations for the proposed loan took place in Washington,
D.C., on February 9-12, 1981. The Bahamian delegation was led by Mr. Stafford
Gomez, Deputy Financial Secretary of The Bahamas.

Project Objectives and Description
26.       The proposed project supports the Government's major objectives in
vocational and technical education (para. 23). The project would consist of:
(a) Construction, equipping and furnishing of: (i) the Industrial
Training Center; (ii) workshops and laboratories in senior high
schools; (iii) the College of The Bahamas' Divisions of Applied
Science, Technical Studies, and Business and Administration
Studies, as well as its Technical Teacher Education Unit and
Library/Learning Resource Center; (iv) the Hotel Training
College; and (v) the Department of Nursing Education;
(b) establishment of a national manpower data base system; and
(c) provision of technical assistance comprising 75 man-months of
specialist services and 489 man-months of fellowships to devel-
op relevant curricula and to train teachers in technical/voca-
tional education.
27.       The Industrial Training Center.  This component would convert the
Soldier Road campus of the College of The Bahamas, currently used by the
Divisions of Applied Science, Technical Studies and Business and Adminis-
tration Studies, into the Industrial Training Center (ITC). Classrooms would
be converted into workshops and a learning resource unit, and existing work-
shops would be refurbished to support an industrial training program.  Four
hundred trainee places would be made available for short (3-6 months) and
longer (12-18 months) craftsman skill training courses allocated to various
occupations, on the basis of national manpower requirements as follows:
industrial and construction trades, 280; secretarial and office arts, 60; and
others,  60.  With day and evening courses, the ITC would train about 500
craftsmen per year.   The ITC would be open to graduates of junior high
schools, as well as out-of-school youth and adults who are unemployed or wish
to upgrade their skills. No tuition would be charged, and stipends would be
used to attract trainees.   A total of 23 additional instructors would be
needed for its operation. The National Industrial Training Council would be
responsible for hiring the additional instructors.  Appropriate training of
10 local instructors for the ITC is provided under the project.
28.       The ITC is to be eventually administered by the proposed National
Industrial Training Council (NITC) which would replace the Interim Industrial
Training Council. The NITC would include representatives of the Government,
industry and trade unions, and would be financed jointly by the Government and
industry.   In addition to administering the ITC it would provide extension
arrangements for craft training evening courses in the senior high schools for
out-of-school youth and adults, it would serve as a forum for general discus-
sion of training matters, and would help coordinate skill training throughout
The Bahamas. The Government has agreed to establish by June 30, 1982 the NITC
and to establish by December 31, 1982 a monitoring and evaluation system for
assessing annually the effectiveness and impact of the training programs
administered by the NITC. It has also agreed to make available to the Bank,
for review and comments, during the project period, annual evaluation reports
of the NITC's training activities (Section 3.03 of the Loan Agreement).

29.       Senior High Schools.   This component would provide 14 new and 5
refurbished workshops and science/food laboratories, and learning materials
to 12 senior high schools for a total of about 285 student places to enable
them to implement effectively their technical education program.   When the
facilities are completed, about 750 students would be able to take industrial
courses, with an annual output of some 300 students. Such training would lay
the foundation for further studies in technology and science at the higher
level; however, many students would attain a skill level which would be
sufficient for employment upon graduation. These schools would also conduct
craftsman training courses in the evening through extension arrangements to
be made by the NITC. Four of these schools are in New Providence and eight in
the Family Islands. They have been selected on the basis of their size and
existing facilities, local manpower requirements, and regional equity. Nine
additional teachers would be required for this program. They would initially
be trained in the Technical Teacher Education Unit of The College of The
Bahamas to be established under the project and would receive regular in-
service training.  The curricula for the technical courses would be further
developed by the Curriculum Development Unit under the Office of the Director
of Education with technical assistance to be provided under the project.
30.       The College of The Bahamas (COB).  The Divisions of Applied Science,
Technical Studies, and Business and Administration Studies of the COB would be
transferred from the Soldier Road campus to the Oakes Field campus.   The
transfer of these divisions would enable the COB to integrate all its activi-
ties into one campus, realizing economies of scale in the offering of courses
and the use of facilities.   This transfer would require the construction,
equipping and furnishing of new classrooms, workshops, laboratories and other
ancillary facilities at the Oakes Field campus. The new Applied Science/Tech-
nical Division would offer 4-semester, post-secondary programs and produce
about  90 technicians  annually.    Students  not meeting  standard  entrance
requirements would be able to take a 2-semester, preparatory course. The 21
teachers who would transfer from the Soldier Road campus would be sufficient
for the new courses. Curricula would be upgraded by the faculty, but special-
ists and fellowships provided under the project would assist in the curriculum
development of electrical and mechanical technology.   The new Division of
Business and Administration Studies would provide about 200 student places,
which would permit an annual output of about 100 middle-level graduates. This
output is expected to be adequate to meet the country's needs in accounting,
banking and finance, marketing and management, data processing and business
economics areas. Three additional teachers would be required for the Division
of Business and Administration Studies.
31.       In addition,  a Technical Teachers Education Unit will be estab-
lished at the C.O.B.  This Unit would annually produce about 15 technical
junior and senior high school teachers, which would meet annual requirements.
The program would consist of three years of training. Provisional admissions
would be made for those who do not meet the requirements and wish to take
preparatory courses.   In collaboration with the Divisions of Education and
Technical Studies, i.e., utilizing their shops, laboratories and teaching
staffs, the Unit would organize its courses, which would include in-service
training arrangements.
32.       The  project  would  also  provide  for a central  Library/Learning
Resource Center which will support all the programs of the COB.

33.       The Hotel Training College.  This component would provide for the
construction and refurbishing of classrooms and practical teaching facilities
at the New Providence campus and equip the teaching facilities at the Grand
Bahama campus. This would enable the College at New Providence to expand its
fulltime enrollment capacity by 60, i.e., from 60 to 90 students for the 2-
year diploma course, and by 30 students for a new one-year post-diploma
course. The College would be able, through day and evening courses, to offer
23 different programs for 330 full-time students and on part-time basis for
about 100 more students. It will continue organizing industry-based courses
for about 1,000 persons every year. The Grand Bahama campus would continue to
operate mainly industry-based courses. At present 18 teachers are working at
both campuses. Nine additional teachers are required for the New Providence
campus and two for the Grand Bahama campus.  The College would continue to
meet its operating costs through equally shared financing by Government and
the Private Sector.
34.       Department of Nursing Education.   The project would provide for
replacement of the facilities for the Department of Nursing Education to
improve its teaching program with modern workshops, laboratories and equip-
ment and to increase its enrollment from about 180 to about 240 trainees--180
trainees for basic nursing courses (registered and clinical nursing) and 60
trainees for advanced nursing (community, midwifery and psychiatric) and
other upgrading courses.  In addition to the 17-member teaching staff, 2 new
members would be needed to serve the increased enrollment.
35.       National Manpower Data Base System.  This component would assist
the Government to establish a national manpower data base system to enable it
to estimate and project the technical/vocational needs of the country.  It
would finance (a) installation of appropriate software on the Ministry of
Finance computer and training of staff in its use; (b) institution of a master
data file on computer through utilization of registration information
compiled by the National Insurance Board (NIB); and (c) implementation of
procedures for annually updating the master file.
36.       Technical Assistance.  The project would finance the equivalent of
75 man-months of specialist services and 489 man-months of fellowships in
support of the project components as follows: (a) Specialist Services: (i)
to assist the Government in the organization and management of the National
Industrial Training Council; (ii) to advise the College of The Bahamas in
curriculum development, teaching technology, measurement/evaluation, and
maintenance procedures; and (iii) to assist the Hotel Training College in the
curriculum development for the advanced management program.  (b) Fellowships:
(i) to upgrade teachers of senior high schools, the Industrial Training
Center, the College of The Bahamas, the Hotel Training College, and the
*            Department  of Education; and (ii) to train the staff of the Ministry of
Education in education planning, curriculum development, education evalua-
tion, and learning resource center activities. The Government agreed that all
specialists, their terms of reference and conditions of employment would be
acceptable to the Bank, and that candidates for the fellowship programs would
be selected and placed following criteria and procedures acceptable to the
Bank (Section 3.04 of Loan Agreement).

Cost Estimates and Financing Arrangements
37.       The total project cost is estimated at US$18.4 million and is exempt
from taxes. It includes physical contingencies of US$1.44 million and price
contingencies of US$5.32 million.   Specialist services are costed at about
US$6,000 per man-month, and fellowships at US$1,550 per man-month.  Project
management costs are calculated at US$0.6 million. The proposed Bank loan of
US$7.0 million, equivalent to 38% of the project cost, would finance 57% of
the foreign exchange component. The balance of project costs would be borne
by the Government.
38.       Recurrent expenditures generated by the project in 1985 are esti-
mated at B$1.5 million (at 1980 prices) which is about 2.9% of the
Government's total recurrent education budget in 1980. This level would not
create a substantial burden on Government recurrent expenditures. The cost of
consumable materials included in the project-generated recurrent costs is
expected to be partly met by the sale of goods produced and the services
rendered at the Industrial Training Center and the Hotel Training College. By
special agreement the private sector and the Government equally share the
recurrent  cost of the Hotel Training College.   A similar arrangement is
expected to be worked out for the Industrial Training Center.
Project Execution
39.       A project unit has been established in the Ministry of Finance, with
the express purpose of implementing the project in a timely and cost-efficient
way. The Project Unit would be responsible for implementation of the entire
project, including monitoring and coordinating of the technical assistance
program.   Its staff consists of a project coordinator, two architects, the
necessary support staff and two liaison officers appointed by the Ministries
of Education and Health.   In addition, the Project Unit would be supported
part-time by an accountant, and a procurement officer, supplied by the
Ministry  of Finance.    Selected  technical  staff  from  the ministries  of
Education and Health and the project institutions under their jurisdiction
would offer whatever support is necessary to the project unit for the prepara-
tion of educational specifications, furniture and equipment lists, terms of
reference for specialist services, and for the monitoring of the preparation
or restructuring of the various training programs to be implemented by these
institutions.   The Government plans to keep the Project Unit intact after
construction of the project is completed to become the nucleus of an entity
that would be used for the formulation, preparation and execution of the
country's development projects.
40.       Professional Services.  Architectural designs would be prepared by
the project unit and engineering designs, cost estimates and supervision of
construction of project institutions would be undertaken by consulting firms
selected and appointed on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.  The
Project Unit staff would review the civil works designs and equipment and
furniture lists before submitting them and the bidding documents to the Bank,
certifying that they meet the agreed economic and functional standards and the
educational objectives of the project. The Government already owns the sites
required for all project institutions. - Designs for the College of The
Bahamas, acceptable to the Bank, have been sufficiently advanced to allow
tendering to begin in July 1981.



- ii1 -
Procurement
41.       Contracts for furniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.
However, furniture and equipment that cannot be grouped into packages of at
least US$100,000 would be procured through local procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Procurement under this procedure is not expected, in the aggregate, to
exceed US$700,000 equivalent, or about 20% of the total costs of furniture and
equipment to be procured.   In the case of procurement under international
competitive bidding procedures, domestic manufacturers would receive a margin
of preference of 15% of the c.i.f. cost or the applicable customs duty,
whichever is lower.  Prior Bank approval would be required for the award of
any furniture and equipment contracts exceeding US$50,000.
Disbursements
42.       Disbursements of the proceeds of the proposed loan would be made for
100% of total expenditures of technical assistance, and the manpower data base
system; 95% of equipment and furniture; and 70% of professional fees and
project  administration.    These  percentages  represent  approximately  the
foreign exchange component of costs in these categories. Civil works will be
financed entirely by the Government.  The Government's auditors would audit
the Project Unit's accounts, including statements of expenditures for project
administration. Yearly audit reports would be sent to the Bank for informa-
tion.   To bring the project to an appropriate state of readiness expedi-
tiously, retroactive financing not exceeding $100,000 would be provided to
cover expenditures incurred after January 1, 1981 for designs, professional
services, technical assistance and project administration.
Benefits and Risks
43.       Benefits.  The proposed project would:  (a) have a major impact on
increasing the number and quality of graduates in key fields of skill train-
ing.  The annual output of the project institutions when in full operation
would be about 1,300 skilled personnel, which is expected to be adequate to
cover the country's needs for 1980-90; (b) improve the relevance of training
to the employment requirements of the country by developing trade standards
for skilled workers; by introducing appropriate curricula for the various
technical and vocational training programs; by assisting in the establishment
or the refurbishing of learning resource centers and by supplying them with
learning materials supportive of technical and vocational training activi-
ties; and by promoting a program for the training and upgrading of technical
teachers and supervisory staff; (c) help strengthen the institutional capac-
ity of the technical/vocational education system by establishing a national
manpower data base system for the assessment of manpower needs of the country;
by strengthening the education planning unit of the Ministry of Education; by
improving the administrative and organizational structure of the College of
The Bahamas; and by establishing the National Industrial Training Council to
develop appropriate machinery for the overall coordination of the various
skill activities to ensure efficient use of human and material resources; and



- 12 -
(d) distribute training opportunities to less developed areas by supporting
the appropriate educational institutions of the Family Islands.  This would
help reduce the high rate of migration from the Family Islands to New
Providence, which takes place, among other things, for purposes of further
education and training, and would assist the development of tourism and other
industries on the Family Islands.
44.       Risks.  The only significant risk is that delays in project execu-
tion may occur because of the complexity of the project and lack of experience
in The Bahamas to execute it. Hiring of experts and consultants to assist in
the execution of the project, and close supervision by the Bank at the initial
stage of project execution are expected to minimize these risks.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bahamas and the Bank and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors separ-
ately. Special conditions of the project are listed in Annex III, Section 3.
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
47.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
