I. SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS RELATED TO EDIJCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
1.01      The central problems besetting the Commonwealth of The Bahamas
are excessive dependence upon a single source of export earnings which is
subject to sharp fluctuations in international markets, high unemployment,
and inequitable distribution of income and welfare. Economic diversification,
employment generation, and income redistribution are familiar development
objectives. But neither the nature of the underlying problems in The Bahamas
nor the setting in which their resolution must be sought is typical.
1.02      Exports are predominantly services, especially tourism.  Unemploy-
ment is largely structural in nature. The disparities in income and welfare
are closely associated with the presence of a large number of expatriates.
Although 19 of the archipelago's 29 islands and more than 3,000 keys are
inhabited, three-quarters of the population (estimated in mid-1980 at 237,000,
of which half is under 20 years of age) is concentrated on only two islands.
Relative prosperity on New Providence and Grand Bahama (with respectively 59%
and 16% of the population) will continue to attract migrants, especially youth
in search of jobs, from the economically less buoyant Family Islands, exacer-
bating further the maldistribution of welfare. Finally, natural resources,
location and topography of immense natural beauty being the principal ones,
are limited.
Economic Structure
1.03      The Bahamian economy is overwhelmingly service oriented.  The two
leading sectors, tourism and international finance and business services alone
account directly for approximately 45% of GDP (possibly another 30% indirectly)
and nearly 30% of employment, which approached 80,000 in late 1979 (40% female).
The service sectors, more broadly defined, 1/ account for roughly three-quarters
of employment. In contrast, the manufacturing and agriculture sectors together
currently account for only about 10% of both GDP and employment.
1.04      By occupation, "service workers" constitute 35% of the employed.
Just the front-line labor force in tourism--the 12,200 cooks, waiters,
bartenders, maids, housekeepers and related personnel--make up 18% of
employment. Clerical and related personnel total a further 17%. The occupa-
tional category of "production process and transport workers and laborers"
constitutes only 20% of employed persons.
Recent Growth Performance and Outlook for the 1980s
1.05      The drive for development has been characterized by great openness
of the economy and heavy reliance upon private investment rather than govern-
ment intervention. Progress has been uneven. The 1950s were essentially a
decade of preparation for the tourist boom of the 1960s.  Restrictions on
capital outflows in the United States during those years stimulated emergence
1/   To include community, social and personal segrvices, and retail and
wholesale trade, in addition to two leading subsectors of tourism and
international finance and business services.

of The Bahamas as a significant international financial center. Growth of
real GDP in the 1960s was in excess of 9% per annum, a level not again
approached until the end of 1979. The all-important indicator of economic
activity, visitor arrivals, virtually stagnated between 1971 and 1973, and
then fell to a reduced level where it remained until 1977. The tourist
revival was strong in 1978, and in 1979 arrivals accelerated to about 1.8
million, a point beyond which further growth of tourism, especially on New
Providence and Grand Bahama, will require expansion of hotel accommodations.
Since 1978, the growth of residential construction has been limited much more
by lack of skilled and semi-skilled labor than by demand. The needed invest-
ments in hotels will also run up against this skill constraint.
1.06      The uneven growth of the past decade, based on labor-intensive
export services, has occasioned strong fluctuations in the labor force,
employment and unemployment, as summarized below, for New Providence and
Grand Bahama for the period since independence in 1973: /1

figures should be viewed as rough estimates.
/2   Assuming stagnant GDP in 1974 and 1975, although incomplete evidence
suggests real GDP may actually have declined somewhat in these years.
1.07      During the 1980s growth is expected to slow appreciably from the 9%
per annum rate achieved by late 1979. Capacity constraints in tourist accom-
modations, and the forecasts of generally lower real growth in Europe and



-3-
North America are the main factors suggesting a mnoderation of average annual
real growth to 4% or 5% in the medium term. Prudence dictates projections
based on the lower figure for the opening years of the decade.
Unemployment
1.08      Growth at the projected pace--about ha:Lf what was achieved by late
1979--would generate approximately 3,800 additional jobs yearly beginning in
1980. But the numbers of unemployed persons wilL also increase. Indeed,
barring radical shifts in immigration patterns and/or the labor force partici-
pation rate (about 46% in late 1979), the overalL rate of unemployment will
again begin to rise from the reduced level of 14% achieved in late 1979 when
the economy was growing at double the rate projected for the early 1980s.
1.09      Even during the high growth years 1978-79, unemployment in The
Bahamas was very unevenly distributed among population subgroups. 1/ On New
Providence 16.6% of the labor force was unemployed in late 1979. This is more
than twice the rate (7.0%) on Grand Bahama. The labor force aged 14-24 years
suffers from 29.3% unemployment. Among women (wlho constituted 45% of the
labor force in 1979), 23% were unemployed on New Providence and 13% on Grand
Bahama. Corresponding figures for males were 10.2% and 3.8%, respectively.
Unemployment among young women (ages 14-24) was nearly double the overall rate
for females: 46% on New Providence and 28% on Grand Bahama. Among people who
had previously been employed in the key sectors of restaurants and hotels,
construction, and financial and business services, unemployment rates in late
1979 were about 12%. Unemployment among labor force members with either
junior or senior secondary school education was higher than the overall
unemployment rate (22% vs. 16.6% for New Providence for 1979). Furthermore,
while the rapid growth during 1978-1979 caused a decline in the unemployment
rate among the New Providence labor force with some secondary education (from
29% to 22%), the unemployment rate for those with senior secondary education
remained constant at 26.5%, and the absolute numbers in both categories rose.
1.10      These differences together suggest that unemployment has significant
structural components. Interventions in the education and training system
may in some measure alleviate the problem if they are carefully designed to
provide the knowledge and skills valued in the labor market to target groups
that are at a demonstrated disadvantage in the competition for jobs.
Demand for Labor in the 1980s
1.11      Prudent expectations of the minimum annual requirements for key
categories of labor during the 1980s are summarized in the following table:
1/   All data derived from the Labour Force Sample Surveys taken in December
1973, 1975, 1977 and 1979. The reported rates are estimates, unadjusted
for seasonal variation. Note that by definition the labor force includes
only those individuals actively seeking work or who are employed--i.e.,
full-time students and housewives not seeking work are excluded from both
numerator and denominator of unemployment rate calculations. Data for
1979 pertain only to New Providence and Grand Bahama; no information is
available for the Family Islands.

1/ The following assumptions underlie these estinates:
(a) annual increments to employment beginning in 1980 will be constant at
roughly 75% of the average experience of 1976-1979, which implies a
slightly declining rate of growth of emplcyment over the decade. This
is purposefully below the figure of 3,800 additional jobs per annum
mentioned in the text, and so represents a lower bound estimate.
(b) The working life of each and every individual is 45 years. This trans-
lates into an annual attrition rate of only 2.2%, which is undoubtedly
lower than that will actually occur when vcrtality and retirements
are counted.
(c) The distribttion of employment in the entlre Commonwealth (by occupa-
tion and eccnomic sector) roughly approxiuates that prevailing in 1979
for New Providence and Grand Bahama combined (data availabe for 1979
only on the two major islands).  This protably results in an under-
estimation cf employment creation in the economic sectors of agricul-
ture and trzde, and in the occupational categories of agriculture,
fishing and comnn labor.
(d) Eighty-five percent of employment in 1979 was concentrated on New
Providence (55%) and Grand Bahama (30%), which implies a continuanion
of the trend towards concentration of economic opportunities on these
two islands. The Government's development strategy, however, contem-
plates greater dispersion of economic activities to the Family
Islands. These assumptions are consciously conservative and result
in lowerbound estimates of demand for labor in the 1980s.



- 5-
1.12      These figures, which do not include gradual replacement of non-
Bahamian personnel amounting in late 1979 to 14% of the labor force, highlight
the demand for high and middle-level manpower. At present, graduates from
Bahamian and foreign higher education meet barely 50% of the manpower require-
ments at this level. The output of secondary schools covers most lower middle-
level manpower requirements (clerical, sales, services).  But the quality of
education and training provided by the system is not up to the standards
required in either the labor market or higher educational institutions.
:L.13     The Government needs to streamline its system for developing tech-
nical manpower so that it contributes more efficiently to achievement of the
three major economic objectives of the country: generation of viable jobs for
the unemployed and new labor force entrants, diversification with appropriate
Linkages to the leading sectors of tourism and international finance and
business services, and distribution of the benefit;s of growth more evenly
among the Commonwealth's islands.

II. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR I/
A. Assessment of the Education and Training System
Overview
2.01      The Bahamas has a comparatively strong system of general education
for its youth. Virtually all children (i.e., 95%) are enrolled through the
first nine years of common general education and almost two-thirds of those
eligible attend senior high school. There is no disparity between male and
female enrollments. The quality of general education is also comparatively
strong. A high proportion (86%) of public primary and secondary level teach-
ers is qualified. Teacher:student ratios are low (1:24 in primary and 1:19
in secondary education). 2/ Due to a policy of almost automatic promotion,
dropout has also been low. Academic education has been historically favored
over technical education and training. The output from technical education
and training is below labor market demands, its quality needs improvement
and it requires better management and coordination with the private sector.
General Education
2.02       Some quantitative characteristics of the system for the school year
1977/78 are summarized in the table below:

2/   Annex 1, T-1.

2.03      As the above table indicates, the nine-year general education course
(grades 1-9), through the elimination of the selective Common Entrance
Examination (CEE) for primary school graduates (grade 6), has become widely
available to almost all children of 6 to 15 years of age. The participation
r,   in senior high schools (62%) is increasing every year; it increased by
2.5% p.a. during the period 1976-78, compared with an average increase of
1.1% for the whole system of primary and secondary education.
Technical and Vocational Education
2.04      Senior high schools offer a comprehensive type of education consist-
ing of a common core curriculum taken by all students, and optional subjects,
such as business and commercial, hotel and tourism, agricultural and marine
science, health and home economics, and technical subjects (technical drawing,
industrial arts, electronics, electrical installations, etc.). The compre-
hensive approach to senior high school education is a recent development in
The Bahamas requiring an attitudinal change on thes part of parents, students
and teachers, who have historically favored academic over technical education.
Technical subjects were formally introduced into the senior high school
program in 1976. It was also as recently as 1973 that the three higher
education institutions of the country, which offer technical and vocational
courses--the College of The Bahamas, the Hotel Training College and the
Department of Nursing Education--were firmly established. There are three
major issues confronting the system of technical and vocational education:
output, quality, and management and institutional capacity.
2.05      Output of Technical/Vocational Institutions.  The main institutions
training manpower at the craftsman, lower technician and technician levels are
the senior high schools (lower technicians), the iCollege of The Bahamas
(business and industrial craftsmen and technicians), the Hotel Training
College (technicians in the hotel industry) and tihe Department of Nursing
Education (technicians in health services). The 1979 output of craftsmen and
technicians from these institutions compared to tihe estimated annual manpower
demand (para. 1.11) is shown in the following table:

2.06      The output shortfall from the existing insitutions can be attributed
to lack of adequate and proper facilities. Senior high schools function on a
full-time basis (35-40 periods per week). Due to lack of workshops (14),
science/food laboratories (5) and equipment at 12 out of the 21 senior high
schools offering technical courses, the time allocation to these courses is
4-6 periods per week instead of the 14 periods recommended by the Ministry of
Education (i.e., 14% instead of 40% of weekly time). This adversely affects
the level and quality of training of the senior high school technical courses.
The Soldier Road campus, one of the two campuses (the other is the Oakes Field
campus) of the College of The Bahamas, provides day and evening courses on a
full-time and part-time basis for three divisions of the College of The
Bahamas--the Business and Administration Studies, the Technical Studies and
the Applied Science Divisions. The Hotel Training College, despite the
inadequacy of its buildings, also offers day and evening courses on a full-time
basis. The rented and quite unsuitable premises of the Department of Nursing
Education are used, during the absence of students attending their hospital
internship course, for the advanced nursing training courses.



2.07      The craft courses at the Soldier Road campus last one year.  In
response to recent shortages in the building and maintenance trades 1/ the
Government is promoting a number of intensive six-month courses intended
for the initial training of about 400 persons ancd the upgrading of skilled
workers in the industrial and business trades. These courses, following a
flexible program of study based on different trade requirements and previous
knowledge of trainees, will eventually replace the one-year craft (Certificate)
courses of the College of The Bahamas. However, expansion of both the craftsman
and the technician courses will create an accommodation problem at the Soldier
Road campus which can only house about 400 trainees.
2.08      Quality of Technical/Vocational Training.  The Divisions of Business
and Administration, Natural Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences of the
College of The Bahamas (COB) offer two-year associate degree courses, which
are recognized by a number of foreign universities. The Teacher's Certificate
issued by the Division of Education of the COB is also recognized for purposes
of further studies by the University of West Indies. The Hotel Training
College has attained full accreditation from the U.S. Southern Association of
Colleges and Schools. The courses provided by the Department of Nursing
Education closely follow curricula and standards set for the training of
nurses in the U.K. Curricula and standards for the above courses, though
influenced from abroad, have also been adopted, with assistance from represen-
tatives of industry and other relevant agencies l-o fit local conditions.
2.09      No training standards or trade tests have been developed for the
craft courses at the College of The Bahamas, which in many respects are
similar to COB's diploma courses. Ad hoc committees have been set by the
Curriculum Unit of the Ministry of Education to prepare guidelines for the
teaching of technical subjects in senior high schools. Progress, however,
has been very slow because of shortage of qualified personnel. There are
only two supervisors for technical subjects dealing with all aspects of
technical education, including curriculum development.
2.10      There is a short supply of equipment and library books on technical/
vocational subjects in all technical/vocational institutions. The Government
provides consumable materials to all public institutions; but they are not
always adequate and must be supplemented by contributions from parents'
associations.
2.11      Technical/vocational institutions depend heavily on expatriate
teachers. In 1979, 53 out of a total of 104 technical teachers (51%) in
senior high schools were expatriates. The Division of Education, which does
not provide training for technical teachers, couLd reduce the dependence
on expatriate staff, by providing such training as well as systematic upgrading
of teachers in service.
2.12      Management and Institutional Capacity of the Technical/Vocational
System. With the exception of the Department of Nursing Education, which
comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of lHealth, the Ministry of
Education and Culture (MEC) is either directly or indirectly (i.e., through
appointed Councils) responsible for the administration of pre-school through
1/   In 1979, the output of craftsmen from the College of The Bahamas was
just below 50, while the minimum annual demand for construction workers
during the 1980s is estimated at 225 (para. 1.11).

college education. The Ministry of Education and Culture has two main
departments which are involved in the development and administration of
technical/vocational training (Annex 1, C-2):
(a)  the Department of Planning and Culture  primarily deals
with educational research, planning and evaluation. Its
Planning Unit is involved in the collection of annual statistics
and projection of enrollments. Because of the absence of a
manpower data base system, the Unit is not able to make any
technical/vocational manpower projections. Its Evaluation
Unit, consisting of one qualified staff member, is involved
in students' academic achievements. There is no aptitude
testing system to support the vocational guidance of students.
(b)  The Office of the Director of Education  oversees super-
visory services, curriculum development and other support
services. The Assistant Director of Education is responsible
for technical and vocational education and training. Super-
vision of technical subjects is provided by two supervisors,
who are also involved in curriculum development, as well as in
administrative matters. However, there is no agency involved
in dealing systematically with the evaluation of existing
training programs or the provision of needed feedback for their
improvement.
Each of the various services of the Ministry of Education and Culture (e.g.,
research, planning, curriculum development, evaluation, technical and voca-
tional education) is controlled by one or two persons, who are generally
qualified and experienced, but are at a disadvantage because they are without
the support of a properly qualified staff.
2.13      In 1979, as an initial step toward organizing the vocational training
system on a new basis, the Government set up and funded an interim Industrial
Training Council. The main function of the interim Council has been to organize,
administer and operate an industrial training center at the Soldier Road campus
focussed on accelerated training and upgrading of skilled workers in the indus-
trial and business trades. This arrangement was considered necessary because
of shortages of skilled workers (para. 2.07). The interim Council consists
of three members representing the Ministries of Education, Labor and Industry.
Discussions between the Government and representatives of industry and trade
unions are expected to lead shortly to the establishment of a permanent National
Industrial Training Council, responsible for all industrial training and up-
grading courses in the country. This permanent Council is to be financed by
both Government and industry.
Education Finance
2.14      Since 1970 the total public educational expenditure (recurrent and
capital) has regularly amounted to 20% of total government expenditure, equiv-
alent in recent years to roughly 6.5% of GDP.  Recurrent public expenditure on
education, approximately 22% of overall recurrent public expenditure in recent
years, has grown in real terms at an average rate of about 4.2% per annum
since 1973. Personnel costs absorb three-quarters of the Ministry of



- 11 -
Education's recurrent expenditures. By contrast, teaching materials and
equipment (including furniture/furnishings) account for less than 4% of
recurrent expenditure on education. This provision in 1979 amounted to
US$33 per child enrolled in public primary and secondary schools. This is
insufficient, especially at the secondary level, where technical training
activities should be reinforced. Estimated annual recurrent costs per pupil
in 1979 were US$570 for primary, US$860 for secondary (US$670 for junior
secondary and US$1,200 for senior secondary), US$3,180 at the College of The
Bahamas, and US$5,670 for tertiary level training abroad. 1/ Current costs
per pupil were well above levels typical of the Caribbean due to (a) high
salaries--about four times the GDP per capita for trained teachers, many of
whom at the secondary level are expatriates--and (b) small school size,
which is the result of geographical dispersion.
External Aid
2.15      With the exception of some technical assistance provided for the
preparation of the 1976-80 Five-Year Education Development Plan by the
Commonwealth Secretariat through the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooper-
ation, the Government of The Bahamas has received no external aid for the
development of the education sector.
B. Education Development Strategy
Government Sector Policy and Strategy
2.16      The overall education policy objective of the Government is the
Bahamianization of education, i.e., the development of a national school
system oriented towards indigenous goals and objectives. One clear implication
of this policy is the gradual reduction of the country's dependence on non-
Bahamian personnel, which forms 14% of the total labor force, and holds most
of the high level posts in the country. This will require the development of
the technical and vocational education system to adequately serve the manpower
requirements of the country, by increasing its output, improving its quality
and strengthening its institutional capacity. Specifically, Government plans
over the next decade include the following:
(a) Increase of output of technical/vocational institutions:
(i) Establishment of an Industrial Training Center at the Soldier
Road campus, under the aegis of the National Industrial Training
Council, to provide flexible and intensive training courses for
about 400 industrial and office workers, and short, upgrading
courses for about 100 skilled workers. These courses will
replace the one-year craft (Certificate) courses of the College
of The Bahamas;
1/   These figures are, at best, order of magnitude approximations, since
the coding scheme used to identify educational level in the expenditure
accounts has been inconsistently applied and since both the primary and
secondary subsystems contain schools catering to various (and overlapping)
age groups. Further, the figure for the College of The Bahamas is based
on an estimate of full-time equivalent students at both technical and
craft levels.



- 12 -
(ii)  Provision of 14 workshops and 5 science/food laboratories to
12 senior high schools for the effective implementation of
their technical subjects program;
(iii) Relocation of the Divisions of Technical Studies and Business
and Administration Studies of the College of The Bahamas to new
premises at the Oakes Field campus. Each Division will have an
enrollment capacity of about 200 for its two-year courses.
(iv)  Establishment of a Technical Teacher Education Unit at the
Oakes Field campus with an enrollment capacity of about 50,
for a three-year training program for secondary school teachers
of technical subjects;
(v)  Expansion and modernization of the Hotel Training College for
about 330 trainee places; and
(vi)  Construction of new, suitable facilities for the Department of
Nursing Education for about 180 trainee places.
(b) Quality improvement
(i)  Provision of technical assistance for:  the development of
curricula for the Industrial Training Center, the technical
subjects of the senior high schools, the Division of Technical
Studies and the Technical Teacher Education Unit at the College
of The Bahamas, and the advanced management course of the Hotel
Training College;
(ii)  Establishment of a Learning Resource Center for the College of
The Bahamas;
(iii) Provision of library books and other learning materials to all
technical/vocational institutions mentioned in (a) above;
(iv)  Through technical assistance, upgrading of the staff of the
Learning Resource Center of the Ministry of Education; and
(v)  Provision of technical assistance for upgrading the teaching
staff of all institutions mentioned in (a) above, and the
organization of systematic staff upgrading courses by the
Technical Teacher Education Unit, when established.
(c) Strengthening of institutional capacity
(i) Establishment of a manpower data base system (para. 2.12(a)) at
the Ministry of Finance or the National Department of Statistics;



- 13 -
(ii) Provision of technical assistance for establishing the structure
of the National Industrial Training; Council, the organizational
and administrative arrangements, the promotion of trade standards
and certification tests, the planning and coordination of the
training programs and their evaluation, and the financing of
the activities of the Council; and
(iii)  Provision of technical assistance for training additional staff
for the Planning Unit (data analyst, manpower planner, institu-
tional planner), Evaluation Unit (program evaluation, psycho-
metric studies) and the Curriculum and Supervisory Services
(technical and science subjects) of the Ministry of Education
and Culture.
rhe Government has requested assistance from the Bank for the achievement
of the above objectives.
Bank Lending Strategy
2.17      The Bank lending policy supports the Government objective of
developing the technical and vocational education system, i.e., to strengthen
its institutional capacity, improve its quality, and increase its productivity
to effectively serve the developmental needs of the country.

III. THE PROJECT
3.01      The proposed project, in accordance with the Government sector
policy and the Bank lending strategy, would pursue three main objectives:
(a) to increase the output of the technical/vocational education
system (2.16a);
(b) to improve its quality (2.16b); and
(c) to strengthen its institutional capacity for needed adjustments
to evolving economic demands (2.16c).
3.02      For the achievement of the above objectives, the project would
include the following specific items:
A.   Construction, equipping and furnishing of:

The Industrial Training Center (Proposed Outlay 1/: Us$0.50 million)
3.03      The project would assist the Government in converting the Soldier
Road campus, currently used by the Divisions of Applied Science, Technical
Studies, and Business and Administration Studies, into the Industrial Training
Center. Classrooms would be converted into workshops and a learning resource
unit, and existing workshops would be refurbished to support the industrial
training program. The 400 trainee places would be made available for short
(3-6 months) and longer (12-18 months) craftsman training courses allocated to
various occupations, on the basis of manpower requirements (para 1.11), as
follows: industrial and construction trades, 280; secretarial and office
arts, 60; and others, 60. With day and evening courses, the Center would
train about 500 craftsmen per year. The Center would be open to graduates
of junior high schools, as well as to out-of-schcol youth and adults who
are unemployed or wish to upgrade their skills. No tuition would be charged,
and stipends would be used to attract trainees. A total of 27 instructors
would be needed for the operation of the Center, but only 4 instructors would
remain when the College of The Bahamas moves out. The National Industrial
Training Council would be responsible for hiring the additional 23 instructors.
Upgrading of 10 local instructors for the Center is also provided for under
the project.
3.04     The Center is to be administered eventually by the proposed National
Industrial Training Council. The Council, which would be composed of repre-
sentatives from Government, industry and trade unions, would replace the
temporary, interim Industrial Training Council (para 2.13). The Government
intends to approach the representatives of industry, no later than July 31,
1981, with a view to agreeing with them on the respective participation in
management of the Council and the financial contr-ibutions to be made by the
Government and industry towards the funding of the Council.  After extensive
discussions among the representatives of Government, industry and trade
unions, a permanent Council is expected to be legally established by mid-1982.
In addition to administering the Industrial Training Center at the Soldier
Road Campus and providing extension arrangements for evening craft training
courses in the senior high schools for out-of-school youth and adults, the
Council would serve as a forum for general discussion of training matters, and
help coordinate skill training throughout The Bahamas. Specialist services
are provided under the project to assist the Government in organizing the
structure of the Council, the development of tra-ining courses, the establish-
ment of trade standards and trade certification procedures, and the evaluation
of the training programs from the dual view of their cost-effectiveness and
their relevance to employment/manpower requirements. During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances that the National Industrial Training Council,
including industrial and trade union representatives, with appropriate arrange-
ments for its management and financing mutually shared by Government and
industry, would be established, satisfactory to the Bank, by June 30, 1982.
The Government also provided assurances that it would establish by December 31,
1982, a monitoring and evaluation system satisfactory to the Bank for assessing
annually the effectiveness and impact of the training programs administered by
the Council, and make available to the Bank, for review and comments, annual
evaluation reports of the Council's training activities during the period of
the project.
1/   This and subsequent figures for proposed oultlay exclude contingencies.



- 16 -
Senior High Schools (Proposed Outlay: US$2.39 million)
3.05      The project would provide 14 new and 5 refurbished workshops and
science/food laboratories, and learning materials to 12 senior secondary
schools for a total of about 285 student places to enable them to implement
effectively their technical education program. When the facilities are
completed, about 750 students would be able to take industrial courses, with
an annual output of some 300 students. Such training would lay the foundation
for further studies in technology and science at the tertiary level; however,
many students would attain a skill level which would be sufficient for employ-
ment upon graduation. These schools would also conduct craftsman training
courses in the evening through extension arrangements to be made by the
National Industrial Training Council. Four schools have been selected from
New Providence, and the remaining eight schools from the Family Islands, on
the basis of their size and existing facilities, local manpower requirements,
and regional equity. As some schools already have teaching staffs, only nine
additional teachers would be required. They would initially be trained in
the Technical Teacher Education Unit of the College of The Bahamas to be
established under the project (para 3.07) and would receive regular in-service
training. The curricula for the technical courses would be further developed
by the Curriculum Development Unit under the Office of the Director of
Education with technical assistance to be provided under the project (para
3.12(b)).
The College of The Bahamas (COB) (Proposed Outlay:  US$3.88 million)
3.06      The project would provide for transfer of the Divisions of
Applied Science, Technical Studies and Business and Administration Studies
of the COB from the Soldier Road to the Oakes Field campus, by constructing,
equipping and furnishing new classrooms, workshops, laboratories and other
ancillary facilities. The transfer of these divisions would enable the
COB to integrate all its activities into one campus, realizing economies of
scale in the offering of courses and the use of facilities. The new Applied
Science/Technical Division would offer 4-semester, post-secondary programs and
produce about 90 technicians annually, considered to be within the country's
absorptive capacity (para 1.11). Students not meeting standard entrance
requirements would be able to take a 2-semester preparatory course. The
21 teachers who would transfer from the Soldier Road campus would be sufficient.
Curricula would be upgraded by the faculty, but specialists and fellowships
provided under the project would assist in the curriculum development of
electrical and mechanical technology (para 3.12). The new Division of Business
and Administration Studies would provide about 200 student places, which would
permit an annual output of about 100 middle level graduates, which would be
adequate for the needs of accounting, banking and finance, marketing and
management, data processing and business economics. Three additional teachers
would be required, for a total of 28.
3.07      The project would also assist the  COB in establishing a new Technical
Teacher Education Unit. The Unit would annually produce about 15 technical
junior and senior high school teachers, which would meet annual requirements
(para 2.16(a)(iv)). The program would consist of three years of training.



- 17 -
Provisional admissions would be made for those who do not meet the requirements
and wish to take preparatory courses. In collaboration with the Divisions of
Education and Technical Studies, i.e., utilizing their shops, laboratories and
teaching staffs, the Unit would organize its courses, which would include
in-service training arrangements. The curriculum of the program would be
developed within one year of the signing of the loan agreement, by a committee
composed of representatives of the Divisions of Technical Studies and Education
of the COB and the Ministry of Education, supported by teacher educators,
provided under the project, with training in technical education, curriculum
development, evaluation and educational technology (para 3.12).
3.08      The project would also provide for a central Library/Learning
Resource Center which would enrich the teaching/learning programs of all
the divisions of the COB; it would also provide maintenance services to
all divisions.
The Hotel Training College (Proposed Outlay: US$1.57 million)
3.09      The project would construct and refurbish classrooms and practical
teaching facilities at the New Providence campus and equip the teaching
facilities at the Grand Bahama campus. The project would enable the College
at New Providence to expand its full-time enrollment capacity by 60, i.e.,
from 60 to 90 students for the two-year diploma course and by 30 students
for a new one-year post-diploma course. The College would be able, through
day and evening courses, to offer 23 different programs for 330 full-time
students and upgrading or part-time courses for about 100 students. The New
Providence campus will also continue organizing industry-based courses for
about 1,000 persons every year. The Grand Bahama campus would continue to
operate mainly industry-based courses; however, it would also initiate a small
number of institutionalized courses. To this effect, negotiations are underway
for the acquisition of an additional Government building on an adjacent site.
At present 18 teachers are working at both campuses; no difficulties are
anticipated in hiring the nine additional teachers required for the New
Providence campus and the two for the Grand Bahama campus. Curricula have
been adequately updated; however, the curriculum for the new advanced diploma
course would be developed by a specialist to be provided under the project
(para. 3.12). The College, administered by the Hotel, Tourism and Allied
Industries Training Council, would continue to meet its operational costs
through equally shared financing by Government and industry.
Department of Nursing Education (Proposed Outlay: US$1.44 million)
3.10      The project would provide for replacement of the facilities for
the Department of Nursing Education to improve its teaching program with
modern workshops, laboratories and equipment and to increase its enrollment
from about 180 to about 240 trainees--180 trainees for basic nursing courses
(registered and clinical nursing) and 60 trainees for advanced nursing
(community, midwifery and psychiatric) and other upgrading courses. The
enrollment increase is possible because students in the registered nursing
program spend their third year at the hospital for their internship program.
The training policy and curriculum, which are consistent with the Government's



- 18 -
health care policy, are set, approved and would be updated regularly by
the Nursing Council of The Bahamas, which is composed of representatives
of the Government and the medical profession. In addition to the 17-member
teaching staff, two additional members would be needed to serve the increased
enrollment in basic and advanced nursing courses.
National Manpower Data Base System (Proposed Outlay: US$0.05 million)
3.11      In order to establish a national manpower data base system,
the project would finance installation of a master data file on computer
through utilization of registration information already compiled by the
National Insurance Board, and implementation of procedures for updating
this master file annually. The project would include installation of
appropriate software on the Ministry of Finance computer and training of
staff in its use and the purchase of key punches or other data recording
machinery. These activities would provide much of the information needed
by the Government to comply with its monitoring and evaluation obligations
(para. 3.04).
Technical Assistance (Proposed Outlay: US$1.21 million) (Annex 1, T-2)
3.12      The project would finance the equivalent of 75 man-months of
specialist services and 489 man-months of fellowships in support of the
project components as follows:
(a) Specialist Services: (i) to assist the Government in the organi-
zation and management of the National Industrial Training Council;
(ii) to advise the College of The Bahamas in curriculum development,
teaching technology, measurement/evaluation, and maintenance
procedures; and (iii) to assist the Hotel Training College in
the curriculum development for the advanced management program.
(b) Fellowships: (i) to upgrade teaching staff of the Industrial
Training Center, the College of The Bahamas, the Hotel Training
College, and the Department of Nursing Education; and (ii) to train
the staff of the Ministry of Education in educational planning,
curriculum development, educational evaluation, and learning resource
center activities.
3.13      Technical assistance costs have been estimated at US$6,000 per
man-month of specialist services and US$1,550 per man-month of fellowships.
During negotiations the Government gave assurances that all specialists and
their terms of reference and conditions of service would be acceptable to the
Bank, and that candidates for the fellowship program would be selected and
placed following criteria and procedures acceptable to the Bank. Fellowship
recipients would obligate themselves, under the normal government procedures,
to return to government employment for which they are to be trained. To
provide guidance to the agencies concerned with the above matters the appraisal

IV. COST AND FINANCING OF THE PROJECT
Cost Estimates
4.01      The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$18.4 million
and is exempt from taxes. The breakdown of type of expenditure and project
institution, shown in Annex 1, T-3, is summarized as follows:
US$ (million) /1
Local   Foreign   Total
Industrial Training Center                0.08      0.42      0.50
Senior High Schools                       0.75      1.64      2.39

/1   US$1.00 = B$1.00.
/2   Estimated December 1980 prices.
4.02      Base costs are expressed in estimated prices as of December 1980.
Costs of civil works are derived from recent contracts and actual costs of
similar construction adjusted for recent price increases. Cost estimates
reflect planned maximum use of cost-effective design, planning and construction
procedures applicable to The Bahamas.  Average building costs, which are
comparable to those in other Caribbean countries, are estimated at US$470 per
square meter of gross floor area on the basis of the one- or two-story class-
room and administrative units of cement block and brick walls and one story
workshops of the steel and reinforced concrete structure with asbestos or
galvanized roofing.

4.03      Project cost estimates include:  (a) physical contingencies for
unforeseen factors averaging 12% of the base cost; and (b) price contingencies
as follows:
1981 (%)        1982-1985 (% p.a.)
Local    Foreign    Local    Foreign
Site Works and Construction         25         18 /1    15          15 /1
Professional Services               15         15        15         15
Furniture and Equipment             12         12         8          8
Technical Assistance                10         10        10         10
Project Administration              15         15        15         15
/1   These contingencies are based on mission examination of recent
experience in The Bahamas and in The Bahamas' traditional supplier
countries for the construction materials to be purchased abroad,
and on judgmental projection of future trends.
4.04      The foreign exchange of US$12.1 million represents about 65% of
the total project cost (net of taxes). This has been calculated as follows:
construction and site development--50%, furniture--85%, equipment--95%, profes-
sional fees--80%, technical assistance--95%, and project administration--50%.
Financing Plan
4.05      The total project cost of US$18.4 million would be financed by a
Bank loan of US$7.0 million (equivalent to 38% of the total cost, or 57% of
the foreign exchange cost) and a Government contribution of US$11.4 million.
The flow of funds required to finance the project has been estimated as
follows:
Fiscal Year            Bank          Government           Total
(US$'000)        (uS$'Ooo)         (US$'000)
1982                 300            1,400              1,700
1983                 500            3,900             4,400
1984               1,700            3,800             5,500
1985               3,500            1,600             5,100
1986               1,000              700             1,700
Total              7,000           11,400             18,400
Because of the high priority accorded to the project by the Government, it
would make adequate budgetary allocations to meet the annual counterpart
funds required to implement the project.
4.06      Recurrent expenditures generated by the project in 1985 are estimated
at B$1.5 million (at 1980 prices), which is about 2.9% of the Government's
t'&sal Tecurrent budget on education in  MO.  Of this total B$0.19 million is
attributable to the Department of Nursing Education; this is equivalent to



- 21 -
approximately one-half of one percent of Ministry of Health's recurrent
expenditures for 1980. This level would not create any substantial burden
on total Government recurrent expenditures, which have been growing at 11.8%
p.a. (1973-79). The cost of the consumable materials included in the project-
generated recurrent costs is expected to be partly met by the sale of goods
produced and the services rendered (automobile repairs and maintenance, etc.)
at the Industrial Training Center, and for charges made for meals, parties,
receptions, etc., provided to the public by the Hotel Training College as an
essential part of their training program.

V. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENTS
Project Administration
5.01      A project unit was established in the new Development Project
Management Office of the Ministry of Finance, which was recently created by
the Government with the express purpose of implementing Bank-financed projects
in a timely and cost-efficient way. The Project Unit would be responsible for
implementation of the entire project, including monitoring and coordinating of
the technical assistance program. Key Project Unit staff consists of a project
coordinator, an architect, and an assistant architect, l/ and two liaison
officers appointed by the Ministries of Education and Culture, and Health and
Social insurance.
5.02      Under the coordination of the two liaison officers, technical staff
would be selected from their respective ministries and from the project insti-
tutions under their jurisdiction to offer whatever support is necessary for
the preparation of educational specifications, furniture and equipment lists,
terms of reference for specialist services, and monitoring of preparation or
restructuring of the various training programs to be implemented by these
institutions. The Project Unit would be supported by the necessary support
staff, and part-time staff consisting of an accountant and a procurement
officer, supplied by the Development Project Management Office. To help the
Government retain qualified professionals and to ensure efficient project
implementation, the cost of the Project Unit (estimated at about US$0.6
million 2/ including US$300,000 for foreign experts not available locally)
has been included in the total project cost.
Implementation Schedule
5.03      To assist the Government in achieving effective and timely execu-
tion of the proposed project, an implementation schedule was discussed and
agreed upon during negotiations (Annex 1, C-3). The Project Unit would review
the agreed implementation schedule and update it on a regular basis for use as
a project implementation and monitoring tool.
Professional Services
5.04      Architectural designs would be prepared by the Project Unit and
engineering designs, cost estimates, and supervision of construction of
project institutions would be undertaken by consulting firms selected and
appointed on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The Project Unit
staff would review the civil works designs and equipment and furniture lists
before submitting them and the bidding documents to the Bank, certifying that
they meet the agreed economic and functional standards and the educational
1/   Cost estimates by a quantity surveyor will be undertaken under contract
(para. 5.04).
2/   Excluding contingencies.

objectives of the project.  Prior to Board presentation, the Government
confirmed to the Bank that designs for the project items of the College of
The Bahamas, acceptable to the Bank, have been sufficiently advanced to allow
tendering to begin in July 1981.
Sites
5.05      The Government already owns all the sites required for the project
institutions.
Procurement
5.06      Contracts for furniture and equipment amounting to about US$2.7
million (excluding contingencies) would be awarded on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. However,
furniture and equipment that cannot be grouped into packages of at least
US$100,000 would be procured through local procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Procurement under this procedure is not expected, in the aggregate, to
exceed US$700,000 equivalent, or about 20% of the total cost of furniture and
equipment to be procured. In the case of procurement under international
competitive bidding procedures, domestic manufacturers would receive a margin
of preference of 15% of the c.i.f. cost or the applicable customs duty,
whichever is lower. Prior Bank approval would be required for the award of
any furniture and equipment contracts exceeding UJS$50,000. The estimated
base cost of locally procured furniture and equipment does not include local
taxes. Imported furniture and equipment will not be subject to import duties.
Maintenance
5.07      The Government would adequately maintain the buildings, furniture
and equipment of all project institutions, including preparation of maintenance
manuals by the Project Unit, and would make adequate allocation for this
purpose in the budgets of the Ministries of Education and Health.
Disbursements
5.08      A project loan of US$7.0 million, equivalent to 38% of the project
cost of US$18.4 million, would finance 57% of the foreign exchange compo-
nent. Disbursement of Bank funds would be made over 4.5 years with construc-
tion and installation of furniture and equipment completed by the end of 1985
(Annex 1, T-4). Disbursements would be made against: 100% of total expendi-
ture for technical assistance and the manpower data base system; 95% of
equipment and furniturea and 70% of professional fees and project adminis-
tration.
5.09      Retroactive financing not exceeding US$'100,000 would cover expendi-
tures incurred after January 1, 1981, for designs, professional services,
technical assistance and project administration, in order to advance project
implementation.
Audit
5.10      The Government's general auditor's office would audit the Project
Unit's accounts, including statements of expenditure (SOE) for project admin-
istration. Yearly audit reports would be sent to the Bank for information.

VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      The proposed project is expected to have a major impact on increasing
the number and quality of graduates in key fields of skill training. Skill
shortages would be reduced and employment opportunities increased as a result
of the project's full support of the Government's strategy to develop manpower
required at various skill levels. The annual output of the project institu-
tions when in full operation would be about 1,300 skilled personnel--500
craftsmen, 300 lower technicians and 500 technicians. This output would be
equivalent to about one-third of the projected annual demand for labor in the
Commonwealth over the period 1980-90 (para. 1.08).
6.02      The project would provide the job market with better trained personnel
with regard to both technical skills and relevance of training to employment/
manpower requirements. The project would assist the National Industrial
Training Council in the development of recognized trade standards for skilled
workers. The project.would also promote the development of appropriate
curricula for the various technical and vocational training programs, assist
the establishment or refurbishing of learning resource centers and supply them
with learning materials supportive of technical and vocational training
activities, and promote a program of training and upgrading of technical
teaching and supervisory staff. These activities are expected to increase
parents' and students' awareness and appreciation of the importance of
technical and vocational education and training to their country's welfare
and development.
6.03      The project would also help strengthen the institutional capacity
of the technical/vocational education system. The establishment of a national
manpower data base system for the assessment of manpower needs, as well as the
strengthening of the manpower services of the educational planning unit of the
Ministry of Education, would assist in bringing about a better balance between
technical/vocational training and employment. Another significant institu-
tional development supported by the project is the administrative separation
of the craft from the technician courses, now taught together at the Soldier
Road campus of the College of The Bahamas (COB). The new administrative
arrangement would allow the COB to concentrate on the tertiary level of
education, enhancing its role as the main source of middle-level manpower of
various kinds including technical teacher training. It would also allow the
newly established National Industrial Training Council to develop, in close
cooperation with industry, appropriate machinery for: (i) the standardization
and certification of craft qualifications, (ii) the development of flexible
and relevant training programs and their evaluation, and (iii) the overall
coordination of the various skill activities to ensure efficient use of human
and material resources.
6.04      The project would help distribute training opportunities to less
developed areas and low-income families. Craft and lower technician courses
offered under the project would be available both in New Providence and in the
Family Islands. These training arrangements are expected to reduce the high
rate of migration from the Family Islands to New Providence, which takes
place, among other things, for purposes of further education and training.



- 25 -
Eventually they would also provide support for the projected development of
tourism and other industries on the Family Islands, thus promoting equitable
regional development.
Risks
6.05      Two risks are foreseen:  (a) project institutions would require
additional and upgraded staff in order to function effectively. The Government
has given assurances that necessary prompt action on this matter would be
taken, but some slippage from the optimal schedule of identifying and training
staff is nevertheless possible; and (b) delays in implementation of the
physical aspects and technical assistance components may develop, due to lack
of previous Bahamian experience in project administration of this sort. The
potential impact of any such delays on the project costs is significant under
the inflationary pressures prevalent in the country. The proposed employment
of various experts and consultants to assist in the implementation of the
project, the use of the implementation schedule as a monitoring tool (para
5.03), and intensive supervision at the initial stages of project implementa-
tion are intended to minimize these risks.
r



- 26 -
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      During negotiations the Government gave assurances that:
(a)  the National Industrial Training Council would be legally
established, in a way satisfactory to the Bank, by June 30, 1982
(para 3.04);
(b)  a monitoring and evaluation system would be established by the
National Industrial Training Council by December 31, 1982, and
annual evaluation reports would be sent to the Bank during the
period of the project (para 3.04); and
(c)  all specialists and their terms of reference and conditions of
service would be acceptable to the Bank, and candidates for the
fellowship programs would be selected and placed following criteria
and procedures acceptable to the Bank (para 3.13).
7.02      Prior to Board presentation, the Government confirmed to the Bank
that designs for the project items of the College of The Bahamas, acceptable
to the Bank, have been sufficiently advanced to allow tendering to begin in
July 1981 (para 5.04).
7.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project constitutes
a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$7.0 million to the Government of the
Bahamas for a period of 15 years including 3 years of grace.
