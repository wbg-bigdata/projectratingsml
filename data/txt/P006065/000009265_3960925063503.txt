PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THE BAHANAS
tInST VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1962-BM)
PREFACE
This is a Pzoject Completion Report (PCR) on the First Vocational
and Technical Education Project In the Bahamas, for which Loan 1962-IN,
approved on March 26, 1981, provided US$7.0 million for a project estimated
to cost US$18.4 million  equivalent.   The project was closed  on June 30,
1988,  two   years  later   than  anticipated,  and  cost  US$17.5 million
equivalent. Lack of financing for one project facility necessitated its
deferment to a subsequent project and a cancellation of the US$0.45 million
of the Loan proceeds originally allocated for furniture and equipment for
that facility.  At  the time  of final preparation of this PCR, the sun of
US$ 163,695.87 remained in the Special Account; cancellation of this final
proportion was anticipated shortly.
A draft PCR was prepared in accordance with Section 3.6 (d) of
the Project Agreement dated May 8,  1981.  The final  report represents a
collaborative effort between the Bank and the Borrower, and is based upon a
review  of  the  Staff Appraisal Report  and  relevant   loan  documents,
supervision  and   project  pr^qress  reports,  evaluations  by  the major
techaical assistance contractort, as well as a field visit to project
institutions in  November 1988.  The Basic Data Sheet includes information
not available when the PCR was Initially prepared in late 1988, but the
differences with the text are minor and do not affect the assessment of the
project.
The draft report has been read by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED), and copies were sent to the Borrower and its agencies for
coument in March 1989. No comments were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THE BAHAMAS
FIRST VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1962-BM)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction and Proiect Obiectives
1.       This project was  the  first  Bank  assisted education or training
project in The Bahamas; and the generally high level of success it has
achieved in meeting its objectives has led to the approval of a second
vocational and technical trae.ning project ir; December 1988. The major
objectives of the first project were  to:   (a) ircrease the outputs of the
vocational and technical education and training system; (b) improve the
relevance and quality of training programst and (c) strengthen the system's
capability to make necessary adjustments to meet the evolving employment
requirements of economic development.
Implementatioia
2.       Project implementation suffered delay  during the first 19 months
because of the lack of managerial attention on the part of the PIU coordi-
nator, who was simultaneously  implementing  the on-going urban development
project, and the lack of attention by Ministry of Health's liaison officer.
However, in May 1983 the implementation of the Ministry of Education's
(MOE) components were transferred from the Ministry of Finance to the MOE,
a project coordinator was appointed with responsibility for only this proj-
ect and implementation of the MOE components began to accelerate at an
acceptable rate. The initial two year dela; was never regained and the
Froject required seven years for implementation instead of the originally
estimated five years.
Project Results
3.       The project was successful  in  attaining  each of the three major
objectives. The quantitative targets in outputs of the vocational and
technical system were significantly exceeded. Especially noteworthy were
the large increases in the in-plant training participation in courses
conducted by the hotel training  college.    With very minor exceptions the
quality of construction, furnishing  a"d  equipping  of  the five major new
training facilities was very good, while that of the 11 new secondary
school facilities were good.  The qualitative improvements in the training
programs are probably of much greater importance over the longer run than
are the purely quantitative gains resulting from the new and upgraded faci-
lities, equipment and  training materials.    Of  equal importance are the
concomitant improvements in the capabilitits of senior staff and adminis-
trators in the planning, implementation and management of training pro-
grams. The project was fortunate in obtaining a major technical assistance
contractor who was able to field a capable team of specialists.



- vi -
4.       In summary, the major  areas  of  accomplishments in I%'proving the
quality of training programs and institutional capahility in planning,
Implementing and administering the training, system were ins (a) the deve-
lopment, validation and implementation of coimpetency-based curricula in the
COB, BHTC, ITC and BSN institutions;  (b) Improvements in testing and eval-
uation for the MOE: COB and BSN, and developing, field testing, and imple-
menting occupational certification standards '.n welding, air conditioning,
and refrigeration at the ITC; (c) student guidance and counseling for
secondary students; (d) staff development for 106 key instructors, super-
visors, planning personnel and administrators through programs abroad; and
(e) in-service training programs.
Proiect Sustainability
5.       There is no question of the sustainability of the project. All of
the project institutions assisted under the project are basic education and
training institutions whose roles in the economic and social development of
the country will steadily increase.    Further inputs into their continuing
upgrading and expansion will be  required.    Recurrent costs financing of
project Institutions is not a significant problem. The Second Technical
and Vocational Project under Loan 3004-BIM provides further assistance in
expansion, curriculum upgrading, facilities improvement and in education
and training planning, particularly at the tertiary level, which will
further strengthen the sustainability of the project.
Lessons Learned
6.       There were several lessons  learned, or  once again confirmed, by
Government and Bank personnel during project implementation which have
implications for future projects.    Among  these,  in training projects of
this  size  and  institutional   diversity   are:       (a)  a  condition  of
effectiveness, and preferably much  earlier,  dkould  be appointment of key
PIU staff, including a coordinator, with no other major project for which
he is responsible, an architect, and an equipment specialist; (b) to insure
stability in financing for PIU staff, in many cases it may be essential for
the Government to utiliLe project administration funds provided in the loan
to pay salaries; (c) the Bank should be cautious, and if it is judged
necessary, seek additional conditionality, when it enters into a loan
agreement in which the Government plens to finance all construction costs
from its own resources, as in such cases the Bank has less leverage in
keeping civil works on scheduleg and (d) appraisal reports should contain
carefully calculated, and separately stated, cost estimates on such things
as customs duties on imported goods, internal transportation and insurance
costs of goods. Customs duties, and in many cases the costs of internal
transportation and insurance, will be borne by the Government. They should
be included in annual budgets for project iWplementation, but frequently
are not.

senior managers of project institutions.   A detailed list of these reports
is attached as Annex 1.
1.02     The format and subject matter  areas  of .   report are based upon
discussions with Bank missions of March and Aptwi of 1988; and on Bank
Guidelines for the Preparation of Project Completion Reports (PCR).
Focus of Revort
1.03     The primary objective of  this  report  is to describe and analyze
the status (during the first four months after the Loan Closing Date of
June 30, 1988) of implementation of components as contrasted to original
plan, and to compare estimated costs and expected benefits at the time of
appraisal with the actual costs incurred and benefits attained and/or
currently exp. ted. It specifically focuses on how well the project objec-
tives were met; the consequences (good and bad) of decisions and actions
takenlnot taken in the course of project implementation; and the project
contributions to strengthening of institutional capacity in the planning
and deliverance of vocational and technical training. Special emphasis is
placed upon lessons learned during project implementation and on formula-
tion of recommendations,  some  of which  could  be  applicable to similar
projects, as to how the negative 'essons could have been alleviated or
prevented; and what further actions are required to assure that the conti-
nually evolving training needs of business and industry can be better met.
II. BACKGROUND AND PROJECT COMPOSITION
Socio-Economic Setting During Period of Implementation
2.01     Economic circumstances, as well as  other unexpected events in The
Bahamas having adverse economic consequences, resulted in a general slow-
down in project implementation and some significant project changes due to
severe competition for scarce public financial resources. The most serious



- 2
of these was that, as a result of a decline in the European Econ3mic
Community (EEC) assistance for The Bahamas during the 1981-85 period, the
funds which were to finance the civil works cost of the new Hotel Training
facilities did nlt become available. Consequently, the development of this
component was deferred. The possibility of EEC assistance was not foreseen
at the time of appraisal, but soon after implementation began such assist-
ance became  a  strong  probability.    Consequently,  the renovations with
government funds to existing hotel training facilities was cancelled, and
designs for the new facility were developed. Two other developments also
caused delays in project Implementation.   The  first of these was a series
of fires, of unknown origin, requiring the replacement of all or major
portions of five secondary schools including the entire administrative
blocks and classroom/laboratory places for 700 students. A second factor
was the largely unanticipated, in terms of medium and longer-term budgetary
planuing, increase in school participation rates of primary and secondary
age youths. These circumstances resulted in a new priority assigned to
construction and furnishing outside the project of five new schools having
3,520 student places with related administrative and service facilities.
These conditions combined to require a total of about US$7.72 millions in
new capital expenditure in education (Annex 2) during the same period that
the Government was committed to finance about US$6.9 million of capital
costs of civil works for the project.
Prolect Origin. Formulation and Justification
2.02          The project was identified and prepared during 1979 through a
series of three missions and the combined efforts of the
Government, the World Bank and  UNESCO.   It was appraised by
the Bank during the period of February 1980 through December
1980, with four Bank field missions during 1980, and culmi-
nating with the Government's mission to the Bank for Negotia-
tions in the second week of March 1981.
2.03     The major justification for  the  project  lay in the Government's
growing recognition, during the last half of the 1970's, of the need to
accelerate the development of a properly skilled labor force.
Proiect Objectives and Composition
2.04     The main objectives of  the  project  were  to:   (a) increase the
output of the technical and vocational education and training system; (b)
Improve the relevance and quality of training programs; and (c) strengthen
the education and training system's capacity to make the necessary adjust-
ments in view of the evolving needs of the labor market.
2.05     To achieve the above objectiv .,  the project included the follow-
ing specific items:
(a) Construction or renovation, furnishing and equipping of:
(i)   Industrial Training  Center  (renovated) to accommodate
500 Srainees annually;



- 3 -
(ii)   Senior High School Vocational  Training  - 14 new and 5
renovated training shops in 12 schools to accommodate
about 750 industrial students annually, with an output
of about 300 trainees annually;
(iii)   College of The Bahamas with  new facilities to produce
annual outputs of about:    90 new technicians from the
Technical Studies Division; 100 from the Business and
Administration Division; 15 new teachers from a new
Technical Teacher Education Unit; and an expansion of
the Library/Learning Resources Center for about 130
additional student place_;
(iv) Hotel Training College with new facilities and supple-
mental equipment to accommodate an additional 120 full-
time students at the Nassau, New Providence Campus, and
to furnish and equip the Grand Bahamas Campus for
upgrading its industry based instructional program for
a continuing 1,000 per year; and
(v)     Bahamas School  of Narsing with  accommodations for a
total of 180 full-time students and 60 students in
part-time upgrading courses.
(b) Development of a National Manpower Data Base System -
with project assistance in the development and installation of
a master data file system.
(c) Technical assistance originally comprising about 75 man-months
of specialist services and 489 man-months of fellowships and
study-tours abroad.
Chances in Prolect Composition
2.06     While the project was generally implemented as originally planned,
there were some modifications, mostly of a positive nature. These modifi-
cationn were as follows:
(a) As a result of the growing recognition for the need to improve
education policies and the competencies of administrative,
planning and instructional staff, the Government and the Bank
agreed to increase the amount of loan proceeds allocated to
specialist  services  and  training/study  tours  aboard.   The
allocation was increased from an original US$1.35 million
contract with the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL), to US$3.07
million (including US$0.21 million with a minor contractor) and
the implementation period for this component extended to
December 31, 1987 to permit a broader and deeper attainment of
the overall project objectives (paras. 3.07-3.10).
(b)  Because of the  lack  of  finaneing  (para  2.01) for the civil
works costs of the new training facility for the Nassau Campus
of the Bahamas Hotel Training College (BHTC), this part of the



- 4 -
project was eventually deferred for a second Bank assisted
project and the US$0.45 million of loan funds allocated for
furnishing and equipping of the new facilities were cancelled.
To help offset the effect of the projected loss of graduates
from full-time programs, the industry based (in-plant) program
was increased from an originally projected 1,000 trainees
annually to 2,500.
(c)  The timely donation, by the  Grand Bahamas Port Authority, of a
completely renovated building in Freeport for the use of the
Bahamas Hotel Training College (BHTC), the Industrial Training
Center (ITC), and the College of The Bahamas (COB) (Refer to
para 3.05 and Tables 3.1 and Annex 4), enabled the BHTC to move
from its inadequate facilities and to increase the projected
output of the Grand Bahamas  Campus.  This output was expected
to be 90 graduates from the campus based programs and 500
trainees from  the  industry  based  progrsms  in  1988,  and a
projection of about 150 graduates from the campus based program
in 1989. The  ITC  was  also  enabled to initiate campus based
training in Freeport and produced an output of 85 in the
1987-88 year. The campus-based output will be further expanded
under the new Bank assisted project.
(d)  Due to the inability to obtain full agreement on procedures and
methodology  between   the   administration   of  the  National
Insurance Board and the Ministry of Finance Computer Division,
the  project was  -mable  to  attain  fully  the  objective of
establishment of a National Data Base System. Consequently,
the development of the 'demand' side of the system was deferred
to the new Bank-assisted  project.    However, the new 'supply'
side of the system, with accurate and regular reporting on
student flows  and  entrants  to  the  labor market,  has been
developed, equipped and  staffed  in  the Ministry of Education
and is operational.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Schedule
3.01     As detailed  in  Annex  2,  and  as  discussed  below, the project
required about seven years for completion (loan signing to loan closing)
instead of the five years  originally  estimated.   The major causes of the
delay were as follows:
(a) The civil works component of the project was completely
financed with  funds  outside  the  loan.    Because of serious
budgetary constraints (para. 2.01) and administrative problems,
there were delays in the beginning of construction ranging from
about 20 months in the case of the COB (para. 3.05) to about 48
months in the case of the Bahamas School of Nursing (BSN).



(b) The reason for the long delays in beginning the design and
construction of the BSN building was due to legal problems in
the procurement of the construction sice, and very slow
administrative process in handling them by the Ministry of
Health (MOB).
(c) The substantial delays of about 24 months in the construction
of the new shops and the refurbishment of existing ones of the
secondary technical schools  were  due mainly  to  the lack of
timely availability of budgeted funds; financial problems of
the contractors; and further complications caused by delays in
the Government's disbursement of funds to them.
(d) The dvlays in procurement of furniture and equipment, with
minoi exceptions, were in response to the delays in construc-
tion and renovations.
(e) The delays in implementation of the technical assistance
component were due tot   the  poorly organized and staffed PIU
during the first 22 months of project implementation in which
no one was specifically assigned the responsibility for imple-
mentation; the unexpected length of time needed to arrange an
acceptable contract with a qualified consulting institution and
for the mobilization of indiviuual specialists; a lengthy
process of obtaining governmental approvals for planned staff
development abroad; and the approximately 130Z increase (para.
2.06 (a)) in the actual level of specialist assistance and
study tours abroad.
(f) The technical (industrial arts) teacher training program was
not successfully implemented as planned. Although several male
trainees originally enrolled in the opening class in 1984-85,
all of them either changed to industrial technology majors or
dropped out before completing the industrial and pedagogical
course requirements. The two major reasons for this situation
are: (a) the average annual replacement requirements for the
total of only about 60 industrial arts teachers is five to six,
which is not enough to attract the 12 students required for an
economically feasible teacher training class; and (b) the
demand  for  two   year  post-secondary  industrial  technology
graduates is greatly in excess of the supply and salaries paid
are much better than that paid for secondary teachers on an
annual basis.   Other  extenuating  factors  are:  (a) employed
skilled craftsmen, who are attracted to teaching in the
industrial arts programs, can obtain their pedagogical qualifi-
cations through part-time classes in the regular teacher
training program at the COB; and (b) qualified expatriate
industrial arts teachers find teaching in The Bahamas very
attractive because of climate, cost of living, and tax free
salaries.



-6-
Pro1ect Manstement
3.02     During the first 19 months  of implementation, certain aspects of
the project suffered from lack of managerial attention on the part of the
Project Unit Coordinator. At this time the Unit was formally a part of the
Ministry of Finance and it had the responsibility for both the Urban
Housing Project and the Vocational and Technical Training Project. As the
Urban Housing Project was already well advanced, it required virtually all
the available time of the Coordinator. The problem was further compliceted
by a lack of attention by the liaison officer for the Ministry of Hes'th's
Department of Nursing Education component.    This inattention w8S a result
of a lack of available time due to heavy competing demand on his time
within that Ministry.
3.03     By the time of the  September 1982 supervision mission, the Bank's
project supervision  personnel became  firmly  convinced  that significant
changes in  local project management were  required.   Consequently, the
mission initiated frank discussions with the PIU Coordinator, the Financial
Secretary of MOF, and the Deputy Permanent Secretary of MOE about how
project management could  be  strengthened.    In  these discussions it was
recommended that the responsibility for the management of MOE project
components, representing about 88S of the total project, be assigned to the
MOE itself. In May 1983 the responsibility for implementation of its part
of the project was formally transferred to the MOE, a Project Implementa-
tion Coordinator was appointed, and the rate of project implementation of
its components began to accelerate.   E-.en though funds were provided under
the loan, no fwaids were ever authorized by the MOE to employ an equipment
procurement specialist. While the development of equipment lists, specifi-
cations and procurement proceeded with only small delays, it became
increasingly more difficult for the PIU Coordinator to handle the work load
as implementation advanced.    This  burden was  especially evident in the
delays in customs clearance and in the delivery and installation of equip-
ment in training centers located in the Family Islands and in Grand
Bahamas. Furthermore, the lack of an equipment specialist resulted in a
few of  the  item   of  equipment  (estimated value  of  about US$100,000)
requested not having adequate specifications to assure their desired
quality and capacity. Because of the unanticipated delays in civil works
completions and the corresponding long storage period required for the
early arrived equipment, the unsuitability of some equipment items was
unfortunately not discovered until late in the implementation cycle.
3.04     It is highly probable that many  of the problems and delays in the
construction and renovations of the secondary technical school facilities
could have been significantly reduced had the PIU been permitted to employ
its own supervision architect, rather than having to rely on the Ministry
of Works and Utilities (MOWU) for this service.
Civil Works, Furniture and Equipment Procurement
3.05     Civil Works. Private architects used in the design of the COB and
BSN and their resulting designs were  very  goou.  While the plans for the
COB were produced with only about six months delay, they were still ready



- 7 -
by the time of loan signing.    However,  the designs for the BSN could not
begin until a site was procured some 48 months later than originally
scheduled. A private architect wes employed to supervise the construction
of the COB facilities and, after a dela- of about 20 months because of poor
coordination between MOE and MOWU  regarding tendering, construction began
and was completed in about three months less than scheduled. Once the site
*           for the BSN was procured,  the  designs  were promptly developed, the works
were tendered and construction carried out with all being completed within
a total of 24 months. The quality of construction in these two facilities
was very good and they are  aesthetically  pleasing.  In recognition of the
significant roles which the BHTC, the ITC and the COB are playing in over-
all economic and social development, and upon the strong recommendation of
business and industry leaders in Grand Bahamas, the Grand Bahama Port
Development Authority donated a relatively new masonry building of 22,400
square feet on a 3.1 acre site and completely remodeled it for education
and training use  by  these  institutions.    The  appraised  value of this
facility, less furniture and equipment, is US$2.7 million. The designs of
the 11 new and six renovated shops and laboratories for the secondary
technical programs were done by the architects of the MOWU, as was the
supervision of constrLction. While the quality of works was generally good
for the new buildings, the quality of the interior finish, including
painting, in the renovated shops was  only  fair.   The renovations of the
training facilities at the ITC in Nassau were carried out by the staff and
the trainees.  Although the  quality  of  the works is generally only fair,
the training value and the  savings  in scarce financial resources probably
justify this approach.  Table  3.1,  below, provides further details on the
type and quality of civil works.

a 3.1 acre site with a total value of US$2.7 million was donated by
the Grand Babama Port Development Authority for joint use of the ITC,
the BHTC, and the COB education and training programs.
2/   Construction was to be finavced  by  EEC  funds and when it was found,
late in the implementatior. period, that sufficient funds would not
become available, the decision was made to delay new construction.
3.06     Furniture and Equipment.  Procurement  of furniture and  equipment
was carried  out  in  accordance  with  Bank  and  Government   guidelines.
Virtually all equipment was procured through ICB, while most furniture was
procured through LCB. Equipment lists and specifications were prepared by
instructional staff of the participation institutions. The evaluation of
tenders was carried out by selected senior instructional staff of the
institutions. These activities were coordinated and supervised by the PIU
Coordinator and the instructional staff received no extra compensation for
these activities. While this procedure resulted in lower administrative
costs payable from the loan allocations, and was good experience for the
technical instructors, it had several limitations in regard to efficiency
and effectiveness of project implementation. The complete process suffered
as the result of the lack of an equipment procurement specialist (pars.



- 9 -
3.05). The MOE PIU Coordinator, after his appointment, quickly became
knowledgeable about procurement procedures as a result of considerable
study of Bank procurement documents and thorough discussions with Bank
supervision personnel. However, he did not have the kind of training or
experience that would permit him to conduct comprehensive reviews of equip-
ment specifications, with the technical instructors preparing them, to
assure their clarity and technical  accuracy.   This deficiency resulted in
instances (valued at about US$100,000) in which the equipment received was
not what was desired even though it technically met the written specifica-
tions. Unfortunately, most of this type of equipment, mainly for the COB
and ITC, arrived long before the buildings were ready for its installation
and had to be put in storage for up to 12 months. Consequently, by the
time it was installed and the deficient specifications were realized it was
too late to exchange it with  the  supplier.   Furthermore, due to the long
delays of time between the shipment of goods by the suppliers and the final
delivery and installation in the training institutions, after many months
of storage, the culpability for damage andlor loss could not be properly
ascribed to the responsible party and, thus, the institution assumed the
loss.
Education and Training Aspects
3.07     Despite the slow  start  in  initiation  of  the overall technical
assistance provided in support of the education and training aspects,
implementation soon  picked  up momentum.    As  a  result  of the careful
logistical control developed and exercised by the PIU Coordinator and the
field coordinator for the major contractor, implementation moved quite
smoothly throughout the greatly expanded program (para. 2.06 a and Table
3.2).
3.08     Curriculum and Materials  Development  and  Evaluation.  More than
two-thirds of the 167 person-months of specialist assistance provided under
the project was devoted to developinglupgrading these three areas with
major emphasis on the education and training programs at the COB, the BHTC,
the BSN, and the ITC, with minor emphasis upon the secondary schools. In
addition to the curriculum materials developed by the specialists, a major
vehicle for curriculum development and evaluation was the organizing and
conducting of in-service workshops for instructional staff (para. 3.09).
Such workshops, along with the  upgrading  of the competencies of key staff
through training abroad, have helped assure the continuing development of
curricula relevant to the needs of business and industry.
1.09     Staffin   Recruitment and Training.    The additional teacher needs
for the project  institutions  were  modest.    Except  for  a few isolated
instances, no  significant  problems  have  been  encountered.    The major
reasons for this are that the competitive salaries, absence of income
taxes, relatively low living costs, and excellent climate, make the
vocational and technical teacher market very attractive to well-qualified
exratriate teachers from Canada and England. Qualified technical personnel
from business and industry also find part-time teaching in COB and BHTC
attractive. In addition to 106 staff members receiving upgrading training
abroad for an average of four months, in-service staff training was con-
ducted by consultants, with assistance of local staff, for more that 120



- 10 -
persons from the MOE, the secondary schools, the COB, BHTC, BSN, and ITC.
These were arranged and conducted over a three year period and many of the
instructional and supervisory staff participated in two or more of the
workshops. There were no problems experienced In the implementation.
3.10     Str2arthenina of Institutional CavacitX in Planning and Manatement
of Education and Training.    The  original  project design provided for no
specialist assistance in this critical area, and only contained fellowship
training/study tours for three staff of the MOE Planning Unit and four
department heads of the  COB.    No  specialist a8s.stance was provided for
either planning or management except for the development of the Industrial
Training Council. Due to the Government's growing awareness of the need
for significantly greater staff competence in planning and management, the
TA component of the project was greatly increased. Consequently, eight
specialists provided about 30 months of full-time assistance in strengthen-
ing the skills of key planning and management personnel in the MOE and all
of the participating institutional groups.   In this regard several special
workshops were conducted by the group of specialists for key planning,
supervisory and management personnel from each of the participating insti-
cutions. Furthermore, the specialists helped plan, develop and, in several
instannes, implement policy changes in the participating institutions
(Refer to Chapter V Project Objectives By Major Objectives for details).
Specialist Services and Fellowship Training
3.11     The original technical assistance  plan called for the utilization
of nine subject matter specialists for a total of 75 person-months, and
fellowship training and short study tours abroad for 55 instructional and
planning staff for a  total  of  489  person months.    As a result of the
Government's growing concern for the need to improve education and training
policies and to upgrade instructional, planning and administrative staff,
the technical assistance component was greatly expanded (Table 3.2). In
summary the completed program included the utilization of i1 specialists
for a total of 167 person-months and provide fellowship training and short
study tours abroad for 106 instructional planning and administrative staff
for a total of  440  person-months.    The Government and the participating
institutions consider, with only minor exceptions, that the greatly
expanded technical assistance program with the major contractor was a
significant success.    The  only  exception  in  the  technical assistance
program was with one individual specialist from a minor contractor whose
work, because of strong personality conflicts, was relatively ineffective.
As a result of the four and one-half years for implementation of the
technical assistance program; the careful logistical control exercised by
the PIU Coordinator and the major contractor; and because much of the
routirz curriculum content development work by the specialists was done at
their home bases; the number of specialists in the country at any one time
did not cause any significant logistical problems.
Fulfillment of Loan Covenants and Policy Changes
3.12     Although slowed in execution, largely as a result of the aforemen-
tioned delays in project implementation, each of the three loan covenants
were implemented in an acceptable manner. A National Advisory Committee on



- 11 -
Industrial and Technical Education and Training (Section 3.03a of Loan
Agreement) was created and officially recognized by the Government as a
legally  organized  advisory  committee   under  the  chairmanship  of  the
Pormanent Secretary of MOE. Its membership consists of 20 people, of whom
seven are from government and 13 from large and small industrial/service
firms.   A  monitorlng  and  evaluation  system  (Section  3.03b)  has been
developed and is opexational in  the  Industrial Training Center.  Terms of
reference and conditions of service for siecialists (Section 3.04a) were
prepared  and  acceptable  to  the  Bank  and  criteria  for  selection and
placement for fellowships were acceptable and found to be highly beneficial
in the implementation of the greatly expanded program. A number of policy
changes, including several not originally planned, resulted from the
expanded technical assistance program.   These policy changes are discussed
in Chapter V, Project Outcomes by Major Objectives.
Implementation Progress Reporting
3.13     Twenty project Implementation reports were prepared by the PIU and
TA contractors during the seven years of project Implementation. These
reports, along with the information obtained during the supervision
missions, adequately served as the baais for Bank supervision of project
Implementation.
Adequacy of Operational Budgets and Counterpart Funding
3.14     Discussions with administrators,  teachers  and  students at 10 of
the 12 secondary school institutions and at all of the other project
institutions did not reveal any significant problems with the adequacy of
the consumable supply or general maintenance budgets of project institu-
tions. However, funds for more major repairs and renovations of buildings
have been inadequate in two institutions.    In  one of these, the ITC, the
problem has been largely alleviated by staff and students carrying out most
of the renovations. As the Government financed the total costs of civil
works construction and renovation, the lack of loan funds to help reduce
the amount of local funding requirements for major renovations was a signi-
ficant drawback to project implementation in one of tk.e secondary schools
and a minor problem in  the  ITC.    The major reason for this shortage of
local funds was discussed in para. 2.01.
Proiect Accounting and Auditina
3.15     Project  accounting was  carried   out  by  Ministry  of  Finance
accountants and has been satisfactory.    Audit reports have been regularly
sent to the Bank, with only moderate delays from time to time. No signifi-
cant problems in this regard have been encountered.

Bank Role In ImDlementation
3.16     The relationship between the  Bank's  staff  and  the staff of the
country implementation agencies has been very good throughout the identifi-
cation, preparation, appraisal, implementation and completion stages of the
project cycle.   The  Government  has  expressed  its  appreciation for the
Bank's expeditious advice, evaluation and approval of implementation
documents and assistance in the development and maintenance of smooth
working relationships between technical assistance specialists and imple-
mentation  agencies/institutlons.    The   Bank's  supervision  staff were
especially commended for their willingness to make on-the-spot decisions
while on missions in the country and to refer only to the Bank those
matters requiring higher  levels  of  approval.    This  helped to minimize
delays and accelerate project implementation.  The only negative aspects of
Bank supervision were the too frequent  changes in the identities of super-
vision mission members, however unavoidable, which resulted in four
different technical educators during the period of the last quarter of CY81
through the first quarter of CY85. Also there was no technical educator on
either of the two missions during CY86 and CY87, during which time only an
architect was available for field missions.   Bank disbursements were made
in a timely manner, as a result of the use of Procedure III and by the use
of the Sp;cial Account during the latter part of the Implementation period.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Proiect Costs - Estimated and Actual
4.01     The total final costs of the project, as shown in Table 4.1 below,
was US$17.52 million, which was about 52 below the appraisal estimate of
US$18.40 million. A comparison between the estimated and actual costs by
category reveals a number of differences.
Financing and Disbursement - Estimated and Actual
4.02     At appraisal the loan of US$7 million was estimated to finance 38%
of total project costs of US$18.4 million and Government would finance
US$11.4 million equivalent to 622.   As  shown in Table 4.2 below, the loan
actually financed 37.42 of total project costs and the Government financed
62.62.
4.03     As shown in Table  4.3  below,  cumulative disbursements from the
loan lagged seriously because of a number of reasons, many of which were
outside the control of the Government, and nearly all beyond the control of
the second PIU which assumed responsibility about 19 months after loan
signing. The major reasons for the delays in project implementation and
the corresponding delays in disbursements were due to causes discussed in
paragraphs 2.01 and 3.01 to  3.05.   An additional problem, contributing to
delays and/or frustrations in implementation, was the frequently lack of
timely funds  to  cover  the  Government's  financial obligations for such
things as customs duties, storage costs and in-country insurance on
furniture and equipment, internal transportation costs of consultants, and
other such costs not specifically identified as to amount in the SAR.

Unit Capital Costs and Space Allocations
4.04     All new construction was  built  to the seecified space st&ddards.
All deviations in the costs of the major civil works contracts were due to
changes in the projected rates of inflation.   Unit base costs of major new
construction were estimated at US$470 per square meter. Unit base costs
plus price  increase  contingencies  were  estimated  at  US$950 per square
meter. Actual contract unit costs, including price increases were about
US$710 per square meter for the COB, which was delayed 18 months, and those
for the BSN were US$900 as it was delayed for 48 months. These reductions
were due almost entirely to a greatly reduced rate of inflation in
construction costs.

V. PROJECT OUTCOMiS BY MAJOR OBJECTIVES
Quantitative Increases In OutPut of System
5.01     The availability of the new  facilities  at  the COB, the BSN, the
new Education and Training Complex at Freeport, the new shops In the
secondary schools, combined with the renovations of facilities in the
secondary schools and the ITC shops in Nassau have enabled a significant
expansion of  training  opportunities.    The  projected  and actual annual
enrollments and outputs of these  new  or renovated training facilities are
summarized in the table below and are detailed in Annex 4.

students taking some courses on an exploratory or supplemental basis
(Annex 4).
5.02     A review of the enrollment and output data as detailed in Annex 4,
and discussions with training administrators and with business and industr-
ial managers show thst upgrading of employed workers through inst:ttutional
part-time and in-plant training programs is still a high priority. Courses
of this kind remain a high priority for the two ITC campuses and for the
COB industrial technology programs.

Qualitative Improvements in the System
5.03     The qualitative improvements in  the education and training system
accomplished by the greatly expanded technical assistance component (paras.
3.07 - 3.09) were probably of greater medium and long-term importance than
were the more obvious gains resulting from the new and upgraded facilities,
equipment and  training  materials.    Detailed  outcomes  of the technical
assistance component are presented in Annex 5, and are summarized below.
Those having their major effect on the strengthening of institutional
planning and management of education and traiaing are discussed in the next
section of this report.
5.04     The more significant qualitative  outcomes  of the project were in
the areas of: (a) competency-based curricula; (b) testing, evaluation and
certification;  (c)  student  guidance   and   counseling;  and  (d)  staff
development.
5.05     Competencv-Base Cuirricula.  (In which daily instruction materials
for individual students clearly state the specific objectiveness of the
lesson; the exact technical knowledge and practical skills, as required in
the labor market, which the student must be able to demonstrate at the end
of the lesson; the level of performance required; and the detailed steps in
attaining the required level of knowledge and skills.) The development,
validation and implementation of competency-based curricula was carried out
by specialists and senior teachers for the COB, BHTC, ITC, and BSN training
programs. Although no competency-based materials were developed for the
secondary technical programs, the supervisory staff and the technical
committee were instructed in  the  techniques.    (The second technical and
vocational training project provides for significant curriculum development
inputs at the  secondary  levels.)    A  cooperative  education program was
jointly developed and implemented between the COB and local businesses.
Most importantly, both the philosophy and techniques of competency-based
education and training--matching instructional content to skills require-
ment of the labor market--have been well established in the education and
training system.
5.06     Testing,  Evaluation  and   Certification.   Educational  testing
broadly performs three significant  functionst    the evaluation of student
and system performance; feed-back for improving future student and system
performancel and the certification of the quality of student outputs to
prospective employers.   Each  of  these  functions  has been significantly
enhanced by the project.    Within  the MOE  several basic achievement and
placement tests were improved and norms were established. At the COB the
mathematics placement tests were revised and validated, revision of English
placement tests was initiated, and a "career testing' program was field
tested.    At  the  ITC,  standards  for  occupational  certification were
developed by specialists, senior instructors and industry for the welding,
refrigeration, and air conditioning trades, and have been tested and
accepted by industry. All programs were evaluated at the BSN, leading to
the adoption of competency-based curricula.



- 18 -
5.07     Student Guidance and Counseling.    The  activities of the Special
Services Division (SSD) and the Learning Resources Unit (LRU) of the MOE
were both upgraded with expatriate technical assistance, resulting in the
development and implementation of a Career Guidance Unit within the SSD,
and of a Career Information Unit within the LRU. Staff were assigned and
trained through specialist assisted in-service training activities.
5.08     Staff Development.   The  project  outcomes  for staff development
should not be measured only by the staff-months of participation througn
in-service and training programs abroad but, more importantly, by the
improved capability of the Bahamian education and training staff in
sustaining the improvement to the system brought about through the project.
Because of the breadth of staff development activities offered, the
Government, the principal technical assistance contractor, and Bank super-
vision staff feel confident that the training system improvements can and
will be sustained. By expanding and modifying the project's original staff
training plan, a 'critical mass" of adequately trained and motivated staff
has been developed with a commitment to effective technical and vocational
education and training in The Bahamas.
Strengtheninp Institutional Capability in the Plannint and Manazement of
Vocational and Technical Training.
5.09     Improved physical facilities,  equipment, materials, curricula and
instructional personnel are not sufficient, alone, to improve educational
efficiency and effectiveness. Concomitant improvements in the planning and
management of educational programs and of the system are also essential.
The project contributed positively, through both formal and informal
activities, to this most essential of education and training inputs. Key
personnel at the support staff, instructor, supervisor, planning and medium
and higher administrative levels participated in training activities
directed at improving their capabilities in the performance of their
assigned roles in planning and management.
5.10     Among the more immediately identifiable of these improvements are:
(a) the coordinat!on of the nursing training programs at the BSM and the
COB, with clearly defined areas of theoretical and practical training
assigned to the respective institutions and a planned integration of the
two; (b) al;. planning and administrative procedures at the COB were
evaluated ana improved; (c) a comprehensive class/shop management system
was adapted and implemented at the ITC; (d) the capabilities of key staff
of the BHTC, the ITC, the COB, the BSN, and the national technical direc-
tors of the secondary technical programs received both in-service and
training abroad in planning, implementation and management of training
programs; (e) 'ivelopment and implementation of a business and industry
needs assessment system and a student follow-up system at the BHTC; (f)
individual training program advisory committees were expanded and improved
at the ITC and COB; and (g) a National Advisory Committee on Industrial and
Technical Education and Training was legally created, officially gazetted,
membership appointed by the Minister of Education, and is functioning as
planned.

Rectrrent Costs Irmlications
5.11     Discussions with administrators,  teachers  and  students at 10 of
the 12 secondary schools and at all of the other project institutions did
not reveal any significant problems with the consumable supply budget in
the first full year (1987-88) of operation of the expanded andlor upgraded
training system.  Unit recurrent costs  of the project institutions or pro-
grams are shown in the following table.
5.12     The above unit  recurrent  costs  are  comparable  to those of the
major countries of the Caribbean, especially those of Jamaica, Barbados,
and those Eastern Caribbean States where tourism is a major economic
sector.

VI. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Lessons Learned
6.01     The principal lessons  learned  or  again confirmed, with implica-
tions for future education and training projects, as a result of experi-
ences during project implementation and the preparation of the PCR are
summarized below. Recommendations regarding some of these are presented in
para. 6.02.
(a) In a project of this scope a condition of effectiveness should
be the appointment and assignment to a PIU key full-time staff
members, such as a Coordinator, an Architect, an Equipment
Specialist, and adequate secretarial assistance to promptly
initiate project  implementation.    Participating institutions
should also have formally assigned one or more training program
administrators, on a part-time basis, to work closely with the
PIU Coordinator in the implementation of the goods and services
aspects of the project.



- 20 -
(b) The PIU should be physically located under "one roof", prefer-
ably within or near the headquarters of the executing ministry,
and the Coordinator should be vested with the full authority
necessary, in accordance with the Loan Agreement and Bank-
Government procurement regulations, to efficiently implement
the project.
(c) The Government should utilize, if necessary, the project
administration funds provided in the loan to pay the salaries
of the key full-time staff, support personnel, and to supply
the needed goods and services for effective operation of the
PIU. (The Government chose to finance these services from non-
loan funds). This would help eliminate the inevitable delays
in  implementation  resulting   from  inadequate  staffing  and
support supplies and services.
(d) The acquisition of building sites by the Government should be a
condition of loan effectiveness to assure timely implementation
of civil works and the installation of furniture and equipment.
(e) When all the costs of construction are financed outside the
loan, the Bank has little or no leverage in preventing or
reducing the length of delays in the availability of funds.
(f)  The lack of timely budgetary  provisions  of funds to cover the
Government's financial obligations for such things as custom
duties on imported furniture and equipment, storage costs and
in-country insurance of goods, internal transportation for
consultants, and other such costs not specifically identified
as to amount in the Bank SAR, are a source of frustration to
PIU and participating institutional administrators and staff,
and often result in significant delays in implementation.
(g)  While  there  are  certain   advantages  in  contracting  large
technical assistance contracts to a single firm, these may be
more than offset by significant reductions in efficiency when
the contract requires three or more years in implementation, a
full-time field coordinator, and a part-time coordinator and
considerable  overhead  costs  at   the   home  office  of  the
contractor. In this project about 35% of the total costs of
all expatriate specialist services were used for the 53 months
of the field coordinator services out of a total of 167 person-
months for all specialist services.
(h) The effectiveness of Bank supervision was inevitably reduced by
the lack of a desirable level of continuity of Bank staff,
particularly technical educators, and the lack of an architect
or a technical educator on certain supervision missions at
about three critical points in project implementation.
(i) While the annual outputs for skilled workers and technicians
increased slightly more than planned under the project, the
estimated  annual  demand  increase  was much  greater.    The



- 21 -
estimated demand, during the major portion of the 1990's, for
these types of trained manpower is expected to be more than
double the current output.   'These prospects, coupled with the
ready acceptance of graduates in the labor market and the
continuing growth in the tourism, construction and commerce/
service sectors, clearly indicate the need for continuing
emphasis upon the upgrading and expansion of such training
programs.
(j)  The value of  cooperative  planning  of  the Project Completion
exercise by the Government-Bank-project institutions, within a
time span of four to  six  months before the Loan Closing Date,
was clearly manifested in this project. A series of meetings,
totaling less than eight staff-hours of Bank mission personnel
during three Bank  missions  concerning  the  new project, were
conducted and directed at planning the project completion
exercise for the first project, the content of the report and
the responsibilities and roles of the participating groups.
The end result was that the Project Completion field mission
required only seven Bank staff-days (not including travel) and
the draft PCR and Annexes required only 10 staff-days to
prepare.
(k)  Bank supervisory staff  should  not  lI  reluctant to recommend
changes in project execution when circumstances indicate it is
strongly advisable.
Recommendations
6.02     Based upon the lessons learned by the Government and the Bank, the
following recommendations are made:
(a) In order to help ensure timely project execution, project
design should insist that the PIU responsible for implementing
education and training projects must be adequately staffed with
full-time key personnel, should be adequately budgeted with
financing under the loan if necessary, properly housed, and
should not have simultaneous responsibility for non-education
projects.
(b) The Bank should be exceedingly cautious on entering into agree-
ments in which there are major civil works, but in which no
loan funds are used to help finance the costs of civil works.
If Bank financing for civil works is not requested, remedies to
ensure adequate counterpart financing should include agreement
on specific budgeted shares, annual expenditure monitoring, or
co-financing agreements with other financiers.
(c) In an attempt to ensure adequate budget for such items as
custom duties on furniture and equipment, which are not
eligible for financing from the loan, and for storage costs and
insurance on goods awaiting completion of civil works, and for



- 22 -
internal transportation costs for consultants and similar costs
that are frequently not financed from the loan, the project SAR
should specifically calculate the amounts of each and present
them as line items for Government financing.
(d)  In order to help ensure  efficient use of resources for techni-
cal assistance, appraisal missions should carefully evaluate
the requirements for specialists' assistance in terms of: the
numbers of individual specialists; the time and scheduling of
each individual within the country; numbers in country at the
same time; activities, if any, to be carried out by different
specialists  which   require   coordination   by   a  principal
contractor; and the ratio of total person-days required of each
specialist to the number of those days he must be in the
country (keeping in mind that most curriculum development work,
after a relatively short exploratory-analytical visit to the
country, may be effectively developed at the specialist's home
base, after which he returns to the country for discussions,
modifications as required and to assist in initiating its
implementation).   On  the  basis  of such  an  evaluation  a
recommendation should be made as to the following options:
(a) the  deployment  of  a   small  group  of  specialists  not
requiring a field coordinator, and considerable overhead costs
at their home base; (b) or the use of individual specialists;
or (c) provision of several small groups andlor individual
specialists and a field coordinator under a general contractor.11
1/ This process was carried out In the appraisal of the Second Technical
and Vocational Training Project for the Bahamas, and recommendat'on (a)
was made and accepted by the Government.

UnantIcioated Canital Expenditures in Education Sector During
Prolect Imulementation Period of 1981-1987
1.   During the  Calendar Years of 1981-87 there were a number of
external factors vhlch had largely unanticipated and highly
signLfLcant economic consequences outside of those vithin the
project.    Among the  more  costly of  these in  terms  of their
capital expenditure requirements were:
(a) the loss of all or major portions of five secondary
schools from fire, including the entire administrative
blocks and 20 classrooms and laboratories, vith a total
of 700 student places; and
(b) the largely unanticipated financial consequences, In
terms of medium and longer term budget planning, of
increased participation rates ofprimary and secondary
students,  resulting in  high  priority  for  five  nev
primary schools with a total of 101 classrooms and
related administrative and service facilities with a
total of 3,520 student places, and extensions to
exlsting primary and lover secondary schools of 95
classrooms and laboratories, with a total of 3,325
student places.
2.   These 7,545 new student places required a capital investment
during  the   1981-1987, period   of  about  $7.22   million  for
construction and about $0.50 -million for equipment, furniture and
-books, for a total of about $7.72 millions. As the Government
was financing all of the construction costs of the project,. the
competition for funds between the project and these largely
unanticipated costs vere intense.
