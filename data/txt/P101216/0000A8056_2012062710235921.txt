                         With ASAP now being in its extended period of implementation, only a few activities remain to be completed, including outstanding activities at the time of the last ISR. The Veterinary
                         Information System (VIS) is now completed and will be connected to the Farm Registry shortly, and the website and reporting system for the Agriculture Market Information System
                         (AMIS) was successfully launched in December 2011. Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is in the process of entering information on plots. Component 4 on reforming the

                         irrigation sector is completed in terms of activities and disbursement, and collection of water irrigation fees is continuing, though at a slightly lower rate than foreseen under the results
                         framework. While a new law made it mandatory to submit irrigation fee payment receipts in subsidy applications, this law entered into force only this year and results on collection
                         rates will therefore not be visible before the end of the season.

                         A few remaining activities continue to delay project completion, and the project was extended for an additional 6 months in January 2012. The development of the Integrated
                         Administration and Control System (IACS) is progressing according to plan. The main bottleneck is the slow entry of land parcel information into the LPIS, which if not complete, can’t
                         be connected to the IACS at the foreseen date in August/September. If incomplete at this date, the Cadastre will be connected to the IACS instead and the LPIS will be connected at
                         a later date. According to the client, this can be done under the post-contract service agreement with the software supplier and will not affect the delivery date of the IACS set for
                         December 2012.

                         A new contract was signed in October 2011 with “Gradba Promet & Toraks Ltd? to complete the construction of the MAFWE HQ, and works were taken up shortly after. An unusually
                         cold winter unexpectedly interrupted construction works for about a month in February, which together with a set of construction problems (including the impacts of high humidity and
                         heavy rains) have caused delays that is currently estimated by the contractor/supervisor to be 1.5 months. At the time of the mission, the Bank team was told that the planned
                         moving-in date was end May, which even at the time did not sound realistic. This date has now been forwarded to July/August.

                         A major concern is the availability of funds for the project in this year’s budget, EUR 1.7 million, which is far below the cost of on-going and planned activities. Invoices for works are
                         also being paid late by the Ministry of Finance. This risks causing further delays in the completion of these works.

                         Funding for the refurbishment of the MAFWE Branch offices was in the end not allocated by the Ministry of Finance, and this activity has been dropped. The client has instead
                         requested for these funds to be reallocated to the construction of the MAFWE HQ and furniture.

                         While the refurbishment of the AFSARD building was officially handed over by the contractor in September, 2011, there are a number of unfinished or non-functioning installations in
                         the building. The client is following up on this and proceeding with legal measures against the contractor to ensure full completion of the works. It can be noted that the premise is
                         functional and that AFSARD is operating there since 2011.
