I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia)
became an independent country in 1991, after the collapse of the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. From a protected and static market of some 23 million people, the newly independent
country had to face the new reality of a small, open economy of 2 million people neighboring the
European Union (EU), the largest food exporter and importer in the world, competing in a global
context of volatile food prices, greater demands on food quality and increasingly visible climate
change impacts. Adjusting to this new context represented a significant challenge and required
building new institutions.

2.       Accession to the EU became an important element of the strategy. The FYR Macedonia
became an official candidate for European Union (EU) accession in December 2005. The
prospect of EU membership brought vast political and economic opportunities, but it also was a
challenge in itself. EU accession required a long set of legal and regulatory reforms to comply
with the “Acquis Communautaire? (the body of EU legislations) and the development of new
institutions, in particular for the agricultural sector, animal health, and food safety.

3.       The agriculture sector played an important role in the economy through its contributions
to GDP – agriculture accounted for 12 percent of GDP and agro-processing an additional 4
percent – as well as employment and the welfare of rural areas, where almost half the country’s
population resided. The country’s comparative advantage in agriculture lies in abundant labor,
fertile soils, a range of moderate continental and Mediterranean micro-climates in the south
(though with water deficiencies and occasional droughts in parts of the country) and natural
upland pastures. The main agricultural exports are tobacco, wine, vegetables, and lamb meat.

4.       EU accession was particularly attractive for the agricultural sector. In addition to securing
access to a large market, it would also allow benefits from the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP)
which includes significant incentives and subsidies paid by the European Commission in the form
of grants. However, the EU required compliance with specific requirements, such as: (i) a
minimal institutional capacity to control management of funds, which had to be verified through a
process called “Accreditation of the Paying Agency? to confirm the existence of a system to
control that subsidies and other incentives are distributed only to legitimate beneficiaries; (ii) a
food safety system with emphasis on animal health to reduce the risk that food and livestock
imported from a new member country may pose a safety hazard; and (iii) environmental
requirements related to the management of natural resources such as water. The Water
Framework Directive and the Nitrate Directive were linked to irrigation and the use of fertilizers
in agriculture.

5.      The overall EU context at the time of project preparation was an important factor in the
project’s evolution. In 2004, one of the largest single EU expansions took place with the
accession of seven new countries: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia, the latter having been part of the former Yugoslavia like
FYR Macedonia. Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007, the same year the project was
taken to the Board. These events generated significant expectations that FYR Macedonia would
quickly join the EU.

6.      Prior to independence, the agriculture sector had benefitted from World Bank support to
the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After independence, the World Bank financed two
projects in the sector: (i) a US$5.0 million project to support private farmers implemented during
1996-2002; and (ii) a US$12.5 million irrigation rehabilitation project which was implemented
during 1997-2006. The project rehabilitated three irrigation schemes and restructured Water
Management Organizations (WMOs) to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of management.
The project was assessed as satisfactory, but left uncompleted the liquidation of nine Water
Management Organizations (WMOs).

7.       Rationale for Bank involvement. The Government of FYR Macedonia requested World
Bank support to develop the institutions and systems required for EU accession in agriculture and
food safety/veterinary services. The main rationale for Bank involvement was to fill the gaps that
EU pre-accession assistance did not cover. In particular, EU pre-accession funds focused on
Technical Assistance (TA), thus leaving the necessary investments in hardware (infrastructure,
equipment, etc.) unfunded. Complementing the EU-funded TA with Bank financing for
infrastructure and equipment to improve institutional capacity to deliver public support to the
sector was a strong justification for World Bank involvement because it would leverage the
impact of EU-funded support to the sector.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.      The Project Development Objective was to improve the delivery of government
assistance to the agriculture sector in a manner consistent with the European Union's pre-
accession requirements.

9.        Key indicators:
      (a) improved Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Economy (MAFWE) ability to
          disburse and track the use of rural development funds and to evaluate their impact on the
          agri-food sector;
      (b) EU IPARD funds paid to farmers in an EU-compliant manner;
      (c) timely delivery of improved veterinary services to producers and agro-processors;
      (d) establishment of participatory, “demand driven? irrigation management; and
      (e) divesting the state of financial responsibility for the irrigation sector.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.       The PDO has not been revised during project implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.      Direct beneficiaries were expected to be institutions which deliver services to farmers.
These were the MAFWE, the Water Economy Directorate (WED), the Water Economies (WE),
the Veterinary Directorate (VD), and the Paying Agency (PA). Farmers and users of veterinary or
irrigations/drainage services were indirect/secondary beneficiaries of the project. Also, farmers
and agro-processors who received IPARD support were direct beneficiaries. Livestock herders
were also to benefit from the improved animal health. Farmers who used irrigation were also to
improve from an improved management of water supply. Finally, those farmers who received
government subsidies were to benefit from the improved targeting of the program.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)


                                                  2
12.       Component 1: Strengthening MAFWE’s Administrative and Management Capacity
in Accordance with EU Accession Requirements (EUR 8.5 million). This component had the
objective of improving the management, administration, information technology, staffing and
institutional structure of the MAFWE. The component had the institutional objective to improve
transparency and governance in MAFWE and move MAFWE structures and systems towards full
compliance with the requirements for EU accession. It included the following subcomponents:
(a) initiation of an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS); (b) establishment of an
Agriculture Information System (AIS); (c) strengthening the Agricultural Inspection Services;
and (d) establishing adequate institutional capacity in MAFWE.

13.      The component financed the building of a new headquarters of MAFWE (around EUR
4.8 million including construction and furniture), equipment (vehicles for inspections, computers
and other IT equipment), aerial photography, and technical assistance and training for the
development of software required for various information systems.

14.      Component 2: Supporting MAFWE’s Ability to Deliver EU Rural Development
Funds (EUR 2.9 million). This component had the objective to help establish the Paying Agency
(PA) that would acquire accreditation to administer IPARD funds on behalf of the EU before
accession, and CAP funds after accession; and improve the capacity of potential beneficiaries to
make successful applications for IPARD grants. Subcomponents include: (a) supporting
establishment of the IPARD Paying Agency (PA); (b) supporting PA capacity building;
(c) supporting an IPARD-tailored capacity building program for rural advisory services
providers; and (d) supporting capacity building in the Rural Development Department.

15.     The component financed refurbishing of the building of the paying agency, some
equipment (vehicles for inspection, computers and other IT equipment), and technical assistance
and training for the development of software required for various information systems.

16.     Component 3: Developing Effective Veterinary Capacity (EUR 2.8 million). This
component had the objective to develop effective veterinary capacity as part of the creation of a
functioning integrated food quality system which is consistent with EU requirements. This
included: promoting safer products of animal origin and prevention and decrease of animal
diseases; helping producers meet cross-compliance requirements to receive IPARD funds; and
enabling Macedonian producers and agri-processors to export their products to the more stable
and higher value market of the EU. It included the following subcomponents: (a) strengthening
the Veterinary Directorate (VD) in accordance with the 2007-2013 VD draft strategy and
business plan and (b) strengthening the Veterinary Laboratory (VL) and the Food Institute
Laboratory (FIL).

17.     The component financed laboratory equipment, computers and other IT equipment as
GPS navigators, and technical assistance and training to increase the capacity to monitor and
control animal diseases.

18.      Component 4: Completing Reform of Irrigation Sector (EUR 3.2 million). This
component had the objective to support the government in completion of reform of the irrigation
sector that started in 2003 under the Irrigation Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project. It
included the following subcomponents: (a) liquidation of Water Management Organizations
(WMOs); (b) establishing new Water Economies (WEs); and (c) strengthening capacity of the
Water Economy Directorate (WED).



                                                 3
19.    The component financed auditing of Water Management Organizations under liquidation,
severance payments to redundant staff of the Water Economies of Ohrid, Radovis, Strumica,
Gevgelia, technical assistance, training, and a limited amount of irrigation equipment.

1.6 Revised Components

20.     The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

21.     Project extension. The project closing date was extended from the original September 30,
2011 to December 31, 2012.

22.     In March 2010, the Loan Agreement was amended to finance 100 percent of the
disbursement categories. This was a request for all projects in the country as a consequence of the
2009 financial crisis. The Government continued to finance in parallel two activities, namely the
building of the MAFWE headquarters and the refurbishment of the Paying Agency building.

23.      In January 2011, a restructuring reallocated EUR410,000 (or 3% of the Loan) from
Component 3 to Component 2. This was due to dropping the purchase of equipment for the safe
disposal of animal by-products under Component 3 and to reallocate funds for refurbishing the
Paying Agency under Component 2. The restructuring also changed one indicator and its target to
make it consistent with the intermediate and outcome indicators and its target. In particular, the
target of recovery of operation costs of Water Economies was reduced because the original target
was deemed overly ambitious (the target of 90% of recovery of WEs' operation costs was reduced
from 90 to 60 percent, see PDO Indicator 4, Reduced financial burden to government from
irrigation management). Finally, the indicator “increased investigations in BSE fallen stocks? was
dropped because with no or limited beef exports, BSE is not considered a major issue in FYR
Macedonia. While the collection of samples from dead animals and treatment of by-products
proved to be more challenging than initially expected.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24.     Soundness of background analysis. The project was prepared by an experienced and
multidisciplinary team of experts, including with support from FAO specialists. There were,
however, some moderate shortcomings in terms of clarity of objectives, indicators, and the
assessment of local capacity to achieve the objectives.

25.      The ASAP project was identified on the basis of sound analysis carried out with a
previous Economic and Sector Work: Agriculture and EU Accession - Achieving FYR
Macedonia’s Agricultural Potential (P097173) completed in 2006. Its principal findings were
reflected in the project design, including the identification of the following needs: (i) improved
management of public expenditures; (ii) a timely preparation of the paying agency;
(iii) mechanisms to assist potential IPARD beneficiaries; (iv) an effective and efficient food
safety system; and (v) reform of irrigation.

26.     The project benefitted from being prepared shortly after a similar project in Croatia (the
Agricultural Aquis Cohesion and Agricultural Pollution Control Project, approved February 16,



                                                  4
2006) and in parallel with similar projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia (respectively,
Agriculture and Rural Development Project, approved June 19, 2007, and Transitional
Agriculture Reform Project, approved June 20, 2007). Some team members worked in parallel in
these similar projects. However, none of these parallel projects had been implemented yet, so the
challenges of implementation remained unknown.

27.     Thanks to the above preparatory work, and additional work carried out by EU-funded
consultants, the project was prepared in an extremely short period of time and with limited
resources: the project concept was reviewed at the end of November 2006 and the project was
approved about 6 months thereafter on June 12, 2007 and with a lower than average Bank
preparation budget of US$326,000.

28.      The above positive assessment is balanced by some moderate shortcomings in terms of
clarity of indicators, and the assessment of local capacity to achieve the objectives. The objective
of attracting a large share of the IPARD funds allocated by the EU was not clearly spelled in
project documents. The intermediate indicator 5 “Potential IPARD beneficiaries apply using
correct procedures,? had an ambitious target: “95% of the planned IPARD funds for the calendar
year committed, 80% of previous year commitments disbursed?. It is not clear why this indicator
was considered “intermediate?, since other PDO indicators are prerequisite to attract IPARD
funding (such as Paying Agency accreditation and Land Parcel Identification). Still it is possible
to infer that this was an important objective from several sections of the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD):
               The PDO was to “improve the delivery of government assistance to the
                   agriculture sector in a manner consistent with the European Union's pre-
                   accession requirements? not just to develop institutions;
               The economic analysis of Component 2 was calculated on assumptions about the
                   uptake of IPARD funds with and without the project. Still, actual
                   uptake/absorption of IPARD funds did not come out clearly as an objective;
               Component 2 Activity c: Supporting an IPARD-tailored capacity-building
                   program for rural advisory services providers in order to make specific IPARD
                   advisory services available to the potential beneficiaries. This activity was
                   necessary for improving demand. However implementation proved that capacity
                   was not sufficient to achieve the target; and
               The following risks and mitigation measures listed in the PAD show that the
                   project also had the objective of attracting IPARD funding:

co-financing or pre-                 addressed by the government.
                                                                         downturn in the country,

funds.                               rural credit projects, e.g.
                                                                         demand.
                                     IFAD.

29.      The above sections indicate that attracting a significant share of IPARD allocation
represented an ambitious and risky objective. Its achievement depended on several preconditions,
including: (i) IPARD requirements, which are developed by the EU, and thus outside of project
and even Borrower control; (ii) demand from potential beneficiaries, which is affected by many
factors (e.g. capacity to prepare proposals in the proper form, economic conditions and market
prospects, etc.); and (iii) availability of credit to pre-finance the investment (since farmers only
receive the grant after the investment is completed). Using the intermediate indicator 5 to
measure PDO achievement would have helped both design and supervision to better address the
need to strengthen farmer capacity to prepare good proposals.

30.      However, the project design underestimated the need for farmer support to prepare good
proposals and the degree to which external factors could also affect IPARD absorption. The
above moderate design shortcomings may be a consequence of the short preparation period. This,
in turn, may have been due to pressure stemming from the Government’s desire to be ready for
EU accession, since membership was considered imminent at the time (see para. 4 above).

31.      Risk assessment. The overall project risk was rated as high, which in retrospect
continues to look like a balanced assessment. The risk that “External developments could slow the
EU accession process? was rated as moderate. However, this risk did materialize and in
retrospect this rating has proven to be an underestimation. The financial crisis contributed to an
overall economic slowdown, credit market tightening and market uncertainty that adversely
affected farmer incentive and capacity to invest, thus affecting absorption of IPARD grants.
While at project preparation all stakeholders expected a fast EU accession process, during
implementation that process became more challenging than initially anticipated as a consequence
of the 2009 global fiscal crisis and the 2010 Eurozone crisis, which significantly curtailed EU
desire for enlargement. Indeed, the FYR of Macedonia has not yet joined the EU nor has a
definitive date been set yet. These external factors were unrelated to the project and impossible to
predict.

32.      Social aspects. No major controversial issues associated with potential social impact
were anticipated, and a rapid social assessment was conducted during preparation. No social
safeguard issue was identified. However social aspects beyond the mere compliance with social
safeguards may have been overlooked: the capacity of potential IPARD beneficiaries to present
financeable proposals was lower than expected, and private sector consultants were not able to fill
this gap as expected at project design (see paragraphs 29, 30, and 52). This contributed to a lower
than expected attraction of IPARD funding.

33.      The role of the main beneficiary in project preparation, MAFWE, has been more active
than in average World Bank-supported projects. The Government was strongly committed to the
project objectives, and the MAFWE took a leading role in designing project components and
activities.



                                                 6
2.2 Implementation

34.      Most project activities were properly implemented according to original plans. However,
delays in the construction of the building for the new headquarters of MAFWE required
extending the closing date. The initial four-year project implementation period was extended by
15 months. This extension was essential to allow completion of the building construction and
achievement of the PDO. The delays were caused by the severe weather in the winter of 2010 and
the termination of the contract in the middle of the construction of the new building because the
contractor did not comply with its contractual obligations. This required a long re-tendering
process which caused a delay of more than one year. At preparation, the Government had asked
for a three-year implementation period, in line with its expectations about the EU accession
process. The Bank team suggested a longer (4 years) implementation period, despite which the
project required additional two closing date extensions.

35.      The project has not been fundamentally changed. It has been considered at risk only for a
short period of time in 2012 when implementation was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory due to
the liquidity problems mentioned below (see paragraph 44). It was restructured in March 2010 to
increase the Loan financing percentage to 100% to help the Project better weather the global
financial crisis. It was also amended in January 2011 to extend the closing date and make minor
adjustments to project activities and result framework.

36.     There was a mid-term review mission in December 2009. The mid-term review mission
was well staffed, including fiduciary and safeguard specialists. The mission focused on the
project’s overall progress in meeting its original objectives but did not review the result
framework.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

37.    M&E was properly designed, implemented and utilized. Still there were some moderate
weaknesses listed below.

38.     Results framework and indicators. The PDO is susceptible to different interpretations
and the indicators selected did not clarify this ambiguity (see paragraph 52). Some indicators are
repeated and used both as PDO and intermediate indicators. For instance:
               PDO Indicator 1 combines the development of 5 systems: (a) Policy Analysis and
                Agriculture Information System Department (PAAISD), (b) Farm Registry,
                (c) Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), (d) Market Information System
                (MIS) and (e) Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Then Intermediate
                Indicator 3 repeated the Market Information System (MIS) and Farm
                Accountancy Data Network (FADN).
               Intermediate Indicator 5 (“Potential IPARD beneficiaries apply using correct
                procedures?) uses a target which is not fully consistent with the indicator: “95%
                of the planned IPARD funds for the calendar year committed, 80% of previous
                year commitments disbursed?. The wording of the indicator refers to the quality
                of procedures, which is already captured under PDO indicator 2 “EU IPARD
                funds are paid to farmers in an EU-compliant manner?. However the target
                relates to the amounts committed and disbursed, which depend on a set of factors,
                including absorption capacity. It is also not clear why this indicator was
                considered “intermediate?, since other PDO indicators are prerequisite to attract



                                                 7
                IPARD funding (see paragraph 28). This created some confusion about the
                actual objective.

39.     Frequency of monitoring report. At design, production of only annual M&E reports
was envisaged. However, during implementation it became evident that this reporting frequency
was inadequate to allow effective monitoring. The project would have benefitted from more
frequent updates.

40.     Implementation. During project implementation the Project Team prepared regular and
useful monitoring reports, which were reviewed, discussed, and improved by the Bank team.
However, after closing the Borrower did not prepare the Borrower’s final project evaluation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

41.      Procurement. The Project Unit management of procurement processes is assessed as
satisfactory. The team of the Project Unit, comprising a Project Coordinator, Procurement
Specialist, Financial Management Specialist and a Project Assistant, was based in the MAFWE.
The unit was responsible for overall coordination and management of the project, including all
the activities of the procurement plan.

42.      Procurement was carried out in line with the applicable Procurement and Consultant
Guidelines, in a diligent, professional and timely manner. There were no deviations from the
agreed provisions during the process. Procurement filing was also good. All documentation
related to each procurement procedure was duly filed and readily available. Most of the contracts
were implemented on time. The project team and the Procurement Specialist properly managed
the procurement process and contract implementation, as well as the recording of processes and
file maintenance. There were two serious or extraordinary contract implementation issues:

       Implementation of the civil works contract for the construction of the new headquarters
        of MAFWE took much longer than planned. The delays were caused by the termination
        of the contract in the middle of the construction of the new building because the
        contractor did not comply with its contractual obligations. The implementing agency did
        apply the performance guarantee, thus limiting the financial losses. Still, the procurement
        process had to be repeated, leading to a delay of more than one year. This was the main
        cause for extending the project closing date; and

       Availability of funds for contracts procured and signed under the project was spotty.
        Although most contracts were paid on time and within the prescribed timeline, some were
        paid with delays. There was one period when several contracts were not signed due to
        lack of liquidity. This issue was systemic, affecting the entire FYR Macedonia portfolio,
        and was caused in part by the financial crisis which started in 2009. Towards the end of
        the project the issue was addressed and implementation improved.

43.      Financial Management. The financial management arrangements of the project in terms
of budgeting, accounting, flow of funds, internal controls, financial reporting and external audits
are assessed as satisfactory. Acceptable software was used for project accounting and financial
reporting. The flow of funds was channeled via a Designated Account (DA) opened in Euros at
the National Bank of FYR Macedonia and a transit account in Macedonian Denars opened in the
Treasury for local currency payments. Quarterly Interim un-audited Financial Reports (IFRs)
were submitted timely to the Bank in format and substance agreed and they were assessed to be
reliable. The project financial statements were audited by eligible auditors from the World Bank


                                                 8
list of approved audit firms and the reports were submitted to the Bank according to agreed
deadlines. The auditors issued a clean (unmodified) opinion in all audits of annual project
financial statements. The last audit report for the project is expected to cover 2012 (plus any
payments in the grace period that ended April 30, 2013) and be submitted to the Bank by June 30,
2013. The World Bank team carried out field reviews annually throughout project
implementation and confirmed that the internal controls and procedures instituted for the project
were adequate.

44.      However, as outlined above, there was a systemic issue that affected implementation. All
projects in the portfolio of the country faced significant liquidity constraints (that became
particularly acute during the first part of 2012), causing delays in payments to suppliers. Even
when 100 percent of the expenditures were financed from IBRD Loans, the majority of World
Bank-funded projects in FYR Macedonia registered liquidity cuts because of ceilings imposed in
the State Budget due to tight fiscal targets. The situation was remedied in September 2012 when
the government provided additional project financing and overdue payments (including for the
construction of the new Ministry building) were completed.

45.      Environmental safeguards. The Project is rated Category B. In accordance with the
Bank’s Operational Policy, this required a partial Environmental Analysis, but not a full-scale
Environmental Assessment. A report prepared during project design identified two areas of risk:
the construction of buildings, such as the headquarters of the MAFWE, and equipment for
veterinary and food laboratories and particularly in the handling of wastes generated by these two
activities. Supervision missions were carried out regularly and confirmed that adequate mitigation
measures were implemented.

46.     The project produced additional environmental benefits. It provided training for
laboratory personnel and thus contributed to increase environmental safety of existing
laboratories. Also, as result of building modernization, there were some energy savings, however
these were not quantified. The project could have applied for an energy rating of the new building,
which would have contributed to creating further awareness about energy efficiency and savings.

47.     Social safeguards. Social safeguards were not triggered. The building of headquarters of
the MAFWE did not cause any involuntary resettlement because the project reconstructed an
existing building and thus it did not entail land acquisition.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

48.     The operation and maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms, and institutional
capacity are all assessed positively. The Bank’s policy dialogue, conducted in parallel with its
support of the project, did contribute to significantly increase attention to the agricultural sector.
The government has now taken a lead position in supporting the sector, in most cases adopting
EU-compliant approaches.

49.     No follow-up project has been envisaged nor is one considered necessary for the
operation and maintenance of investments carried out under the project. EU accession remains an
important policy objective of the Borrower, and it is expected to continue maintaining
independently a long term dialogue with EU institutions on the EU accession process.

50.     Conversely, the challenges of the agricultural sector in FYR Macedonia are far from
being solved, and a new operation to support the sector could be useful. Further, a recent World
Bank regional study has identified climate change as another important challenge for Macedonian


                                                   9
agriculture. The upcoming CPS will provide a useful framework to discuss with the Government
the modalities of Bank support, to help the country address these challenges.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

51.     The objective is fully consistent with the country’s priorities and the Bank Partnership
Strategy. To improve the delivery of government assistance to the agriculture sector in a manner
consistent with the EU pre-accession requirements was – and still remains – an extremely
important Government objective. This objective is also fully in line with the FY2007-11 World
Bank Partnership Strategy for the FYR of Macedonia.

52.      There were, however, some weaknesses in design. The selected indicators did not
sufficiently clarify the PDO objective to “improve the delivery of government assistance?.
“Improvement? can be interpreted in two different ways: (i) improvement in terms of quality of
government assistance such as improved targeting, transparency, efficiency, and capacity to track
public expenditures, and/or (ii) improvement of capacity to attract EU funding for the sector in
quantitative terms. While most indicators track the “improved delivery? of IPARD funding in
terms of quality (through the adoption of systems which increase efficiency, targeting, etc.),
indicator 5 sets an ambitious amount of EU funding for the sector. As a consequence of this lack
of clarity, project design did not sufficiently address all the gaps that hindered the capacity to
attract the ambitious amount of EU funding. In particular, the project did not sufficiently
strengthen farmers’ capacity to prepare proposals which comply with all EU requirements. This
proved to be a weakness which contributed to the shortcoming in achieving the quantitative target
of attracting IPARD funds.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

53.      The achievement of the PDO as spelled out in the project documents is assessed as
moderately satisfactory. Project activities directly contributed to improving the delivery of
government assistance to the agriculture sector in a manner consistent with the EU pre-accession
requirements. There were, however, some moderate shortcomings in terms of achieving the
targets of attracting IPARD funding and water user fee collection, which triggered the moderately
satisfactory rating.

54.     The ICR team met with EU staff in the Delegation Office in Skopje, who confirmed that
the project helped FYR Macedonia to meet several prerequisites for EU negotiations and
accession. The EU accession documentation also attests to the country’s progress in this area. The
most recent EU report1 on the status of EU accession negotiations positively assessed progress on
Agriculture and Rural Development, Food safety, and Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy.

55.    The project achievements in helping the country establish an EU-compliant IACS system
for managing IPARD funds had a significant spillover effect on the management of the

                                                    10
agricultural subsidies that are funded by the national budget. Over the life of the project the
disbursements under the national budget for direct payments to agriculture producers and the
National Rural Development Fund grew from US$57 million in 2008 to US$132 million in 2011
(see Figure 1 below). The World Bank advised that the Paying Agency not to confine its
responsibility to IPARD payments only, but also channel the national support program. This was
a useful advice which allowed the control systems developed under the project to increase the
quality and efficiency of public assistance to the sector. The project investments in the IACS
system enabled the Paying Agency to administer these transfers in a more transparent manner,
thus reducing waste and decreasing the risk of fraud. The automated IT-based administrative
controls and the associated risk assessment modules were particularly helpful for ensuring
transparency of these substantial public funds transfers. The project investments in vehicles,
equipment, and systems of agriculture inspection were instrumental in improving the on-the-spot
controls of the subsidy program. The increased institutional capacity directly contributed to
increase effective governance in line with EU best practices.

56.      The project financing of the headquarters building of MAFWE – which absorbed almost
a third of project financing – generated important institutional, efficiency, and environmental
benefits. Before the project, the staff of the Ministry were scattered in several locations in the
capital city of Skopje, and had to travel from office to office to work together. Thanks to the
project they are now located in a central, safe, and efficient new building. This led to significant
savings in terms of rent, energy savings, reduced fuel waste for moving across various locations,
and computer servers that are safely hosting various IT databases.

57.      The project supported the Borrower’s efforts to streamline its Food Safety and Veterinary
institutional setup in accordance with the best EU practices. It helped establish the Food Safety
and Veterinary Agency by merging the relevant departments of the MAFWE (Veterinary) and
Ministry of Health (Sanitary Inspection). This was a major regulatory and enforcement capacity
advancement that many new member States are struggling to accomplish even at a more
advanced accession stage. This institutional reform brought together the country’s Food Safety
and Animal Health Authorities and by doing so, streamlined and improved consumer protection
as well as the inspection services it provides to the export/import industry. The project also
supported the new Food Agency by strengthening its inspection service capacity as well as by
equipment upgrades of the key laboratories. The increased capacity to monitor animal diseases
contributed to reducing the incidence of animal diseases such as brucellosis and tuberculosis, with
human health benefits and economic benefits in terms of livestock productivity.

58.      The project financed the restructuring of WMOs into WEs by financing the severance
payments of employees who were not considered useful to the restructured and streamlined
organization. This downsizing generated savings which are quantified in the economic analysis
below and helped irrigation management to become more sustainable. The management of the
new WEs is more demand-driven compared to the previous WMOs, and this allowed for
increasing operating cost recovery, even if the target was only partly achieved. The initial target
of 90% operating cost recovery was reduced to 60% of invoiced irrigation user fees in 2011.
According to the final report, 54% of invoiced fees were collected in 2011, down from 70% in
2010. While this shortfall has been assessed as minor, compared to a baseline of 10%,
nonetheless the drop from 2010 to 2011 suggests that the WEs are not yet sustainably recovering
their costs.

59.     The majority of targets spelled out in the results framework were achieved, and there is a
clear causal linkage between project activities, intermediate outcomes, and results. One indicator
was only partially achieved: intermediate indicator 5 stated “Potential IPARD beneficiaries apply


                                                 11
using correct procedures,? and had the target of “95% of the planned IPARD funds for the
calendar year committed, 80% of previous year commitments disbursed?. This target was only
partially achieved. Demand for IPARD funds was initially good, with fund applications totaling
about 95% of the EU allocation. However, only 27% of these applications were contracted. In
terms of funds, this represented a 33% achievement of the target. Disbursements, at 20% of
contacted amount, missed the target: only 8 percent of the target was achieved. Although these
results did not fully achieve the targets, they represent an important achievement when compared
with other accession countries such as Serbia and Turkey. Rather, the targets were overly
ambitious, in particular the disbursement target.

60.       The IPARD program is designed to be demand driven, and several factors played a major
role in its low absorption, many of which were outside the scope of the project. These included:
(i) weaknesses in the land administration system--applicants are required to provide land
ownership titles to be eligible for IPARD. But many farmers had outdated titles2 and the current
owners are not recorded in the cadaster records; (ii) many farm structures (buildings, machinery,
greenhouses, etc,) are not recorded in the cadaster records. Submitting ownership titles for these
to obtain IPARD funds is costly and time consuming; (iii) weak credit market—commercial
banks were reluctant to lend to agriculture, in part due to the poorly functioning land market. This
was further exacerbated by the financial and Eurozone crisis. This limited farmer access to the
required co-financing for and pre-financing of IPARD projects; (iv) significant documentary
requirements such as proofs of good financial condition, including evidences that he/she does not
carry arrears related to tax, pension and health insurance dues3; (v) inadequate advisory services
to assist the farmers in putting together the IPARD applications and implement the activities; and
(vi) inadequate complementary public infrastructure--the completion of numerous IPARD
investments have been postponed due to the delayed construction of access roads, potable water,
and electricity connections.

59.      In addition to the limited capacity of applications to achieve the minimal requirements to
get contracted, there were two external factors that significantly increased the challenge of
attracting IPARD funding. The 2009 global financial crisis, whose impact is not yet over, did
reduce the incentive to invest while reducing the borrowing capacity of potential beneficiaries.
This curbed demand and some applications were rejected because the applicants could not
confirm availability of financial resources. Under the IPARD program, farmers have to pre-
finance the approved investment and the grant is awarded only after the investment is completed.
Thus availability of funds up-front is critical, and this became challenging when the credit crunch
occurred due to the financial crisis. In addition, the global financial crisis contributed to the 2010
Eurozone crisis, which in turn reduced EU appetite for enlargement while increasing rigidity in
the application of IPARD requirements. Neither of these factors could have been predicted at
appraisal.

60.     Even though the IPARD target was not fully achieved, the project was still able to attract
EUR 3.0 million in IPARD grants paid to beneficiaries. EUR 15.4 million have been contracted
with beneficiaries, out of a total allocation of EUR 66.5 million for the 2007-2012 period (see


2
  This was mainly due to the unfinished inheritance proceedings where the heirs of a deceased landowner have not
completed the required court proceedings. Thus these ownership changes are not reflected in cadaster records.

3
  The IPARD program has been amended four times since its inception to simplify the application
procedure/requirements.




                                                         12
Figure 1 below). It is expected that a large share of these contracted funds will soon be disbursed.
Thus the activity was still able to produce significant benefits, even during a harsh financial crisis
such as the one that started in 2009. This shortcoming has been assessed as moderate. Notably,
the low absorption of the IPARD was recognized by the government and was compensated to
some extent by an increase in support for rural investments through the national budget.

                         Figure 1 – FYR Macedonia. Public Support to Agriculture4




61.      In summary, the project was successful in setting up a Paying Agency which is
processing not only IPARD payments but also much larger national government transfers to
agriculture in a way compatible with EU requirements. A functioning agency of this kind is
useful regardless of EU membership, and therefore satisfactory outcome rating is robust. At the
same time, the following design factor did not allow the project to be fully satisfactory. Because
the team needed to unite the three disparate parts under one operation, the scope was a bit
ambiguous and some results indicators fell outside the project's scope. In this respect, improved
absorption of IPARD was an overambitious objective given project design focused mostly on the
supply side, that is only a part of the IPARD absorption story, while important constraints to
absorption lie on the demand side.

3.3 Efficiency

62.     Project efficiency in economic terms is evaluated as satisfactory. An ex-ante economic
and financial analysis was carried out at project appraisal, and an ex-post analysis compared the
actual project results and performance with the baseline situation applying the same analytical
approaches and methods.

63.     As shown in Table 1 below, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of Component 1 was
not quantified at appraisal, while the ex-post analysis quantified it only for the headquarters
building. The ERR of Component 2 was lower than estimated at appraisal because of the limited
achievement in terms of attracting IPARD funds. The ERR was slightly lower than at appraisal

    The second IPARD call for 2012 is not included because it is still under review.



                                                   13
for Component 3. The analysis at appraisal did not quantify the overall ERR, which the ex-post
analysis estimated at 23.8 percent, and a net present value of EUR 8.2 million.

64.       Sensitivity Analysis. An analysis to test the sensitivity of the economic results to various
scenarios was carried out for this report. In a hypothetical scenario, under which the country did
not attract any IPARD funds, the project ERR would have dropped to 16.5%, which is low, but
still significantly above the 12% discount rate. Conversely, if the country had attracted IPARD
funds as per initial target, the project ERR would have increased to 41.8%.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

65.      The overall ratings are justified on the basis of the important and clear project
contribution to achieving the PDO of improving the delivery of government assistance to the
agriculture sector in a manner consistent with EU pre-accession requirements. This objective was
and remains relevant to the country, even if the initial prospects for rapid EU accession were not
realized. Project efficiency is assessed as satisfactory given the good ex-post rate of return of the
project. All indicators were achieved except for the IPARD and irrigation water fee collection
target. The above considerations led to the moderately satisfactory rating.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
66.      The project contributed to alleviate poverty by increasing quality and efficiency of
Government assistance to the agricultural sector, in particular in terms of improved subsidy
program, reduction of zoonoses (diseases which affect both animals and humans), and
restructuring of irrigation. Agriculture has traditionally been important as a social buffer,
absorbing rural unemployment, alleviating poverty by supplementing incomes and food in rural
areas, where poverty is concentrated. Indeed the Government maintains that support to agriculture
responds to important social development objectives.

67.      Gender aspects were not envisaged at project design. IPARD has the objective to
promote gender equality, and to achieve this, women applicants get some advantages. However
there is no information available to prove that any gender objective was achieved.




                                                 14
68.      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The project achieved important institutional strengthening objectives. It significantly contributed
to strengthen the capacity of the MAFWE and the PA to implement agricultural policies and
attract EU funding. The capacity of MAFWE to monitor public support programs increased
significantly. This reduced waste and frauds and increased efficiency, targeting, and capacity to
track public expenditures. It also increased the capacity to monitor and control zoonoses. The
reduced incidence of brucellosis and tuberculosis, both in animals and humans, generated benefits
for the human population and in terms of animal productivity. Improved veterinary and food
safety services also helped to access profitable EU markets, where the borrower is exporting.
Finally, the project helped restructuring local irrigation institutions thus improving their
sustainability, even if this task is not yet fully completed.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
69.      There were no unintended outcomes and impacts, except for the positive impacts which
are related to the improved governance of the Government support program to the sector (see
paragraph 55 above) and those related to increase efficiency thanks to the new building of the
MAFWE (paragraph 56 above).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
70.    There was no beneficiary survey.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

71.      The institutional changes supported by the project fit into the broader framework
necessary for EU accession. The mechanisms developed under the project will continue to help
adjust the national agricultural policy and eventually, upon accession, inform the Common
Agricultural Policy. The institutions which were supported under the project will in the future
need to report to supra-national bodies, such as the European Food Safety Agency. The
Government will therefore need to continue to deliver its government assistance to the agriculture
sector in a manner consistent with the European Union's principles. Even if the EU accession
process were to falter, the Borrower is expected to continue to use the mechanisms developed
under the project to support its agricultural sector, and to continue to address food safety both for
its own domestic market and to access the EU market. The relationships with the EU are expected
to remain strong with or without accession. For these reasons, the risk assessment for this
component is assessed as low.

72.      The amount of own funds that the Government has allocated to support the sector
(outside of the project, see paragraph 55) is a strong evidence of the relevance of the agricultural
sector for the Borrower. Further, the instruments developed by the project can continue to be used
to improve governance of the public support system. The risks that the institutional systems
developed by the project to improve efficiency, transparency, targeting, and capacity to track
public support to the sector are therefore negligible.

73.     Food safety will remain a key factor both for the domestic and the EU market, so the risk
that emphasis on these activities will be reduced is assessed as low.

74.    The risk for the fourth component - Completing Irrigation Sector Reform - is higher.
Even though the project supported important steps to improve sustainability of the Water
Economies, their sustainability remains challenging, and the Government will need to continue



                                                 15
making efforts to further improve and reform the irrigation sector. If it was not for this
component, the overall risk rating would have been rated as Negligible to Low.

75.     The overall risk rating for the project was assessed as moderate taking into account the
different risk profiles for each component.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.     The World Bank team prepared a good project in record time and with a minimal budget,
responding to the Borrower’s request for rapid support. However project design suffered some
moderate shortcomings in terms of clarity of the objective to attract IPARD funding and
addressing the gaps to achieve this objective.

77.     The team was experienced and knowledgeable, applied lessons learned in similar
countries, such as stressing the importance of developing systems required to get EU
accreditation. Design built on previous experience of investment operations and technical
assistance, including technical assistance funded by the EU. The World Bank team added value,
complementing the Borrower’s effort, by improving some important design features, such as
having the paying agency be responsible for all payments to the sector, not just those related to
EU funded activities. This institutional strengthening increased significantly the benefits
produced by the project.

78.      The lack of clarity in PDO and indicators contributed to lower than planned attraction of
IPARD funds despite strong demand. Gaps in capacity to produce acceptable IPARD
applications were overlooked. A clearer statement of the indicators at the outset would have
helped to better focus supervision. The impact of this shortcoming was exacerbated by the
expectation at project design, which proved overly optimistic in retrospect, that the country would
quickly join the EU, passing from IPARD to the easier-to-implement CAP. The financial crisis
which started in 2009, also contributed to exacerbate these shortcomings. Since the financial
crisis could not be predicted, these shortcomings are assessed as moderate, warranting overall a
moderately satisfactory rating.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.     The World Bank team carried out regular supervision missions producing good quality
and useful aide-memoires and supervision reports. However the Bank supervision team also did
not pay sufficient attention to the target of attracting IPARD funding.

80.      A mid-term supervision mission was carried out at an appropriate time and with an
adequate mix of specialists. The World Bank showed flexibility when accommodating the
Borrower’s reduction in financing after the 2009 financial crisis. These elements significantly
contributed to overcome implementation difficulties and thus contributed to project success.
However supervision could have been more pro-active once it became evident that EU accession
was not happening as fast as initially envisaged. The supervision team could have restructured the
project to adapt to this new situation. Restructuring could have helped address the bottlenecks



                                                 16
that were limiting the uptake of IPARD funds, and would likely have led to a scaling down of the
excessively optimistic target for Intermediate Indicator 5.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

81.      The Bank’s contribution was important to the project’s achievements, yet greater
attention to IPARD related activities during both the design and supervision phases might have
allowed for timely identification and remediation of key factors affecting full achievement of the
PDO.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82.     The Government demonstrated commitment throughout design and implementation of
the project. While lack of liquidity caused some implementation shortcomings, and considerable
time elapsed before the issue was addressed, the root cause was the exogenous shock of the
Eurozone crisis. The use of systems developed under the project to implement and monitor the
Government support program to the sector, thus improving governance, efficiency, targeting, and
capacity to track the Government funded agricultural support program. This is a good indication
of a forward-looking and progressive approach.

83.      Without these implementation shortcomings, the implementing agency and the World
Bank team could have better focused on more important issues, such as the limited ability to
effectively access IPARD funds.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

84.      The MAFWE played a key role in project design and implementation. This generated
positive coordination between international organizations, in particular EU and World Bank. The
Project Team was small yet staffed with qualified and energetic consultants who overcame most
implementation obstacles. Project activities were implemented by regular staff of the Ministry
and all component coordinators were staff from within the regular units. The project team focused
on following World Bank procurement and procedures, which helped strengthen the capacity of
the line Ministry, including Veterinary Services and Water Economies Directorate, and the
Paying Agency.

85.     However, the implementing agency did not produce a final project evaluation. Project
benefits could have been better presented and quantified if the implementing agency had prepared
a comprehensive and robust final evaluation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

86.     The Borrower designed and implemented a successful project, yet some adjustments
would likely have allowed for greater progress towards the PDO. The overall Borrower
performance is in line with the Overall Outcome Rating.




                                                17
6. Lessons Learned
      Leveraging funds from other institutions, as in the case IPARD funds from the EU,
       is a complex process which requires strong coordination and partnership. Partnering
       with the EU proved to be highly beneficial to the project which was built on a set of
       analysis carried out by EU consultants. This ensured aid coordination across a common
       objective to help the Borrower meet the EU accession agenda in the agricultural sector
       and satisfied the necessary institutional arrangements. But this coordination effort is also
       costly in terms of time and funding since it requires frequent meetings, trainings, and
       travel. In view of the number of stakeholders, it would be important in the future to plan
       for additional meetings, trainings, and travel;
      Institutional development does take time, and in fact the original implementation
       period was not sufficient. Even to complete the construction of the headquarters building
       during the four years of implementation period was challenging. Given the institutional
       development focus of the project, the balance between infrastructure, equipment, and
       technical assistance is often difficult to reach. The Government was eager to use existing
       TA funded under the EU, but coordination and proper sequencing is not always easy to
       achieve;
      The institutional setting where project activities were coordinated by long-term staff of
       the relevant units of MAFWE. This contributed to project sustainability in the long run,
       but it also created implementation delays in the short run. Given the long term
       institutional objectives of the project, this is to be considered as a useful arrangement;
       and
      Institutional development of irrigation management is a long and continuous process.
       The period since the previous centralized socialist irrigation institutions started to reform
       has not yet been sufficient to complete the decentralization process to make them fully
       demand-driven and financially sustainable. In climatic conditions where irrigation is
       supplemental (i.e., where irrigation supplements natural precipitation, such as in the FYR
       Macedonia), this process is going to take even longer, since in some years irrigation may
       be of limited benefit. Because of this, a continued Government commitment is
       imperative.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Strengthening MAFWE’s administrative and management capacity in
accordance with EU accession requirements

90.     The component established the administrative structures required to handle EU funds and
ensure compliance. This included an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS),
which includes a computerized database to record aid applications and payments, a Farm Register,
a Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), and an Animal Registration and Identification
System. In addition, a standardized Agricultural Information System (AIS) was developed. It
comprises a Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), Agricultural Statistics (AS) including
Economic Accounts for Agriculture (EAA), and a Market Information System (MIS).

1 (a) Initiation of an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)
91.      Before the project, MAFWE already had some elements of the structures required for the
IACS, but the system was not fully computerized and few farmers were registered. The databases
were not integrated and the institutional and technical management systems were still at an early
stage. The Government had an Animal Identification and Registration System operated by the
Veterinary Department and nearly all cattle had been registered, with ear tags, and an effective
reporting and database system is in place. The Land Parcel Register based on aerial surveys was
available for some regions. The MAFWE has been implementing a pilot vineyard cadaster project
supported by an EU-funded project that covered about one-third of the area under vineyards. In
this case, parcel information along with ownership characteristics are transferred into digitalized
form based on aerial survey maps.

92.      The project supported the development of an integrated Farm Register, with information
characteristics that describe agricultural holdings in terms of farm ownership, physical production
structure and support scheme claims. The system is required for policy formulation and
administration of support policies in the agricultural sector. The Farm Register was integrated
with databases and registers already existing, including the Animal Identification and Registration
System and the Vineyard Cadaster System. The Farm Register Unit is responsible for
management of the Farm Register. The project provided appropriate IT (hardware and software),
based on a common IT platform with proven consistency through operational procedures and
methodology for data flow and data management. Along with the design of the technical
infrastructure, the project also provided training of dedicated MAFWE personnel from the Policy
Analysis and AIS Department, and provided financial support for establishing the system and
technical assistance as required.

93.      The project supported the development of a Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS),
which together with the Farm Register forms the backbone of an efficient system for the
administration and control of national policies and programs for direct support in the agriculture
sector. Information on agricultural land parcels and ownership characteristics is maintained and
continuously updated on the register by the Land Register Unit of the Land Policy Department in
MAFWE. Being part of the IACS, the LPIS is linked with the integrated Farm Register managed
by the Policy Analysis and AIS Department. The project also helped furnish regional offices, and
provided training and technical assistance as required.




                                                20
1 (b) Establishment of Agriculture Information System (AIS)
94.      MAFWE, as the state institution responsible for agriculture and agricultural information,
needs to set up a standardized agriculture information system (AIS). AIS can differ among
countries, but particularly in the EU and in the candidate countries the minimum components
required for EU harmonization include: Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), Agricultural
Statistics (AS) including Economic Accounts for Agriculture (EAA) and Market Information
System (MIS).

95.      The Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) is an important component of the AIS,
being the basic tool used in the creation of the CAP. MAFWE had established some elements of
the FADN, but there was no overall system to monitor the economic standing of agricultural
holdings and therefore it did not comply with the EU standards. The Farm Monitoring System
(FMS), which is operated by the National Extension Agency (NEA) based in Bitola, provided
data from individual farms and was the only financial and technical survey on farm economics in
the country. The system had been in place since 2001, with a computer network installed
throughout the regional offices, and was updated in order to comply with the quality of collection
and processing of data to the standards needed for introduction of the national network for
monitoring and collection of accounting data of the farms. However, the system included only a
small number (less than 450) of surveyed farms, and budgetary limitations have restricted the
collection of data over recent months. The project provided the necessary know-how and
financial support for sustained implementation of the FADN. The project provided technical
assistance, training of staff and financial support for operating the FMS to a satisfactory level,
including regular visits to participating farmers and with a sufficient sample size. The FADN was
developed by the NEA and the Liaison Agency under oversight of MAFWE staff in the Policy
Analysis and AIS Department.

96.      The Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) is an important and useful service
for small farmers in re-orienting their commercial production, through facilitating arbitrage and
price convergence across regions and greatly increasing the efficiency of markets. The AMIS is
able to continuously provide the Government with relevant information on prices and quantities
traded internally and externally, which are of key for business and policy formulation. The
development of a sustainable AMIS, especially for some important agricultural sub-sectors, is
also required for the process of establishment of the Common Market Organization under the
CAP. Before the project, the Agricultural Unit of the State Statistical Office (SSO) collected
prices on a weekly basis and published reports on a monthly basis. Prices are collected at
wholesale, livestock and at green markets in different locations. They include the highest price,
the lowest price and the most frequent one, but averages were not calculated. There was limited
analysis of the data. The integrated system developed within MAFWE for policy formulation and
monitoring as well as for reporting purposes to the EU at the time of accession. Different
stakeholders were associated in establishing the system, such as groups of producers and SSO,
but MAFWE will be responsible for organizing the integrated system needed for policy
formulation and monitoring as well as for EU reporting purposes. The project provided the
necessary IT equipment; training of staff; financial support for market data collection and
dissemination and other proposed market-related activities; and technical assistance as required.
The SSO will continue to be a source of data for the AMIS along with other sources.

1 (c) Strengthening the State Agricultural Inspectorate
97.      It is expected that EU accession will place additional burden on the State Agricultural
Inspectorate (SAI). Inspections play an important role in the different aid schemes financed by
pre-accession and later on CAP funds, by controlling and verifying the facts on which payments
are made. The integrated control system as a part of the overall IACS consisted of administrative


                                                21
checks on aid applications including a verification of the eligible area and the corresponding
payment entitlements, supplemented by a system of on-the-spot checks to verify eligibility for aid.

98.      At the beginning of the project, fewer than 30 agricultural inspectors were in charge of
controlling and monitoring the implementation of around 20 legal acts under the competence of
MAFWE. The agricultural inspectors performed tasks based on the former Yugoslav legal
framework and their linkages with other relevant inspection services were weak or non-existent.
Their organization, human capacity and technical equipping did not seem able to respond to
existing responsibilities, let alone future responsibilities.

99.     The project improved the ability of the agriculture inspection services to carry out their
duties within the context of harmonization with the EU acquis communautaire by improving the
control procedures, technical skills, and operational efficiency of the SAI. The project supported
the improvement and streamlining of:

       The organization of the Agriculture Inspection Services and their role in MAFWE,
        including cooperation with other MAFWE organizational units, governmental bodies,
        and coordination/unification with other inspection services.
       The internal organizational structure of the Agriculture Inspection Services.
       The working procedures and methodologies, including timing of checks, number of
        checks performed, work plans and reporting, size of control samples, sample-taking
        methodology, and financial consequences of non-compliance.
       The technical, communication and transportation resources available to the Agricultural
        Inspection Service.
       The human resources of the inspection services and training of inspectors.
       The internal supervision and quality control of the inspection work, to ensure
        transparency, fairness, etc.

1 (d) Establishing adequate institutional capacity in MAFWE
100.    The establishment and further functioning of the IACS, AIS and Agriculture Inspection
Services required adequate administrative capacity. MAFWE was reorganized and established a
more functional structure by putting in place new organizational units, transforming the existing
units and strengthening the internal procedures for increasing efficiency. Units established and/or
strengthened include the Policy Analysis and AIS Department, the Project Cycle Management
Unit, the Human Resources Development Unit, the Budget Planning Unit, and the MAFWE
regional offices. The project supported capacity-building needs in the Rural Development
Department under Component 2. Under Component 1, the project established or strengthened the
capacity of the following administrative departments or units of MAFWE:

       Policy Analysis and AIS Department: This department developed appropriate human and
        technical capacity, including training on quantitative techniques for impact assessment of
        policy and regulatory changes, especially those related to approximation with the EU
        acquis, and to support reforms during the EU accession process. The department
        established and operated the integrated farm register, and it is providing suitable inter-
        institutional cooperation and/or managing the process of contracting different institutions
        in the FADN and MIS system, including providers of extension services, agricultural
        research, education and statistics etc. The project provided support for training of staff in



                                                 22
            the department as well as IT equipment described for the registers and databases; and
            incremental operating costs.
           Project Cycle Management Unit: The project built capacity for a Project Cycle
            Management Unit. The project provided support for training of at least four new
            employees (PCM specialists) to ensure the Unit’s operational effectiveness.
           Human Resources (HR) Development Unit: The project provided technical assistance,
            training, and other resources for the strengthening of the HR Development Unit that
            became able to perform training needs assessments that form the basis for the preparation
            of an annual training program for MAFWE employees, as well as to undertake the
            following regular HR activities: HR planning and analysis; equal employment
            opportunity; staffing; HR development; compensation and benefits; health, safety, and
            security; and employee and labor/management Relations.

  101.    A large share of the funds for this component went to finance the re-building of the
  MAFWE headquarters. The new building is much larger than the previous one and can
  accommodate most staff of the ministry in one location. The new building is safer and more
  energy efficient, more elegant and orderly, and was designed to host computer servers and other
  IT equipment for the safe storage of data.

  Component 2: Supporting MAFWE’s ability to deliver EU rural development funds

  2 (a) Supporting establishment of the IPARD Paying Agency (PA)
  102.    This component supported the government’s efforts to overhaul its agriculture policy
  implementation capacity by establishing an EU-compliant IPARD Paying Agency (PA) and by
  strengthening MAFWE’s Rural Development Department. This investment advances MAFWE’s
  capacity to administer the dedicated national (CAP pillar 1 aligned) and EU (CAP pillar 2
  modeled IPARD program) funds in a more transparent and equitable manner over the pre-
  accession period. Thanks to this component, the PA was accredited by the EU in 2009 and the
  Borrower was able to attract EU IPARD funds, even if the quantity of fund attracted did not
  achieve the target (see table below).

2 (b) Supporting PA capacity building needs
103.    The project supported the PA’s capacity building needs for: (a) taking over the
responsibility for the administration of the national direct agriculture payments; and
(b) administering the newly accredited measures under the IPARD program. The project
introduced a system of checks and controls for the payments of the national subsidies in the
context of setting up an IACS. It helped adopt the Farm Registry, whose development was
supported by Component 1. The Farm Registry enabled the PA to implement the administrative
and control functions for the direct agriculture payments.

104.     The project supports the PA in its efforts to: (a) establish beneficiary entitlement registry;
(b) develop farmer claims procedures and manuals; (c) determine risk analysis principles
including cross checks and on-the-spot checks; (d) design a cross-compliance control system; (e)
digitize authorization, payment, accountancy and control systems; and (f) draft manuals defining
IACS procedures.

105.    Since 2007, these systems administered US$487 million of various national programs to
support the agricultural sector.

2 (c) Supporting an IPARD-tailored capacity-building program for rural advisory services
106.     The project helped farmers and beneficiaries to apply for IPARD funding. It helped
preparing the IPARD applications, proofs of eligibility for funding in the form of various official
documents to prove that the individual or the business is not overly indebted, has been involved
in farming and/or processing business for a number of years, does not have tax or social payments
arrears, owns the land and/or business premises, has obtained the necessary permits if any civil
works are to be funded, the investments comply with the national and/or EU environmental
protection requirements, and others.

107.     An important and forward-looking feature of the IPARD program is that often a portion
of the grant is earmarked for purchasing advisory services. The share of these dedicated funds
increases with the complexity of the investments that are supported by a particular measure. Thus,
the IPARD program increased the demand for competent consultants. In this regard, the project
provided technical assistance to support MAFWE introducing quality assurance for the IPARD-
specific advisory services, both publicly and privately provided. It also supported the PA in
coordination with MAFWE to develop IPARD specific training modules that were advertised
nationwide which were open to all interested parties at no charge However, shortcomings of this
activity may have contributed to the high share of IPARD applications rejected.

2 (d) Supporting capacity-building in the Rural Development Department
108.     The Rural Development Department in MAFWE was restructured due to the separation
of its previous implementation function from the newly-established Paying Agency. The project
upgraded MAFWE’s capacity as the managing authority for programming, monitoring and
evaluation of rural development programs through training of employees, and support for a
working group of experts established to prepare multi-annual IPARD plans and carry out ex-ante
evaluations.

Component 3: Developing effective veterinary services




                                                      24
109.     Due to legislative gaps, institutional weaknesses and insufficient control mechanisms, the
Borrower’s food safety capacity was assessed as weak at appraisal. The project contributed to
increase testing and certification practices to meet standards in agricultural export markets. In the
area of food safety, the main legal development had been the transposition of the EU regulation
178/2002 into the national Food Law in 2002, aligning national food safety standards with some,
but not all of the principles of the EU regulation.
110.     Before the project, institutional responsibilities in relation to the enforcement of national
food safety standards were dispersed over different directorates and agencies within different
Ministries. The Food Directorate of the Ministry of Health is responsible for inspection of food
safety in general, whereas MAFWE’s Veterinary Directorate (VD) and Directorate for Plant
Protection (DPP) were responsible for controlling livestock and plant health. The project helped
establish the unified Food Safety and Veterinary Agency by merging the relevant departments of
the MAFWE (Veterinary) and Ministry of Health (Sanitary Inspection). This institutional reform
brought together the country’s Food Safety and Animal Health Authorities and by doing so,
streamlined and improved consumer protection as well as the inspection services it provides to
the export/import industry.

3 (a) Strengthening the Veterinary Directorate (VD)
111.     The VD plays a critical role in modernizing the livestock and meat processing sector, as
well as improving compliance with relevant legislation that will come into force as part of the
adoption of the EU acquis. The project supported the implementation of the VD business plan and
the consequent strengthening of the veterinary services through the following investments:

       Training and study tours to upgrade specialized knowledge and exchange implementation
        experience with existing EU member countries.
       Information technology to develop the Veterinary Information System (VIS)
       Testing equipment for veterinary inspectors to collect samples.
       Vehicles for veterinary inspectors.
       Equipment such as containers, mass culling, gas applicators, and pumps for disinfection
        for contingency plan implementation to combat disease such as FMD, swine fever, and
        avian flu.
       Equipment, including ear tags, a GIS system and GPS devices, PDA readers (portable
        barcode readers) to complete Animal Identification and Registration activity, focusing on
        small ruminants (sheep and goats).
       A feasibility study for options regarding collection, transport, disposal of contaminated
        animal by-products (regional landfills in combination with incinerators, or other
        solutions), an environmental impact assessment for the option that is selected, and
        resources for financing selected option.
       Public awareness campaign directed to producers (slaughterhouses, dairies, food
        processing SMEs, especially those exporting to the EU) informing them of design and
        construction criteria for farms and processing units, requirements to production and
        marketing of safe foods (GMP. HACCP etc.), including for export markets.

3 (b) Strengthening the Veterinary Laboratory (VL) and the Food Institute Laboratory
(FIL)




                                                 25
112.    The laboratory provides services to the VD on a contractual basis. The project supported
their ISO 17025 certification and national accreditation and international accreditation for a range
of important tests. A total of 7 health and 68 food hygiene tests were accredited. The project
supported upgrading the VL and the FIL through investments in equipment.

Component 4: Completing reform of irrigation sector

4 (a) Liquidation of WMOs
113.    The project supported the completion of the liquidation of 5 WMOs with liquidation
procedures already initiated (WMO “Vodostopanstvo-Kumanovo? in Kumanovo; WMO
“Vodostopanstvo-Pelagonija? in Bitola; WMO “Sterna? in Prilep; WMO “Malesevsko Pole? in
Berovo; and WMO Vodostopanstvo “Vardar? in Skopje) and 4 WMOs still under operation
(WMO “Ohridsko Ezero? in Ohrid; WMO “Mantovo? in Radovis; WMO “Strumi~ki sliv? in
Strumica; and WMO “Gevgelisko-Valandovsko Pole?).

114.    Severance payments: The size of the severance packages was established by the Court,
and amounted to €2 million, net of pension payments and social contributions already settled by
the government.

115.     The Bank loan financed 100% of the severance package costs associated with these four
WMOs, i.e. expenditures for severance payments, limited compensations for arrears (salaries and
allowance) towards retrenched staff, and pension and social contributions for about 1,100 staff.
In addition, the project financed the cost of audit of the 4 WMOs to be liquidated and the cost of a
local expert to assist with the overall liquidation process. Payments for the severance package
were made against the staff listed in the auditor's report.

4 (b) Establishing new Water Economies (WEs)
116.    The project supported the establishment of 6 WEs, namely WE Kumanovo, WE
Strumica-Radovis, WE Pelagonia, WE Prilepsko-Pole, WE Skopsko-Pole, and WE
Ju’novardarska Dolino. The project provided the newly established WEs with some initial
financial support to carry out their new functions. This support included some initial basic
equipment and technical expertise to assist with the overall process. Thanks to the project effort,
water fee payments by members of the eater economies increased from 10% to 70% in 2011 and
54% in 2012. Annual variability can be consequence of the need for water (irrigation is
supplemental in FYR Macedonia) or exogenous factors such as the financial crisis.

4 (c) Strengthening the Water Economy Directorate
117.     The project supported the Water Management Directorate (WMD) to improve its
capacity to oversee the establishment of new Irrigation Water Communities (IWCs) and WEs and
monitor their performance as well as to carry out improved planning of water resources in the
country. Activities supported under the project include:

       Implementation of the already adopted systematization plan for the WMD, including the
        filling of 12 new permanent positions.
       Development and installation of a full GIS system for water and land management,
        surface water, and registry of water users with adequate licensing, using remote sensing
        data to monitor and evaluate performance of irrigation and drainage system performance.
       Development and capacity building for an IWC/WE support unit to help establish new
        IWCs/WEs, monitor their performance, and provide technical assistance and support to
        water users. This will include: provision of legal and technical advice for formation and


                                                 26
establishment of new IWCs/WEs; publicity, communication and awareness campaigns
about establishment of IWCs/WEs including study tours to already established
IWCs/WEs; training and capacity building programs on financial management, technical
management (system operations and maintenance), proper water management for
multiple and sometimes competing stakeholders; baseline and periodic surveys to gauge
the effectiveness and efficiency of services delivered by IWCs/WEs; and crop budget
surveys to assess agriculture performance.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

Economic rate of return: 23.8%
NPV: EUR 8.2 million

118.    An ex-ante economic and financial analysis of the project was carried out at the project
appraisal. Therefore the current ex-post analysis is comparing the actual project results and
performance with the baseline situation applying the same analytical approaches and methods that
were used at appraisal.

119.   Primary data and information were collected from the project implementation reports.
Some data were also collected by a local short-term consultant recruited by the World Bank. A
conservative approach was applied to the presented analysis.

Component 1. Strengthening MAFWE’s administrative and management capacity in
accordance with EU accession requirements.

120.     Since quantifying the impact of institutional strengthening is extremely difficult, a
qualitative analysis was carried out at project appraisal to assess the benefits deriving from the
component’s activities. The component aimed to improve policy design and analysis, impact
monitoring and budget management within MAFWE.

121.     According to the PAD the Ministry’s annual budget is significantly increased reaching €
34 million in 2007. Increases were most dramatic for the first pillar of MAFWE policy, the
Agricultural Development Program (ADP), which mainly provides agricultural subsidies. It was
expected that to prepare capturing the benefits from pillar one of the EU Common Agricultural
Policy, agricultural subsidies would increase from € 8.0 in 2005 to € 20 million in 2010, and
funding of the MAFWE’s second pillar, the National Rural Development Program (NRDP),
would increase from € 2.2 million in 2007 to € 3.3 million in 2010.

122.    In fact, the MAFWE’s annual budget after the peak growth in 2007 decreased to € 24.9
million in 2011 and € 23.4 million in 2012. While the annual allocation of the ADP continued to



                                                28
grow and reached € 87.3 million in 2010 and € 113.6 million in 2012 (see table 2 below).
Financing the NRDP is also significantly increased and reached € 5.4 million in 2010 and € 11.5
million in 2012.

123.    According to the PAD, the Ministry had significant shortcomings in its designing,
planning and implementation of the subsidies, which compromised the effectiveness of the
subsidy program. Support to agriculture in the form of subsidies was highly variable and unstable,
creating unnecessary risk and uncertainty for farmers. Subsidies were distributed largely on an
ad-hoc and political basis rather than a systematic examination of the specific merits of each type
of measure, and the Ministry lacked a clear statement of the purpose and expected impact of its
various subsidy measures. It also lacked the information and means to forecast uptake and report
and analyze subsidy expenditures, and thereby calculate efficiency and impact of subsidies. There
was also poor targeting, monitoring and verification of subsidies. It was expected that by
improving the way that agricultural subsidies were managed the project would considerably
increase the effectiveness of the subsidy program and its impact on agricultural growth.

124.     It cannot be claimed that the significant increase in funding of the Ministry’s programs is
fully attributable to the impact of the project activities. However, it can be argued that such
project activities as the establishment of an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)
and an Agriculture Information System (AIS), strengthening the Agricultural Inspection Services
and establishing adequate institutional capacity in MAFWE in general, contributed significantly
to the strengthening of the Ministry’s institutional capacity and made possible a significant
increase in funding the Ministry’s programs.

125.     As an illustrative example of the component’s activities, a cost-benefit analysis of a new
building of the MAFWE was carried out. According to the Ministry’s estimates, the construction
of this building resulted in a significant cost saving of about € 0.5 million per year. A cost-benefit
analysis of this construction shows a good investment return: the economic rate of return is 12.2%.

Component 2. Supporting MAFWE’s ability to deliver EU rural development funds

126.    The component facilitated the government’s access to the EU IPARD funds. It was
expected that the total amount of the EU IPARD funds would be €31.3 million, distributed over
four years as follows: € 2.1 million in 2007, € 6.7 million in 2008, € 10 million in 2009 and €
12.5 million in 2010.

127.    As it was mentioned in the project PAD, the funds were made available to candidate
countries under the predecessor to the IPARD program, the Special Accession Programme for
Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD). Several countries that implemented the
SAPARD program were not able to access all of the SAPARD funding potentially available to
them because they did not have the necessary institutional mechanisms in place, and because
beneficiaries had difficulty in applying for funds.

128.    Countries also experienced dead-weight losses in the SAPARD program as funds were
taken up by wealthier farmers better able to negotiate complicated application procedures and
provide pre-financing, but who could have accessed other sources of capital for financing
investments in their enterprises. It was expected, that this component would help the country
avoid these problems by putting the institutional structures in place in a timely manner and
promoting equitable access to IPARD funds among potential beneficiaries.

129.    The ex-ante economic analysis calculated for this component was based on the
assumptions of the uptake of IPARD funds in “with project? (WP) and “without project? (WOP)
scenarios. It was assumed, that since the project investments would finance essential building
blocks of the IPARD PA, the costs in the WP scenario would be the same as those WOP, but the
investments would be made earlier.

130.    As the investments would be made earlier, the benefits of a functioning paying agency
would also derive earlier. Based on these assumptions on uptake and the IPARD funds available,
it was estimated that in the WOP scenario a total of € 9.5 million of IPARD funds would not be
accessed in the period 2007-2010. However, in the WP scenario, this figure would decrease to €
4.4 million. It was estimated that over the project period the IRR for this component would be
48%.

131.    Due to the fact that the actual situation with the uptake of IPARD funds developed during
the project implementation was different from that planned at the project appraisal, some changes
were made in WOP scenario of the presented ex-post economic analysis. For example, the actual
uptake of the IPARD funds started in 2009, i.e. two years later than planned and the total amount



                                                  30
of contracted IPARD funds over four years (2009-2012) was only € 7.8 million, while the actual
reimbursement over the indicated period of time was even lesser – only € 3.0 million. It is clear
that the assumptions for the IPARD funds uptakes made under at appraisal were too optimistic.
Moreover, the WOP scenario should have been envisaged not only the delay in time, but the fact
that the IPARD funds would not be allocated.

132.      Therefore, based on the assumption the IPARD funds uptake in WOP scenario would be
close to zero, the economic IRR is 30.2% based on the analysis of six-year period from 2007 to
2012 with applying the benefit phasing for 3 years and 80% success factor (see Table 4 below).
This investment return is less than that planned at appraisal (48%), however, as it is mentioned
earlier, this is due to overoptimistic WOP assumptions made in PAD.

Component 3. Developing effective veterinary capacity

133.    The component’s activities aimed to strengthen the overall capacity of the Veterinary
Directorate to undertake effective controls in the animal and public health sectors, in line with the
current and relevant EU veterinary practices, that in turn reduced the incidence of animal and
human diseases. The ex-ante economic and financial analysis for this component was based on



                                                   31
expectation of the reduced incidence of key indicative animal diseases: ovine/caprine brucellosis,
bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis and other zoonoses.

134.    The reduced incidence predictions, and cost assumptions incurred dealing with the
diseases, provides the basis for calculations of the savings resulting from reductions in slaughter
and compensation costs for diseased animals, destruction of milk from infected animals, and
reductions in human cases that require treatment. Savings were also calculated from introduction
of improved laboratory diagnostic capacity that allows for switching from expensive and time
consuming CFT tests for brucellosis to the cheaper and faster ELISA method.

135.     The present ex-post analysis was based on the actual data. For example, the actual
number of the sheep and goats was 943,988 in 2007 and it decreased to 839,409 sheep and goats
in 2011; the actual number of cattle was 253,766 in 2007 and it reached 265,299 heads in 2011
(while it was only 750,000 sheep and goats and 200,000 heads of cattle taken into account in the
ex-ante analysis).

136.    Besides, due to the fact that the impact of the component and its benefits will continue
deriving after the project completion, a 15-year period was applied in the analysis to identify the
value of future benefits.

Component 4. Completing reform of irrigation sector

140.   The ex-ante economic analysis of the liquidation of Water Management Organizations
(WMOs), of which the retrenchment program of WMOs staff was an integral part, was mainly
based on expectation of labor costs savings. It was envisaged that the liquidation of the four
WMOs that was financed by IBRD resources would contribute significantly to the successful
reform of the irrigation sector country-wide. For example it was expected that the water users
would save about €0.5 million annually in salaries associated with the reduction of redundancies
from 292 permanent staff to about seventy permanent staff and about thirty seasonal staff.

141.    It was planned that the wage bill savings including pension payments and social
contributions would overtake the financial costs of retrenchment estimated in about 4 years.
Furthermore, the reduction in the number of staff involved in water management would result in a
drastic reduction in the operation and maintenance costs of irrigation services, as those
experienced under the Irrigation Reform and Restructuring Project - from about US$200 per


                                                    34
hectare (when WMOs were responsible for delivery of irrigations services) to US$100 per hectare
(after the establishment of IWCs and WEs).

142.     The computation of the savings in labor costs presented below was based on the actual
salary rates. It shows that the annual savings in labor costs is € 770,400. This amount makes a
significant contribution in the benefit flow of entire project. The economic IRR of the component
is estimated at 36.8% (see Table 8 below).

Overall Project Economic Analysis

143.     The period of analysis is 15 years to account for the long-term impact of the project
interventions. The scenario presented in the economic analysis is conservative. The analysis
presents the balance of costs and benefits of the project and it is based on the actual data and
results of the project.

144.    The analysis identified the quantifiable benefits that relate directly to the activities
undertaken following implementation of the project, or that can be attributed to the project’s
implementation. The incremental quantifiable benefit stream comprises of three main elements:


                                                 35
(i) benefits deriving from the increased IPARD financing, (ii) cost savings from reduction of
incidence of human and animal diseases and (iii) savings in labour costs.

145.     The cost-benefit models described above were used for the calculation of the overall
benefit streams, on the basis of economic prices. All local costs were converted into their
approximate economic values using a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.8 7 . A Shadow
Wage Rate of 0.7 was also introduced into the analysis to identify the opportunity cost of labour
in the project’s civil work costs. All values are given in constant 2013 prices.

146.    Given the above mentioned benefit and cost streams, the Economic Internal Rate of
Return (E-IRR) of the project is estimated at 23.8% which is above the minimum level (15%).
The Net Present Value (NPV) of the Project’s net benefit stream, discounted at 10%, is positive -
EUR 8.2 million. The project economic analysis is presented in Table 9 below.

Sensitivity Analysis

147.    Actual economic returns were tested against several hypothetic scenarios of the changes
in benefits and costs that could have happened during the project implementation. The analysis
shows that the E-IRR is equally sensitive to changes in costs and in benefits, these changes could
not have a significant impact on the E-IRR, and the economic viability could not have threatened
by either a 20% decline in benefits or by a 20% increase in costs. A fall in total project benefits
by 20% and an increase in total project costs by the same proportion could have reduced the base
E-IRR to about 16.7%-17.9%.

  This is to make all economic costs used in the economic analysis net of indirect taxes (VAT, duties, sale
taxes, etc.) and indirect subsidies.

148.    The project experienced some implementation delays and the analysis shows that it was
quite sensitive to any further delays in deriving of the project benefits. For instance, a one-year
delay in project benefits could have reduced the E-IRR to 17.9% from the actual 23.8%, while
with a two-year delay, it could have fallen to approximately 14.1%.

149.    In a hypothetic scenario when the country had not attracted any IPARD funds, the project
E-IRR would have dropped to 16.5%, which is close to a borderline, although still acceptable.
Conversely, if the country had attracted all IPARD funds as was envisaged in the project PAD,
the project E-IRR would have increased up to 41.8%.
