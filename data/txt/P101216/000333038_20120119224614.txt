1.     The closing date for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Agriculture
Strengthening and Accession Project (IBRD Loan Number 48610-MK, P101216) will be
extended from June 30, 2012 until December 31, 2012.

2.      The project objectives continue to be achievable, with noteworthy results and positive
outcomes already achieved.1 The action plan and proposals that the Government has presented
to complete the remaining project activities are satisfactory to the Bank.2 The Project has been
rated Satisfactory and Moderately Satisfactory for the last 12 months for Progress towards the
Development Objective and Implementation Progress respectively. Overall, project
implementation is progressing well under all components, with the exception of the
development of the Integrated Administrative and Control System (IACS) activity under
Component 2, which is about three months behind the original schedule and is now expected to
be completed by December 15, 2012. As of November 22, 2011, 89% of project funds have
been disbursed. Financial management performance is satisfactory, and there are no overdue
audits. Financial covenants have been complied with.

3.       The proposed extension is necessary to allow additional time for remaining project
activities to be completed. One ongoing specific and complex activity, the development of the
Integrated Administrative and Control System (IACS) requires 49 weeks starting from the day of
signing the Contract with the selected firm. This activity is crucial as IACS is the “umbrella? that
enables the connection of the Land Parcel Identification System, the Farm Register, Vineyard
Cadastre and the Veterinary Information System. The integration of these systems through the
IACS allows the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy (MAFWE) and the
Paying Agency to create and implement agricultural policies through subsidies granted to
farmers. This system also allows accurate and prompt updating and digitalizing of data on
farmers and farms. The Bank team has assessed and discussed progress under this activity
during an Implementation Support Mission on September 26-30, 2011. On December 13, 2011,
the Government signed the contract with Consortium Abaco, Sinergise & PR Tehnologii -
Mantova, Italy for the supply and installation of IACS. With respect to the remaining
reconstruction and refurbishment activities (listed in the letter from the Government), these
activities are on track to be completed by the planned dates. The project team fully supports the
