MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO INDONESIA
FOR A FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT:
IMPROVING EQUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE
1.      I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$88.0 million to help finance The Fourth
Health Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
20 years, including five years of grace.
2.      Country and Provincial Background. During its first 25-year development plan (1968/69-
1993/94), Indonesia achieved sustained economic growth rate averaging over 6 percent annually,
and, in the process, reduced poverty. During this period, the country also registered advances in
the health sector. Access to modern health care widened and health status increased considerably,
as indicated, for example, by the rise of life expectancy at birth from 45.7 years in 1967 to 62 years
in 1990. In addition, the nutritional status of the population improved, as illustrated by the decline
in the prevalence rates of protein energy malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency. The use of certain
preventive health measures such as modem family planning has also increased at a rapid rate. For
instance, the contraceptive prevalence rate among married women of reproductive age rose to 55
percent in 1994 from 10 percent in the 1960s, facilitating the reduction of total fertility rate from
6.61 children in 1971 to 2.90 in 1994.
3.     Indonesia's provinces have shared to a greater or lesser extent in economic growth,
improved access to modem health services and infant mortality rate decline. The country's regional
differences and commonalities are illustrated in the project provinces of East Java, West Kalimantan,
East Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB), and West Sumatra. East Java, for example, has
reached an estimated infant mortality rate (IMR) of about 64 deaths per thousand live births in 1990,
while the infant mortality rate (IMR) in NTB continues to be high at about 145 despite health gains
made during the past decade. West Kalimantan, which has the highest poverty rate in the country
(33.8 percent), also registered a decline in infant mortality and gains in education and other
socioeconomic indicators. Accessibility of basic health services, however, remains a problem.
Average catchment area of health centers, which relatively few people visit, is sixteen times larger
than in East Java and transportation is difficult. East Kalimantan is beginning to encounter the costly
chronic and degenerative disease problems associated with higher income areas. Yet, infectious and
parasitic diseases continue to account for more than half of all reported episodes of disease and
deaths.
4.      Despite differences in mortality and morbidity levels and epidemiological agendas, the
project provinces all face comparatively high infant mortality rates and similar service delivery
challenges, including the need to improve performance and quality of care within a common health
care delivery system. Part of the problem is low public spending for basic health services (BHS).
But factors other than money, particularly those relating to institutional capacity, work process, staff
attitudes and other aspects of organizational culture also contribute to performance problems. For
example, service quality is affected by lack of sensitivity to clients, inefficient work processes, poor
management, and weak performance incentives. These weaknesses can make government health
facilities less attractive and accessible to clients. Consequently, health system efficiency and
effectiveness often suffer, as evidenced by frequent lapses from recommended clinical norms and



-2 -
underutilization of government facilities and staff in many localities. Finally, another deficiency in
the performance of the health systems in the five provinces is that the poor continue to lag behind.
Currently, the poor receive a disproportionately low share of overall health subsidies due in part to
the substantial share of health spending going to hospital services that are used mostly by the well-
off.
5.      Health Sector Strategy. Improvements in the performance of the publicly managed health
system represent a feasible and cost-effective means of enhancing health outcomes. To realize this
expectation, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) will pursue the following strategy:
(a) Effect facility level changes to raise the level of performance of basic health service (BHS)
providers, specifically in rendering higher quality BHS and reaching out to the poor;
(b) Promote decentralization, adjust institutional arrangements and enhance the capacity of
provincial and district level managers to supervise, motivate and support lower-level staff
and hold them more accountable for service performance; and
(c) Improve health financing by allocating a greater percentage of government health spending
to highly cost-effective basic health services and raising the share of health benefits of the
poor, increasing local government financial support for health and raising the retention of
revenues from fees for health services to support their improvement, and adjusting
budgetary arrangements, in particular promoting the use of block grants for health services.
6.      Lessons Learned from Previous Bank QOerations. The Bank has funded thirteen health
projects since 1977. These include support for nutrition, community health, health manpower
development, water and sanitation, referral facilities and family planning initiatives. Bank loans for
these projects totalled US$602 million. There are several important lessons that are relevant to the
development of this project. First, the experience of the first cohort of Bank-supported health
projects in Indonesia confirms that too rapid expansion of activities can jeopardize quality and lack
of attention to quality assurance and effectiveness issues seriously limits project impact on health
outcomes. Second, it is critical to address demand and utilization issues. Ignoring them has led to
implementation problems, as shown by the experience of the manpower and hospital construction
projects. Third, from the recent group of projects, the experience of the Third Health Project (HP
III) reveals that incremental steps towards decentralization, particularly strengthening the
responsibility and authority for and the management and delivery of health programs at the provincial
and district levels, can have considerable positive impact on health sector development. Measures
introduced under the Third Health Project include consolidation of the central development budget
(DIPs) for community health into a single budget for high priority basic health services, transfer of
budget responsibility to the District Health Offices and drugs management reforms. But to sustain
institutional changes and extend them down to health facilities, follow-up efforts are needed. For
example, the quality of care provided at health centers in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) and East
Kalimantan (Kaltim) is still deficient in terms of compliance with recommended clinical standards,
indicating the need for quality assurance mechanisms, reform of work processes and other aspects
of organizational culture of health centers.
7.      Rationale for Bank Involvement. The health sector is an appropriate area for Bank
involvement. Public intervention in the sector is legitimate and necessary to maximize sector



- 3 -
efficiency. Many basic health interventions have public goods characteristics; moreover, market
imperfections in the health sector are quite serious due to the asymmetry of information between
consumers and providers. Some public interventions can also be justified on grounds of equity. In
particular, Bank analysis shows that the provision of basic health services is a cost-effective way to
alleviate poverty.
8.      The Bank is well suited to provide the support needed to deal with these various issues.
First, it is at the forefront in assisting health sector reforms in Indonesia and has accumulated
relevant knowledge and experience. Its analytical work and recent innovative lending operations
have dealt with key sectoral issues. Second, the Bank has established an excellent partnership with
GOI and a credible approach to health sector reform. Third, the Fourth Health Project (HP IV)
represents an excellent vehicle for pursuing the objective, cited in the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), of helping Indonesia overcome human resource bottlenecks by strengthening provincial and
district management, and improving the quality and utilization of basic social services like health.
The project is consistent with the CAS which was discussed by the Board on March 21, 1995. The
Fourth Health Project would contribute to the CAS agenda by:
(a)  supporting GOI efforts to enable and motivate frontline health providers and managers
in public facilities to deliver higher quality, more accessible services that fit the needs
and demands of clients;
(b)  promoting decentralization and enhancement of capacity of provinces and districts to
supervise and support lower level managers and staff; and
(c)  assisting in improving health financing by reorienting (i) public expenditures in health
to assure that a larger share of sectoral allocations goes to the poor and provision of
basic service packages, and (ii) sector financing mechanisms, with much greater reliance
to be placed on direct cost recovery and health insurance modalities.
9.      Project Objectives. The aim of the project is to improve health outcomes by giving
provinces, districts and puskesmas (health center) managers greater responsibility, authority,
resources, and skills to enhance health care quality and equity. Specific project objectives are: (i)
to increase the authority and capacity of provincial and district health offices and health centers to
plan and implement health programs as they deem appropriate to local conditions; (ii) to ensure that
the provision and consumption of key health services conform to affordable, cost-effective standards
of care; (iii) to improve access and utilization of these health services by the poor; and (iv) to
improve efficiency in the delivery of basic health services (BHS). These objectives address key issues
that are essential to further health sector development and poverty alleviation.
10.     Project Description.  As mentioned, the project would cover the provinces of West and
East Kalimantan, East Java, Nusa Tenggara Barat, and West Sumatra and provide, over five years,
support for various components. The choice of the five provinces was based on the following
considerations. First, Kaltim and NTB were included to follow up assistance provided under Third
Health with additional innovative activities deemed necessary to bring about required changes in
organizational culture and institutional capacity at the facility level.  Second, GOI chose the
remaining three provinces from those that did not have any major donor-assisted health project.



- 4 -
Within, this group, priority was given to those provinces with the worst poverty indicators (West
Kalimantan) and the largest number of poor families (East Java).
11.     Components. In each province, the project consists of facility-level service improvement,
institutional development, and resource allocation and revenue generation components. In the facility-
level service component, funds would be used to: (i) upgrade and construct health facilities to
improve delivery of basic health services (BHS); and (ii) provide discretionary health center Special
Assistance Funds (SAFs) and other additional resources for operational and recurrent costs (on a
declining rate) to support implementation of quality assurance and other BHS programs initiated by
provincial, district and frontline providers.
12.     Funds for institutional development would finance improvements in the capacity of
provincial, district, and Central-level agencies to assist, motivate, and supervise frontline health
providers in delivering accessible high quality packages of basic health services. Specifically, project
expenditures would go to: (i) establishing quality assurance mechanisms and supporting
training/curriculum development activities; (ii) developing effective performance-linked incentives;
(iii) financing discretionary district SAFs, replication of HP III innovations, and other pilot
programs; and (iv) strengthening the capacity of Central-level MOH units to give technical guidance,
disseminate quality assurance and other HP IV innovations, and carry out oversight functions.
13.     Finally, funds would be provided in the resource allocation and revenue generation
component for technical assistance (TA), data collection and analysis, materials and workshops to
design and promote facility-level fee increases and revenue retention, and to institute more effective
targeting of health subsidies to appropriate recipients and activities.
14.     Provincial Health Improvement Programs. Project activities and outlays by province are
described below (amounts in parentheses are base costs):
15.     East Java (US$23.1 million equivalent): The project would mainly fund operational and
incremental recurrent costs (73 percent) to meet the drugs and other requirements of an expanded
BHS coverage program and developmental expenditures (13 percent) needed to establish quality
assurance practices and supporting training programs. Over a fifth of the project costs would finance
discretionary SAFs for health centers and districts which support GOI's decentralization efforts.
Outlays would be directed at existing deficiencies in the quality and coverage of ten basic health
services, which include nutrition, maternal and child care/family planning, immunization, health
education, control of communicable diseases (dengue, malaria, TB, diarrhea, and acute respiratory
infection) and school health services.
16.     West Kalimantan (US$29.6 million equivalent): A distinctive feature of the province's
program is its support for technical assistance and other components that would address systemic
issues arising from the application of Indonesia's conventional health delivery system and approaches
to an area characterized by non-standard geographic configurations. SAFs (30 percent) and the
budget for quality assurance (QA) and supporting activities (10 percent) would be the vehicle to
enable the province to tailor its approaches to the distinctive environment within which its health
programs operate. In addition, the project would support civil works (40 percent) and equipment
provision more heavily than in other provinces to improve the physical infrastructure of its publicly
managed basic health services facilities. Referral facilities for maternal and child services would be



strengthened. Water and sanitation programs would be improved to reduce the high prevalence rate
of water-borne diseases.
17.     Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) (US$9.0 million equivalent): NTB would further develop,
expand and institutionalize the quality assurance program that it has successfully piloted. In addition,
it would try out Referral Health Centers and develop a program to enhance the ability of traditional
birth attendants (the predominant source of birth delivery assistance) to conduct their practice more
safely and to make timely and appropriate referrals of high risk pregnancies. NTB's SAFs (28
percent), quality assurance efforts (15 percent), and support for health equipment and recurrent costs
for supervision and medical supplies (21 percent) would provide funds to promote safe motherhood,
child immunization, ARI interventions and other BHS activities. As in other provinces, the SAFs
would not only increase discretionary resources available to district offices and health center
managers to respond more quickly to quality problems documented through the application of QA
methodologies; they would also be used as a vehicle for developing and instituting a budgetary
practice of providing extra operational resources for underserved areas.
18.     East Kalimantan (US$14.5 million equivalent): As in the other provinces, the project
would support the development of effective systems of performance evaluation and associated
incentive schemes linked to service improvements in terms of both utilization and quality assurance-
based indicators. The province would further develop and expand its pioneering efforts to use health
center fees as a source of extra-budgetary resources and incentives for improved service performance
by health staff. It also plans to use project funds for Program Development Expenditures (PDE) to
pilot a managed prepaid health care system in Balikpapan that would utilize private providers of
health services. However, project funds allocated for this province would be used largely to establish
quality assurance processes and supporting activities (about 10 percent) and finance recurrent costs
for health supplies (15 percent), SAFs (23 percent) and equipment (17 percent) purchases to address
Kaltim's remaining problems of communicable and infectious diseases.
19.     West Sumatra (US$27.5 million equivalent):  The project would supp9rt: (i) the
development of an institutionalized QA program; (ii) the expansion of outreach activities, particularly
in the remote areas; (iii) training to address skills deficits that affect quality of care; (iv) expanded
supervisory contacts with service providers to facilitate the QA program and development of
interventions to make these contacts more productive and accountable; (v) redeployment of staff to
underserved areas; (vi) the provision of adequate health supplies and greater availability of functional
equipment in health centers; and (vii) decentralized problem-solving initiatives by health center,
district and provincial managers. The province would use the above funds to raise immunization rate
and utilization of cost-effective health interventions to strengthen maternal child health services and
control of communicable and infectious diseases such as ARI, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and
diarrhea. In this regard, about a quarter of the above funds would finance discretionary SAFs to
enable the province to expand its BHS programs, especially to poor communities. In addition,
another third of the province's project funds would be allocated for drugs and other recurrent costs
to meet shortages of supplies.
20.     Project Implementation. The proposed project would be carried out by the Ministry of
Health. The project cost is estimated at US$134.3 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$40.4 million equivalent (30%) and taxes and duties estimated at about US$3.0
million equivalent, of which the Bank would finance US$88.0 million equivalent (96% of the foreign



-6 -
exchange and 67 % of the total project cost excluding taxes). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13991-IND dated May 22, 1995, is being
distributed separately.
21.      Project Sustainability. Prospects for project sustainability are very good. Indonesia's
outlook for economic growth is bright, and the cost of the project's various initiatives is modest and
affordable. Moreover, there is a strong sense of project ownership and a firm commitment by GOI
and participating local governments to carry on successful HP IV initiatives with local funds and
retained earnings of health facilities. Furthermore, as the project eases current concerns about the
public health sector's inability to efficiently absorb additional funds, resistance to budgetary increases
for basic health services could be reduced considerably. Finally, through its promotion of higher
cost recovery, greater retention of revenues earned by public health facilities, as well as intensified
mobilization of private resources (e.g., health insurance), the project is expected to facilitate
budgetary reallocations that would increase health subsidies to basic health services and poverty
alleviation.
22.     Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the following assurances were obtained from the
Government of Indonesia that it would:
(a)   not later than December 31, 1995, furnish to the Bank a classification, on the basis of
poverty issues, of health centers and health districts in the project provinces;
(b)   not later than October 31, 1996, furnish to the Bank guidelines for pricing personal
health services provided by health centers and hospitals and protecting the poor from
the impact of price adjustments;
(c)   not later than October 31, 1996 implement the system for the annual collection of
consolidated budgetary information to monitor achievement of the targets relating to
increased government health spending for BHS and the poor and for assessing the
impact of proposed central and provincial budgetary allocations on the funding of BHS;
(d)   cause the local governments of the participating provinces to take all actions required
for the implementation of the Provincial Government Statement of Support in each
district selected to participate in the project, including the requirement:
(i) that the share of district health budget going to BHS and the poor be increased
annually;
(ii) that health service fees be adjusted upwards and that such revenues be used for
purposes of the health sector; and
(iii) that part of the earnings of the health centers be used by such facilities for health
center incentives;



- 7 -
(e)   not later than January 31, 1996, furnish to the Bank a proposal for a scheduling and
management mechanism for the training of staff which minimizes disruption in the
health facilities' activities and which ensures: (i) that training courses under the project
address documented skills deficits critical to BHS improvement and have defined
measurable outcomes; and (ii) that training courses are evaluated on the basis of the
trainees' measurable acquisition of relevant gains in skills and knowledge;
(f)  before implementing a training program, have the relevant course materials available
for the trainees;
(g)  (i) not later than March 31 in each year commencing on March 31, 1997, furnish to the
Bank evaluation reports of the health districts' performance covering a two-year period
in terms of agreed performance indicators; and (ii) thereafter, review with the Bank the
reports and take all measures required to ensure improvements in the health districts'
performance in terms of the performance indicators, including, if necessary, the
reduction of Special Assistance Funds to non-performing health districts;
(h)  undertake midterm and final project reviews, acceptable to the Bank, and submit copies
of reports of the midterm review not later than December 31, 1997, and discuss with
the Bank the results of the review not later than February 28, 1998;
(i)  cause technical audits of project implementation to be carried out, in a manner
acceptable to the Bank, by April 1 in each year during the implementation of the project
and furnish a copy of such audit to the Bank for comments, by July 31 of each such
year;
(j)  provide the required vehicles for the project in accordance with a schedule agreed with
the Bank;
(k)  carry out the activities under the Special Assistance Fund (SAF) in accordance with the
SAF Operating Guidelines, agreed with the Bank; and
(1)  carry out the Program  Development activities in accordance with the Program
Development Expenditures Operating Guidelines, agreed with the Bank.
23.     Environmental Aspects. The project does not pose any significant environmental threat.
The possibility of hospital wastes impacting on the environment is unlikely to be significant, since
there will be no major hospital construction under HP IV. On the contrary, HP IV could contribute
to the quality of the environment to the extent that the project strengthens the ability of health centers
to deal with communicable diseases and pathogens in the environment.
24.     Project Benefits. By improving the delivery and quality of BHS, the project would increase
the number of people utilizing them and benefiting from their use. Covering about 886 health
centers, HP IV could benefit an estimated 27 million people. Of these, about 20 percent are poor
and another 13 percent are near-poor. While all demographic groups could benefit from the project,
the major beneficiaries are expected to be women and children from both poor and non-poor



- 8 -
families. The poor, however, would benefit from the project disproportionately, as subsidies for
health centers and their outreach activities are strongly pro-poor
25.     Risks.  The project has two salient risks.  First, increasing cost-recovery rates to
appropriate levels might be delayed in some districts, given that price increases for publicly provided
services represent a politically sensitive decision. Second, the training activities sponsored by the
project could become burdensome on staff and disruptive of their work. These risks have been
reduced during project preparation by ensuring that enough funds have been allocated for the
promotion of price reforms and that both provincial, district and central officials are committed to
them. Evidence for this commitment is shown by their involvement in advancing this aspect of the
project and by the decrees issued by Bupati (head of district government) of starter districts
expressing support for price adjustments. As to training, the project would emphasize distance
learning and other on-the-job approaches. It would also establish mechanisms for controlling the
number of days staff are away from work to attend off-the-job training.
26.     Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
