Project Description:    The aim of the project is to improve health outcomes by giving
provinces,  districts  and  puskesmas  managers  greater
responsibility, authority, resources, and skills to enhance health
care quality and equity. Specific project objectives are: (i) to
increase the authority and capacity of provincial and district
health offices and health centers to plan and implement health
programs as they deem appropriate to local conditions; (ii) to
ensure that the provision and consumption of key health
services conform to affordable, cost-effective standards of care;
(iii) to improve access and utilization of these health services by
the poor; and (iv) to improve efficiency in the delivery of basic
health services (BHS).
The project, which would be implemented in the provinces
of West and East Kalimantan, West Nusa Tenggara, West
Sumatra, and East Java, would operate through three
mechanisms.  First, it would seek to improve the work
processes, attitudes and skills within publicly managed BHS
facilities, while providing the additional resources needed to
render higher quality, more accessible services that fit the needs
and demand of clients. A key element is the establishment of
quality assurance (QA) processes and supporting training
programs.
Second, to facilitate these changes, the project would
strengthen the institutional capability of provinces and districts
to supervise, support and reward frontline providers of care;
and simultaneously make managers of districts and facilities
more accountable for their performance.
Third, the project would support resource mobilization and
a reorientation of government spending to BHS and poverty
alleviation.  Indicative targets have been agreed, increasing
government health spending for BHS and the poor.
Benefits and Risks:     By improving the delivery and quality of BHS, the project
would increase the number of people utilizing them and
benefiting from their use. Covering about 886 health centers,
HP IV could benefit an estimated 27 million people. Of these,
about 20 percent are poor and another 13 percent are near-
poor. While all demographic groups could benefit from the
project, the major beneficiaries are expected to be women and
children from both poor and non-poor families. The poor,
however, would benefit from the project disproportionately, as
subsidies for health centers and their outreach activities are
strongly pro-poor.



- Hii -
The project has two salient risks. First, increasing cost-
recovery rates to appropriate levels might be delayed in some
districts, given that price increases for publicly provided
services represent a politically sensitive decision. Second, the
training activities sponsored by the project could become
burdensome on staff and disruptive of their work.
These risks have been reduced during project preparation
by ensuring that enough funds have been allocated for the
promotion of price reforms and that both provincial, district and
central officials are committed to them. Evidence for this
commitment is shown by their involvement in advancing this
aspect of the project and by the decrees issued by Bupati (head
of district government) of starter districts expressing support for
price adjustments. As to training, the project would emphasize
distance learning and other on-the-job approaches. It would
also establish mechanisms for controlling the number of days
staff are away from work to attend off-the-job training.

CHAPTER 1
HEALTH SECTOR ISSUES AND STRATEGY
A. NATIONAL HEALTH TRENDS
1.1         During its first 25-year development plan (1968/69-1993/94), Indonesia
achieved sustained economic growth rate averaging over 6 percent annually, and, in the
process, reduced the poverty rate and the total number of poor people. During this period,
Indonesia also registered advances in the health sector. The extent of improvement in
health outcomes in the country is seen in the decline of infant mortality rate (IMR) from
an estimated 145 per thousand live births in 1967 to 63 per thousand in 1990. A related
indicator, life expectancy at birth, rose from 45.7 years to 62 years during the same
period.  In addition, nutritional status improved, as illustrated by the decline in the
prevalence of protein energy malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency.
1.2         As the economy grew, govermment was able to expand the number of
facilities and the availability of modern health services throughout Indonesia. At the
beginning of Repelita I, there were 1,227 health centers (Puskesmas). By 1993, their
number reached 6,954, and there were also 19,977 health subcenters (Pustu). On average,
there is now one health center per 27,000 people compared to about one per 96,000 in
1968. Complementing this expansion of health facilities has been a rapid increase in the
number of doctors, nurses, midwives and other health professionals relative to population
size. Private provision of health services also expanded considerably, especially in urban
and peri-urban areas in Java and Bali.
1.3         As a result of increased accessibility of modern health care (combined with
higher fanily incomes and education), utilization of modem curative and preventive health
services is greater today than in the past. For example, utilization of modern providers
when sick has risen considerably among the poorest deciles in rural and urban areas, and
in both Java and the Outer Islands. The use of certain preventive health measures such
as modern family planning has also increased at a rapid rate.  For instance, the
contraceptive prevalence rate among married women of reproductive age rose to 55
percent in 1994 from 10 percent in the 1960s, facilitating the reduction of total fertility
rate from 6.61 children in 1971 to 2.90 in 1994.
1.4         Despite these successes, Indonesia lags behind its comparator countries in
health development and substantial gaps remain in the delivery of basic health services.
After a sharp decline in the 1970s, IMR appears to have stabilized in the mid and late
1980s at 75-80 deaths per thousand births. Current estimates suggest that IMR remains in



countries like China and Sri Lanka. Maternal mortality risks and malnutrition among
children remain high, and access to safe water and sanitation facilities by the poor
continues to be a major concern.
B. PROVINCIAL BACKGROUND
1.5          Indonesia's provinces have shared to a greater or lesser extent in economic
growth, improved access to modern health services and infant mortality rate decline. The
country's regional differences and commonalities are illustrated in the provinces included
in the project. As described below (see Table 1.1), these provinces must contend with
distinctive epidemiological and service delivery problems. (For a discussion of the choice
of these provinces, see para. 3.2). However, they also face comparable service delivery
challenges, including the need to improve quality of care within a common health care
system. A second challenge is that of raising spending on basic health services, especially
for the poor.
1.6          East Java. This province, with the second largest population in Indonesia,
had an infant mortality rate of about 64 deaths per thousand live births and a life
expectancy at birth of about 63.9 years in 1990. With an average poverty rate of about
20.5 percent, East Java (Jatim) has over 7 million poor people (a fifth of Indonesia's
poor).
1.7         In Jatim, communicable and infectious diseases, particularly diarrhea and
respiratory infections, remain important causes of mortality and morbidity. Maternal
mortality is high at 425 per thousand live births, suggesting continuing needs in the
reproductive area. Moreover, malnutrition is common: more than half of pregnant women
have anemia and iodine deficiency is endemic in 38 percent of villages.
1.8          East Java has an extensive network of health centers and associated
subcenters, as seen in the relatively small average catchment area (Table 1. 1) and the
availability of doctors. Data show that almost all health centers have doctors. On the
whole, these facilities are highly utilized -- the average number of daily visits to health
centers is among the highest in the country and health centers. Significant gaps, however,
remain in the use of certain basic health services (BHS) by relevant population groups. For
example, of the children under five years old, 10.7 percent had diarrhea in the past two
weeks prior to a survey in 1994, and many of them did not get needed oral rehydration
therapy. In Probolinggo municipality (an urban area), less than half of pregnant women
completed, the full cycle of recommended visits, compared to the provincial rate of 68
percent.
1.9          Another aspect of the BHS gap is the low quality of health care being
provided.   A  pilot study (Annex  14), using quality assurance (QA) techniques,
demonstrates the low rate of compliance with recommended technical standards of care in
the management of acute respiratory infections (39 percent), antenatal care (66 percent),
and vaccination (74 percent). Patient counselling, history taking and physical examination
were found to be technically inadequate, decreasing the effectiveness of basic health

services in East Java. These findings indicate the need to establish quality assurance
systems in health facilities.
1.10        In regard health financing, consolidated public expenditures data (Table 1.1)
suggest that recurrent government spending per capita amounted to only about two dollars.
This is considerably less than the amount needed to finance the provision of essential
health services recommended by the 1993 World Development Report.
1.11        West Kalimantan. This province, which has the highest poverty rate in the
country (33.8 percent), registered a decline in infant mortality in the last decade and gains
in education and other socioeconomic indicators. Moreover, despite its high poverty rate,
West Kalimantan (Kalbar) has achieved a lower IMR (about 81 in 1990) than many
provinces with lower rates of poverty.
1.12        Kalbar provides a sharp contrast to East Java in regard to geographic-,
environmental and other characteristics. It is one of the largest provinces in the country
(after Irian Jaya and East Kalimantan), but it has one of the smallest populations (3.2
million in 1990). Over 50 percent of the population live along rivers. Few roads exist and
transportation and communications are difficult. In addition, environment sanitation is poor
and safe water supply is not available for half of the population.
1.13        The main health problems of the province continue to be high infant and
child mortality from diarrheal disease, respiratory infections, tetanus, and malnutrition, and
high maternal and perinatal mortality due to inadequate antenatal care, poor management
during labor and delivery, unhygienic birthing conditions and poor nutritional status.
Anemia is prevalent as a result of iron folate deficiency and of malaria and other parasitic
diseases. Diarrhea in West Kalimantan is the highest in the five project provinces,
reflecting the need for improvements in water and sanitation. Malaria and tuberculosis
remain common and are a major cause of adult mortality; Dengue fever and hepatitis are
endemic and widespread through much of the province.
1.14        The number of health centers per person in Kalbar is higher than the
national average. However, the average catchment area is sixteen times larger than that in
East Java. The difficulty of transportation and the sparsity of the population in West
Kalimantan explain why relatively fewer people visit these facilities. These facts also point
to the difficulty of providing basic health referral services and the need to adapt
Indonesia's standard service delivery model. Data show that over 60 percent of women
deliver at home without a trained birth attendant. A fifth of pregnant women receive no
prenatal care -- this figure is almost twice that in East Kalimantan. These findings are not
surprising considering that 60 percent of villages have no midwives.
1.15        Quality of health services is also a key concern. Standards of care are not
clear to health staff (for example, many midwives lack the knowledge and skills for high
quality antenatal care). About 80 percent of health centers have no laboratory technicians
and less than 40 percent of needed equipment are available in health staff centers.
Moreover, a high percentage of doctors are inexperienced with less than two years in their



- 5 -
current assignment. Primary health care providers have inadequate knowledge in health
education and rational drugs use.
1.16         Funding for basic health services is inadequate, given the high cost of
service delivery in Kalbar arising from transportation problems. The total per capita budget
for BHS is only 65 percent that of East Kalimantan.
1.17         East Kalimantan. As with Kalbar, East Kalimantan (Kaltim) is a large and
sparsely populated province with a density that is one percent of that in East Java. Health
centers in Kaltim  cover about 1,607 sq. km. on average, compared to East Java's
54 sq. km. In 1990 about half of the population lived in urban areas, leaving the other
half of the population in the province's vast rural area. East Kalimantan is rich in natural
resources with the highest per capita provincial income. Kaltim's poverty rate is only half
that of Kalbar and its IMR is 58 compared to 81 per 1,000 live births in Kalbar.
1.18         As in East Java where the highly urbanized areas are now exhibiting non-
traditional morbidity profiles due to demographic transition, East Kalimantan is beginning
to encounter the costly chronic and degenerative disease problems associated with higher
income areas. These morbidity patterns are emerging before Kaltim has adequately reduced
the infectious and acute diseases of developing areas.  Cardiovascular disease, for
example, has now become the leading cause of death. Yet, infectious and parasitic
diseases continue to account for more than half of all reported episodes of disease and
deaths. Tuberculosis remains a major health problem and chloroquine-resistant malaria
is increasing.
1.19         Despite its large catchment area, basic health services are more available in
East Kalimantan than in West Kalimantan -- and even East Java in some respects. Kaltim
has more health centers and doctors per capita. Its immunization rate is the highest in
Indonesia. Moreover, Kaltim has already pursued reforms in drugs management,
decentralized planning and budgeting, and resource mobilization. And of the five project
provinces, East Kalimantan has the highest public expenditures for health per capita
including large contributions by local governments.
1.20         Still, there are notable gaps in the provision and funding of basic health
services. The coverage of maternal child health (MCH), for example, for safe delivery is
estirnated to be only 65 percent in 1993. Kaltim has difficulty keeping experienced doctors
and paramedics in remote areas. As in other provinces, more needs to be done to improve
the quality of services and improve staff motivation to ensure compliance with standards
of care. Finally, providing adequate services to the rural population will require even
larger operational subsidies.
1.21         Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB). The province of NTB, with the country's
highest recorded infant mortality rate, has also made progress economically and socially.
In the last five years, NTB along with East Kalirnantan has undertaken pioneering
institutional improvements, including decentralized and integrated budgeting, drugs
management, and resource mobilization, which should contribute to accelerated health
sector development.



1.22        Despite IMR gains from  187 to 145 per thousand live births and its
achievements in institutional development, NTB continues to face serious community health
challenges. The high levels of infant and maternal mortality in the province reflect the
high prevalence of communicable and infectious diseases -- in particular of tetanus
neonatorum, acute respiratory infection (ARI), diarrhea, malaria and TB. A part of NTB's
problem lies in its socioeconomic disadvantages: education is low and poverty rate is high
compared to other provinces. But maternal health and the quality of all basic health
services remain problematic as well. Only about 15 percent of births are delivered with
the assistance of trained birth attendant. Of the five provinces, it also has the highest
percent of births without antenatal care. In terms of quality of health services, the above-
mentioned quality assurance pilot study shows that as in East Java compliance rates with
recommended standards of care (Annex 14) are also low: 45 percent (antenatal care), 45
percent (ARI) and 60 percent (vaccination).
1.23        With respect to the issue of funding, the amount spent on health by the
public sector is almost only half of that in Kaltim despite recent increases in expenditures,
indicating the need to further increase BHS funding (Table 1. 1).
1.24        West Sumatra. West Sumatra (Sumbar) is less urbanized than the other
provinces except for NTB. Its educational level and income, however, are even higher than
East Java, and its poverty rate is lower. The number of health centers per thousand
population is also higher. Yet, Sumbar's IMR is about the same as that of East Java.
1.25        Communicable and infectious diseases continue to dominate Sumbar's
epidemiological profile. These include ARI, TB, diarrhea, immunizationable diseases,
malnutrition and pregnancy-related health problems. Immunization coverage needs to be
increased and Maternal and Child Care services, malaria and ARI control and nutritional
programs expanded further. To date, West Sumatra has one of the lowest immunization
rates in the country. Moreover, the percentage of pregnant women with anemia is quite
high at 72.5 percent and many of them have not received antenatal care. Furthermore, a
large proportion of births are unattended by health professionals.
1.26        Field visits also revealed that the quality and utilization of its basic health
services also need to be improved. As in East Java and NTB, recommended standards of
care are often not followed and frontline health providers need to learn quality assessment
and problem-solving techniques to increase the effectiveness of Sumbar's health system.
C. HEALTH SECTOR ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
1.27        Systemic Problems.  As mentioned, despite differences in mortality and
morbidity levels and epidemiological agendas, the project provinces face similar service
delivery challenges, including the need to improve performance and quality of care within
the common health care delivery system. As with other line ministries, there are provincial
health offices (Kanwil Kesehatan) and district health units (Kandep) directed by the central
Ministry of Health (MOH) which pass along and enforce centrally set policy guidelines and
prepare health budgets. Routine service delivery matters are directed by health offices,



-7-
Dinas Kesehatan I and Dinas Kesehatan II, that have been established under the provincial
and district administrations, respectively. Within each district, services are actually
delivered by a network of health centers (puskesmas) and associated sub-centers and
outreach programs. Services are financed by funds channeled to local health offices and
implementing units. Funds flow through at least ten separate budgetary channels, each
with its own regulations and monitoring arrangement. Central government assistance is
still specified and controlled by the different divisions in the central MOH, which is also
largely responsible for training, hiring and deploying the health work force.
1.28         As mentioned, health system efficiency is generally low, as evidenced by
the underutilization of government facilities and staff in some facilities. For example, in
West and East Kalimantan the number of visits to health centers averaged only about 31
or less per day in 1991. On the other hand, centers in East Java recorded, on average,
about 75 visits per day.
1.29         Variable health center performance, as evidenced by relatively low
utilization levels, is attributable to several factors, including availability of resources; staff
competence, attitudes and behavior; and established operating procedures and processes.
A common problem in the five provinces is the shortage of funds and materials for
operations and maintenance. Health centers may not have reliable and timely access to
drugs and laboratory materials, two key determinants of service quality and facility
utilization. Also, follow-up and basic referral services especially in poor and remote
communities often can not be conducted in accordance with recommended practice because
operational funds (e.g., for travel) are not sufficient.
1.30         These shortages in materials and operational funds in the five provinces are
due to the inadequate resources allocated to basic health services (BHS). From a national
perspective the low budget allocation is partly due to the health sector's low absorptive
capacity. It is estimated that current per capita public expenditures for health overall are
one-half or less of the cost of delivering a minimum package of health services to all
Indonesians (using the 1993 World Development Report suggested package for low income
countries as a benchmark).
1.31         But other factors, particularly those relating to institutional capacity and
organizational culture also contribute to performance problems. For example, service
quality is affected by lack of sensitivity to clients, inefficient work processes, poor
management, and weak performance incentives. These weaknesses can make government
health facilities less attractive and accessible to clients. The limited time spent by
physicians with patients, inadequate counselling efforts, and the inflexibility of facility
service hours are all telltale indicators. A related problem that has been documented in
East Java and NTB is variable compliance with technical standards of care. Staff may not
be clear about case management protocols, and know little about quality assessment and
problem-solving methodologies. And, current assessment mechanisms and supervision
practices often do not provide the feedback and assistance needed to improve service
performance. Consequently, diagnoses may be unreliable and treatment ineffective.



- 8 -
1.32        Finally, health centers are sometimes poorly managed, while staff may have
insufficient incentives to provide high quality care and reach out to prospective clients.
Facility managers (doctors) often are unable to sufficiently guide health workers on case
management protocols, data analysis, problem-solving and use of staff time. Health center
managers do not have much power over priority setting and resource allocation.
Consequently, they lack the motivation to develop sensible, locally appropriate plans and
work out innovative initiatives.
1.33        A further deficiency in health system performance is that the poor continue
to lag behind. For example, in 1991 infant mortality for mothers who had completed some
secondary schools, a reasonable proxy for household income, was one half that for those
who had not completed primary schools.  This finding applies in the five project
provinces. The utilization rate of modem health services, including those provided by the
government, is also less than that of the well-off, as illustrated by survey data on Kaltim
and NTB.
1.34        Given the relatively low budgetary allocation for health, government services
need to be more focused on the needs of the poor. Currently, the poor receive a
disproportionately low share of overall health subsidies. A 1993 Bank study of the
incidence of the health spending showed that the amount of subsidy per capita going to the
top income decile is about three times that of the lowest decile. This is due in part to the
substantial share of health spending going to hospital services that are used mostly by the
well-off.
1.35        Improving Performance. Given its mixed record of success, the question
is whether the government health system in the five provinces can meet the various health
challenges facing the country. Fortunately, there are indications that the system can be
improved and that publicly managed health facilities can provide better quality care. As
mentioned (para. 1.28), there are numerous districts in which average facility utilization
rate is very high.  In addition, field visits revealed that there are health centers in
Indonesia that are well-managed and highly utilized, despite budgetary and other
institutional constraints. Second, the experience of Third Health Project in NTB and
Kaltim suggests that even partial steps towards decentralization, giving greater
responsibility and authority to district managers, can have a positive impact on health
sector progress indicators (Chapter 2). Third, a pilot project in NTB and East Java (see
Annex 14) demonstrates that a modest investment in the establishment of quality assurance
processes can yield notable improvements in the quality of care. In a short period of less
than a year, compliance with recommended standards of care increased dramatically, and
clinics began to take steps to address client satisfaction issues.
1.36        These observations imply that further progress in health can be achieved by
improving public provision of services. To realize this expectation, however, will require
changes in work processes, staff motivation, budgetary focus, and institutional capacity.
1.37        Facility-level Changes. Improvements are needed, in the first instance, in
the way service provision is organized at the puskesmas level (including its outreach
activities). This is a fundamental condition for enhancing the utilization of health services,



-9-
especially among the poor, and the effectiveness and efficiency of care. Raising the
productivity of frontline workers will require additional funds for health centers and
changes in the ways service tasks are allocated, carried out and supervised. Facility-level
managers need to be made responsible for public health services. This means giving them
the necessary support, incentives, and authority to carry out solutions they deem
appropriate to their local situation, while at the same time making them accountable. In
this regard, funds for health centers should not only be adequate, but should be provided
in a manner that would allow managers the freedom to allocate resources in accordance
with locally appropriate priorities. This strengthening of managerial authority needs to
translate into a commitment to team-building and quality improvement, and a greater focus
on client needs, demands and outcomes.
1.38         Such changes in organizational culture can be facilitated through the
application of quality assurance (QA) mechanisms and procedures. QA is an approach to
building organizational capacity and culture that focuses on continuous improvement in
service (product) quality and its ability to satisfy consumer requirements. Institution of
QA systems has been an element in the success of many firms in various industries and
services including health care. In Indonesia, some industries and a few hospitals have
started to apply QA concepts and techniques.
1.39         In its application to health, quality assurance deals with compliance with
case management protocols and broader issues regarding efficient provision and utilization
of services. In practice, QA programs involve establishing cost-effective standards for
facility services; building capacity for data-based "systems analysis" (which means
enabling staff to methodically investigate problems in quality issues and systemic
processes); enhancing skills and authority to solve problems and learning appropriate
lessons from their experience; cultivating team work; and facilitating client feedbacks and
community participation to improve patient satisfaction.
1.40         More Effective Supervision and Support. To facilitate and reinforce
facility-level changes, support from the provincial and district management will now have
to focus on expediting and motivating the work of frontline providers of care. The change
in responsibilities and the agenda for those working at this level will require enhanced
provincial and regional decision-making authority and capacity, and changes in supervisory
culture, learning opportunities and incentives. To this end, the first step will be to extend
the decentralization measures that have been successfully piloted in Kaltim and NTB by
the Third Health Project.
1.41         In addition, the supervision system will have to move away from the
established inspection approach towards facilitation and coaching of subordinates on ways
to improve services. Supervisors, for example, need to focus on communicating standards
of care and teaching puskesmas staff how to make reliable assessments of the care they
provide. Meanwhile, monitoring and evaluation data need to be rationalized to enable the
supervisors to help frontline providers more effectively. Data should include measures of
service quality, consumer satisfaction and demand, and facility-level resource use and
efficiency.



- 10 -
1.42         Better support for frontline providers also means that learning opportunities
for continuing education, and incentives that reward competency and performance need to
be established. Current training has low relevance to providers' needs, while reliance on
off-the-job (residential) training has often been be disruptive of staff work and is quite
costly. To meet the learning requirements of health facility staff efficiently, it is vital to
decentralize training activities and plan them in accordance with documented knowledge
deficits.  It is also important to establish rigorous, regular evaluation of training
effectiveness; test alternative methodologies such as distance learning that are less
disruptive of staff work; and institute better control mechanisms for minimizing the
monetary and opportunity cost of staff training. Furthermore, incentives need to be
restructured so that they are tied to measures of actual skills improvement, instead of
encouraging staff to attend off-the-job training.
1.43         To reinforce the above-mentioned facility-level changes and the ability of
the district and higher level units to expedite achievement of those improvements, some
adjustments in MOH's personnel policies will also be required. One change should include
devolution of decision-making authority to allow district and facility managers to allocate
manpower resources or their financial equivalent to support their local health service
improvement plan, including hiring contract (private) providers. These administrators need
to be made responsible and accountable, initially in pilot areas, for deciding on the number
of staff, skill mix, in-service training and task assignments within facility budget
constraints.
1.44         To ensure that decentralization of decision-making results in higher
productivity, effective performance assessment mechanisms and incentives need to be put
in place. Current performance evaluation systems, which are based on self-assessment,
are ineffectual, and need to be replaced by a credible evaluation systems, which can be
used in conjunction with schemes for accrediting health centers and rewarding
performance.
1.45         Finally, improving support for frontline providers and managers entails
timely access to drugs and equipment that for practical reasons are more efficiently
procured by units at the district level or higher.  Lacking an effective inventory
management system and demand-driven process of ordering, available equipment often
does not match what health facilities actually need and, as a result, are often unused or
underutilized. Therefore, in addition to replicating nationally the drugs management
system (LPLPO) developed by the Third Health Project (HP III), an analogous system for
equipment management needs to be instituted.
1.46         Better Resource Allocation and Health Financing. In a recent advance,
the Integrated DIP (development budget) or DIP Terpadu (an initiative under the Third
Health Project) gives the Dokabu (health district head) the authority to reallocate resources
between basic health programs funded through the DIP. Further steps, however, are
needed to give district and facility managers the authority to reallocate resources between
expenditure categories and to reduce the number of budgetary channels.  Without
additional progress towards decentralized and integrated budgeting, accountability for



- 11 -
health performance will remain diffused, and local health managers will have little
motivation to initiate service improvement.
1.47         In addition to improved budgetary processes, increased public funding for
BHS is needed to ensure that the poor have access to adequate, good quality health
services. The Repelita VI goal of improving the health status of the poor needs to be
interpreted in terms of the share of BHS in the health budget. Quantitative targets will
have to be specified and spending levels regularly monitored, requiring collection and
analysis of integrated budgetary data. At present, such information is not available.
Accordingly, a system to routinely track the total amount of resources going to basic health
services and to evaluate the impact of proposed budgetary decisions on their funding will
be required.
1.48         Support for BHS can also come by raising fees for nonessential health
services provided by public facilities, particularly hospitals, and by permitting greater
retention of revenues from health service fee. Public facilities currently charge low prices
for their services. For example, public hospitals charge fees that on average are less than
30 percent of cost. Local government should be encouraged not only to return all health
revenues to the sector, but also to guarantee health centers a fraction of their revenues for
operations and maintenance and staff incentives. Of course, the poor must be protected
from the impact of price increases. This can be done through: (i) geographic price
discrimination, charging zero or low fees at facilities serving primarily poor households
and higher prices at facilities with better-off clients; (ii) individual price discrimination,
such as giving health fee exemption cards to poor households; (iii) charging differential
prices at different levels of care to encourage self-selection; and (iv) larger fees for
identifiable groups of better-off individuals such as civil servants. Pilot activities on price
adjustments and ways of protecting the poor from fee increases have been conducted in
Kaltim and NTB and need to be extended to other areas.
1.49         Finally, expanding health insurance for the better-off may  enable
government to target more public resources towards the poor. In principle, provision of
insurance would redirect the insured population towards higher quality private sector
services, reducing their use of public facilities and increasing the public budget for the
poor. How best to promote this expansion, however, and address important design issues
needs to be explored, for example, by testing self-financing prepaid health plans, using
private providers and capitation payments. Pilot efforts would allow Perum Husada
Bhakti, the civil servants' health insurance system, to develop ways of reducing its
dependence on subsidized government services and would give MOH direct experience on
how to contract private providers to deliver prepaid packages of health services, ensure
quality of care and deal with enforcement issues.
D. HEALTH SECTOR PLAN AND STRATEGY
1.50         The government is aware of the issues of equity and efficiency in health
system performance, and intends to address them during Repelita VI, the current five year
development planning period (I 994/95 - 98/99). The objectives and policies of Repelita
VI are consistent with the steps suggested above to improve health sector performance.



- 12 -
1.51         The general objective of Repelita VI is to raise the health status of the
population by increasing the quality and scope of health services and by paying greater
attention to the needs of the poor. It aims to achieve specific targets for infant mortality
rate, life expectancy at birth, maternal mortality rate, nutritional status and other health
outcomes which are presented in Annex 9. For example, GOI aims at reducing IMR to
50 deaths per thousand live births at the end of Repelita VI-current estimates put IMR
in the 55-60 range.
1.52         As specified in Repelita VI, the Ministry of Health  would focus on
improving equity and quality of health services, with particular attention to the poor,
children, and neglected elderly. To achieve these ends, MOH is to emphasize cost-
effectiveness in service delivery, by decentralizing health management and decision-making
authority to provincial and district governments, and through greater mobilization of
available resources, including non-governmental capabilities. In allocating health budgets,
MOH is to give priority to highly cost-effective basic health services and interventions that
directly benefit the poor. The Ministry will also promote intersectoral cooperation through
improved participation of community, private sector and professional associations.
1.53         For GOI, the Fourth Health Project (HP IV) represents a vehicle through
which to test ways of attaining the goals of improving the quality and equity of health care.
In particular, this project would enable GOI to:
(a)   Effect facility level changes to raise the level of performance of basic health
service (BHS) providers, specifically in rendering higher quality BHS and
reaching out to the poor;
(b)   Adjust institutional arrangements at the provincial and district levels so that
frontline providers receive stronger support from higher level staff and
accountability of both health center and district management is enhanced;
and
(c)   Improve health financing by allocating a greater percentage of government
health spending to highly cost-effective interventions (BHS) and raising the
share of health benefits of the poor, increasing local government financial
support for health and raising the rate of retention of revenues from fees for
health services to support and encourage their improvement, and adjusting
budgetary arrangements, in particular promoting the use of block grants for
health services.

BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED
A. BACKGROUND
2.1         The Bank has funded thirteen health projects in Indonesia since 1977. These
include support for nutrition, community health, health manpower development, water and
sanitation, referral facilities and family planning initiatives. Bank loans for these projects
totalled US$602 million. Thirty-eight percent of these loans financed "first generation"
projects, which consist of loans approved before 1989.
2.2          These first generation or "start up" projects had a mixed record of success.
The first four population projects have been implemented satisfactorily and have
contributed significantly to the success of Indonesia's family planning program. The
Second Nutrition and Community Health Project (NCH II) also achieved its main
objectives of promoting "Posyandu", a monthly community-based integrated delivery of
five high priority health interventions at designated locations. On the other hand, the
Provincial Health Project and the Second Health (Manpower Development) Project were
rated as unsatisfactory due to both design and implementation problems.
2.3         Of the second generation (follow-up) projects, the Third Health Project (HP
111) is now widely recognized as a well implemented, carefully designed operation. This
innovative project, which started in 1989 and is now in its last year of implementation, has
supported empowerment of provincial and district health authorities, management reforms
and resource mobilization in the provinces of Kaltim and NTB. How HP III has helped
shape government policy and attitudes towards the above-mentioned issues is discussed
below. Of the other second generation projects, Third Community Health and Nutrition
Project (CHN III) and Water Supply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project
(WSSLIC), appear promising but are only in the second year of execution.
2.4         In addition to sector lending, the Bank has conducted several sector studies
on health planning and budgeting, health insurance, social expenditures and poverty, and
the health workforce between 1989 and 1994. Furthermore, analytical work on the health
sector has been regularly undertaken for the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and
the Country Assistance Strategy.

B. LESSONS LEARNED
2.5         First Generation Projects. The following lessons have emerged from the
experience of the first cohort of health projects:
(a)   Too rapid expansion of activities can jeopardize quality and lack of attention
to quality assurance and effectiveness issues seriously limits project impact
on health outcomes. It is for this reason that despite the rapid expansion of
Posyandu and the accompanying dramatic increases in immunization,
nutrition surveillance, and diarrhea control activities, infant mortality rate
has declined little in the last 10-15 years.
(b)   A project is likely to be more effective if it is demand-driven. Much of the
explanation for the failures of the above-mentioned manpower development
and hospital construction projects can be traced to past disregard of this
factor. For example, hospital capacity was expanded by 30 percent, when
there was little effective demand as evidenced by the fact that public health
facilities in Indonesia were widely underutilized.
(c)   Right from the start, project preparation and design should maximize
ownership by concerned agencies and policy-makers to ensure timely and
effective implementation. This is a key characteristic of the successful
population projects and the prime factor for NCH II's satisfactory and
timely completion-achieved despite unanticipated problems of counterpart
funding and other initial difficulties delaying project implementation.
2.6         Second Generation Projects. From the recent group of projects, the most
important lessons derive from the experience of HP III. The greatest success of HP III
has been the introduction of a process of institutional reforms that have had as a focus
strengthening the provincial and district health offices' role in health program
implementation.   These reforms include measures for decentralization  and drug
management, which have been accepted for national replication in Repelita VI.
2.7          Provincial and district strengthening was achieved by developing the
following instruments:
(a)   the Integrated Health Plan and Budget (IHPB). This is a consolidated
framework depicting all flows of funds to health programs in the sector;
(b)   the Integrated DIP or DIP Terpadu and the Basic Health Service Package.
This is the consolidation of the central budgets (DIPs) for community health
into a single budget for high priority basic health services.
(c)   transfer of budget responsibility to the District Health Officer (Dokabu), a
step that expanded the resource allocation authority of the Dokabu.



- 15 -
2.8          These measures have engendered a more decentralized planning process with
provincial, district and puskesmas staff becoming more involved in the process; greater
flexibility and decision making authority at the local level; and clearer sense of
accountability and faster flow of funds. In addition, as provincial and district governments
became more aware of health issues and more involved in their solutions, local funding
rose dramatically. Furthermore, drugs shortages at the health center have been minimized
in the HP III provinces, not only because of increased budgetary allocations but also
because of the development of an innovative system (LPLPO) of drug management and
supply.
2.9          Two overall lessons have emerged from these HP III outcomes:
(a)    First, incremental steps towards decentralization, particularly strengthening
the responsibility and authority for and the management and delivery of
health programs at the district level, have had considerable positive impact
on health sector development.
(b)   Second, local government involvement is vital to the success of any
decentralization effort. A substantial "marketing" effort is required from
the outset of preparation and through project implementation.
2.10         The achievements of HP III, however, represent just a start towards
enhancing the capacity and organizational culture of health centers and improving support
from the district and provincial levels of government. Much remains to be done. For
example, quality of care provided at puskesmas is still deficient in terms of compliance
with case management protocols, indicating the need for introducing quality assurance
mechanisms. Furthermore, in spite of the freedom to shift budgets between programs
included in the DIP Terpadu, district managers are still unable to reallocate these resources
across categories of expenditures as they see fit. Puskesmas managers also continue to
follow targets reflecting central level priorities, rather than determining their own priorities
and allocating their DIP Terpadu budget in accordance with local disease patterns.
Another lesson, therefore, emerges from HP III experience:
(c)    Follow-up efforts may be needed to sustain institutional changes and extend
them to health facilities to achieve more satisfactory levels of health service
performance.
2.11         In conclusion, institutional and management advances have occurred in
Kaltim and NTB, which have already resulted in improved health services. Additional
efforts, however, are needed to supplement these achievements.  From  the national
perspective, follow-up projects are needed to facilitate replication of the aforementioned
innovations in the other provinces. Equally important, the process of experimentation and
institutional reforms would also have to be broadened to bring changes in other areas that
are critical for higher health system performance.

C. RATIONALE AND STRATEGY FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
2.12         The health sector is an appropriate area for Bank involvement.  Public
intervention in the sector is legitimate and necessary to maximize sector efficiency. Many
basic health interventions have public goods characteristics; moreover, market
imperfections in the health sector are quite serious due to the asymmetry of information
between consumers and providers. Some public interventions can also be justified on
grounds of equity. In particular, Bank analysis show that the provision of basic health
services is a cost-effective way to alleviate poverty.
2.13         To realize more fully the benefits from government health interventions,
GOI needs to make adjustments in its public health system and in its approach to health
care.  These changes involve a combination of policy changes, revised institutional
arrangements, strengthening of incentives structures, technical capacity building,
procedural reforms, and improved health financing.
2.14         The Bank is well suited to provide the support needed to deal with these
various issues. First, it is at the forefront in assisting health sector reforms in Indonesia
and has accumulated relevant knowledge and experience. Its analytical work and recent
innovative lending operations have dealt with key sectoral issues. Second, the Bank has
established an excellent partnership with GOI and a credible approach to health sector
reform. Third, Bank involvement is consistent with its global health development policy
and its country assistance strategy (CAS) for Indonesia.
2.15         In this regard, HP IV represents an excellent vehicle for pursuing the
objective, cited in the CAS, of helping Indonesia overcome human resource bottlenecks
by strengthening the decentralized management, quality and utilization of basic social
services. HP IV would contribute to the CAS agenda by:
(a)   supporting GOI efforts to enable and motivate frontline health providers and
managers in public facilities to deliver higher quality, more accessible
services that fit the needs and demands of clients;
(b)   promoting decentralization and enhancement of capacity of provinces and
districts to supervise and support lower level managers and staff; and
(c)   assisting  in  improving  health  financing  by  reorienting  (a) public
expenditures in health to assure that a larger share of sectoral allocations
goes to the poor and provision of basic service packages, and (b) sector
financing mechanisms, with much greater reliance to be placed on direct
cost recovery and health insurance modalities.

CHAPTER 3
THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3. 1         The aim of the project is to improve health outcomes by giving provinces,
districts and puskesmas managers greater authority, responsibility, resources, and skills
to enhance health care quality and equity. Specific project objectives are: (i) to increase
the authority and capacity of provincial and district health offices and health centers to plan
and implement health programs as they deem appropriate to local conditions; (ii) to ensure
that the provision and consumption of key health services conform to affordable, cost-
effective standards of care; (iii) to improve access and utilization of these health services
by the poor; and (iv) to improve efficiency in the delivery of basic health services (BHS).
These objectives address key issues that are essential to further health sector development
and poverty alleviation.
3.2          The project would cover five provinces: West and East Kalimantan, Nusa
Tenggara Barat (NTB), West Sumatra (Sumbar), and East Java (Jatim). Except for Jatim,
all districts in each province would be covered. Fourteen districts in Jatim would be
included, chosen in accordance with selection criteria that gave highest priority to poverty
and BHS gap indicators, and commitment to price reforms and facility fee retention for
operations and maintenance (O&M) and staff incentives. -The choice of the five provinces
was based on the following considerations. First, Kaltim and NTB were included to
follow up assistance provided under HP III with additional innovative activities deemed
necessary to bring about required changes in organizational culture and institutional
capacity at the facility level. Second, GOI chose the remaining three provinces from those
that did not have any major donor-assisted health project. Within this group, priority was
given to those provinces with the worst poverty indicators (Kalbar) and the largest number
of poor families (East Java).
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.3         Project Design. The Fourth Health Project (HP IV) adopts a systems
approach (see Chart 3.1) to quality and equity improvement and employs various
mechanisms to bring about facility-level changes and adjustments (described below) at the
provincial, district and central levels to achieve its objectives. Provincial and district health
offices would be given enhanced responsibility and authority for planning and
implementing most of HP IV's activities, including the processing of contracts. The role
of the Central Ministry would be to provide general guidance and technical assistance and

to disseminate innovations and lessons learned from the experience of provinces and
districts. Fourth Health Project's design is highly cost-effective, compared to other
alternatives for improving health outcomes and poverty alleviation. First, the basic health
interventions (currently underutilized) the project would support are highly cost-effective
relative to other health services, as shown by the 1993 World Development Report.
Second, a Bank study of the incidence of health subsidy benefits in Indonesia reveals that
spending on health center and subcenter services, which is currently low, are strongly pro-
poor compared to other public subsidies.  Hence, reorienting government health
expenditures towards improving basic health services would not only be efficient but also
be equitable. Third, a pilot study (see Annex 14) reveals that a modest amount of
investment in establishing quality assurance processes could lead to considerable
improvements in quality of care and, hence, in enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the
above-mentioned basic health services.  Fourth, greater efficiency could be achieved
through the following district, central and facility level changes and mechanisms.
3.4          Facility-Level Change. The first project mechanism is improvement of
basic health services provided by puskesmas and, to a limited extent, by district hospitals
in the five provinces. (In this report, the term puskesmas or health center also refers to
associated sub-centers and outreach programs.) Here, the agenda is to change the work
processes, attitudes, skills and other aspects of organizational culture of these facilities,
while giving them additional resources that would enable the provision of higher quality,
more accessible services that fit the needs and demands of clients.
3.5          To this end, the project would introduce and establish facility-level quality
assurance (QA) processes suitable to the Indonesian situation. The QA program, which
has been based on lessons from a small pilot project in NTB and East Java (see Annex
14), would be directed at five areas: technical competence, client satisfaction, efficiency,
coverage/access, and effectiveness. Health center staff would initially learn to analyze and
resolve simple problems of non-compliance with clinical standards and would progress to
more complex issues pertaining to priority-setting and health outcome problems. To
achieve the aims of this quality assurance program, the project would support on-the-job
training and encourage self-learning in areas of concern.
3.6          HP IV would finance expenditures needed to carry out service improvement
plans drawn up by frontline providers through problem-solving and priority setting
exercises. For this purpose, a program would be established providing Special Assistance
Funds (SAF) for health centers. SAFs comprise discretionary resources that puskesmas
managers could use to purchase eligible expenditure items (mainly for operations) needed
to initiate and implement their plans. Agreed SAF Operating Guidelines in Annex 10
present the list of eligible expenditures together with the operating procedures and the
assignment of oversight responsibility. (Expenditures made through the SAF would be
referred to in the cost tables below as SAE or Special Assistance Expenditures.)
Furthermore, additional assistance for improving physical facilities, equipment, and other
activities needed to reduce BHS quality and coverage gaps would be provided through
other (less flexible) budgetary arrangements.



- 20 -
3.7         To maximize their impact, use of the above funds would be concentrated on
selected basic health interventions that are expected to be highly cost-effective. Annex 13
presents an initial list of these interventions (Basic Awal). This list would be used during
the first year of the project and revised on the basis of a more systematic analysis of
disease burdens and the relative cost-effectiveness of health interventions.
3.8         Provincial, District, and Central Level Changes. Improvements in the
current institutional processes and the attitudes and technical assistance capacity of staff
in health districts and provincial units comprise the second mechanism and agenda.
Assistance would be geared towards building the ability of provinces and districts to
supervise, support, and reward frontline providers of care, while at the same time making
district and facility managers more accountable for their performance.
3.9          To bring about these changes, HP IV would reorient the way supervisors
do their job. They would be encouraged to change their role from acting as work
inspectors (mainly noting bureaucratic shortcomings) to coaches who would help frontline
staff improve their services, treating them as internal clients and sharing with them
problem-solving responsibility. In this new role, supervisors would become sources of
new ideas and conduits for communicating standards of care to puskesmas staff.
Accordingly, HP IV would provide supervisors learning opportunities to acquire a clear
understanding of recommended clinical standards, the ability to analyze compliance
problems and other more complex service quality issues, as well as skills in team-building
and monitoring. In addition, an evaluation system would be developed whereby frontline
staff would be able to provide feedback on the effectiveness of their supervisors in
carrying out their new role.
3.10        The project would give provincial and district health offices the additional
funds needed to support the above agenda. Resources would be provided in ways that
would advance decentralization and make resource allocation decisions more demand-
driven. Hence, in funding equipment and drugs, the project would institute (prior to major
purchases of these items) reforms of their inventory and management not only to minimize
wastage and increase reliability of supply, but also to give provincial, district and facility
managers a voice in the procurement process to ensure that it is responsive to frontline
needs.  HP IV training prograns would be decentralized, emphasizing on-the-job
approaches tailored to address knowledge and skills deficits identified by health staff
through their QA exercises.
3.11         Furthermore, discretionary special assistance funds (SAFs) would be
provided to health districts to finance eligible expenditures they deem necessary (within
the parameters set out in the SAF Operating Guidelines) to carry out BHS improvements.
These expenditures would include, inter alia, outlays for supervision, monitoring and
evaluation, and redeployment of staff, for which HP IV provinces and districts would be
given the necessary authority. Through these special assistance funds, HP IV would help
provinces and health districts establish a track record that could eventually help accelerate
further budgetary integration and decentralization of resource allocation and personnel
decisions. During negodations, GOI gave assurances that it would carry out the



- 21 -
activities under the SAF in accordance with the SAF Operating Guidelines, agreed with
the Bank.
3.12        As authority is devolved to provincial, district and frontline managers, HP
IV would simultaneously strengthen their accountability and enhance their motivation to
improve health service performance. Accordingly, as part of the quality assurance and
other initiatives to bring about changes at the provincial and district levels, the project
would develop new health center accreditation and performance-linked incentive systems.
These systems would be based on an agreed list of performance indicators (para. 3.41 and
Annex 3) and linked to various incentives that GOI would like to test. One scheme would
be for districts with excellent performance to receive their Integrated DIP in a form that
would increasingly look like a block grant. Another is to raise their SAFs as the districts
showed greater absorptive capacity, while freezing or reducing that of consistently non-
performning districts at initial levels until remedial measures have been taken and the latter
showed evidence that they can absorb additional funds efficiently. In addition, based on
the experience of Balikpapan and other puskesmas in Kaltim regarding their use of facility
fees, districts would be encouraged to guarantee staff of accredited health centers a fraction
of their revenues from health service fees and allow them to use the money for their
operations and maintenance as well as staff incentives.
3.13        Finally, to lay the ground for further health system advances, the project
would support trials of bolder innovations and QA studies (e.g., on standards of care and
documentation of best practices). In this regard, a limited amount of funds would be
allocated to finance program development expenditures (PDE) needed to pilot the testing
of managed care schemes using private providers, a system for their accreditation, MOH
hiring processes, and other high priority issues specified in the PDE Operating Guidelines
(see Annex 11). The list of eligible expenditures, the criteria for approval of proposals
and the process of review are described in these guidelines. During negotiations, GOI
provided assurances that it would carry out the Program Development activities in
accordance with the Program Development Expenditures Operatng Guidelines, agreed
with the Bank.
3.14        Increased Financial Support for BHS and Poverty Alleviation. The third
mechanism and agenda are resource mobilization and the reorientation of government
spending to raise funding of basic health services (BHS). The above initiatives would
contribute to this agenda by establishing provincial and district capacity to deliver effective
health services and, thereby, making the health sector an attractive area for public
investment. These steps are crucial to overcome the reluctance of concerned planning and
finance officials to boost public spending on health because of their view that the health
sector does not have the absorptive capacity to use additional funds effectively.
3.15        HP IV would also encourage increased provincial and district funding of
BHS by fostering greater local government awareness of health sector issues and
involvement in their solution. Fees would be increased for non-BHS personal health
services provided by publicly managed facilities and the return of all health revenues to
the sector would be promoted. At the same time, measures would be taken to develop and



- 22 -
institute schemes (e.g., geographic price discrimination or use of health cards for fee
exemption) to protect the poor from the impact of fee increases.
3.16        A further step to raise funding of basic health services to the poor is the
expansion of self-financing health insurance schemes among the better-off, which include
civil servants, to reduce their dependence on highly subsidized government health services.
The PDE funds mentioned above would be available to finance such proposals. An
example of these proposals is building the capacity of Perum Husada Bhakti to develop and
market self-financing prepaid health plans for the well-off and in the process shift the
delivery of the civil servants' health insurance benefits to private sector providers.
3.17        Lastly, HP IV would introduce a budgetary practice of giving more financial
assistance to health facilities which attend primarily to the needs of the poor than those
serving the better-off. The SAF would, therefore, be structured so that health centers and
districts serving primarily poor communities would be allocated relatively more funds.
This design feature would reinforce the equity impact that might be expected from
allocating a larger proportion of public funds to basic health services. In Indonesia, the
incidence of benefits from these services, which are primarily delivered by health centers
and their subcenters, strongly favor the poor.
3.18        GOI brought to negotiations a Statement of Policy of the Ministry of Health
and a Statement of Provincial Government Support for the project, showing the
commitment of MOH and the Governors of participating provinces to an increase in the
amount of Central and provincial health subsidies going to the poor as well as to the
provision of basic health services.  In this regard, annual targets were agreed at
negotiations for increasing health related public spending for the poor and for basic health
services.
3.19        Agreement was also reached with GOI at negotiations, providing for higher
SAFs per capita for health centers and health districts in poor areas than those in well-off
areas. Moreover, assurances were provided during negotiations that GOI would: (a) not
later than December 31, 1995, furnish to the Bank a classification, on the basis of
poverty issues, of health centers and health districts in the project provinces, as referred
to in the aforementioned Statement of Policy and Provincial Government Support; (b)
not later than October 31, 1996, furnish to the Bank guidelines for pricing personal
health services provided by health centers and hospitals and protecting the poorfrom the
impact of price adjustments; and (c) not later that October 31, 1996 implement the
system for the annual collection of consolidated budgetary information to monitor
achievement of the above-mentioned targets and for assessing the impact of proposed
central and provincial budgetary allocations on the funding of BHS.
3.20        Furthermore, assurances were provided by GOI during negotiations that it
shaUl cause the local governments of the participating provinces to take aU actions
requiredfor the implementation of the Provincial Government Statement in each district
selected to participate in the project, including the requirement: (a) that the share of
distridc health budget going to BHS and the poor be increased annually; (b) that health
service fees be adjusted upwards and that such revenues be used for purposes of the



- 23 -
health sector; and (c) tW  part of the earnings of the health centers be used by such
facilites for health center perfornance incenfives.
3.21         Components. In each province, the project consists of facility-level service
improvement, institutional development, and resource allocation and revenue generation
components. (For a detailed description of each component, see Annex 5.) In the facility-
level service component, funds would be used: (i) to improve the physical facilities of
health centers, subcenters and, to a limited extent, district hospitals, including support for
needed equipment, water supply, storage facilities, vehicles and furniture; and (ii) reduce
the current BHS gaps in quality and coverage by providing discretionary health center
Special Assistance Funds (SAFs) and other additional resources for operational and
recurrent costs (on a declining rate) to support implementation of quality assurance and
other BHS programs initiated by frontline providers.
3.22         Funds for institutional development would finance improvements in the
capacity of provincial, district, and Central-level agencies to assist, motivate, and supervise
frontline health providers in delivering accessible high quality packages of basic health
services. Specifically, project expenditures would go to: (i) establishing quality assurance
(including health center accreditation systems) and supporting training/curriculum
development activities; (ii) developing effective performance-linked incentives systems;
(iii) financing discretionary district SAFs, replication of HP III innovations, and other pilot
programs that could lead to improvements in the organizational culture of the public health
system and its role in the provision of basic health services; and (iv) strengthening the
capacity of Central-level MOH units to give technical guidance, disseminate quality
assurance and other HP IV innovations, and carry out oversight functions.
3.23         Finally, funds would be provided in the resource allocation and revenue
generation component for technical assistance (TA), data collection and analysis, materials
and workshops to design and promote facility-level fee increases and revenue retention,
and institute more effective targeting of health subsidies to appropriate recipients and
activities. Funds under this component would help MOH: (i) to develop and establish
mechanisms for monitoring and reporting the total health subsidies going to BHS and the
poor, especially their corresponding share in Central and local health budgets for the
nation as a whole and for each of the five provinces; and (ii) to develop a system for
analyzing annual APBN (National Budget) and APBD (Regional Budget) budgetary
decisions in terms of the above financial indicators.
3.24         Provincial Health Improvement Programs. Project activities and outlays
by province are described below (amounts in parentheses are base costs; see Table 4.1(a)
for detailed breakdown):
3.25         East Java (US$23.1 million equivalent): The project would mainly fund
operational and incremental recurrent costs (73 percent) to meet the drugs and other
requirements of an expanded BHS coverage program and developmental expenditures (13
percent) needed to establish quality assurance practices and supporting training programs.
Over a fifth of Jatim's project cost would finance discretionary SAFs for health centers and
districts which support GOI's decentralization efforts. Outlays would be directed at existing



- 24 -
deficiencies in the quality and coverage of ten basic health services, which include
nutrition, maternal and child care/family planning, immunization, health education, control
of communicable diseases (dengue, malaria, TB, diarrhea, ARI and school health
services). Other uses of the above amount include inter alia funding of supervision
improvements and pilot activities involving private health providers, health insurance,
district-determined redeployment of health staff, the development of performance-linked
incentives and replication of the drugs management and other HP III innovations.
3.26         West Kalimantan (US$29.6 million equivalent): A distinctive feature of
Kalbar's program is its support for technical assistance and other components that would
address systemic issues arising from the application of Indonesia's conventional health
delivery system and approaches to an area characterized by non-standard geographic
configurations. Kalbar's SAFs (30 percent) and budget for QA and supporting activities
(10 percent) would be the vehicle to enable the province to tailor its approaches to the
distinctive environment within which its health programs operate. In addition, the project
would support civil works (40 percent) and equipment provision more heavily than in other
provinces to improve the physical infrastructure of its publicly managed basic health
services facilities. Referral facilities for maternal and child services would be strengthened.
Water and sanitation programs would be improved to reduce the high prevalence rate of
water-borne diseases.
3.27         Nusa Tenggara Barat (US$9.0 million equivalent): NTB would further
develop, expand and institutionalize the quality assurance program that it has successfully
piloted. In addition, it would try out Referral Health Centers and develop a program to
enhance the ability of traditional birth attendants (the predominant source of birth delivery
assistance) to conduct their practice safer and to make timely and appropriate referrals of
high risk pregnancies. NTB's SAFs (28 percent), quality assurance efforts (15 percent),
and support for health equipment and recurrent costs for supervision and medical supplies
(21 percent) would provide funds to promote safe motherhood, child immunization, ARI
interventions and other BHS activities.
3.28         East Kalinantan (US$14.5 million equivalent): As in the other provinces,
the project would support the development of effective systems of performance evaluation
and associated incentive schemes linked to service improvements in terms of both
utilization and quality assurance-based indicators. Kaltim would further develop and
expand its pioneering efforts to use health center fees as a source of extra-budgetary
resources and incentives for improved service performance by health staff. Like East Java,
it also plans to use project funds for Program Development Expenditures to pilot a
managed prepaid health care system in Balikpapan that would utilize private providers of
health services.
3.29         However, project funds allocated for this province would be used largely
to establish quality assurance processes and supporting activities (about 10 percent) and
finance recurrent costs for health supplies (15 percent), SAFs (23 percent) and equipment
(17 percent) purchases to address Kaltim's remaining problems of communicable and
infectious diseases. As in other provinces, the SAFs would not only increase discretionary
resources available to district offices and health center managers to respond more quickly



- 25 -
to quality problems documented through the application of QA methodologies; they would
also be used as a vehicle for developing and instituting a budgetary practice of providing
extra operational resources for underserved areas. In this regard, East Kalimantan plans
to initially give poor health districts 50 percent more SAFs per health center than those in
non-poor areas.
3.30         West Sumatra (US$27.5 million equivalent): This fund would support:
(i) the development of an institutionalized QA program; (ii) the expansion of outreach
activities, particularly in the remote areas; (iii) training to address skills deficits that affect
quality of care; (iv) expanded supervisory contacts with service providers to facilitate the
QA program and development of interventions to make these contacts more productive and
accountable; (v) redeployment of staff to underserved areas; (vi) the provision of adequate
health supplies and greater availability of functional equipment in health centers; and (vii)
decentralized problem-solving initiatives by health center, district and provincial managers.
3.31         Sumbar would use the above funds among others to raise immunization rate
and utilization of cost-effective health interventions to strengthen MCH services and
control of communicable and infectious diseases such as ARI, TB, malaria, and diarrhea.
In this regard, about a quarter of the above funds would finance discretionary SAFs that
the province can use to expand its BHS programs, especially to poor communities. In
addition, another third of the US$27.5 million would be allocated for drugs and other
recurrent costs to meet shortages of supplies. West Sumatra would further spend about
12 percent to develop the skills of its health staff to analyze and address service utilization
issues, in addition to technical quality problems.
3.32         Although training expenditures would be focused on QA methodologies,
these funds would be used, selectively, to develop programs with clearly defined goals
expressed in terms of objectively measurable competencies and aimed at addressing staff
deficiencies in technical skills and knowledge that have been demonstrated to hamper the
ability of district and frontline health staff to provide effective care. With technical
assistance from Pusdiklat (the national center for health in-service training), Sumbar also
plans to use HP IV funds to try out and evaluate innovative approaches such as distance
learning and on-the-job training to meet the learning needs of health staff. The cost-
effectiveness of providing incentives based on measured skills and knowledge acquired
through training or self-learning would be examined and successful innovations would be
expanded in future years. (Sumbar's training strategy illustrates the approach that the other
provinces also intend to take to support HP IV's learning requirements.)
C. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
3.33         Project management. The Ministry of Health would be the executing
agency with the Secretary-General as Project Director (Annex 12).  He would be
responsible for the overall direction of the project and for making decisions on policy
issues involving the project. He would appoint a Project Officer (the Head of the Bureau
of Planning, MOH) who with the assistance of a Deputy Project Officer would manage the
project and would be responsible for all technical and administrative aspects of the project.



- 26 -
A Project Secretariat with several full-time staff headed by an Executive Secretary would
manage routine administrative matters. Many HP IV innovations deal with issues outside
the purview of the Secretary-General and most of them are the responsibility of the
Director-General for Community Health (DG-CH). Consequently, to ensure smooth
coordination and timely implementation of HP IV activities, a Central Technical Task
Force under the leadership of the DG-CH would be established to review and guide key
technical and policy innovations involving the aforementioned issues.
3.34        At the provincial level, the Chief of the MOH Provincial Health Office
(Kanwil) would be the Provincial Project Officer. He would be ultimately responsible for
all project-related activities in the province. He would be assisted by an Administrative
Officer (the Head of the Provincial Health Office Planning Division) who would be in
charge of project administration, specifically reporting, planning, coordination, and
monitoring of project activities.  A small full-time staff would be assigned to the
Administrative Officer to assist him in carrying out his project responsibilities. As regards
activities under Dinkes I (the Provincial Health Services), its head would be the Project
Implementation Officer. Moreover, a Provincial Technical Task Force, chaired by the
Provincial Project Officer, with the Head of the Division of Health Services in the
Provincial Health Office (Kanwil) as first secretary, would be established to monitor and
guide all technical innovations involved in HP IV with the help of some consultants.
3.35        The center of gravity of HP IV activities would be at the district level and
below. The Head of the District Health Office (Dokabu) with the help of a District
Implementation Officer would be in charge of all HP IV activities at this level and would
report directly to the Provincial Project Officer. The Dokabu's responsibility includes
planning and implementation of project activities.  He would also be in charge of
proposing, testing and evaluating district innovations. A District Health Development
Committee, an intersectoral team with active participation from the Bupati (Head of
District Administration) and the head of the district development planning agency
(BAPPEDA II), would be established to guide the overall development of health within the
district. Finally, the Head of the Health Center would manage HP IV activities undertaken
at the facility and would be accountable to the Dokabu.
3.36        During the course of the project, efforts would be made to develop
mechanisms to promote active community involvement in health services, with the
objective of making health providers more accountable to the community they are serving.
To this end, local government representatives and non-governmental community leaders
would be mobilized.
3.37        Channeling of funds. Loan funds would be channeled through the DIP.
Specifically, these funds would be channeled through the Integrated DIP (locally referred
to as DIP Terpadu), with the exception of funds to support activities under the Central
units. The choice of the Integrated DIP, which is a HP III innovation for integrating and
decentralizing GOI funding of basic health services, is based on its workability. In
contrast to the usual DIP, which rigidly earmarks funds for specific activities, the
Integrated DIP is less complex and allows the health district to reallocate resources across
programs as it sees fit. In this regard, the Dokabu would have the authority to disburse



- 27 -
funds and the responsibility for their accounting. The translation of the HP IV COSTAB
allocations into GOI's budget is easier and their release to implementing units is faster.
The initial experience of GOI and the Bank regarding the Integrated DIP has been positive.
Some civil works, however, to be funded 100 percent by GOI would be financed through
INPRES.
3.38        Implementation schedule. The project would be implemented for a period
of five years starting effectively about September 1995. The number of districts and health
centers that would be provided with special assistance funds (SAFs) and other HP IV
assistance would be phased according to the schedule laid out in Annex 2. Poor areas
would be given priority for early coverage.
3.39        Implementation would begin in two starter districts per province (three for
East Java) during the first one and a half years of the project. By focusing initially on a
few districts, the collaborating agencies would have the time to lay out a solid foundation
for accelerated project implementation in later years.
3.40        The first one and a half years would focus on: (i) provision of technical
assistance; (ii) finalizing the detailed design of QA, training and other components; (iii)
putting in place supporting policy actions; (iv) conducting orientation workshops and social
marketing key project messages; (v) establishing the necessary implementation
arrangements, including the institution of the drugs (LPLPO) and equipment management
system and Integrated Planning and Budgeting; and (vi) development of the district
performance evaluation and incentive system, as well as the redesign of MOH's health
survey (SKRT) and collection of baseline data.
D. MoNrroRING AND EVALUATION
3.41        Several indices of performance were agreed with GOI during negotiations.
Of these, intensive project monitoring and evaluation will focus on the following core
variables, which are key, proximate determinants of health outcomes:
(a)   Quality of care: This will be measured by the extent to which health
providers and patients comply with recommended standards of care or case
management protocols (See Annex 14 for examples). Health interventions
can be thought of as a series of steps involving history taking,- physical
examination, treatment, counseling and patient knowledge. Within each of
this step are activities which if carried out correctly would maximize the
probability of safe and effective care. An observation form, which has been
developed and tested for quality assessment, has several items (about 40 to
60) for each health intervention detailing the activities that should be
performed. The quality of care provided by a health staff will be measured
as the ratio of the number of recommended activities performed correctly
relative to the total items in the observation form. Quality measurement
would be applied to vaccinations, ARI, antenatal care, diarrhea and other
health interventions included in HP IV's BHS list (Annex 13). Initially, a



- 28 -
simple average of the various compliance rates for all of the HP IV basic
health services would be used as a summary indicator of the quality of care.
During the course of project implementation other aggregation schemes will
be tried and consumer satisfaction measures will be developed and factored
in. Quality of care indicators will be measured annually.
(b)   Rate of adoption of QA processes. This indicator is intended to monitor
the extent to which health center staff and their supervisors know and
practice key quality assurance principles and processes. These are likely to
include: clinical competency measures, number of staff trained in QA,
knowledge of the standards of care, applications of QA techniques,
problem-solving skills of staff, frequency of QA meetings, number of
process improvement teams. This indicator will be refined and tested during
the first year of the project. The key challenge here that needs to be
addressed is measuring the effectiveness with which health facilities are
applying these QA processes. An approach that will be explored by the
project will be the use of an expert review panel to rate the effectiveness of
the QA procedures and process being established in a small sample of health
facilities.
(c)   Basic health services utilization rate: This measure would consist of
contact rate and visit rate. Contact rate is defined as the number of persons
in contact with health facilities in the last month relative to the number of
people in the catchment area.   Contact rate will be obtained through
SUSENAS and, if necessary, a specially designed survey. Visit rate is
defined as the total number of visits made to health facilities in the previous
four weeks relative to the total number of people in the catchment area.
The BHS list contains at least ten classes of health interventions. Therefore,
there will also be at least ten different BHS related utilization measures.
Aggregating these into a single indicator is not straightforward, because
they differ in relative importance. The project will formulate a scoring
system for aggregating these various measures into a single indicator during
the first year of project implementation. For practical reasons, emphasis will
be put on visit rate, using data from the facilities monitoring system whose
improvement has already been started under the Third Health Project.
(d)   Share of Central, provincial, and district health subsidies going to basic
health services and the poor. The percentage share of the consolidated
Central, provincial, and district health subsidies would be monitored
annually. The share of these subsidies going to the poor would be measured
every other year, starting in the first year.
3.42         To monitor equity improvements, the quality and utilization indicators would
be measured separately for the poor and better-off, using income/expenditure poverty
thresholds based on GOI's current estimate. The MOH Bureau of Planning would develop
a socioeconomic classification of households and communities to identify the poor,
building on the government's IDT program.



- 29 -
3.43        During negotiations, indicative targets for the above core performance
indicators were agreed. Agreement was also reached as to the frequency with which they
would be monitored.
3.44        In addition, GOI gave assurances that it would: (i) not later than
March 31 in each year, starting March 31, 1997, furnish to the Bank evaluation reports,
covering approximately a two-year evaluation period, of the health districts'perfornance
in terms of agreed performance indicators; and (ii) thereafter, review with the Bank the
reports and take all measures required to ensure imnprovements in the health districts'
performance in terms of the agreed performance indicators, including, if necessary, the
reduction of Special Assistance Funds to non-perfonning health districts.
3.45        Supervision and technical audit. Like other projects in Indonesia, Bank
supervision (Annex 4) would be conducted twice a year. Midterm and final project
reviews would be undertaken, using local and international consultants as necessary.
Assurances were given by GOI during negotations that it would submit the reports of
the midterm review, acceptable to the Bank, not later than December 31, 1997, and
discuss with the Bank the results of the review not later than February 28, 1998.
3.46        Supervision requirements would not be excessive. Supervision would need
to focus on Kalbar and Sumbar, because East Java has many experienced local health
officials and NTB and Kaltim (Third Health provinces) will have fewer activities. The
project would also use simplified budgetary arrangements (the DIP Terpadu) and
redesigned systems of ordering and managing drugs and health equipment. HP III
introduced these innovations in NTB and Kaltim and found them to be reliable and
efficient.
3.47        Furthermore, the project by design has built-in mechanisms to ensure
development effectiveness. These include: (i) the establishment of a quality assurance
system, which would improve supervision effectiveness; (ii) the aforementioned
performance-linked incentive system, which would create incentives for district
management (particularly, the Dokabu) to effectively supervise and guide health centers
in the cost-effective use of their available resources; (iii) greater attention by the MOH
Inspectorate-General to the technical audit of HP IV implementation; (iv) the
implementation schedule has been worked out in a way that before coverage of activities
is expanded significantly, most of the above arrangements would have already been put in
place; and (v) a team of local and international experts who would annually review (audit)
HP IV implementation and recommend corrective actions. GOI has agreed that this
technical audit would be funded by the project and that the selection of the external
auditors would be subject to Bank's agreement.
3.48        Bank supervision would include an annual meeting with all of the provincial
delegations at once to review expenditures, policy reform and work programs. To
facilitate this review and ensure adequate involvement of the provinces, agreement has
been reached with GOI during negotiations that a joint consultative meeting among the
Bank and the central and provincial teams be held annually to provide a venue whereby
key achievements by the provinces would be recognized, lessons learned would be shared,



- 30 -
and suggestions for corrective and other future actions discussed. The terms of reference
for this meeting was agreed during negotiations.
E. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
3.49         Provision for technical assistance (Annex 1) is crucial for the success of HP
IV. It is needed to develop and institutionalize the various innovations to be introduced
by the project. Hence, local and international consultants would be hired to assist both
Central and local implementation units.
3.50         The cost of this technical assistance (TA) is moderate at about US$8.5
million equivalent or less, which is about 6 percent of total project cost. Expenditures for
consultants are estimated to be less than 10 percent of Bank loan.  International
consultants, which were limited to what is critically needed, would be contracted for about
148 person months (about a quarter of total consultancy). They would be deployed mostly
during the first half of the project period and would be geared towards creating local
capacity by teaming them up with domestic consultants and dedicated key MOH staff.
3.51         In general, consultants, both local and international, would help MOH to:
(i) formulate suitable standards of care (BHS case management protocols) and establish
quality assurance programs based on international and Indonesian experience; (ii) develop
the capacity of Pusdiklat and Bapelkes to provide supporting QA training programs and
instructional materials based on distance learning and on-the-job training approaches; (iii)
redesign and test performance assessment and staff incentives systems; (iv) develop and
test capitation-based prepaid health benefit plans using private providers of care; (v) reform
the drugs and equipment inventory and management systems; and (vi) design an
appropriate framework for pricing health services of government facilities and targeting
health subsidies to BHS and the poor.

CHAPTER 4
PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. COSTS
4.1          The total cost of the project is estimated at US$134.3 million equivalent
(Rp 294.4 billion), including contingencies and identifiable taxes and duties. Tables 4.1 and
4.2 summarize the estimated costs by province and by project component and category of
expenditure, respectively. Detailed project costs by year, purpose and components are given
in Annex 6.
4.2          Bases of Cost Estimates. Baseline costs are estimated at March 1995 prices.
Civil works costs are based on average square meter construction costs in the project provinces
for government buildings. The cost of land is not included in the above costs. Furniture costs
are based on lists of standard locally available items. Medical and office equipment, and
vehicle costs are based on current prices for similar imported or locally available items. Costs
for international and domestic consultants are in line with recent health projects for
appropriately qualified experts. Unit cost for domestic fellowships is about US$5,000 per staff-
year for long-term programs, and US$500 to US$1,000 per month for short-term programs.
Overseas training and fellowships range from US$5,000 per staff-month for short-term training
to US$25,000 per staff-year for long term programs. Operational costs are consistent with
current government practices and recent health projects.  Costs for short-term, in-country
training costs vary widely depending on the type of training being given and its location, and
average between US$25-45 per training day. Amounts for special assistance and program
development expenditures, and project management costs have been agreed between the Bank
and the Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Health. Drug costs are based on INPRES price
schedules. Recurrent costs are based on standard government allowances for travel, per diem,
O&M, and consumable materials.
4.3          Contingency Allowances. Physical contingencies (US$5.7 million) represent
5 percent and price contingencies (US$13.8 million) 12 percent of baseline costs. Physical
contingencies of 5 percent have been allowed for all categories, as actual expenditures for all
project components are expected to differ from current estimates, given HP IV's programmatic
approach. Price contingencies have been calculated at 5.0 percent per year for local costs and
2.2 percent per year for foreign costs.
4.4          Foreign Exchange Costs. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$40.4
million (representing about 30 percent of total project costs) based on the following percentages:
(a) overseas fellowships and vehicles - 90 percent, (b) equipment and international consultants -
80 percent, (c) drugs included in recurrent costs - 50 percent, (d) civil works and furniture -



- 32 -
30 percent; and (d) domestic consultants, domestic studies, program development expenditure,
special assistance expenditures, project management costs and incremental recurrent costs -
10 percent.
4.5               Taxes and Duties. Identifiable taxes and duties are estimated at US$3.0 million
(Rp. 6.6 billion) based on the current 10 percent value added tax on all goods and materials,
and it would be financed 100% by the Government of Indonesia.

B. FiNANCING
4.6            The total project cost of US$134.3 million equivalent would be financed by a
proposed loan of USUS$88.0 million equivalent, covering 67 percent of total project costs
excluding taxes (96 percent of foreign and 53 percent of local expenditures). The Government
would finance from its annual budget the remaining costs of US$46.3 million equivalent (33
percent of the total project costs excluding taxes or 34 percent of total project costs including
taxes).
4.7            Incremental Recurrent Costs. Incremental recurrent costs are additional costs
associated with the MOH and its PlUs. These account for 24 percent of total base costs. All
special assistance expenditures and project-related incremental recurrent costs would be financed
on a declining basis in order to ensure sustainability.

C. PROCUREMENT
4.8            The loan proceeds would be used to finance procurement of goods and services
under all project components:
(a)    Civil works totalling  about US$31.4 million equivalent.   Because of the
geographical dispersion of project sites and the small size of most contracts,
contracts for civil works would be awarded on the basis of national competitive
bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for civil works
valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$5.0
million may be awarded through national shopping, or where no experienced
contractors are available may be carried out by force account, up to an aggregate
amount of US$2.0 million.
(b)    Equipment and furniture totalling about US$15.3 million equivalent including
contingencies. All equipment and furniture will be handled by central, provincial
and district levels depending on where the goods are being delivered. Specific
hospital equipment contract packages valued at or above US$200,000 would be

awarded under international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures.  Local
manufacturers would be granted a 15 percent of domestic margin of preference.
Contract packages valued at less than US$200,000 and up to an aggregated
amount of US$5.4 million would be awarded through national competitive
bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contract packages valued less
than US$50,000 or equipment of a specialized nature for which NCB is not
practical, up to an aggregate limit of US$7.9 million including taxes, may be
purchased through international and national shopping on the basis of three price
quotations.
(c)    Vehicle costs totalling about US$0.1 million equivalent. The Government of
Indonesia considers the procurement of vehicles as reserve procurement and
therefore Bank financing would not be used to purchase vehicles. During
negoiations, the Government gave assurances th  it would provide the
required vehicles for the project in accordance with a schedule agreed with the
Bank.
(d)   Consultant services and studies totalling  about US$8.5 million equivalent,
would be selected and contracted in accordance with Bank Guidelines.

(e)   Overseas and domestic fellowships totalling about US$9.6 million equivalent.
Placement of candidates in foreign and domestic institutions would be made on
the basis of the relevance and quality of the programs offered, costs, and prior
experience, according to government administrative procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Training contracts totalling about US$3.8 million equivalent would be
awarded to local providers in accordance with Government administrative
procedures acceptable to the Bank.
(f)    Project management totalling about US$5.2 million equivalent.  Project
management expenses, including travel allowances, office costs, and other
operational costs, meetings, and administrative support, would be spent following
government administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank.
(g)   Incremental recurrent costs totalling about US$60.4 million equivalent.
Incremental recurrent costs including supervision travel expenses, operations and
maintenance, office consumables and eligible expenditures under the SAF
operating guidelines, would be spent following government administrative
procedures acceptable to the Bank.
4.9         Procurement Review. Review by the Bank would be as follows:
(a)   By loan effectiveness, the Bank will carry out a prior review of (i) standard
bidding documents for civil works and goods contracts to be awarded under ICB
and NCB procedures, and (ii) letters of invitation for consultant services, to
ascertain their conformity with the Bank guidelines. The approved documents
would be used as master documents for all future bidding;
(b)   All civil works contracts valued at or over US$1,000,000, if any, and goods
contracts valued at or over US$200,000 would be subject to prior review by the
Bank, whereas all other contracts for civil works and goods would be subject to
random  post-review.  However, the first contract for civil works in each
province and the first contract for goods in each province estimated to cost the
equivalent of $50,000 or more will be subject to prior review. Roughly 20% of
civil works contracts, and 25% of goods contracts are likely to be covered by
prior review. The largely successful province-level procurement experience in
the HP III Project suggests that these prior review percentages are sufficient. In
addition, standard bidding documents will be used for both ICB and NCB
procedures, and regular random post review would be carried out by the resident
mission and supervision missions;
(c)   Consultant contracts valued at or over US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for
individual would be subject to prior review by the Bank. All other consultant
contracts would be subject to random post review. However, all consultants'
terms of reference would be subject to prior review;
(d)   Fellowships would be subject to random post-review by the Bank; and
(e)   Annual training plans for each year would be included in the annual report for
discussion with the Bank.

D. DISBURSEMENT
4.10        The proposed loan of US$88.0 million equivalent would be disbursed over a
period of about 5 years (Annex 8). The project is expected to be completed by September 30,
2000, and the Loan would be closed six months later on March 31, 2001. The disbursement
schedule is based on the implementation schedule and the disbursement profile for health project
in Indonesia. It is somewhat faster to reflect the establishment of the special account and the
timely implementation experience of HP IV Project team. Disbursements estimated for the first
semester of FY96 are based on the proposed initial deposit into the project Special Account.
Disbursements would be made as follows:
(a) civil works                    US$20,300,000   91 % of total expenditures
(non-INPRES financed)
(b) equipment and furniture        US$ 8,900,000   100% offoreignexpenditures
(excluding vehicles)                            100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory cost)
65 % of local expenditures for
other items procured locally
(c) consultant services and         US$ 6,100,000   100% of total expenditures
studies
(d) overseas fellowships           US$ 6,600,000   100% of total expenditures
(e) training and workshops         US$ 3,600,000   100% of total expenditures

- 40 -
4.11        Disbursements from the Loan for the following contracts would be made against
full documentation: (a) civil works contracts valued at or more than US$1,000,000; (b) goods
contracts valued at or more than US$200,000; and (c) consultant services contracts with
individual consultants valued at or more than US$50,000 and consulting firm contracts valued
at or more than US$100,000. All other disbursements would be made against statements of
expenditures (SOE) for which relevant documents would be retained by responsible agencies
and made available for review as requested by visiting Bank missions.  To facilitate
disbursements, a Special Account in an amount of US$4.0 million would be established at Bank
Indonesia. This Special Account would be held in the name of Directorate General of Budget,
Ministry of Finance, following established procedures. The Special Account would be used for
all eligible foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment to the Special Account would be
made on a monthly basis or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever
occurs first.
E. ACCOuNTS, AuDrrs AND REPORTS
4.12        MOH would establish project accounts for all project expenditures at both the
provincial and central levels, to be maintained in accordance with sound accounting practices.
Accounts for the SOEs and Special Account would be maintained separately for annual audits.
Each provincial PIU would send financial statements for all project expenditures for each fiscal
year to the Project Secretariat. The Project Secretariat would consolidate the five provincial
financial statements with the central level financial statement and prepare a consolidated
financial report. The financial statements and consolidated financial reports would be audited
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, including a separate audit opinion on SOE
expenditures. Certified copies of the financial report on the project for each Government fiscal
year, together with the auditors' statements, would be furnished to the Bank as soon as
available, but not later than six months after the end of each government fiscal year starting
June 30, 1996. MOH would also monitor progress in project implementation and report to the
Bank each semester on this progress. Within six months after the completion of disbursement,
the Ministry would submit an implementation completion report (ICR) to the Bank.
4.13        Technical Audits. MOH has the primary responsibility to monitor all project
activities and routine monitoring would be added through annual reviews. However, given a
large number of contracts that will be financed under SOE procedures implemented by each
project management level, an independent, qualified firm with external technical assistance
would be hired to conduct technical audits of key project activities.  These include
implementation of QA, SAF, PDE, health finance and management reforms, and training
programs. The above audits would cover activities in progress and post review of completed
actions to examine whether from the substantive, technical standpoint implementation of the
various project components are appropriate and to recommend corrective measures, if
necessary. These audits would be conducted annually on a random sample basis. During
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it would cause technical audits to be
carried out, in a manner acceptable to the Bank, by April I in each year during the
irnplementation of the project and furnish a copy of such audit to the Bank for comments,
by July 31 of each such year.

CHAPTER 5
BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. BENEFTS
5.1         By empowering provincial, district and facility authorities and thereby
improving the delivery and quality of basic health services, the project would increase the
number of people utilizing them and benefitting from their use. Consequently, mortality
and suffering from pain and disability due to illness could be reduced significantly. The
poor particularly would gain from the project, as one of the worst aspects of
poverty-premature death, disability and debility from illness-would be considerably
alleviated by the project's emphasis on the extension of cost-effective packages of good
quality basic health services to the poor.
5.2          The expected health service improvements would benefit a wide range of
potential clients. The major beneficiaries, however, are expected to be women and
children from both poor and well-off families. At present, maternal, infant and childhood
diseases are major causes of mortality and morbidity. It is precisely these diseases that
most of the health interventions supported by the project are directed against (e.g.,
immunization, ante-natal care, treatment of diarrhoea, health education, de-worming and
provision of selected micronutrients).
5.3         The total population that could benefit from the project is estimated to be
about 27 million. This is the number of persons covered by the 886 health centers
included in HP IV. Of the 27 million potential beneficiaries, about 20 percent are poor
and another 13 percent are near-poor. In the long-term, the benefits from HP IV would
likely go well beyond these districts. As the project proves to be successful, its initiatives
would most likely be adopted by other provinces. The experience of Third Health in this
respect is very encouraging. Innovations that moved successfully under that project then
became part of GOI's national policy.
B. RISKS
5.4         Health Finance. A major step towards increasing resources for BHS and
reorienting government health spending towards the poor is to raise the prices of health
services provided by public facilities, while protecting the poor from their impact. The
problem is that it is difficult to predict the pace and extent of price reforms that could be
accomplished under HP IV. Raising prices of government health services is politically
sensitive and some local governments, which are responsible for the prices of publicly



- 42 -
managed health services, may be reluctant to make substantial price increases. Therefore,
increasing cost-recovery rates to appropriate levels might be delayed or could become
impossible in some districts.
5.5          Despite this risk, the chances that targeted cost-recovery rates will be
increased significantly as a result of the project remain good, primarily because of GOI's
strong commitment. Both the Ministry of Health and BAPPENAS have been involved in
formulating this policy and has actively campaigned for the support of provincial and
district officials from the outset of project preparation. The results of this effort, which
reinforced provincial and district support for price reform, are reassuring. For example,
the Bupati of the starter districts have already submitted to the Bank signed decrees
addressed to local staff supporting price adjustments. Another encouraging factor is that
the Third Health experience showing the feasibility and beneficial effects of price increases
has proven to be an effective material for promoting price reforms. This experience
together with the recent introduction of health cards exempting the poor from paying fees
for government health services provides HP IV an effective tool for assuaging concerns
about the impact of fee increases.  Finally, sufficient funds have been allocated in
provincial and central government expenditure programs to support activities promoting
cost recovery and appropriate targeting of health subsidies.
5.6          Training. There is a large but manageable training challenge involved in
transferring skills and information needed for a QA program. As currently practiced,
training has several features that are counter-productive. Absences of staff from work due
to training overload are becoming a problem. Staff have a perverse incentive to participate
in unnecessary training to augment their incomes through training-related honoraria and
per diems. Promotion credits are also awarded on the basis of simple attendance. The
actual acquisition of competencies is rarely measured and recorded.
5.7          The risk that off-the-job training activities could become excessive,
disrupting the provision of services in the health centers, was highlighted during appraisal
and was well-appreciated by concerned GOI officials. Consequently, GOI intends to use
the project to develop and assess alternatives to off-the-job training such as distance
learning and other on-the-job training approaches. The project will also test direct, skill-
based incentives that have proved feasible in other settings. The credit points system for
promotion, which rewards mere attendance in training events, would also be reviewed and
revised to take into account actual competencies learned. Furthernore, assurances were
provided during negotiations by GOI that it would: (a) not later than January 31, 1996,
furnish to the Bank a proposal for a scheduling and management mechanism for the
training of staff which minimizes disruption in the facilities' activities and which
ensures: (i) that training courses under the project address documented skills deficits
critical to BHS improvement and have defined and measurable outcomes; and (ii) that
training courses are evaluated on the basis of the trainees' measurable acquisition of
relevant gains in skills and knowledge; and (b) before implementing the training, have
the relevant course materials available for the trainees.



- 43 -
C. SUSrAINABxLrrY
5.8          Prospects for project sustainability are very good. Indonesia's outlook for
economic growth is bright, and the cost of the project's various initiatives is modest and
affordable. Moreover, there is a strong sense of project ownership and a firm commitment
by participating provincial governments and GOI to carry on successful HP IV initiatives
with local funds and retained earnings of health facilities. Furthermore, as the project
eases current concerns about the public health sector's inability to efficiently absorb
additional funds, resistance to budgetary increases for basic health services could be
reduced considerably. Finally, through its promotion of higher cost recovery, greater
retention of revenues earned by public health facilities, as well as intensified mobilization
of private resources (e.g., health insurance), the project is expected to facilitate budgetary
reallocations that would increase health subsidies to basic health services and poverty
alleviation.
D. ENVIRoNMENTAL IMACT
5.9          The project does not pose any significant environmental threat.  The
possibility of hospital wastes impacting on the environment is unlikely to be significant,
since there will be no major hospital construction under HP IV. On the contrary, HP IV
could contribute to the quality of the environment to the extent that the project strengthens
the ability of health centers to deal with communicable diseases and pathogens in the
environment.

CORE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND
INDICATIVE TARGETS FOR
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
This note describes indicative targets for the following core performance indicators. These
indicators are part of a broader list of performance indicators (agreed with GOI) for the project.
As with the other performance indicators these will be collected annually by the district health
offices and compiled at the provincial level.
QUALITY OF CARE
The Fourth Health Project will seek to raise the rate of compliance to standards of care or
operating procedures (SOP) to at least 80%. This means that if in the SOP there are 30
different kinds of activities to be carried out, 24 of them will be correctly implemented.
2.    RATE OF ADOPTION
The project would measure the rate of adoption of QA mechanisms. The number of
interventions in the basic health package for which QA would be established over the
project period is as follows:
Number of Interventions in the BHS List
with Established QA Mechanisms

3.    BASIC HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION RATE
Utilization rate will be broken down into contact rate and visit rate. Contact rate is defined
as the number of individuals who had contact with govermnent health facilities in the last
month divided by the number of people in their catchment area. Visit rate is defined as the
total number of visits made to government health facilities in the previous month divided by
the total number of people in their catchment area. For practical reasons, emphasis during
this project will be put on visit rate. Data from the health facilities' monitoring system,
whose improvement has been already started by the Third Health Project, will be used to
estimate visit rate. Contact rate can be obtained through SUSENAS or a specially designed
survey, if deemed necessary. The project will seek to increase the visit rate at a minimum
of 10% annually.
4.    SHARE OF CENTRAL, PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT HEALTH SUBSIDIES
GOING TO BASIC HEALTH SERVICES AND POOR
The percentage share of the consolidated central, provincial, and district health subsidies
going to BHS would be imonitored annually. The share of these subsidies going to the poor
would be measured every other year, starting in the first year. Indicative targets, which
will be reviewed annually and adjusted as needed, have also been set for BHS recurrent
expenditures per capita (see attached Fourth Health Project Financing Plan).

FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT:
IMPROVING EQUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE
Project Activities by Components
I. Facility-Level Service Improvement (65%): US$74.2 million equivalent
To ensure that frontline staff are able to deliver locally appropriate, highly cost-
effective BHS, funding would be provided for:
(a)   Health Facility Construction and Upgrading (32%): US$36.9 million
equivalent
This amount would support investment costs for upgrading, renovation and
building of health centers, subcenters, storage facilities (e.g., for drugs) and, to a
limited extent, district hospitals. It would also finance equipment, water supply,
vehicles and furniture needed to outfit these facilities.
(b)   Special Assistance Program for Basic Health Services (33%): US$37.3
million equivalent
This program would fund expenditures on equipment and furniture,
operational expenses and recurrent costs (on a declining rate) necessary to meet the
resource requirements of reducing current gaps in the quality and provision of basic
health services. These expenditures would include expenses for institutionalizing
QA practices, improving BHS utilization, strengthening outreach activities and
carrying out on-the-job training in QA/BHS problem-solving, management and
planning, laboratory, supervision, etc.
US$14.1 of these funds would be provided to health facilities through
discretionary Special Assistance Funds (SAF). These funds would be used for
financing eligible expenses listed in the SAF Operating Guidelines (Annex 10) and
classified as Special Assistance Expenditures (SAE) in the cost tables' category of
expenditures. Each eligible health center would initially be allocated an annual HC
SAF that ranges from Rp 6 million (East Java) to Rp. 10 million (West
Kalimantan).
II. Institutional Development (34%): US$39.2 million equivalent
This component would improve the capacity of Central, provincial and district level
agencies to assist, motivate, and supervise frontline health providers in delivering
accessible high quality packages of basic health services.  The following would be
supported:



Annex 5
- 68 -                        Page 2 of 4
(a) Support for Quality Assurance Mechanisms: US$7.5 million equivalent
HP IV would assist in building the capacity of the above agencies to
promote and help establish quality assurance practices in health facilities and units
in charge of their supervision. This component will fund workshops, materials,
consultant services, incentives, fellowships, travel and other expenses to carry out
the following activities: (i) review of current standards as applied to clinical
protocols, and management and support procedures; (ii) establishment of a formal
accreditation process in which health centers and their staff will receive some
incentives based on documented quality improvements; (iii) training of clinic staff
and field supervisors and enhancement of field support for the application of
modern quality assurance techniques; (iv) development of Central and provincial
staff dedicated to QA and professional organizations as sources of technical
assistance; and (v) documentation and dissemination of problem-solving experiences
through a professionally produced QA newsletter.
(b) Support for Training and Curriculum Development: US$9.1 million
equivalent
This component would develop institutional capacity at the district level and
above to provide training support required by the quality assurance program and
other key HP IV initiatives. The project will fund expenditures for instructional
materials and equipment, workshops, consultant services, fellowships, incentives
and other expenses needed for the following activities: (i) building a capacity in
Pusdiklat  and  Bapelkes  to  train  trainers  and  to  develop  learning
materials/methodologies needed by the QA program; (ii) assessment of clinical
training needs; (iii) development of QA learning packages and alternatives to
residence/off-the-job training courses such as distance learning; (iv) training,
evaluation and certification of trainers; (v) monitoring and evaluation of post-
training performance; (vi) revision of incentives to learning; and (vii) institution of
a training information system and approval process to control training activities
better.
(c) Support for Performance-Linked Incentives: US$0.6 million equivalent
Under this subcomponent, HP IV would finance activities designed to
establish a system for measuring and rewarding district performance. The project
would fund expenditures for consultants services, travel, materials, computers,
software, equipment, surveys, incentives and other expenses for: (i) formulating
system design and ways of measuring the performance criteria in Annex 3; (ii) data
collection and analysis; and (iii) provision of performance-based incentives.
(d) Replication and Piloting Innovative Initiatives: US$15.5 million equivalent
HP IV would support several efforts to replicate HP III innovations and try
other initiatives that could lead to improvements in the organizational culture of the
public health system and its role in the provision of basic health services. This
subcomponent would finance expenditures related to the following activities:



Annex 5
- 69 -                       Page 3 of 4
(i) Dissemination and Adaptation of HP III Innovations: US$1.8 million
equivalent
This amount would support workshops, local consultants, travel and other
costs of disseminating and advancing selected innovations that have been
successfully developed and tried under the Third Health Project. These would
include among others: (i) integrated planning and budgeting; (ii) drugs management
(LPLPO); and (iii) equipment inventory, ordering and procurement system. Along
with the institution of these new drug and equipment management systems, HP IV
would fund some facility upgrading to support these systems and procurement of
basic drugs and other materials.
(ii) Piloting Exemplary Integrated District Health System: US$13.7 million
equivalent
The project would also support a program providing health districts with
discretionary Special Assistance Funds (HD SAF). Dokabus can use these funds
as they deem appropriate to improve their supervision, support and motivation of
frontline managers and staff, provided their expenditures conform to the SAF
Operating Guidelines (see Annex 10). Eligible expenditures, referred to as Special
Assistance Expenditures in the cost tables below, include operational costs,
instructional materials and equipment, incentives, health providers' fees, and other
expenses for:   QA  development, strengthening of outreach activities and
supervision, building of the district's capacity to provide on-the-job training
support, staff re-deployment, and improved monitoring and evaluation. A total of
US$9.4 million will be allocated for the Health District SAF.
In addition, this subcomponent would fund a limited number of pilot
programs and QA studies. Under this component, the project would finance
program development expenditures (PDE) needed to carry out proposals approved
in accordance with the process of review and approval laid out in the Operating
Guidelines for PDE (see Annex 11) and for eligible expenses listed therein. A total
of US$4.7 million equivalent would be allocated for PDE.
e. Project Management Support (6%): US$6.5 million equivalent
Funds under this subcomponent, which represent about 6 percent of total
base cost or less than 5 percent of total project cost, would be used to finance
project management activities. These activities include the provision of technical
assistance to local implementing units; project oversight and administration;
coordination and policy support; monitoring and evaluation; and management of the
review and approval process for PDE-funded pilot activities funded.
III.   Better Resource Allocation and Revenue Generation (1%): US$1.4 million
equivalent
Funds would be provided for technical assistance (TA), data collection and analysis,
materials and workshops to design and promote facility-level fee increases and revenue

retention, and institute more effective targeting of health subsidies to appropriate recipients
and activities.  The project would also help MOH:  (i) to develop and establish
mechanisms for monitoring and reporting the total health subsidies going to BHS and the
poor, especially their corresponding share in Central and local health budgets for the
nation as a whole and for each of the five provinces; and (ii) to develop a system for
analyzing annual APBN (National Budget) and APBD (Regional Budget) budgetary
decisions in terms of the above financial indicators.

FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT:
IMPROVING EQUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE
SAF OPERATING GUIDELINES
SUMMARY
Introduction
1.   HEP IV would finance expenditures needed to carry out service improvement plans drawn up by
health centers and districts through problem-solving and priority setting exercises. The aim is to enhance
the ability and motivation of frontline providers and managers to render higher quality, more accessible
basic health services (BHS) that efficiently meet the needs and demands of clients and that effectively reach
the poor. For this purpose, a program would be established providing Special Assistance Funds (SAFs) for
health centers (HC) and health districts (HD).
2.    SAFs comprise discretionary resources that puskesmas and health district managers could use for
eligible expenditures (mainly for operations) needed to initiate and implement their plans. This annex
summarizes the list of eligible expenditures, the operating procedures regarding the use of SAFs, and the
assionment of oversight responsibility. (Expenditures made through the SAF are referred to in the cost
tables and below as SAE or Special Assistance Expenditures.)
3.    HC and HD managers are expected to use SAFs as they deem appropriate within the parameters
described in these guidelines.
Eligible Expenditures and Criteria for Awarding SAFs
4.    The above funds could be spent only on goods and services described in the attached Tables I and
2 of this Annex.
Limitations
5.    Allocation to staff incentives should not exceed 25 percent of the HC special assistance fund.
Administration, Technical Review and Record Keeping
6.    The Dokabu is responsible for the administration of both HC and HD SAFs. Required documents
(see below) should be kept at one designated District Health Office location for spot-checking by Bank
supervision missions and for audit purposes.



- 78 -                               Annex 10
Page 2 of 4
Documentation Requirements
7.    The following documents should be submitted before SAFs are budgeted in the DIP:
(a)   Health center proposals signed by the Puskesmas head and countersigned by the Dokabu,
briefly indicating his comments,
(b)   Health district proposals signed by the Dokabu and countersigned by the Kakanwil along
with brief comments from him.
Financial Accountability Procedures
8.    Financial audit will be conducted according to standard government operating procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
Disbursement
9.    Special assistance expenditures (SAE), which are outlays paid for by SAFs, would be financed by
the Bank through standard SOE (Statement of Expenditures) procedures, on a declining rate basis. These
expenses would be financed by the Bank only if they follow the SAF operating guidelines.
Dokabu's Annual HC SAF Report
10.   The Dokabu will submit a report to the Kakanwil not later than September 1 of each year. It will
summarize the accomplishments of the recipient health centers, highlighting the health district's analysis of
five most important problems for which the SAFs were used, separately for HC and HD. The report also
should describe the solutions implemented, key lessons learned, and corrective steps taken or proposed to
improve efficient utilization and effectiveness of SAFs.

Table 1
Expenditures Items Eligible for SAE Funding
Those items which can be financed by SAE funds are listed below, for both health centers and
district or municipal health offices:
1. Health Centers
* Travel costs
* Maintenance of health center and sub-centers (maximum Rp. 5 million per year per health center
and Rp. 1 million per sub-center); equipment and vehicle maintenance
* Cost of materials and supplies
* Incentives for existing staff and wages for non-professional contract/daily workers (maximum of 25
percent of total SAE funds)

Table 2
Criteria for Awarding SAE Funds
1. Health Centers - SAF funds should not be awarded equally to all health centers in the district. The level
of funds should be based on the following:
*   Ability of the community to paY for health services. Those areas covering poor villages should be allocated
more funds. Percent of population in poor villages (desa miskin) or the number of people with health cards
might be used as ways to measure this.
*   Difficulty in covering service area. Those health centers in areas which cover a large geographic area and
have difficult transportation should be given higher allocations. This might be done by giving a high unit
cost for travel.
.   High volume of services provided and high coverage of key prorrams. Health centers and sub-centers with
a large number of visits might be given high allocations to reflect their higher need for materials, supplies,
staff incentives and so forth. This also promotes greater efficiency. Special health centers with beds, a
large number of sub-centers or providing extra services (referral laboratory, etc.) should also receive higher
allocations.
*   Management including performance and implementation of previous allocations. Special considerations
should be given to health centers with high performance levels or where there have been substantial
improvements from previous years.
2. Districts and Municipal Health Offices - The basic criteria involved in determining the funds for the district
l SAF involve the size of the service area, the number of health centers and the relative wealth of the district or
municipality. In addition, special considerations are needed for staff incentives and the employment of
contract workers.
^   The ability of the district or municipality to fund its own recurrent costs for the district health office.
.   The number of health centers to be supervised and the unit cost of travel to health centers
.   The number of district health staff involved in supervision and the amount of time they are expected to
travel.
.   The number of areas where special assignment incentives are needed.
The difficulty in attracting staff to the district health office
The justification for special contract workers, mainly involving the need for critical staff and the lack of
alternatives.
The total population served in the district or municipality.
The performance of district staff in managing health services.

FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT:
IMPROVING EQUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE
PROJECT MANAGEMENT
I .    The management of the project is based on three principles. First, it should use the
existing structure of the Ministry of Health (MOH) whenever possible to facilitate project
implementation and to make its innovations sustainable. Second, management arrangements
should be clear and simple to prevent responsibilities and accountability from becoming
diffused. Third, special emphasis on strengthening district management of health services, with
effective technical support from the provincial and central levels, should continue.
Central Level Management
2.    Project Director - The Project Director will have ultimate responsibility for the
Project. This position will be held by the Secretary General of MOH. He will be responsible
for making decisions involving the overall direction of the Project, as well as relevant policy
issues.
3.    Project Officer - The Chief of the Bureau of Planning in the Secretariat General will
be in-charge of managing the Project and will be accountable for its technical and
administrative aspects.
4.    Deputy Project Officer - The Project Officer would be assisted by a Deputy Project
Officer who would oversee day-to-day technical and administrative activities of HP IV. In
addition, he would be responsible for ensuring coordination of HP IV activities with other
government initiatives and donor-assisted projects to prevent unnecessary duplication and to
promote exchange of experience. An echelon III official in the Bureau of Planning would be
appointed as Deputy Project Director and would be assigned on a part-time basis.
5.    Project Secretariat - HP IV would establish a unit with full-time staff responsible for
routine administrative matters, including submittting required reports to the Bank and support
for technical activities. An Executive Secretary would be responsible for the management of
the Project Secretariat at the center and for coordinating work with the Administrative
Officers in the five provinces. Administrative and Financial Officers as well as other full-time
staff would be recruited to work for the Project Secretariat.
6.    A Central Technical Task Force would be organized to review and guide key
technical and policy innovations which involve Directorates General outside the Secretariat
General. Since most of the planned project initiatives concern Basic Health Services, the
Director General of Community Health would lead this Technical Task Force.



- 85 -                           Annex 12
Page 2 of 3
7.    An Advisory Board, consisting of Echelon I officials from various departments and
agencies involved in the project, would also be set up to ensure support for policy reforms
that need intersectorial consultation. The Board would be led by the Deputy for Human
Resource Development in BAPPENAS and would serve not only HP IV but also other Bank-
assisted health projects.
8.    A Steering Committee, consisting of Echelon II officials of MOH units involved in
HP IV would be established and attached to the Project Officer. This committee would meet
regularly to advise the Project Officer about various technical and administrative issues.
Provincial Level Management
9.    Provincial Project Ofricer - The head of the Provincial Health Office (Kakanwil)
would be the Provincial Project Officer, which would be the provincial equivalent of the
Project Director. The Kakanwil would ultimately be accountable for all project-related
activities in the province; he would be responsible for solving problems that cannot be
resolved at lower levels.
10.   Provincial Project Implementation Officer - The head of the Provincial Health
Services (Dinas Kesehatan I) would be in-charge of the implementation of all province-level.
11.   Administrative Officer - The head of the Provincial Health Office Planning Division
would oversee the overall administration of the project in the province and would be
responsible to the Provincial Project Officer. This part-time assignment would be in addition
to his structural duties. His project responsibility includes reporting, planning, coordination,
monitoring and reporting of HP IV activities. The Administrative Officer would be assisted by
a small, full-time administrative staff.
12.   Provincial Steering Committee - This would be an intersectoral committee with
representatives from local departments and agencies involved in project planning and
implementation.
13.   Provincial Technical Task Force - This task force would be responsible for
monitoring and guiding all technical aspects of HP IV innovations. It would be led by the
Provincial Project Officer, with the Head of the Division of Health Services in the Provincial
Health Office (Kanwil) as the first secretary. HP IV consultants would work closely with this
task force.
District Level Management
14.   District Project Officer - The head of the District Health Office (Dokabu) would be
responsible for the planning, implementation and administration of district-level project
activities. He would also oversee HP IV health center activities. The Dokabu would also be



- 86 -                          Annex 12
Page 3 of 3
in charge of proposing, testing and evaluating district health innovations. As District Project
Officer, he would report directly to the Provincial Project Officer (Kakanwil).
15.   District Health Development Committee - This body would be established to guide
the overall development of the health sector in the district. This would be an intersectoral
team with strong participation from the Bupati (Head of District Administration) and the head
of the district planning agency (BAPPEDA II).
16.   District Implementation Officer - He would be responsible for the day-to-day
implementation of project activities within the district and would report to the District Project
Officer.
Health Center Level
17.   The Puskesmas head would be responsible for project activities at the health center,
and associated sub-centers and community. He would be accountable to the District Project
Officer (Dokabu).
18.   During the course of project implementation, efforts would be made to develop
mechanisms to promote active community involvement in health services, with the objective
of making health facilities more accountable to the community they are serving. To this end,
participation by local government and community organizations would be mobilized,
particularly the LKMD and village and sub-district leaders. Where appropriate, Community
Health Committees would be formed.

FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT:
IMPROVING EQUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE
Basic Health Services
I.    A key mechanism through which BP IV would attain its goals of equity and quality
improvement is to reorient public spending on health towards basic health services (BHS). To
this end, GOI would raise the share of BHS in total health subsidies according to agreed
targets, the achievement of which would be reviewed regularly. The issue is what should
comprise BHS. This is important not only for setting those targets and monitoring their
achievement (a key result area), but also for defining the interventions for which the Special
Assistance Funds should be used.
2.    BHS and the DIP Terpadu. At present, GOI regards the primary health services
included in the DIP Terpadu as its BHS. Adjustments, however, are needed to sharpen the
focus of government health spending on highly cost-effective interventions, including some
basic referral services provided by district hospitals. In this regard, MOH plans to formulate a
BHS list based on both epidemiological and cost-effectiveness principles. The new
formulation would draw from the experience of the 1993 World Development Report,
particularly in regard its concept of essential health services and the DALY (disability-adjusted
life years) methodology. HP IV would support this initiative, which would be started soon
after project effectiveness.
3.    Completion of the above effort, however, would take time. It was agreed, therefore,
that the BHS would meanwhile comprise activities funded.in the current DIP Terpadu for
purposes of implementing and monitoring HP IV's agenda of raising BHS funding. These
essentially are activities conducted through the Puskesmas, including all outreach activities.
4.    The Basic Awal. In allocating limited HP IV funds, MOH would give top priority to
a subset of health services covered by the DIP Terpadu. The ten health services in this subset,
which are listed below and are referred to as Basic Awal, were chosen because they are
currently regarded as national priorities. Specifically, they were selected on the following
grounds:
(a)   their contribution to the IMR and MNR reduction;
(b)   GOI's international commitments of GOI (e.g., World Summit for Children
along with its Mid-Decade Goal; Polio Eradication by the Year 2000;
Elimination of Leprosy by the year 2000); and
(c)   Inclusion of other communicable diseases with high morbidity and mortality
rates, but low program coverage such as malaria in provinces outside Java-Bali
and tuberculosis.



- 88 -                             Annex 13
Page 2 of 2
5.    The ten basic health services in the Basic Awal, for which MOH would like to provide
the funds needed to close existing gaps in utilization and quality, include:
(i)   immunization;
(ii)   antenatal care, including TT vaccination, provision of iron tablet and
referral of high risk pregnancy;
(iii)   treatment for TB cases;
(iv)    treatment for malaria cases;
(v)    treatment for ARl/pneumonia and diarrhea among under fives;
(vi)   iodine, vitamin A and iron tablets for pregnant women and under fives;
(vii)    vector control (especially, malaria and dengue);
(viii)    health education;
(ix)    family planning services; and
(x)    school health, including antihelmintics.
6.    Improvement in these services through direct and indirect means would be the initial
focus of HP IV financial support. During the course of HP-IV implementation, modifications
(acceptable to the Bank) of the composition of the Basic Awal would be made as the results
of the aforementioned cost-analysis become available.

FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT:
IMPROVING EQUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE
Developing a Quality Assurance Program
1.    To improve the quality of basic health services provided by publicly managed health
facilities in Indonesia, it is necessary to change work processes, attitudes, skills and other
aspects of their organizational culture. A key to bring about this change is to establish facility-
level quality assurance (QA) processes. This annex briefly outlines HP IV's strategy for
developing and instituting QA mechanisms and practices and then presents initial results of a
QA pilot conducted by MOH as part of project preparation.
Quality Assurance Strategy
2.    Quality assurance is an approach to building institutional capacity and organizational
culture that focus on continuous improvements in service (product) quality and on its ability
to satisfy consumer requirements. In HP IV, this approach would be applied to problems
relating to compliance with case management protocols for effective care and broader issues
regarding efficient provision and utilization of services.
3.    The HP IV quality assurance program would seek to improve technical competence,
client satisfaction, efficiency, coverage/access, and effectiveness. The program would be an
evolutionary one, beginning with frontline health staff learning to analyze and resolve simple
problems of non-compliance with clinical standards and progressing to more complex issues
pertaining to priority-setting and health outcome problems. Its specific configuration would be
shaped through a series of structured learning-by-doing activities. Improving technical
compliance is good place to start: standards of care recommended on the basis of available
scientific information, if followed, provides the best chance to the patient of a speedy and safe
recovery.
4.    In broad outline, the establishment of QA mechanisms and practices in health facilities
would be phased as follows:
(a)    Phase 1. A detailed methodical analysis - referred to as "systems analysis" in the
QA literature -of the technical quality of health services would be conducted in
each participating health center. Observation guides, based on accepted treatment
norms, would be used to document where patient care fell short of the standard.
Based on the results of this analysis, each health center would develop its own plan
of action to correct lapses in technical quality and would implement those plans
through direct supervision and on-the-job training. The objective in this phase is to



Annex 14
90 -                            Page 2 of 9
bring the provision of clinical services into compliance with recommended
standards of care. For example, if one of the standards for ARI (acute respiratory
infection) were to count the respiration rate, during phase 1 health centers would
ensure that all service delivery personnel would be able to perform this correctly
and do it for all ARI cases.
(b)    Phase 2. Supervisors would assist health centers in monitoring and improving
technical service quality. The supervisors would be trained to support and monitor
the improvements in activities and processes; they would also receive training in
how to analyze more complex quality problems (the difference between simple and
complex quality problems is described below). The objective of this phase is to
complete the work on compliance with technical standards of quality, and to move
on to somewhat more complex quality issues.
(c)    Phase 3. In the final phase of implementation, health center staff would be trained
to analyze and resolve complex service quality problems. While they would still be
assisted by the supervisors, the importance of the supervisor as a coach or
facilitator would diminish during this phase as health center staff acquire the skills
needed to analyze and solve complex problems. The objective of this phase is to
consolidate a sustained and effective effort at the health center level to improve
service quality.
Coverage
5.    The program would cover as many clinical activities as possible from the start of the loan
and technical performance standards will be adopted and disseminated for the following seven
health services: immunization, ante natal care (ANC), tuberculosis, malaria, ARI, nutrition, and
family pianning. Two districts in each province (three in East Java) would implement the QA
program during the first year of the loan; additional districts would be added each year until all of
the districts (included in HP IV) in a province have been incorporated into the program by the end
of year four.
The Experience of the Pilot Project
6.    To build a strong foundation for HP IV's quality assurance program, a pilot project
funded by resources from the Japan Grant Facility and USAID's International Quality
Assurance Program was undertaken to try out some QA models in ten health centers. The
aim was primarily to assist MOH develop its own QA program for HP IV funding. A
secondary objective was to get a head start in building MOH capacity to carry out its QA
program by providing key staff and domestic consultants some QA experience and by
documenting local case materials for QA training and promotion purposes.

7.    The following discussion of the above-mentioned QA pilot activity illustrates how the
QA program will work in the field and lend substance to the concept of quality assurance.
(a)    The systems analysis: Ten health centers participated in the pilot project, five
in East Java and five in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB). A baseline survey, or
systems analysis, of the quality of care in three basic health services -
antenatal care (ANC), management of acute respiratory infections (ARI), and
vaccination -was conducted in May and June of 1994. Three health workers
from each health center were trained in the use of observation forms that were
based on detailed service standards (these were adapted from international
sources through field testing in both provinces). An observation form
contained from 40 to 60 items for each health intervention detailing the
activities that should be performed. As an example, the section on ANC
history taking was checked to see if the health worker asked the expectant
woman six questions about her reproductive history (number of pregnancies,
previous complications, etc.) and ten questions on maternal risk factors
(spotting, kidney problems, use of medications, etc.). The three trained health
workers then spent two or more days in a neighboring clinic observing the
treatment given twenty-five patients for each of the three health interventions.
The assumption was that this number would provide an adequate sample to
identify deficiencies in health care. The large number of deficiencies reported in
this peer evaluation encourages confidence in the results.
(b)    Plans of action: The results of the systems analyses were given to the senior
staff of the health centers. The staffs were then asked to prepare plans of action
to address the deviations from standards. Consequently, they tried to identify
the most pressing quality problems and then sought to resolve them. In general,
they found they could address nearly all of the problems uncovered by the
systems analysis and correct those by themselves without additional resources.
(c)    Supervisory support: District supervisors were trained in the use of
checklists based on the standards. It was assumed that the supervisors would
perform two functions: they would communicate standards and they would
monitor supervision of standards in the health centers. In several of the health
centers they were permitted to perform only the first function, that of
communicating standards. Apparently, direct supervision of staff is often a
prerogative, jealously guarded, of the health center director. The supervisors,
almost none of them physicians and typically of less tenure than the clinic
directors, encountered subtle and overt resistance to their efforts to monitor
health worker performance. They were able to supervise long enough to
provide a model for direct observation of care, but once that model was
understood by the health center staff, the supervisor was displaced in that role.

(d)    Clinic-level activities: Within all of the health centers, a similar set of
activities evolved to improve quality. The clinic director, a doctor, discussed
the plan of action with clinic staff and a QA team was usually formed. Some of
these teams functioned as true quality improving teams; in other instances their
role was limited. The director then conducted informal training on the
standards. This training was followed up by monitoring of the health workers,
usually with the same checklists used by the supervisors. In most instances the
health workers were also provided with new job aids to provide visual re-
minders of the standards. In some instances these job aids were simple
reproductions of the supervisory checklists, in others the director developed
new aids that focused on specific deficiencies and in one instance the director
created innovative flow diagrams that guided the health worker through
history-taking, examination, classification, and treatment. In several clinics
there were initial problems of resistance from one or more health workers.
This resistance was overcome through persistent monitoring and direct
supervision. All of the clinics were visited periodically by the researchers. A
"circuit rider" visited each clinic approximately every ten days. An
international research consultant visited each of the NTB clinics two or more
times at the start of the pilot. And two national researchers made additional
periodic visits to the clinics. During the three-month experimental period
(August - October) each clinic received a dozen or more of these drop-in visits.
The frequency of these visits, necessary to monitor processes within the
clinics, almost certainly affected staff behavior.
Results
8.    Even the most optimistic expectations were surpassed by the results of the pilot
project (see Table 1/Annex 14). A second survey of clinical service quality was conducted in
November 1994. The sample sizes were reduced to 12 observations for each service in a
clinic; this is the minimum sample size consistent with LQAS (lot quality assurance sampling)
methodology. In most areas compliance with standards reached or approached 100 percent.
In all areas there was a marked improvement.
9.    There was concern that the clinic staffs might not undertake quality improvements
beyond simple adherence to standards. This concern was partly allayed by the findings. In
four of the ten clinics the staff tackled complex problems and all of the clinics took halting
steps toward addressing client satisfaction issues. The following cases are relevant examples:
* Chloroquine resistant (p. falciparum) malaria is a growing problem in some
areas of NTB. Prior to the pilot project, a clinic in an endemic area had treated
nearly all malaria patients based on clinical signs since the patients were
unwilling to wait 90 minutes for the blood analysis to be completed;
consequently nearly all patients were treated with chloroquine.  This was
obviously an unsatisfactory situation and the clinic staff initiated a program of



Annex 14
93                             Page 5 of 9
aggressive counseling of patients to await the results of the slide examination.
At the end of three months over 70 percent of malaria patients waited for the
slide results. Fears that the increased wait might depress utilization were
unfounded as the visit rate increased slightly. The health impact of this change
on the incidence of p. falciparum malaria, which was found in the clinic to be
50 percent during December, is clear. These patients now receive effective
treatment which is fansidar and primaquine.
A clinic discovered, as it applied the standards for counseling, that patients did
not understand the messages.  This discovery was followed by direct
observation of the counseling session and, from this observation, changes were
made. First, awareness of the problem encouraged health workers to be more
directive and to probe for understanding. Second, where they could, health
workers removed crying children from the room during the counseling of
mothers. A third change, group counseling, will be implemented after a special
room for the purpose has been prepared. The results are encouraging. As an
example, nearly 100 percent of ARI patients now return for the two-day
control visit; formerly the return rate was less than 25 percent.
Concluding Remarks
10.   The consistency of the above findings encourages several conclusions. Specifically, the
following lessons emerge:
(a)   It is possible to get immediate and significant improvements in the quality of
basic health services provided by government facilities, which can be achieved
with a little investment in the development and establishment of a QA program.
(b)    A corollary to this lesson is that staff are quick to learn about technical quality
and need little external support to improve compliance with standards. Clinic
staff find the presence of clear standards of care reassuring. Consequently,
once motivated, they develop a variety of ingenious ways to remind themselves
of the standards and improve compliance. This experience has made frontline
health workers realized that they are the key to solving a lot of the quality
problems facing their facilities.
(c)    A common initial perception of health staff is that they can do little to improve
quality of care because of lack of resources. This resource-dependent mentality
was quickly broken by their systems analysis and problem-solving exercises.
(d)   A key to motivate staff is for high-level authorities to show that they are
strongly committed to quality improvement, and they will hold health center
directors accountable for establishing quality assurance mechanisms and

practices in their facilities. In the field trial, while seven of the ten clinic
directors moved rapidly ahead in their quality improvement efforts, the three
others showed little or no inclination to get started. The appearance of senior
officials in the three clinics to make polite inquiry about the progress of the QA
program had a galvanizing effect.
11.   The pilot ran for only a few months; and the durability of the improvements is not yet
known. Therefore, a caveat is needed in making these conclusions. This notwithstanding, the
fact that the QA pilot performed as well as it did, and the weaknesses revealed are easy to
correct, provides a good empirical basis for BP IV's quality assurance program. MOH is now
ready to move ahead with a program that it finds suitable to Indonesia and regards as its own.
