MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed credit of SDR 7.4 million (US$10
million equivalent) to the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and would help finance an industrial c:edit project.
2.        Background.  The Lao PDR has a very small industrial sector which
accounts for less than 5% of GDP. The structure of the sector has changed
little since the early 1970s as foreign exchange shortages have prevented much
needed replacement of, and additions to, productive capacity. As a result,
most factories operate with antiquated and often largely obsolete equipment in
a poor state of repair. An unwieldy sectoral management system in force from
1975, when most industries were taken over by the Government, to 1984 has
further constrained the sector's development. Under that system, planning,
pricing and investment decisions were highly centralized, trade policies were
restrictive, and market-oriented incentives totally absent. Capital invest-
ments were normally financed through budgetary allocations. The Government
has recognized the ineffectiveness of this management approach, and in 1985
introduced a New System of Economic Management (NEM) based on (a) autonomous
decision-making by individual enterprises with respect to output levels,
employment, investment, pricing and wages; (b) removal of constraints on
internal and external trade; and (c) acknowledgement of the potentially
constructive role of the private sector in tae economy. A critical element of
the reform process is the decision by the Government to move progressively
toward a unified exchange rate system that would closely parallel the free
market exchange rate. Moreover, output prices would be set by the enterprises
themselves so as to be competitive with market prices. By the beginning of
1988, the Government had made almost all manufacturing enterprises autonomous,
i.e., under NEM provisions, it had endorsed the principle of equality of
treatment for both private and public enterprises, and had begun to encourage
the establishment of mixed (public/private) businesses. In view of the
expected term credit needs of the newly autonomous enterprises, a major
implication of the NEM is the expanded role of the country's still undeveloped
financial sector, now comprised of only the State Bank of the Lao PDR (SBL).
Investment decisions that were formerly determined by plan targets will now
have to be based on independent assessments of project prospects.
Furthermore, the Government has recently approved the broad framework for a
reform of the financial sector that would provide for the separation of SBL's
central and commercial banking functions.
3.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project is directed mainly at
supporting essential investment for the rehabilitation, modernization and
expansion of productive capacity in the country's industrial sector through
the provision of equipment, spare parts and technical assistance. All private
and mixed enterprises as well as public industrial enterprises which have been
authorized to operate autonomously would be eligible for funding. Because of



- 2 -
the lack of ready projects in the private sectc:, most project subloans are
expected to go to public autonomous enterprises, The project would also
support the establishment of an infrastructure for the delivery of term credit
for industrial financing. In particular, the establishment of systems and
procedures for project appraisal and investment financing would be initiated
with a view to progressively strengthening SBL's ability to assume its
expanded financial intermediation function under the NEM.
4.        Project Description.  The project, which would extend over five
years, would finance (a) small- and medium-sized rehabilitatioa and expansion
projects, mainly in light industry; and (b) technical assistance and training
for both SBL and the borrowing enterprises.  The IDA credit would be for SDR
7.4 million (US$10 million equivalent) to be on-lent by SBL to eligible
industrial enterprises to finance the acquisition of fixed assets, interest
during construction, and initial stocks of raw materials and supplies.
Technical assistance and training would be financed by grant from a bilateral
donor agency. The proceeds of the IDA credit would be lent by SBL to eater-
prises at a fixed interest rate of 8% p.a. over a period normally not
extending beyond 7 years and, in any case, not exceeding 12 years including a
grace period of up to three years. The on-lending rate of 8Z p.a. is expected
to be positive in real terms over the life of SEL's subloans, given projected
world inflation rates, but the terms of subloans would be reviewed with IDA
annually during the project period and adjusted if necessary to ensure that
the lending rate to the final beneficiaries remains positive in real terms.
SBL would receive the credit proceeds from the Government at a fixed interest
rate of 4% p.a. for 20 years including a 5-year grace period; the 4X margin to
SBL would provide it with an adequate spread to establish the financial
viability of term lending operations. Both the subsidiary loan to SBL and the
subloans would be denominated in US dollars. The Government would thus bear
the cross-currency risk between the US dollar and the SDR, while the sub-
borrowers would carry the foreign exchange risk betwten the US dollar and the
kip. The proposed financing plan and credit disbursement schedule are given
in Schedules A and B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in the Lao PDR are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7166-
LA, is being distributed separately.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would be the
first IDA operation in the Lao industrial sector. Its justification lies in
supporting the far-reaching program of economic and financial reforms intro-
duced by the Government over the past two years. In the course of previous
economic discussions with the Bank, the Government has been receptive to Bank
analysis of issues related to the performance of the country's public enter-
prises. The Bank has also been gaining relevant experience with the opera-
tions of public enterprises in the country through its lending for hydropower
and telecommunications development, and is thus in a good position to assist
the Government in implementing its proposed package of reforms. The new
program opens the door for greater efficiency in the eerations of public
enterprises, thereby justifying an expansion in industrial investment to
compensate for the sharp curtailment in capacity renewal and extension that
prevailed over the past decade. Government policies also envisage a greater
role for private, cooperative and mixed (public/private) enterprises. Over-



- 3 -
all, demand for term credit for industrial development is expected to increase
sharply within a general policy environment that justifies the involvement of
IDA.
6.        Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the Government and SBL on: (a) on-lending arrangements, including an annual
review of the terms of subloans in particular to ensure that the interest rate
remains positive in real terms; (b) recruitment of consultants; (c)
eligibility criteria for the subprojects; and (d) a free limit of US$200,000
for the subloans.
7.        Justification.  The proposed project would help bridge the gap in
the availability of foreign exchange for the financing of industrial invest-
ment in the Lao PDR. The main beneficiaries of the credit would be small- and
medium-sized enterprises producing for export or efficient import
substitution. The project would thus contribute to increasing the currently
very low levels of production in the manufacturing subsector and improving
capacity utilization. For public industrial enterprises funds would only be
provided to those units that have been authorized to operate on an autonomous
basis under the Government's new system of public enterprise management, thus
strengthening the reform process.
8.        Risks.  The principal project risk is that lack of qualified staff
may impede the rapid development of a capability for subproject appraisal
within SBL.. This constraint would be mitigated by IDA's detailed review of
SBL's pipeline of subprojects during project appraisal. Consultant assistance
would also be provided during implementation to train and assist staff in
project evaluation and monitoring.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
