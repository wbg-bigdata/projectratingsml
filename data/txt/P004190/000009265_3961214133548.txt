INDUSTRIAL CREDIT I 11947-LA]
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Industrial Credit
Line project in Lao PDR, for which Credit 1947-LA in the amount of US$ 10 million
equivalent was approved on July 26, 1988 and made effective on January 19, 1989.
The credit was closed on June 30, 1995, in comparison with the original closing
date of June 30, 1993. It was fully disbursed, and the last disbursement took place on
August 10, 1995. Cofinancing for the project was provided by the Government of
France.
The ICR was prepared by Rebecca Hall, Country Officer, Country Operations
Division, East Asia and Pacific Region and reviewed by Pamela Cox, Division Chief,
Country Operations Division; Walter Schwermer, Projects Advisor and Callisto Madavo,
Director, East Asia and Pacific Department I. The borrower provided comments on a
draft of this document, which have been incorporated.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission, December 11 to December 16, 1995 It is based on material in the project files.
The borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by contributing its views during the
mission, which are reflected in the Aide Memoire, preparing its own evaluation of the
project's execution; and commenting on the draft ICR.

INDUSTRIAL CREDIT I
CREDIT NO. 1947-LA
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Industrial Credit I project (IC) was the first IDA operation in the industrial
sector in Lao PDR. The project was developed as a result of discussions between the
central bank (formerly State Bank of Lao PDR now the Bank of Lao PDR) and IDA
regarding the need for support in expanding the intermediation role served by the
financial system.
Project Objectives
2.    The Industrial Credit project was designed to support essential investments for the
rehabilitation, modernization and expansion of productive capacity in the industrial sector
through the provision of financing for equipment, spare parts, and technical assistance. It
was expected to bring about greater efficiency and help the country take advantage of
export and import substitution opportunities, thereby enhancing public savings and
foreign exchange earnings. The primary focus of the project was the manufacturing
sector and many of the investments to be financed were already identified/pre-appraised
by the time of Board presentation. An additional project objective was to support the
institutional development needed for the delivery of term credit for industrial financing in
the Lao PDR.
3.    The objectives of the project were achieved in a narrow sense but fell short of
initial expectations. Productive capacity in the industrial sector did increase as many
credit recipients were able to expand production lines and purchase new equipment and
spare parts. By 1994, industry accounted for almost 18 percent of GDP in real terrns, up
from 11 percent in 1988. There is little evidence, however, that production methods and
management skills in enterprises have improved as a result of the credit, with the
exception of some privatized enterprises.  This is illustrated by the high percentage of
credit recipients, particularly state owned enterprises, whose loans are in arrears. Lastly,
the capacity within BoL to evaluate projects remains weak due to discontinuity of staff
and a lack of training and transfer of skills within the institution.

Implementation Experience and Results
4.    While the development objectives of the project were met, implementation
experience must be considered less than satisfactory.  There were large lags in
disbursements and the identification, appraisal and approval of sub-projects by the
Borrower was weak. Additionally, monitoring of the portfolio of sub-loans by the
Borrower was insufficient and a large percentage of loans resulted in arrears. Shortages
of trained credit officers at the BoL resulted in delays in sub-project approval. The
deadline for submission of sub-projects for approval to IDA was extended twice and the
project's closing date was also extended two times. As of project closing, 93.77 percent
of the credit was committed. Of the credit amount, 92.5 percent had been disbursed, with
the remainder being canceled.
5.    It is important to recognize that the economic environment changed quite
dramatically between project design and implementation. The State Bank of Lao, which
functioned as both a central and commercial bank, was reorganized into a two-tier system
with central banking separated from commercial banking. The n w central bank (the
Bank of Lao PDR) was made responsible for issuing currency, extending credit to the
commercial banks, and acting as the fiscal agent for the Government. The IDA credit,
however, remained under the management of the Central Bank as the commercial banks
were not considered capable of managing longer-term lending activities. Demands of the
financial sector restructuring resulted in reduced attention paid to project implementation.
6.    Furthermore, the privatization efforts of the Government negatively affected
project implementation. As state-owned enterprise demand for credit waned due to
privatization or the shift to joint venture arrangements, attention shift to the private sector
for identification of sub-projects.  However, demand for term  credit from private
enterprises was relatively modest. The overall result was a weak pipeline of sub-projects
and a need to extend the deadline for submission of sub-projects to IDA for approval as
well as the project closing date. Early into project implementation, problems with
payment arrears developed.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
7.    While the development objectives were met in a narrow sense, there are concerns
about the sustainability of the project, particularly the institutional capacity development
that has taken place.
8.    It was expected that a second Industrial Credit Project would follow this operation
but developments in the financial sector, including the separation of the State Bank into
several commercial banks and a Central Bank and the opening of branches of foreign
commercial banks, make it difficult to justify BoL's continued involvement in credit
distribution. Preparation of an Industrial Credit II Project was therefore discontinued.
There is still a valid need for capacity building at the Bank of Lao, however, but these
needs are being addressed through various technical assistance projects rather than with
additional IDA credits.



- 111 -
The main lessons learned from project implementation include:
(a)    There is a need for IDA to develop a strategic view of relevant sectors
prior to project identification and appraisal in order to ensure that potential
reforms and changes with the sector can be foreseen.
(b)    A realization that discontinuity of staff within an implementing agency is
of particular concern in countries where human capacity is still weak.
Additionally, mechanisms for transfer of newly acquired skills and
knowledge need to be institutionalized so changes in staff do not result
loss of new skills.
(c)    Adequate attention to and resources for supervision on the part of IDA,
particularly for the first operation within a sector, is crucial to effective
project implementation.
(d)    Technical assistance, when crucial to project implementation, should be
included in project design and financed by the project so that timely
provision of necessary activities can be assured.

INDUSTRIAL CREDIT I [CR. 1947-LA]
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT AND EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.    Background and Statement of Objectives. At the time of project inception, Lao PDR
had a very small industrial sector which was largely dominated by state-owned enterprises. The
structure of the sector had changed little since the 1 970s as foreign exchange shortages prevented
much needed replacement of and addition to productive capacity. Capital investment was
normally financed through budgetary allocations, often being used as a means of providing
operational subsidies to enterprises.   In general, the system provided little incentive for
operating efficiency at the enterprise level.
2.    With the introduction of the New Economic Mechanism (NEM) in 1986, however, a
fundamental shift in the operation of public enterprise was expected as the program supported
increased autonomy and greater operational and financial accountability for public enterprises.
Credit was expected to replace budgetary transfers as the main means of financing investment
and working capital. A major implication of the NEM was the expanded role of the country's
still underdeveloped financial sector in the provision of term credit for the newly autonomous
enterprises.  At the time of project development, the financial sector comprised a single
institution, the State Bank of Lao PDR (SBL), which was responsible for the combined functions
of central, commercial and development banking.
3.    The Industrial Credit Project was directed mainly at supporting essential investment for
the rehabilitation, modernization and expansion of productive capacity in the country's industrial
sector through the provision of equipment, spare parts and technical assistance. The project was
also intended to support the establishment of an infrastructure for the delivery of term credit for
industrial financing. In particular, the establishment of systems and procedures for project
appraisal and investment financing was to be initiated with a view towards strengthening the
banking system's ability to assume its expanded financial intermediation function under the
NEM.
4.    Specifically, the project objectives were: (a) to upgrade the capacity and productivity of
small- and medium-sized industries through: the acquisition of modern equipment and essential
spare parts and raw materials, and the provision of technical assistance to improve production
methods and management skills; and (b) to initiate the development of a capability for project
evaluation within SBL with a view towards progressively strengthening the institution's ability



to assume its expanded financial intermediation function under the New Economic Mechanism
(NEM).
5.    Evaluation of Objectives. The objectives of the project were appropriate given the
situation within the financial and industrial sectors at the time of project preparation and IDA's
strategy as formulated at the time. As noted in the section discussing IDA performance,
however, questions can be raised as to whether sufficient attention was given to diagnosing the
causes of poor performance in these sectors, before prescribing a credit line as a solution. The
project attempted to bring about greater efficiency in the operations of public enterprises while
opening the way for a greater reliance on private initiatives. It addressed the two key constraints
to development in the sector, namely the lack of foreign currency resources for the rehabilitation
and expansion of productive capacity and the need to strengthen institutional and managerial
capabilities given the increasing emphasis that was being placed on autonomous microeconomic
decisions by individual enterprises. Additionally, focus on the development of capacity for
project evaluation within the banking system was timely based on the expected increase in
demand for financial intermediation under the NEM.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
6.    The development objectives of the project were achieved in a narrow sense and fell short
of initial expectations in certain areas. Productive capacity in the industrial sector did increase,
but the total increase was less than expected, as credits were also extended to service sector
enterprises. The privatization of some state enterprise reduced the demand for credit from the
industrial sector. As a result, the focus of the project shifted towards the budding private sector,
which is largely service oriented. Development of institutional capacity for project evaluation
fell short of expectations as the use of new skills and project evaluation techniques has not yet
been institutionalized.
7.    Expansion of Productive Capacity. The primary objective of the project was to support
essential investments for the rehabilitation, modernization and expansion of productive capacity
in the industrial sector, particularly focused on the manufacturing sector. This was to be
accomplished through the provision of credit to acquire necessary modem equipment and
essential spare parts and raw materials, and by the provision of technical assistance to improve
production methods and management skills.
8.    Productive capacity of enterprises in various industries was indeed upgraded as many
credit recipients were able to expand production lines and purchase new equipment and spare
parts. Lao Brewery, which was later privatized, was able to change its bottling line and
substantially expand production. Several manufacturing enterprises in the garment and food
processing industry were also able to increase production as a result of credits received.
Enterprises engaged in metallurgy, extraction, chemicals, paper, plastics and construction
activities also benefited from available credits. In 1994, industry accounted for almost 18
percent of GDP in real terms, up from 11 percent in 1988. The manufacturing sector's share of
GDP (in real terms) also increased substantially, from 7.5 percent in 1988 to 12.7 percent in
1994.



- 3 -
9.    To the extent, however, that some portion of available credit was diverted to service
sector enterprises, such as hotels and tourism, the overall increase in industrial productive
capacity is less than expected. Credits equal to roughly 16 percent of total lending were
extended to enterprises outside the industrial sector. While these credits did result in increased
productive capacity in the service sector, this was not the original intention of the project. As the
Government pursued its privatization program, the pipeline of sub-projects which had been
developed during project appraisal to ensure quick disbursements became less and less relevant.
It can be argued, therefore, that IDA and BoL were correct in redefining the objectives of the
credit line towards increasing private sector participation, including services. Given that many of
these private sector sub-projects were much smaller in size, this also contributed to slower than
expected disbursements.
10.   The project included co-financing from the French Government to fund a Resident
Advisor to provide technical assistance (TA) for a period of 3 years. This advisor, however, was
less than completely successful in providing the necessary guidance and training to BoL;
commercial banks and enterprises, and IDA supervision missions often provided supplemental
TA. During project implementation, it became apparent that an additional advisor was needed
and BoL requested IDA's assistance to secure financing for such an advisor. When these efforts
proved unsuccessful, BoL was still reluctant to use part of the available IDA credit for this
purpose and the additional training never materialized.
11.   Development of Institutional Capacity for Project Evaluation. While the technical
assistance provided did develop some capacity within BoL to appraise projects, and an
infrastructure for the delivery of term credit for industrial financing has been initiated, the use of
new project appraisal and evaluation techniques has not been institutionalized. Despite the
availability of sound, modern project appraisal methods, intuition and personal qualifications
remain the primary factors used to evaluate creditworthiness. Computer programs developed for
project appraisal which employ internationally recognized indicators and evaluation criteria are
still not used regularly in credit decisions. This remains true both within the BoL and the state
commercial banks. Projected cash flow and product marketability are taken into account during
the evaluation process, but when project cash flow cannot be demonstrated, "collateral" of the
project's promoter is accepted and credit is extended. This is particularly problematic in Lao
PDR where the legal framework and related regulations enabling the actual collection of
collateral in the event of default are still underdeveloped. Additionally, little follow-up regarding
the financial situation of credit recipients is done on a systematic basis.
12.   The capacity at BoL to evaluate projects remains weak despite training and technical
assistance provided. This is largely due to a lack of continuity of staff and little or no training
and transfer of skills within BoL. Management within BoL has had difficulty moving from the
old system of simple administration of credit allocations to the new system involving proper
banking functions, and additional training in this area would be beneficial.
13.   Upgrade Management Skills. With the possible exception of some enterprises which
were privatized and have since become more profitable, there is little evidence that management
capacity in enterprises has improved as a result of the credit.  This is illustrated by the high
percentage of credit recipients who were unable to service their debts and whose loans fell into
arrears. At the time of the ICR mission, six enterprises, which received 12.1 percent of total



credit funded from IDA proceeds, were in arrears of more than three payments with another four
enterprises accounting for 6.4 percent of the IDA credit were in arrears of one to three payments.
Finally, five firms representing 9.3 percent of IDA credit proceeds are in dispute regarding
payments which BoL is trying to resolve. With respect to credits financed from project reflows
(about US$2 million), an additional 10 enterprises or 31 percent of these credits were in arrears.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
14.   There were several factors which resulted in project delays and the postponement of both
the deadline for sub-project approval and the closing date by two years. Most importantly, the
ability of the Borrower to implement the project successfully was affected by reforms in the
financial sector which began in 1988. SBL, which functioned as both a central and commercial
bank, was reorganized into a two-tier system with central banking separated from commercial
banking. The central bank (now called the Bank of Lao PDR) was made responsible for issuing
currency, extending credit to the commercial banks, and acting as the fiscal agent for the
Government. The IDA credit, however, remained under the management of BoL as the
commercial banks were not considered capable of managing longer term lending activities.
Given this major restructuring and additional financial sector reforms which were adopted during
the implementation period, the project received less attention from BoL than needed for truly
successful implementation.
15.   Additionally, the privatization efforts of the Government led to a reshaping of many state-
owned enterprises initially considered as candidates for subloans. In a number of cases, joint
venture agreements signed with foreign investors resulted in an elimination of the demand for
credit from that enterprise as new owners brought sufficient capital to the enterprise. As the
privatization program continued, the implementing agency became less concerned with
investigating new investment opportunities. The scope for publicly sponsored projects was
considerably reduced, at the same time that private sector demand for term credit remained
relatively modest. The overall result was a weak pipeline of sub-projects and a need to extend the
deadline for submission of sub-projects to IDA for approval from June 30, 1991 to December 31,
1994.
16.   Early into project implementation, problems with payment arrears also developed.
Efforts on the part of BoL to resolve these payment arrears did not prove successful in many
cases, largely due to a lack of clearly enforceable penalties. Increased efforts by BoL to improve
the performance of the portfolio of sub-loans and resolve these arrears situations resulted in a
near moratorium on the approval of new projects for almost a year which further slowed project
disbursements. Lastly, weak institutional capacity within the implementing agency hampered
implementation and resulted in slower than expected disbursements.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
17.   To the extent that enterprises who received credits remain viable, the expansion in
productive capacity is sustainable.  The question of enterprise viability is a crucial one,
particularly with respect to state-owned enterprises. It is not clear that investments financed by



the project were made in growth areas and therefore sustainable. With respect to capacity
building activities, it is doubtful whether project evaluation and appraisal techniques transferred
to and other skills acquired by BoL staff will remain in use now that IDA supervision of the
project has ceased. While capacity building is a priority for the Lao, there remains work to be
done with respect to institutionalizing the use and sharing of newly acquired skills within the
government and its agencies. For these reasons, project sustainability remains uncertain.
E. ASSOCIATION PERFORMANCE
18.   Project Identification. IDA's identification of the project raises some important questions.
The industrial and financial sectors at the time were underdeveloped and in need of support given
the Government's economic reform program as outlined under the NEM. In light of the
assumption regarding the need for credit, a credit line was appropriate and the project was in line
with IDA's strategy of overall support for the Government's program of economic and financial
reform. It is not clear from project documents, however, that a sufficient attempt was made to
determine whether this increase in the demand for credit would actually materialize given
expected changes in ownership of state enterprises. There should have been more strategic
thinking as to how these sectors would develop under the NEM and the possible effects on
project implementation of potential developments within the sector. Additionally, it is unclear
whether or not sufficient attention was paid to diagnosing the causes of poor performance in the
financial and industrial sectors,  before ascertaining that access to credit would improve
performance.
19.   Project Preparation. IDA's preparation of the project was adequate and some attention
was given to the current situation in both the financial and industrial sectors as well as capacity
constraints within the banking system.  From the project documents, it appears that the
substantial changes that took place in the financial sector and the resulting effect on project
implementation were not foreseen during the preparation phase, but perhaps should have been
considered.
20.   Appraisal.   Early  identification  and  appraisal of viable  sub-projects proved
satisfactory and facilitated faster disbursements of the IDA credit. With the exception of one
sub-project (a coal mine), appraisal and rate of return calculations proved accurate. In the case of
the coal mine, however, the assessment of the market for coal production was overly optimistic.
It was expected that a cement factory, not yet built, would purchase a significant portion of the
production from the mine at a price of US$40 per ton. The credit line was extended based on this
appraisal but delays in construction of the cement factory translated into income problems for the
coal mine. The cement factory was not completed until 1994 and the mine was forced to export
to Thailand in the interim at a much lower price of US$25 per ton. As a result, the credit line has
had severe payments problems which are only now being resolved.
21.   Supervision. Initially, supervision of the project by IDA was frequent and adequate. As
the project progressed, however, supervision became less frequent. After 1991, only one
supervision report per year was prepared. This is largely the result of staff turnover: during the
implementation period there were at least four task managers of record for the project. This
turnover of staff within IDA unfortunately occurred while project staff at BoL were also



- 6 -
changing, resulting in a near by complete lack of institutional memory within IDA. This is of
particular concern for this project since many of the initial preparation briefs and reports mention
that lack of trained personnel and shallow institutional depth at SBL would likely translate into a
need for more frequent or higher than normal supervision. However, such close supervision did
not materialize during imp"^ --titation.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
22.   Borrower performance with respect to  sub-project identification, appraisal and
supervision of approved projects was lower than expected. BoL had difficulty moving from the
old system of administration of credit allocations to the new system involving proper banking
functions. Perhaps the largest single problem with respect to project implementation was the
discontinuity of staff at BoL. Management of the Credit Department, which was responsible for
project implementation, and project staff changed several times during the implementation
period. This turnover of staff translated into gaps in project implementation and the loss of
institutional knowledge regarding proper sub-project appraisal and overall project
implementation procedures. Lack of knowledge of project staff and inability to prepare proper
documentation resulted in fewer and fewer sub-projects submitted to IDA for approval and lower
than expected disbursements.
23.   Computer programs developed for project appraisal using internationally recognized
indicators and criteria are still not used in credit decisions. Despite the existence of this model
and training provided by a resident advisor, intuition and an evaluation of personal qualifications
rather than project viability remain the primary methods used to evaluate creditworthiness. This
is true both within the BoL and state commercial banks. With respect to supervision of approved
sub-projects, no analysis was done regarding the evolution of the financial situation of credit
recipients and the possible effect on an enterprise's ability to meet its debt-service obligations.
While it can be understood that such analysis may not be necessary for all sub-projects, it is
certainly warranted for those enterprises that fell into arrears and have been unable to service
their debt.
24.   However, BoL did try to involve the newly established commercial banks in project
implementation. Based on an evaluation of the financial position and capabilities of the
commercial banks, it was decided that this involvement should be limited to the role of acting as
agents in the identification and supervision of selected sub-projects.  With respect to projects
financed by reflows, commercial banks were given primary responsibility for identification and
appTaisal of sub-projects, with final approval required from BoL.  BoL therefore did try to
develop project appraisal skills and some infrastructure for delivery of term credit in the
commercial banks. It is important to note that sub-projects financed with reflows did not require
prior review by IDA and therefore minimum rates of return may not have been properly assessed.
Additionally, since IDA approval was not necessary, and the approval process therefore much
quicker, the availability of these reflows may have contributed to slower disbursements from the
original IDA credit line.



G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
25.   On balance, the project's outcome is considered successful in a narrow sense since to
some extent all major objectives were achieved; however issues regarding sustainability remain
uncertain. The primary objective, expansion of productive capacity, was achieved as credit was
provided to allow firms to purchase modem equipment and spare parts. The troublesome
situation with arrears, however, raises doubts about the viability of these enterprises. In some
cases, reports indicate that enterprises are in fact viable and a "willingness" to pay rather than an
"ability" to pay is the cause of the arrears problem. Institution building objectives were also
achieved, albeit to a lesser extent than originally envisaged, but sustainability in this area is
particularly doubtful.
26.   Despite the achievement of these objectives, there were several shortcomings in
implementation. Project implementation was slower than expected due to dramatic changes
within the financial sector and discontinuity of staff both within BoL and IDA. Disbursements
lagged behind appraisal estimates for several reasons. First, the Government's privatization
program rendered the pipeline of sub-projects (which had been prepared and appraised in order to
enable quick disbursements) less and less relevant and enterprises lacked the expertise to
translate investment ideas into bankable projects.  Second, once project reflows became
available, approval of sub-projects financed from these reflows may have substituted for use of
the credit line as they did not require prior approval from IDA. Thirdly, the provision of
technical assistance, which occurred early in project implementation, did not prove sustainable as
many newly acquired skills were not shared across or within agencies which resulted in a weak
pipeline of sub-projects and corresponding lags in credit approvals and disbursements.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
27.   It was expected that a second project would follow this operation, and in fact an Industrial
Credit II project was developed as far as the IEPS stage. When the Industrial Credit I project was
developed, it was understandable for SBL to be involved in credit distribution given the virtual
non-existence of a commercial banking sector in Lao PDR. Even after SBL was restructured
into separate central and commercial banks, capacity within the newly created state commercial
banks did not warrant management of long term credit activities, and BoL continued to manage
the credit line. The situation today, however, is quite different: in addition to domestic
commercial banks, there are several branches of foreign banks now operating in the country.
Under these circumstances, BoL's continued involvement in credit distribution is hard to justify
and preparation of the Industrial Credit II project was therefore discontinued.
28.   There is still a valid need for institution building and capacity development at the BoL
but these needs are beirpg addressed through various technical assistance projects rather than
additional IDA  credits.  The broader issues of financial sector reform, including the
strengthening of the banking sector to meet the needs of a growing market-oriented economy,
will be further supported by the proposed Third Structural Adjustment Credit.

I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
29.   There is a need for IDA to develop a strategic view of relevant sectors prior to project
identification and appraisal in order to ensure that potential reforms and changes with the sector
can be foreseen. Potential reforms and resulting changes in structure or methods of operations
should be considered before embarking on the first project in a particular sector.
30.   Discontinuity of staff within an implementing agency is of concern in any project but is
of particular concern in countries where human capacity is still weak. Additionally, when
mechanisms for transfer of skills and project knowledge are not institutionalized, project design
must include adequate capacity building and the development of staff capable of training other
staff.
31.   Adequate attention to and resources for supervision on the part of IDA, particularly for
the first operation within a sector, is crucial to effective project implementation. To the extent
possible, changes in responsible staff within IDA should be limited during the implementation
period.
32.   Technical assistance, when crucial to project implementation, should be included in
project design and financed by the project. While the financing of TA by bilateral donors with
grant money is desirable for the Borrower, it often results in delays in project implementation
and when problems arise, IDA typically has no recourse to correct the situation.

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
Given the nature of the Industrial Credit I project, it is not possible to calculate an economic rate
of return for the entire project. Ex-ante rates of return which were calculated for a sample of sub-
projects range from 26.5% to 67.1%. Ex-post rates of return were not calculated since the
requisite information (financial data from sub-borrowers) was not collected by the BoL.

Lao People's Democratic Republic
Industrial Credit I (Credit No. 1947-LA)
Implementation Completion Mission
AIDE MEMOIRE
The Industrial Credit I project was approved by the Board on July 1, 1988 and declared
effective on January 19, 1989. The closing date was originally planned for June 30, 1993
but due to a number of factors, was extended twice and finally closed on June 30, 1995.
A World Bank Implementation Completion Report (ICR) mission visited Lao PDR from
December 1 1 to December 16, 1995 to collect additional data for the preparation of the
ICR, to solicit the views of the borrower and implementing agencies, and to provide
advice and support to the Government on the preparation of their evaluation of the project
for contribution to the document. The mission wishes to thank the Credit Department,
Bank of Lao PDR (BoL) for its assistance and cooperation.
During the mission, the objectives of the ICR were explained to a team from the BoL
designated by the Government to undertake the task of overseeing preparation of the
report. The mission solicited the views of the Government representatives and those
responsible for actual project implementation. The mission encouraged the team to focus
on a) an assessment of the objectives, design, and implementation experience; and b) an
evaluation of the Bank's and the Government's performance during the implementation
phase of the project.
The Industrial Credit Project was the first IDA project in the industrial sector in Lao PDR
which was very small and dominated by state owned enterprises. The first few sub-
projects approved, which were loans to state enterprises, did support essential investment
for the rehabilitation, modernization and expansion of productive capacity as the project
intended. During implementation however, priorities were redirected, and a significant
portion of subsequent loans were made to private sector, service oriented enterprises such
as hotels, printing and a dental clinic. Additionally, loans made to state enterprises
experienced problems with arrears, in some cases despite the profitability of the
enterprise. Pressure from the Government resulted in complete repayment of outstanding
balances by one enterprise, but 18 out of the 39 total loans remain in arrears.
Capacity building at the BoL and state commnercial banks for project appraisal was also
an objective of the Industrial Credit Project. Staff turnover and failure to utilize available
bilateral technical assistance resulted in a smaller than expected increase in institutional
capacity for project appraisal. This is evidenced by the fact that a computerized sub-loan
monitoring system and model developed for sub-project appraisal at BoL has not been
updated or used since 1993 (the mission was inforrned, however, that monitoring of some
projects has been done by hand). To a large extent, credit decisions continue to be made
on the basis of personal merit and creditworthiness rather than project viability. This is
particularly true of the loans financed out of reflows where Qnly 4 out of 26 sub-projects
were appraised using the computer model. The model for project appraisal was updated
and converted to Microsoft Excel by the mission. It is strongly recommended that BoL



begin using the model again and that commercial banks be required to use the program
for appraising projects prior to credit approval.
Despite difficulties and delays in project implementation, US$9,377.3 million was
committed under the IDA credit with withdrawals as of 15 December 1995 totaling
US$8,674.2 million. A total of 39 loans were made for 34 approved sub-projects directly
from the IDA credit plus an additional 27 loans for 23 sub-projects approved out of
reflows. The remaining undisbursed balance from the IDA credit will be canceled with
the formal closing of the project. It should be noted that the availability of reflows from
existing loans, which began in 1991, contributed to a decline in the use of funds under
the IDA credit, particularly since approval of sub-projects from IDA was not required for
these loans. The mission also noted that during the period January 1994 to February
1995 no new projects were approved, either from reflows or the IDA credit. During this
period there was a reluctance on the part of BoL to initiate new loans until the arrears
situation had been addressed, additionally there was a lack of viable sub-projects in the
industrial sector.
The mission attempted to calculate ex-post financial rates for return for a small sample of
sub-projects, however sufficient data was not available. IRRs were calculated for each
sub-project prior to approval and those rates can still be considered reliable. The mission
reviewed a sample of 11 sub-projects which showed IRRs ranging from 26.5 percent to
57 percent (this high IRR is for the Lao Brewery plant extension and should be
considered an outlier).
Overall, project implementation was less than satisfactory but progress on overall
development objectives must be considered satisfactory. Productive capacity has been
upgraded for several industries and development of capacity for project evaluation within
BoL has been initiated. It is however, the recommendation of this mission that funding
for further training in this area, both for BoL and state commercial banks be secured.
Tentative lessons that have been drawn from the experience of implementation of the
project are: First, continuity of staff is important in projects that require initial training
and capacity building to implement. If continuity of staff is not possible, there must at
least be a mechanism in place to transfer knowledge and skills needed for project
implementation to replacement staff. Second, initial operations in any field require
frequent supervision in the part of IDA, but particularly in areas where existing capacity
has been identified as weak from project preparation.
It was agreed that the Bank would send the draft ICR document to the Bank of Lao by
January 20, 1996. BoL staff agreed to provide comments on said draft and to furnish the
Government's contribution to the ICR no later than January 30, 1996.

RAPPORT FiNAL SUR L'EXECUTION DU PROJET
RDP Lao : Projet de Credit Industriel IDA Cr.1947-LA
Historigue:
Le Projet de Credit Industriel IDA Cr. 1947-LA r6sulte dune etroite collaboration entre
rIDA et les autorites du Gouvernement Lao. Les missions didentification se sont
d6roulees en fevrier, septembre de rann6e 1987 et en fevrier de rann6e 1988. Les Accords
de Cr6dit de Developpement et de Projet ont 6te sign6s a Washington le 16 aofit 1988,
pour un montant de 7,4 millions de DTS soit environ 10 milions de USD. La date de
clotfure du Projet etait iniatialement fix6e au 30 juin 1993, mais apres 2 extensions, il a et
finalement cloture le 30 juin 1995.
Les obiectifs du Proiet:
Le Projet a deux grands objectifs:
- Elever la capacite et la productivite des petites et moyennes industries a travers ( i )
racquisition d'equipements modemes, de pieces de rechange et de matieres premieres
indispensables et ( ii ) une assistance technique pour am6liorer les methodes de production
et les connaissances en gestion.
- Initier le developpement dtune aptitude a 6valuer les projets au sein de la Banque en vue
de renforcer progressivement les comp6ences pour assumer ses fonctions dintermediateur
financier.
Ainsi, le projet est forme de deux composantes:
- La composante credit qui vise a ameliorer et a d6velopper les PME/PMI qu'ils viennent
du secteur public ou prive.
- La composante assistance technique qui est une aide du Gouvernement francais et qui est
concretise par l'envoi de conseillers pour assister la cellule du Projet dans r6tude et
ltvaluation desprojets durant le commencement de la mise en 6x6cution du Projet.
La mise en oeuvre du Proiet
La mise en vigueur du Projet a 6te declaree le 19 janvier 1989. Depuis cette date jusqu' a
maintenant, 39 conventions de pret ont et accord6es a 34 projets secondaires approuv6s

sur la ligne de credit initiale, representant des d6caissements d'un montant total de
8.939.315,89 USD. Le plus grand emprunteur est la Brasserie du Laos ( elle a re,u en tout
3.324.438,98 USD ), le plus petit etant la Clinique dentaire ( 11.444,14 USD ).
Le Projet a 6t6 mis en oeuvre dans la Prefecture de Vientiane et ensuite dans six provinces
qui sont: Province de Vientiane, Savannakhet, Champassack, Saravane, Luang Prabang et
Xieng Khouang.Les secteurs dont le Projet a 6te implique sont au nombre de 6:
confection de v8tements, industrie d'assemblage, industrie alimentaire et de boissons,
mines et carrieres, h8tels et services.
L'assistance technique francaise a commence au mois d'octobre 1988 et a fini en septembre
1991. Cette aide etait compos6 d'un conseiller technique permanent et d'un conseiller de
projets qui venait travailler 3 a 4 fois par an durant la periode citee. Concemant les details
de cette aide de 600.000 USD, la Banque ne les connait pas et raide materielle ne s'est
traduite que par un ordinateur en 1989.

Evaluation des resultats
a) Le credit:
Bien qu'il y a eu des retards au debut de rex6cution du Projet ( les premiers decaissements
ont et6 effectues en juin 1989 ), les fonds utilises sur les ressources de 1IDA ont pu etre de
l'ordre de presque 9 millions usr les 10 millions de USD prevus. Les premnieres 2 annees,
les prets ont dt6 faites principalement sur la Prefecture de Vientiane, et ensuite nous avons
developpe les pr8ts dans les autres provinces. Les resultats ont ete satisfaisants car en plus
du renforcement de la base industrielle du pays, cela a permis de creer des emplois a la
population.
Les acquisitions d'equipements et de mat6riels pour la majorit6 ont 6t6 execut6s suivant les
principes et les procedures en accord avec l'IDA.
b) L'Assistance techniaue:
Au cours de la periode de 3 ans ou les conseillers 6taient presents, bien que c'etait une
p6riode assez courte, ils se sont efforc6s de nous aider dans la mise en oeuvre du Projet de
facon satisfaisante, surmontant les difficultes et en introduisant des nouvelles m6thodes de
gestion d'une ligne de credit.

c) La Lestion du Proiet
Bien qu'au cours des 6 annee de la mise en place et de rex6cution du Projet, il y a eu
fr6quemment des changements de responsables, mais en realite, nous avons pu assurer
fondamentalement une certaine continuite qui s'est traduite par des relations de travail
regulieres avec IIDA, des approbations de projets secondaires a une cadence normale, un
bon taux de recouvrement des prets accordes.
Conclusions finales
1. Les avantages
Ce projet a eu un succes dans une certaine mesure, bien que les fonds n'ont pas ete utilises
a 100 %, on n'a pu quand meme decaisser i hauteur de 90 % environ des ressources
allouees, tout en orientant le credit vers les diff6rentes regions du pays, contribuant a une
meilleure situation economique.
L'octroi du credit a atteint un grand objectif en creant des emplois a la population,
notamment dans les usines de confection de vetements qui ont recu un financement de la
part de la ligne de credit. Actuellement, dans ces usines, la main d'oeuvre est
principalement f6minine et est estime a plus de 3.500 personnes. De facon generale, le
recouvrement des prets sur la ligne de credit initiale se deroule satisfaisante, couvrant deja
44 % ( environ 4 millions de USD ) des fonds utilises.
2. les difficultes
Le manque de cadres competents est a rorigine que les rapports d'ex6cution et les
documents de synthese soient faits en retard. De ce fait, la gestion du Projet eprouve des
difficultes de temps a autre. C'est une des raisons que le Projet a ete oblige d'avoir eu deux
extensions.
Le manque de connaissances solides de la part de certains promoteurs qui viennent
soumettre des dossiers est un probleme qui se prolonge dans le recouvrement des dettes.
Certains projets secondaires ont des retards dans leurs paiements parce qu'ils ont estime
leur taux de rentabilit6 trop haut et qui n!6tait pas realiste avec le marche local ou etranger,
la structure du financement et leur capacite de gerer leurs affaires. A part ca, les langues
etrangeres sont une barriere, en particulier ranglais et le francais pour qu'ils puissent bien
formuler leur projet. Cela entrame bien evidemment des retards dans la soumission des
dossiers.
