F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The loan would support RS government to resume a sustainable fiscal position which
includes a smoother debt profile and a balanced social security scheme. In addition, the
loan would contribute to improved public services through public sector management
reforms. Similarly, a sustainable fiscal path would eventually expand fiscal space for
investment to enhance the quality of public service provision, improve the economic
growth prospects and reverse the deteriorating trend in social indicators

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
Background
1.      Located at the extreme south of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul (RS) is the fourth
largest Brazilian state economy and the fifth largest in population. The state’s GDP in
2007 reached R$ 175 billion (US$90 billion1) and represented 7.4 percent of national
GDP. Industry and services each represented 44 percent of GDP, while agriculture
contributed with the remaining 12 percent. Economic activity is driven by export sectors,
high-productivity agro-business, and a well developed industrial sector. Rio Grande do
Sul had a population of 11 million inhabitants, which represented 6 percent of the
Brazilian population.
2.      Rio Grande do Sul is a well developed state and has enjoyed high socio-economic
welfare standards in the Brazilian context. Per capita GDP was US$8,100 in 2007, the
fourth highest in Brazil and 16 percent larger than the national average. Social indicators
were also well above national averages. In 2006, RS’s poverty headcount rate was 17.1
percent, the fifth lowest in the country. Income inequality is also much lower than
national figures. Education and health indicators were also well above national averages.
3.      Despite the privileged position that Rio Grande do Sul holds in the Brazilian
context, economic and social development deteriorated since the mid 1990s. The state’s
growth was more volatile than the national economy, with large expansions followed by
strong recessions. The RS economy is highly vulnerable to climatic effects concerning
water resources and the exchange rate movements, which affect export-oriented agro-
business and industries.
4.      This difficult economic scenario was translated into structural and entrenched
fiscal imbalances, which in turn further aggravated the local economic outlook. In 2007, a
new elected government took office. During the campaign, it had promised to take
measures to address the difficult state fiscal situation. Thus, one of the Government’s first
measures was to launch an emergency fiscal adjustment package.
5.      At appraisal, Rio Grande do Sul was the state with the most difficult fiscal
situation in Brazil, failing to comply with several Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) limits2.
The sources of the imbalances were traced to a smaller tax base, together with
benevolence in granting tax exemptions, an increasing trend in personnel expenditures as
well as fiscal risks on payroll such as the Brito Law3, a large structural deficit of the
state’s social security system, the state’s debt dynamics, and a rigid structure in the
provision of a large array of public services, as presented briefly below.




1
  GDP was converted using the average exchange rate prevailing in 2007 (1 US$ = R$ 1.94).
2
  The FRL along with Federal Senate resolutions imposes limits on payroll expenditure, guarantee issuance,
debt/ revenue ration and other minor restrictions.
3
  The Brito law was approved by the legislative in 1998 granting salary increase to public servants, but it
was never put into practice due to a federal law, called Camata law, that put a ceiling on payroll
expenditures. The state government argument was that it could not implement the wage rises because it was
spending above the limit set by the federal law. However, the government’s position was overthrown by
judicial decision that mandated the government to implement salary increases.


                                                    1
6.       This two-tranche DPL was designed to support the Government’s policies to
address the above cited problems as well as to help the state comply with the subnational
fiscal responsibility framework.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
7.      The project was appraised and finalized under the guidelines of the Brazil
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2008-2011. One of the CPS pillars deals with macro
fundamentals, good governance and public sector management. The country development
objective related is to strengthen fiscal sustainability with increasing private sector
development. In this pillar, the CPS advances issues such as public management
efficiency and effectiveness, improving quality in public expenditures and engagement
with states in results-oriented public sector reforms.
8.      The RS Fiscal Sustainability DPL was fully aligned with the above mentioned
CPS pillar. It helped strengthen fiscal sustainability in the state by addressing debt
dynamics problems. It also helped the state address long term fiscal sustainability
challenges by improving expenditure management (e.g. procurement system actions), tax
administration (e.g. revenue matrix management), social security, and HR reforms.
9.      The loan also concentrated on public management efficiency and effectiveness
issues and results-oriented public sector reform in line with the CPS.
10.     Lastly, this operation also attended a strong demand from the central government
explicit in the CPS, to work more with subnational governments, especially on fiscal
issues and compliance with the FRL.
1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
11.     As described in the Project Document (PD), the PDO is: “the loan would support
RS Government to resume a sustainable fiscal position which includes a smoother debt
profile and a balanced social security scheme. In addition, the loan would contribute to
improved public services through public sector management reforms. Similarly, a
sustainable fiscal path would eventually expand fiscal space for investment to enhance
the quality of public service provision, improve the economic growth prospects and
reverse the deteriorating trend in social indicators?.
12.     As per the PD, the operation was structured around four components: fiscal
sustainability, debt restructuring, social security and modernization of the state public
sector. Each component had its own development objective(s) and key indicator(s) as
summarized in Annex 3.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification
13.     PDO was not revised.
1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program
14.    This DPL supported seven policy areas within its four components. The table
below presents each policy area with its corresponding long-term vision as depicted in
the PD. The complete policy matrix is shown in annex 3. The first two components
implemented short and medium term measures embodied in the emergency fiscal plan
prepared by the Government to address urgent fiscal needs. Policy actions in these two
components included reduce indebtedness, contain personal expenditures, rationalize


                                           2
operating expenses, enhance tax collection efficiency and rationalize tax expenditures.
The last two components were composed of long-term and structural policy actions. They
included the introduction of results-oriented public management practices and the
modernization of HR management.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas
15.      Not applicable.
1.6 Other significant changes
16.      No significant changes were made to the DPL.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Program Performance
17.    Program implementation was satisfactory, even though some external factors to
the executive power hindered the pace and conclusion of some reforms. Nonetheless,
achievements like a declining debt/ revenue ratio and controlled expenditures are
important, especially in a state with a long history of fiscal profligacy.

Component 1: Fiscal Sustainability
18.     A - Fiscal Adjustment. This first policy area reflected the commitment undertaken
by the Government to fulfill the Fiscal Restructuring and Adjustment Plan (PAF)4 targets
and to reduce its indebtedness ratio. The measures included the reduction of civil servants
commissioned positions, the restructuring of the Executive Branch and the imposing of
an expenditure ceiling to all secretariats.

  PAF is a three year rolling fiscal plan that the states are mandated to devise in accordance with STN under
the state debt renegotiation agreement with the Federal government.


                                                     4
19.     Table 35 shows solid improvements in the state fiscal conditions. As a result, it is
expected that the Net Consolidated Debt (NCD) to Net Current Revenue (NCR) ratio fall
under two i.e. under 200% by mid-year 2012. As recognition, the National Treasury
Secretariat (STN) allowed the state to initiate the procedures for contracting new loans
for the first time since the debt renegotiation contract was signed in 1998.

20.     B - Expenditures. The focus of this policy area was on structural fiscal imbalances
issues and thus helped to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal adjustment by reducing the
pace of current expenditure growth and allowing for greater investment.

 This table and the following ones present the baseline indicators for 2007, even though the PD has
baseline indicators for 2006 as well. This was done for the sake of simplicity and because 2007 was the
year before the operation was put into effectiveness.

21.     Table 4 shows that the state was able to reduce the share of payroll and current
expenditures and opened up more room for investments, signaling for sustainability of
the adjustment and growth prospects.
22.     The major highlight in this area was the restructuring of the procurement system.
The Government implemented more modern procurement alternatives like electronic
reverse auctions and price registry, as well as bolstered a planning culture for the state
regular purchases.
23.     The procurement office was totally restructured, including its facilities, and
human resources which were increased and trained. The improved fiscal management
resulted in more resource predictability, allowing for better purchase planning and
reduced the suppliers’ uncertainty regarding payments. By the end of 2010, RS had more
than 2,500 items registered which allowed for immediate supply and counted with more
than 11,000 registered suppliers. As a result, the price paid for some items like livestock
vaccination was reduced from R$ 1.56 per shot to a range between R$ 0.76 to R$ 0.86.
The total savings reaped by the procurement office amounted to R$ 271 million.

24.     C - Revenues. The policy actions in this area were aimed at improving tax
collection efficiency like the extension of the “Substituição Tributária8? mechanism and
adoption of the electronic fiscal invoice.
25.     Regarding, tax expenditures, the state has withdrawn some tax breaks, but more
importantly the State has given increased transparency to all tax expenditures in its
website9. The general public can access the total expenditure amount and the values for
each tax, region, and purpose. A technical note with the methodology is also available.
                                          Regarding the indicators,

firm of the production chain to avoid tax evasion.

26.    Table 5 demonstrates that the first two indicators achieved the expected results for
2010. State tax collection increased due to state’s efforts to curb the tax gap as well as
external factors such as the smaller reliance on exports by local firms. While the tax
revenue to state GDP ratio did not reach the expected 9% value, this was largely due to a
higher than expected GDP growth. In fact, the actual the tax revenue collected far
exceeded the expected one – as shown also in Table 5.
27.    The original policy matrix foresaw an indicator on tax expenditures that was
never put in place. This occurred due to the high complexity and controversy regarding
such measures, which were unknown for the team at the time of preparation. In addition,
due to the tax incentive design, the amount of tax expenditure can increase, even if the
government does not give any new tax break, which undermines the purpose of
monitoring such indicator.

Component 2: Debt Restructuring
28.     D - Debt Management Policy. This policy area aim was to support RS by paying
out extra-limite debt with the resources provided by the Bank loan, as well as building
debt management capacity in the state.
29.     Table 6 shows that once more the expected results were achieved. The
Government estimates that the debt restructuring saved R$ 379 million (1.6% of GDP) up
to December of 2010.
30.     Furthermore, the engagement with the Bank allowed the civil servants in charge
of debt management to deepen their expertise. During preparation of the ICR, the State’s
government informed the Bank that staff is now apt to perform analysis on exchange and
interest rate swaps, as well as to produce more informative managerial debt reports.

  Regarding the first indicator , although the PD and the ICR data sheet state that the indicator refers to tax
revenue, the loan agreement refers to the broader concept of revenue collection and put the corresponding
word in Portuguese in parenthesis (receita de arrecadação própria), which is the fourth target enforced at
PAF. Therefore, the baseline numbers were changed to reflect the correct concept.

Component 3: Social Security
31.     E - Reform of the State Social Security System. This policy area dealt directly with
one of the largest structural sources of fiscal imbalance in RS. Despite the fact that the
benefits paid were higher than expected and the contribution received was lower than
forecasted, the state social security deficit was within the expected value. More
substantial improvements were prevented since social security reform bill was not
approved by the state legislative. In this regard it is worth noting that in recent months the
new Government sent a new draft law to the legislature to address this issue.

Component 4: Modernization of the State Public Sector

  The expected target for the debt duration is wrongly set. The intention was not to reduce the duration;
rather it has always been to extend the duration. Therefore, the expected outcome for the debt duration was
also achieved.

32.     F - Introduction of Results-Based management. In order to overcome public
sector inefficiencies and deliver a better service to the population the RS government
decided to contract the relationship with several of its offices and invest in alternative
service delivery approaches. In this area, one successful initiative was the “Portal de
Gestão?, a dedicated website to monitoring and evaluating the government’s priority
projects, the so-called “Projetos Estruturantes?.
33.     The advances in this policy area were uneven. The government was able to move
fast with management contracts both with line secretariats and SOEs. The contracting
experience has been very positive. Reported benefits include better planning and
executing capacity, better management reports, allocative efficiency gains, identification
of bottlenecks and better internal coordination.
34.     Regarding the management contracts with SOEs the Government diagnosed that
the incentives offered to state enterprises to sign the contracts were not sufficiently
attractive as to commit them to the results contracted. It is believed that SOEs saw the
contracts as a mere way of getting more budget and more staff. Thus, even though the
indicators were mostly met the intended outcome was not achieved since the pretended
cultural change in the way SOEs operate did not materialize.
35.     Finally, the public service provision by OSCIPs was the action in which the least
progress was achieved in this area. The Government was only able to sign one contract,
despite its documented effort to attract new partners and sign more contracts.
36.     The Government and the Bank believe that factors like the lack of government
credibility due to its former financial situation, the complicated political state context,
resistance and low adherence to the model by government middle and lower-level
management were key reasons undermining the success of this initiative.

37.     G - Human Resources Policies. The government intended to implement a new HR
development policy to deal with issues such as workforce planning, inadequate salary
scales, inflexible career options and weak management.
38.    The drive for HR reforms lost momentum in the state government along its tenure.
The difficult political situation in the state made it harder for the governor to face
entrenched interests. Additionally, the government underestimated at the onset of the plan,
the need for legislative approval of the proposed measures.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
39.     Background analyses were carefully conducted. All policy components were
supported by background papers prepared by experts. On the client side, the governor and
other top Executive officials demonstrated an unprecedented political commitment in
carrying out the proposed reforms.
40.     The PDO indicators were well aligned with the loan objective. Overall, PDO
indicators focused on the outcomes for which the operation could be held accountable.
This is especially true for the first two components (Fiscal Sustainability and Debt
Reestructuring), while the set of indicators in the last two components (Civil Service



                                                10
Social Security and Modernization of Public Sector) were more dependable on actions
external to the Executive Power. The overall number of indicators (apart from the PDO
indicators) in the policy matrix proved to be excessive. Some indicators were even
difficult to understand and unclear, adding complexity to the operation
41.      The main risk identified at the preparation stage was of political nature and it was
explicitly stated at the PD that the proposed loan was a high risk one. The risk arising
from civil servants internal resistances to change was vaguely identified as reform fatigue.
It is clear now that the internal resistance by civil servants to change towards a result-
oriented culture was underestimated.
42.      On the political risk side, at time of preparation the government seemed to have
strong political support at the legislative as politically sensitive laws had passed with a
strong majority vote. It was also stated as a mitigating factor that the Government was
able to thoroughly communicate to the general public the need for reforms, the reforms
were clearly stated in the campaign platform and the society increased awareness of the
state fiscal problems. It is clear now that such mitigating factors were insufficient.
43.      The global economic crisis had an impact on the state economic and fiscal
situation, but not on the program implementation. Tax revenue growth slowed down from
previous years, but RS was one of the least affected Brazilian states in 2009. The state
good performance in previous years served as a buffer to the global economic crisis and
the decision to postpone some expenditure in 2009 helped secure balanced budget results.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
44.     The primary role in coordinating the data gathering, calculating the indicators and
assembling the responses for the Bank was done by the Secretariat of Finance. The
indicators chosen were coherent with PDOs and policy components.
45.     Most of the data needed to calculate the indicators were already regularly
collected and monitored by the Government. In this sense, it is correct to say that these
data was already used to inform Government decisions mostly on the fiscal policy side.
However, the data used to monitor HR and social security indicators were not regularly
collected by the government and thus presented difficulty in recovering and reporting.
2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:
46.     As a result of this DPL, both in financial and operational terms, the state is now
able to contract out new loans other than debt restructuring operations. Since the Bank
supported the fiscal turnaround carried out by the State, the Bank is well positioned to
provide new loans to the state in the upcoming period, supporting at the same time the
maintenance of a prudent fiscal behavior. In fact an investment loan with a multi-sector
SWAP approach is already in the pipeline.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
47.     The objectives of the DPL were extremely relevant both to the state and federal
government as well as the Bank during its appraisal and have remained so until the time
of the ICR. The loan objective was to support the fiscal adjustment carried out by a state
with a long record of fiscal mismanagement. The fragile financial situation was a major
reason behind the weaker economic performance. The fact that RS had the Bank support



                                            11
prior and throughout the world economic crisis reduced the impacts that state finances
would otherwise have suffered, through improved debt service profile, increase tax
collection efficiency and better prioritized expenditures.
48.     The DPL was fully aligned with the CPS during loan preparation, implementation
and conclusion. The CPS 2008-2011 document states “(b) a major leading program with
states, on state priorities and in compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law. This
emerging state-dominated program is branded as one based on principled opportunism,
in which governors who are interested in working with the Bank define their priorities,
and in which the Bank brings a set of well-articulated principles (based on analytic work
and experience in Brazil and elsewhere) to the table?.
49.     The extract above could well be used to describe the RS operation, confirming
once more its alignment with the country strategy and its high overall relevance.
Furthermore, it advances the issues listed in the CPS pillar: Macro fundamentals, good
governance, and public sector management.
50.     Lastly, it is also in accordance with the country current development priorities
since during the 2008-2011 CPS consultations, the federal government had formally
asked the Bank to engage more with states and support them in complying with the FRL.
Furthermore, the target of increasing public investment is also in line with federal
government priorities as reflected in the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC).

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
51.     The overarching objective of this operation was to assist the state government
achieving a more sustainable fiscal position. This would be achieved by a combination of
short and medium term policies (components 1 and 2) and more long term reforms
(component 3 and 4). Expected results from improved fiscal position were better public
services and greater fiscal space for investments.
52.     The state fiscal position improved considerably as showed by Table 3, Table 4
and
53.
54.     Table 5. The adjustment was carried out without relying heavily on extraordinaire
revenues and by controlling the growth rate of current expenditures. Revenue increase
was achieved through more efficient tax collection and increased economic growth. The
debt restructuring operation was very successful either.
55.     On the third and fourth components, progress in achieving the development
outcomes was mixed. On one hand, state social security system reforms undertaken,
although relevant, did not fully meet the expected outcomes. On the HR side, the reforms
were restricted to the creation of one new career (public manager). On the other hand,
advances in the introduction of results-based management were more significant and the
drawbacks faced are the ones regularly expected in such endeavors.
56.     Thus, even though some shortcomings occurred the overall outcome is still very
satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
57.    This operation to the State and to the Brazilian subnational fiscal outlook was so
relevant that it contributed to create a new demand for Bank work in Brazil. Regarding


                                           12
the outcomes, the state has met five out of six PDO indicator targets (only the
intermediate outcome indicator was missed). RS now enjoys a more fiscally sustainable
position, which allowed it to reap the gains of fiscal rectitude in terms of greater fiscal
space for investment.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
58.     As stated in the PD, the poorest and most vulnerable people in the RS society are
the ones who rely the most on state public services. Therefore, all the measures aimed at
improving public sector delivery as well as allowing the government to increase its fiscal
space to increase public service provision have contributed to poverty alleviation and
social development. There was no specific gender component to the loan.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
59.     The project has had a positive impact on institutional and capacity development.
For example, the reforms supported by the loan on the procurement procedures
represented an invaluable efficiency gain for the state. Before, the reforms the state was
seen by suppliers as a not-so-good purchaser due to the delays in making payments.
Internally, state offices complained about the delay in receiving the goods and services
requested. After the reforms, RS implemented price registry system for more than 2,500
items for immediate supply. Payment periods and the average price paid were reduced
and the number of suppliers was increased.
60.     The same can be said from the capacity acquired by the debt management team,
due to the training and assessments offered by the Bank. As a result, Sefaz has been
producing comprehensive annual reports on its debt activities. It has also assembled a
procedure manual for the debt related activities.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
63.    The above DPL was classified as a high risk operation. The political risk derived
from the fear that the government would not be able to sustain the adjustment until the
end of the government and that adjustment would be maintained in the following
government. The risks to development outcome are concentrated on economic, political
and government ownership factors.
64.    On the economic side, the most pressing issue relates to the question of whether
the positive fiscal results obtained can be sustained or not. To this issue, it must be
highlighted that the results obtained did not rely heavily on non-recurrent revenue and it
had a sizable component of expenditure reduction. Also, the pressure arising from the




                                            13
extralimite debt service was also addressed. Some fiscal risks like the “Brito Law? and
judicial claims were at least partially solved.12
65.     On the political and government ownership front, the state administration faced
opposition in the state assembly. As a result, important draft laws were not approved. The
incumbent party did not manage to get reelected and the political party elected was the
one which led the opposition. The transitioning to a new government, especially to an
opposing party, increases the risk to development outcome.
66.     Nevertheless, some attenuating factors may sustain the development outcomes
and even advance them. The speeches and actions taken so far by the new government
reflect the intention to maintain an environment of fiscal prudence. Also, the follow-up
operation with the state will leave the Bank in a better position to ascertain that fiscal
responsibility is maintained.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
67.     For this operation, Bank staff drew knowledge from previous AAA work on
federalism, pension system and the analytical work done in Minas Gerais. The Bank
maintained an intense technical dialogue with the state throughout the project preparation
stage. The Bank fielded several missions to the state with specialists on each field, who
prepared detailed background analysis for the operation. Stakeholders’ consultations were
also conducted.This has guaranteed that the proposed policies were relevant to the state
and the whole program was adequate and constituted of reforms that would address not
only short-term problems, but also would deal with the structural reasons behind the state
fiscal imbalance.
68.     The Bank has also designed an innovative repayment profile, with monthly
payments and customized repayment profile in response to the client’s needs. The debt
restructuring operation has also fostered demand from other subnational governments in
Brazil for the Bank’s services. Finally, the supported reforms opened up fiscal space for
greater investments and better public service provision.
69.     Small deficiencies were felt on the institutional aspects and on the M&E
arrangements. On this last point, it is worth noting that only five out of the 32 indicators
of the matrix indicators were monitored coherently through the whole operation lifetime.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
70.     The Bank conducted several supervision missions to RS, as well as maintained an
active policy dialogue during project supervision. The supervision missions and budget
were also used to provide non-lending technical assistance to the state, to help them




12
  The government has implemented the pay rises mandated by Lei Brito, however the amounts owned due
to past wages were not settled. Regarding, judicial claims the state has adhered to the rules set forward by
the Constitutional amendment 62 and will equate this liability in 15 to 20 years.


                                                     14
deliver on the agreed products and reach the expected outcomes. This allowed for
capacity building in several areas, as mentioned above (e.g. M&E and debt management)
71.     This was particularly important when the Bank envisaged that the state was not
going to be able to fulfill the second tranche triggers on the expected time. The Bank then
sent consultants to help them work on topics with the greatest delays. For instance, a
consultant was sent to help them devise the rules and manuals regarding OSCIPS.
Another expert was enlisted to revise the draft law on pensions. Thus, the Bank took all
measures in our reach to help the client meet second tranche triggers, however, due to the
local political situation the Bank took the conscious decision not to get involved anyhow
on it and suspended all missions during that period.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
72.    The Bank performance is rated satisfactory since the project addressed the client’s
main problems and the supervision not only monitored the implementation, but also
helped the Government achieve most of the expected results. Even though, some policy
components were not fully implemented, it’s hard to attribute this failure to major
problems in project appraisal or supervision.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
73.     The borrower was the Government of Rio Grande do Sul and the implementing
agency was the Secretariat of Finance. Other secretariats involved included Secretariat of
Planning, Secretariat of Administration and Human Resources and Secretariat of Justice
and Social Development.
74.     The borrower instituted an enabling environment for the reforms and addressed
timely issues raised during implementation. A good example relates with OSCIPS model,
in which the government proactively sought social organizations to participate in its
program. No shortcomings were faced regarding fiduciary aspects or transitions
arrangements.
75.     Regarding government ownership, top level management commitment in the
Executive Power was outstanding. However, the same degree of commitment was not
experienced in some areas at lower level management and the Legislative Power. Thus,
the failure to implement some of the reforms cannot be fully credited to the borrower.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
76.     As the program champion, Sefaz showed strong commitment to achieve the
development objectives and played a good role in coordinating the program
implementation with all secretariats involved. It has also coordinated the data gathering
task for supervision missions.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
77.    The borrower as well as the implementing agency showed commitment to the
reforms proposed as well as supported timely implementation of the loan. No fiduciary


                                            15
issues arose in the course of this operation. Minor shortcomings were faced on
monitoring and evaluation arrangements as well as on borrower ownership, thus
justifying the overall satisfactory rating.
6. Lessons Learned
78.     The first lesson highlights the importance of the debt restructuring operation
among the fiscal consolidation measures behind the fiscal turnaround in RS. The
restructuring not only saved budgetary resources, but was also key to smoothing the debt
service profile in 2009 and 2010 – at a time when the global economic crisis increased
uncertainty and rollover risks worldwide. The improved profile also facilitated the task of
budget planning. The debt restructuring was thus of paramount significance to the state
and spurred a new demand from subnational clients willing to engage in fiscal
consolidation operations with debt restructuring components with the Bank.
79.     Another important lesson regards the value of flexibility from the Bank side.
Since this DPL was the first debt restructuring operation carried out in Brazil after the
FRL and the debt renegotiation law, the Bank had to be very flexible to structure the
repayment profile to the needs of the client and the guarantor. In this sense, Bank
Treasury innovated by allowing for monthly repayments which was key to secure the
federal government’s approval to the operation.
80.     A political economy lesson can also be drawn. The loan supported reforms aimed
at addressing structural fiscal imbalances. However, undertaking such reforms requires
strong social coalitions. These coalitions in turn take a relatively long time to build while
the DPL instrument is short-lived. In this sense, the DPL merit was at least to help build
the needed coalition by bringing up the issue. The submission of a new draft law on
pension reform by the new Government is suggestive that this DPL may have contributed
to building a consensus around this issue.
81.     Finally, the timing of the loan suited very well the state’s needs. Firstly, because it
avoided the spikes in the debt service. Secondly, because the first tranche was released
just before the outburst of the economic crisis which cushioned the state budget.
