                                       RESTRUCTING PAPER


SUMMARY

The proposed changes include: (a) to add new activities and reallocate the corresponding
credit proceeds from the unallocated category (US$ 4.2 million equivalent); (b) to extend
by 12 months the closing date from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011; and (c) to revise and
fine-tune the results framework.

The proposed restructuring will help complete ongoing activities and implement new
activities, which are critical for the attainment of the project development objective and
for the preparation phase of the new Health III project, which is planned for Board
approval on March 15, 2011.

PROJECT STATUS

The Project suffered from delays particularly during the first two years of project
implementation (CY2005-2006); however, there has been noteworthy progress in the past
year, thanks to the new leadership at the Ministry of Health. As of April 2010,
disbursement of the IDA Credit 3979-UZ has reached 63 percent (commitment is
estimated at US$5.0 million equivalent1, or 12% of the total credit), compared to 42
percent in March 2009. Likewise, the IDA Grant (H1240-UZ) has disbursed 75.5
percent, and all remaining funds are committed.

Since July 2009, the project has significantly picked up as improvements have been
observed in the implementation of components' activities as well as in procurement and
financial management. More specifically, significant progress has been made in
equipping the primary care centers (SVPs) rehabilitated with assistance of local
governments and in retraining medical personnel on general practice. Furthermore, the
state allocations to Primary Health Care (PHC) have improved resulting in increased
remuneration of health providers and greater motivation in the provision of quality health
care.

There has been notable progress in procurement of major goods and services since no
contracts have been delayed due to the protracted period for contract registration with the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and International Trade (MFERIT), which had
caused significant delays in procurement. This is a country issue and not project-specific,
and its resolution remains to be a critical factor to ensuring successful implementation of
the project. Financial management is rated moderately satisfactory according to a recent
assessment, including accounting and reporting, counterpart funding, external audit, and
organization and staffing. The Project's IP is upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory given
the above mentioned implementation progress.

However, given the lack of updated data on the Project Development Objectives (PDO)
indicators, the PDO rating remains as Moderately Unsatisfactory until progress on the
key performance indicators (KPIs) are confirmed. The recently recruited Monitoring and
Evaluation specialist will focus his time on data collection and validation accordingly.
This effort is expected to be completed by end-May 2010.

A detailed Action Plan on streamlining procurement as well as improving the fiduciary
management and addressing lack of data on project monitoring have recently been
developed and agreed with counterpart.

PROPOSED CHANGES

      Results/indicators.   Although the Project Development Objective remains
       unchanged, a review of the results framework for the Project during the mid-term
       review in 2007 indicated the need for modifying project monitoring indicators to
       improve their measurability and their linkage to project specific investments.
       Baselines and targets were then established and tools to track progress identified.
       Monitoring of progress of the revised indicators was also launched at the same
       time. However, a formal written agreement with the Borrower on the revised
       indicators was deferred until a decision was made on new activities that could be
       financed from the unallocated category. Revised indicators were fine-tuned in
       February 2010 and finally agreed upon by the MoH by letter of March 2, 2010.
       Annex 1 presents the revised Results Framework and Monitoring for the project.
       The selection of the M&E specialist mentioned-above, will enable the Joint
       Project Implementation Bureau (JPIB) to inform on the progress of the Key
       Performance Indicators (KPIs) on a regular basis.

       The following additional output indicators are proposed for the new activities
       mentioned below:
       a. 100 percent of SVPs in pilot oblasts will be staffed with specialists trained on
          the new medical equipment maintenance system;
       b. 4 percent of SVPs and 100 percent of central polyclinics will be equipped
          with modern dental equipment; and

      Components. New activities that will affect the results framework and require a
       reallocation from the unallocated category (US$4.2 million equivalent) are as
       follows:

       Component 1: Primary Health Care Development. The new activities would
       include (a) the provision of dental equipment (estimated at US$3.15 million
       equivalent) for dental cabinets of Primary Care Centers (Selski Vratch Punckt,
       SVPs) and of rayon and oblast polyclinics where there are the greatest demand on
       dental care; and (b) technical assistance (estimated at US$0.35 million equivalent)
       for the development of a medical equipment maintenance system for SVPs. This
       aim at increasing the current and long term sustainability of investments made
       under the Project on medical equipment in the SVPs, and on office equipment and
       vehicles. The development of an efficient system for equipment maintenance and
       repairs is a condition of effectiveness for the Health III project.
                                            6
        Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. The project
        would finance technical assistance (estimated at US$0.7 million) to assist the
        Ministry of Health in the preparation of the follow up operation. The Board
        approval for the said operation is planned for March 15, 2011.

     Closing date

A first time one-year extension of the project closing date from June 30, 2010 to June
30, 2011, is necessary to allow for the completion of ongoing activities and the
implementation of the new proposed activities according to the agreed
implementation schedule. Since July 2009, the new leadership in the Ministry of
Health has demonstrated commitments to accelerating project implementation and to
launch preparatory activities for the Health III operation.

   Implementation schedule

    A detailed implementation schedule and a procurement plan have been developed
    by the MoH for the completion of ongoing activities as well as for those new
    activities to be implemented until the one-year extension period. The plan has
    been reviewed by the Bank team and agreed with the MoH.

   The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) of August 5, 2004, (Report No. 28485-UZ) does not make a clear distinction between Project Outcome Indicator and
 Intermediate Result Indicator. The indicators categorization confuses both types in many cases. Furthermore, there are no baseline and target data for most original
 indicators. The outcome indicators that are being dropped are taken from those listed in Section A.2 (page 4) of the PAD.

   Project's KPIs agreed at mid-term review (November 2008), were monitored, but never formally revised. Data for Years 1-5 are actual values, when available, for
 each year of project implementation. Year 6 represents revised End-of-Project Target Value (June 30, 2011).

   Annex 1 of the PAD lists 42 output indicators, which are not explicitly linked to the Project's PDOs. The revised Result Matrix proposes a smaller number of
 revised and new intermediate results indicators for each component. These are also better linked to the Project's PDOs. Accordingly, Component 1has 6 intermediate
 results indicators as compared to 16 in the PAD; Component 2 has 4 intermediate results indicators as compared to 6 in the PAD; Component 3 has 5 intermediate
 results indicators as compared to 8 in the PAD; and Component 4 has 3 intermediate results indicators as compared to 12 in the PAD.
