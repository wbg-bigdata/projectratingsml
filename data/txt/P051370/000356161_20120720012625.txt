Andijon, Djizzak, Ferghana, Navoiy, and Syr Darya) and other regions as agreed, and
institutionalization of general practitioners nationally;

                                                      ii
  (b) extending financing and management reforms related to efficiency and effectiveness of service
delivery;

  (c) improving public health services, including surveillance, training in public health and control of
communicable disease; and,

  Annex 1 of the PAD (attached to this ICR as Annex 11) lists 42 indicators, not all explicitly linked to the PDOs. However,
per ICR Team findings only 4 Intermediate indicators have been monitored and regularly updated prior to Mid Term Review
in October 31, 2007 when new Results Framework was agreed upon with the Government and results monitored and updated.
Due to lengthy Government administrative procedures, the request for restructuring was delayed and this Results Framework
has been formally revised during Restructuring on June 22, 2010.

1.     The Health 2 Project was approved on September 9, 2004. The Development Financing
Agreement was signed on October 3, 2004 and became effective on December 20, 2004. The Project was
the second health supported project to Uzbekistan by the International Development Association (IDA).
The Project continued Bank‟s support to the next stage of Government‟s health sector reform program
initiated by Health 14. It was co-financed by an IDA Grant aimed at supporting the HIV/AIDS prevention
and care. The Grant was also signed on October 3, 2004 and became effective on December 20, 2004.

       1.1 Context at Appraisal5,6

2.    Uzbekistan’s transition experience was somewhat unique among former Soviet countries in
that it experienced a milder and less protracted recession relative to many of its neighbors. Output
declined in the early 1990s, but was still 81 percent of its 1991 level by 1995. In 2001, Uzbekistan‟s Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, at the official exchange rate, was $552. In real terms, per capita GDP
in US dollars was 84 percent of per capita GDP in 1990. Most of the population (63 percent) lived in rural
areas, and most of the poor were found in rural regions. Since 1995, the economy has been growing at
about 4 percent annually, according to official statistics. Yet, living standards appear to have stagnated.

3.     At the time of Appraisal, approximately 28 percent of the population lived below the poverty
line, and a third of them could have been considered extremely poor. Some regions were particularly
worse off. Access to basic public services and utilities, such as water and sewerage, was low, particularly
in the rural areas and for the poorer strata of the population. Despite a historical legacy of relatively
favorable human capital outcomes, these non-income dimensions of poverty were under stress and there
was evidence of serious disparities between regions, and income groups. Large segments of the population
were vulnerable to risks from loss of income, natural disasters, and ill health and employed
counterproductive coping strategies. Many, but especially the poor, were negatively affected by corruption
and informal payments, including payments for social services.

4.     Uzbekistan suffered from a double burden of disease, with both communicable diseases (CD) re-
emerging, particularly with the post-Soviet transition, and non-communicable diseases (NCD) typical to
developed countries. Despite improving vaccination coverage against tuberculosis (TB), pertussis,
measles, diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis remained a major problem. Acute respiratory infections
among children remained the primary cause of death and morbidity leading to several outbreaks of
infectious diseases, including TB, diphtheria, viral hepatitis, and typhoid.

5.   Although the Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS)
epidemic was in the early stages in Uzbekistan, there were signs of quick spread of infection, especially
among young people as the number of cases doubled in less than one year in 2003.

6.    NCDs, ischemic heart disease, chronic digestive system and chronic liver disorders showed
increasing trends, exceeding EU and Central Asia Republic (CAR) rates. This could have been attributed
to poor diet, tobacco and alcohol consumption and sedentary lifestyles.

7.    Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) indicators such as infant mortality (IM), under 5 (U5)
years mortality, and maternal mortality (MM) were high. IM was among the highest of the former
Soviet republics. Although below the Central Asia Republics (CAR) average, the country had 22 infant
deaths per 1,000 live births in 1998 and 19 in 2000 according to official data. However, the Demographic
and Health Survey (DHS, 1996) placed IM much higher - at 44 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1996.
The U5 was 55 per 1,000 live births in 1996. The overall trends for MM were similar, although differing
widely between different geographical regions and between rural and urban areas. For example, a rate of
over 90 was reported for Navoi in 2000. Excessive rates of MM were generally associated with lower
income areas of the country.

8.     Even though significant improvements have been achieved in three pilot oblasts (Fergana,
Navoi and Syr Daria) through the Health 1 Project, the Quality of Primary Health Care (PHC)
nationwide was poor, especially in rural areas. The PHC facilities were scarce, underequipped and
understaffed thus resulting in high referrals to secondary level. Limited medical skills and diagnostic back-
up along with the shortages of drugs and evidence based approaches to diagnostics and treatment remained
a challenge. The continuation of the reforms initiated by the Government Strategy from 1996 called for
new and rehabilitated PHC facilities and rationalization of the health network, which originally contained
four levels of care: PHC centers (SVPs or Selski Vratch Punkt in Russian), feldsher or obstetrics posts
(FAPs or Feldshersko-Akusherski Punkt in Russian), rural outpatient clinics (SVAs or Selskaya
Vrachebnaya Ambulatoriya in Russian), central rayon/district hospitals (CRH) and regional hospitals.
Continuous Medical Education (CME) and general practitioner (GP) training had been piloted and
financed through the IDA-supported Health 1 Project (SCL-43960, which closed on December 31, 2004)
and the United Kingdom Department for International Development (UK DfID). The outcome of this
training was successful and led to a clear need for its institutionalization.

9.     During the transition period the health care system in Uzbekistan had been moving from
central planning and Government financing to a mixed public and out-of-pocket payments system.
There was a growing public-private mix as well. The old Soviet system was characterized by too many
facilities, too many staff, and an imbalance between hospital-based specialized care versus more cost-
effective primary care. The 1996 National Strategy established the basis for a progression towards primary
health care (PHC). The reforms aimed at reducing several tiers of health facilities into a flatter two level
structure. Furthermore, issues such as the unequal distribution of physicians, with over an 8-fold difference
between urban and rural areas, remained a challenge.

10. PHC was retained by the public sector and remained free of charge except for
pharmaceuticals. Key management and financing reforms piloted through the Health 1 project were to be
replicated, including legal independence, greater financial and organizational autonomy at all levels,
incentive-based financing, and closure of redundant facilities. Limited medical skills and diagnostic back-
up in the remaining eight regions of the country, particularly in rural areas, shortages of drugs, and the
need to more fully introduce evidence-based approaches to diagnosis and treatment remained a challenge.
With the experience from the pilot areas achieved through the Health 1 Project, the MoH was committed to
extending the reforms to the rest of the country, i.e. another nine oblasts. The MoH further wanted urban
primary care models to be developed as the next step of reforms to ensure universal access to health care
through the services of a general practitioner (GP).



                                                     2
11. The set of reforms, supported by the Health 1 project, had encouraged efficiency. Patients
shifted to lower cost services on an outpatient basis as the reforms also helped orient facilities towards
local needs and improve accountability. In the pilots supported by the Health 1 project, relative funding for
recurrent expenditures such as pharmaceuticals and supplies had increased, while referrals and staff inputs
per capita have decreased by 5-15 percent depending upon the region. Hundreds of facilities were closed
as well. Nevertheless, staffing was unequally distributed, and budgetary inputs in some regions were
skewed towards hospital-based care.

12. A 10-month retraining program for SVP doctors in pilot areas supported under the Health 1
project had been a widely acknowledged success and apparently upgraded skills have led to a
reduced rate of referrals and better patient satisfaction. The training was financed through close
collaboration between the Bank and the UK Department for International Development (DfID) grant
funding for technical assistance (TA) and training. National replication required expanding the number of
clinical training centers to meet the demand for practical training, as well as expanding the number of
trained trainers, and supportive agreements between the training institutes and authorities towards
institutionalization of trainings. Incorporating the Family Medicine (FM) curricula into graduate studies
and establishing FM specialization remained a challenge.


1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

13. The project Development Objective was to improve the quality and overall cost-effectiveness of
health care services in Uzbekistan. This was to be achieved through:

(a)   completion of the PHC program in 8 regions (Samarkand, Sukhandarya, Namangan, Andijon,
Djizzak, Ferghana, Navoi, and Syr Darya) and other regions as agreed, and institutionalization of GP
nationally;

(b) extending financing and management reforms related to efficiency and effectiveness of service
delivery; and

(c) improving public health services, including surveillance, training in public health and control of
communicable disease; and, (d) building capacity in the Ministry of Health (MoH) to better monitor and
evaluate the reforms, and better manage the restructuring process.

14. The achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the following performance indicators as
identified in the main text of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD, Report No. 28485-UZ) and
Supplemental letter No. 2 of the Minutes of Negotiations:

Component 1
   Increase number of pregnant women covered by prenatal care by 10 percent;
   Increase number of newborns who receive hepatitis B immunization by 10 percent;
   Increase primary health care utilization and access by 10 percent;
   Training of 2,700 GPs who work in SVPs; and
   Increase availability of essential pharmaceuticals at the PHC level as measured by number of
     essential drugs stocked.




                                                     3
Component 2
   Decrease hospital referrals and admissions by 10 percent;
   Training of 520 health policy experts and financial managers;
   Recurrent expenditures for PHC is at least 20 percent of total public expenditures for health; and
   Share of expenditures for primary and outpatient care at least 40 percent.
Component 3
   100 percent pregnant women have access to HIV testing and have access to Mother-to-Child
     treatment (MTCT) prevention;
   Increase of coverage of groups at risk by HIV prevention activities by 10 percent;
   Adoption of a National Strategic Plan and scaling-up Directly Observed Treatment Strategy
     (DOTS) throughout the country;
   Training of at least 50 public health specialists and public health nurses; and
   Number of community-based grant projects implemented.
Component 4
   M&E system established with a minimum of 2 facility surveys and 2 household surveys.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

15.   The PDOs were not revised.

16. Although attempts were made to fine-tune the indicators throughout the life of the project, none
were formally revised prior to the formal restructuring of June 2010. Some of the PDO Indicators and
Intermediate Outcome Indicators were modified and/or dropped due to data unavailability during
implementation.

17. The final Results Framework was developed and agreed with ECA Quality during the Mid-Term
Review on October 31, 2007, but was only formally revised at the restructuring in June 22, 2010 (see para.
45 and Table 4) as shown in the amended Supplemental letter No. 2 of the Amendment to the
Development Financing Agreement. The revised indicators were:

Component 1
   Increase number of pregnant women who receive antenatal care in the early stage of pregnancy (up
      to 12-week pregnancy period) by 10 percent;
   Number of visits to PHC facilities (SVPs, FAPs) per capita of rural population; and
   Increase availability of essential pharmaceuticals for emergency care in SVPs
Component 2
   Decrease hospitalization rate among rural population;
   Decrease percent of patients referred from SVP to hospitals
   Convert urban pilot PHC facilities to per capita financing and management system in pilot areas;
   Convert rural PHC facilities to per capita financing and management system; and
   Share of expenditures for primary and outpatient care at least 40 percent;
Component 3
   Increase percent of target groups provided with Iron supplementation (in Bukhara, Navoi,
      Samarkand and Tashkent oblasts).
Component 4
   None

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

18.      Direct beneficiaries of the project investments were the following:

      a) communities benefiting from scaling up of the PHC development program. The project effectively
targeted poor individuals and households as improvement of PHC services in rural areas was the principal
way of providing basic services to poor and vulnerable households. Moreover, women and children who
use PHC facilities to a greater extent, benefited particularly from improved access.

      b) better equipped and staffed PHC facilities and functional integration in the treatment of priority
health problems helped patient flows towards appropriate levels of care, adding indirect benefits including
reduced travel time for patients, improved social welfare and productivity of the population.

      c) family physicians (FP), nurses and managers benefiting from re-training and introduction and
establishment of the FM specialization.

      d) improved management of the pharmaceutical sector supply chain helped to serve the end-users of
drugs and reduced frustration in health workers.

1.5 Original Components

         The Project had the following four components7:


19. Component 1. Development of the primary healthcare sector (US$ 98.1 million or 83.1 percent
of total project costs) was to support: (a) construction and provision of equipment, technical
telecommunications and vehicles to SVPs not covered by the Health 1 project; (b) improved provision and
use of basic medications and preparations in the SVPs; (c) development and implementation of the
experimental urban PHC model, including provision of medical and laboratory equipment, training and
consultancy; (d) strengthening the GPs training program, including provision of equipment for the three
new clinical training centers and clinical laboratories, conducting training, study visits and provision of
consultancy services; and (e) the creation and operation of the Evidence Based Medicine Centre and
Centre for Continuous Medical Education, including provision of equipment, library materials, training
and consultancy services.

20. Component 2. Financing and management reforms (US$ 5.4 million or 4.6 percent of total
project costs). The component was to support: (a) the nationwide implementation of rural PHC sector
financing and management reforms, including provision of computer equipment, training and consultancy
services; (b) piloting reforms of financing and management in the urban primary healthcare sector,
including provision of computer equipment, training and consultancy services; (c) implementation of
provider payment and management reforms and rationalization of secondary healthcare services through
provision of computer equipment, training and consultancy services; and (d) strengthening the
management capacity of the health sector management through provision of equipment, training materials
and consultancy services.

    Allocations by component changed during project implementation. See Annex 1 of this ICR



                                                               5
21. Component 3. Improvement of public health services (US$7.51 million or 6.4 percent of total
project costs) was to support: (a) the further development and improvement of the national public health
strategy; (b) strengthening the Public Health School; (c) expanding the scope of the programs for
promotion of healthy lifestyles and sanitary education; and strengthening first aid and nutrition programs
amongst the local population; (d) modernization and strengthening of the public health infrastructure
through provision of training, consultancy services, computer equipment and re-equipping several
sanitary-epidemiology laboratories; (e)the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and the National TB Strategy,
including provision of equipment, training and consultancy services.

22. Component 4. Project management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation (US$2.9 million
or 2.5 percent of total project costs). The component was to support: (a) planning procurement activities in
accordance with the project‟s objectives; (b) conducting procurement and implementing financial controls
over rational use of the project‟s funds; (c) training of Joint Project Implementation Bureau (JPIB) staff;
(d) provision of consultancy services (including audit services); (e) strengthening the JPIB‟s and Oblast
Project Implementation Bureau‟s (OPIB) capacity for implementing project activities; and (f) monitoring
and evaluation of the project‟s results.

1.6   Revised Components

23. Per Government‟s request during the restructuring in June 2010, Component 1 was revised to
include the following additional activities: provision of dental equipment and creation of a system for
maintenance of medical equipment at PHC institutions.

1.7.1 Other significant changes

      There were two amendments to the Development Financing Agreement:

24. The first amendment, letter of May 14, 2010, countersigned on June 22, 2010, included
reallocation of funds and extension of the closing date (see below). Unallocated funds in the amount of
US$ 4.178 million were reallocated for: (a) procurement of dental equipment for dental cabinets of PHC
Centers and of rayon and oblast polyclinics with the greatest demand for dental care; (b) technical
assistance for development of a medical equipment maintenance and repair system for SVPs; (c) revision
and fine-tuning of the results framework to better monitor and report on project progress, and (d) TA for
support of Health 3 project preparation. The Government‟s decision to allocate US$ 698,000 of the Credit
proceeds for the preparation and design of the Health 3 project enabled the launching of preparation
activities for the Health 3 project.

25. The second amendment, letter of June 11, 2011 related to: (i) a reallocation of funds to include
procurement of information technology equipment and software to strengthen the Management
Information System (MIS) in MoH; and (ii) a second extension of the closing date (see below).

26.   The closing date of the Credit and the Grant were extended twice for a total of 18 months.

27. The first extension (amendment letter of May 14, 2010) was for 12 months (from the original date
of June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011) and was part of the first amendment of the Development Financing
Agreement (June 22, 2010). The extension of the closing date was required to allow for the
implementation of the remaining and newly introduced activities.

28. The second extension (amendment letter of June 8, 2011) was for six months (from June 30, 2011
to December 31, 2011). The second and final extension allowed for the effective completion of

                                                     6
procurement, delivery, installation, configuration and testing of the computer hardware and software for
oblast, city and rayon IT centers, IT equipment for MoH, sanitary and epidemiological centers,
dermatovenerological centers, as well as training specialists from IT centers on database management.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

29. The ICR team rates Design and Quality at Entry as Moderately Satisfactory on the basis of the
following features:

30. Assessment of Project design. The technical design of the first two components reflected the
Government's own policy model stemming from the 1996 Rural Social Infrastructure Initiative. It had
been piloted and refined through the Health 1 project. Over a dozen technical work groups reviewed its
experience and impacts, and developed refinements for Health 2. Development of PHC and financing and
management reforms initiated and piloted by Health 1 continued in Health 2, while Component 3 (Public
Health) included the application in the specific conditions of Uzbekistan of well proven health strategies
such as the DOTS and other interventions to contain TB and HIV/AIDS epidemics, as well as nutrition
interventions. The design was appropriate to the health sector's needs and consistent with the country's
development strategy to implement programs for poverty alleviation. The Project did not have a Quality at
Entry Review (QER).

31. Project preparation activities were supported by the Japanese-funded PHRD grants TF-54236 and
TF-54237. The project objectives, scope and institutional arrangements were appropriate. The
project design incorporated the main lessons of Health 1 on policy, sustainability and implementation
capacity issues. Furthermore, as the Health 1 had been implemented in very close collaboration and with
TA from USAID, the design of Health 2 envisioned the same level of TA to be provided by USAID8. The
project aimed to build institutional capacity in the areas of public health and pharmaceuticals. It was
designed in close collaboration with a complementary project financed by the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), which aimed at strengthening primary health care, especially maternity and child services and
blood safety to complement activities under the IDA-supported Health 2 Project. From the point view of
the ICR team, the Government‟s decision to have the Joint Project Implementation Bureau (JPIB)
coordinate the implementation of both projects was appropriate and led to more efficient use of funds,
better planning and synchronization of activities. In addition, the efforts to plan and carry-out joint
supervision missions are commendable and led to synchronization of activities and efficient use of funds.

32. Lessons learned. As stated above, the project design incorporated lessons from the implementation
of the Health 1 project. While the project design duly identified many areas needing improvement in the
health system of the country, the ICR team finds that given the institutional constraints, the design was
overly ambitious. The design was comprehensive, addressing multiple reforms, and introducing numerous
changes in the health sector, covering a large area of the system. The limited institutional capacity in the
country in general and in the health sector in particular, was in fact duly recognized in the PAD.




8
  However, this assistance did not materialize due to the USAID‟s activities being pared down very early in the life of Health 2
(2006) due to registration issues with the Government of Uzbekistan. This could have not been envisaged during the project
preparation. Similarly, it was not possible to foresee whether reduction of USAIDs activities would be temporary or permanent.


                                                               7
33. Furthermore, the ICR Team notes that putting project proceeds and in-kind Government contribution
under the same category of expenses (therefore subject to auditing), led to problems since it imposed
auditing of the overall State annual budget. Auditing of the State annual budget was unacceptable for the
Government and caused repeated issues with audit performance and acceptance of audit reports.

34. Risk assessment. The PAD identified four risks from outputs to objective and two risks from
components to outputs, ranking from Modest to High. Substantially, the assessment of risks related to: (i)
weak institutional capacity, and (ii) insufficient political will to right-size health care services in terms of
number and quality of health care providers (having new GPs and nurses trained), number of beds in the
facilities, and the size of the health facilities. Capacity in project management was rated as Modest in
relation to procurement, given the experience from the previous project. As explained elsewhere in this
ICR, in time, capacity in the JPIB increased in both quality and quantity as complexity of activities
increased. However, capacity oscillated over the life of the project as JPIB leadership changed three times.
Likewise, during the first two years of implementation, from September 2004 until December 2006, as
well as from July 2009 to April 2010, JPIB was without an M&E specialist9, thus unable to monitor
progress against key performance indicators. Similarly, inflexibility of legislation and state procedures,
especially related to procurement and lengthy administrative procedures led to delays in project
implementation and monitoring. The complex government procedures caused significant delays in the
amendment of the Results Framework after the Mid Term Review (MTR) of October 2007. In fact, the
Bank received a formal request from the Government for restructuring only in June 2009 with an actual
restructuring that only materialized in June2010 due to additional Government requests related to
extension (see para. 45 and Table 4).


2.2      Implementation

35. The ICR Team rates implementation as Moderately Satisfactory. It has to be noted that the
project was implemented in a very challenging environment burdened by a rigid and robust bureaucracy
and punitive system. While the Project was successful in delivering most of the outputs under the four
components (see Annex 2), there were delays that made the extension of the closing date by 18 months
necessary. The Project was successful in achieving or substantially achieving all but one PDO indicator
and almost all intermediate indicators, over-achieving several of them (see details in Tables 6-9, Annex 2,
Section 3.2, and data sheet). Throughout its life, the Project went through oscillations, being rated
Moderately Satisfactory or Moderately Unsatisfactory in terms of both PDO and implementation progress
(IP). The first downgrading to Moderately Unsatisfactory rating was documented: (i) between November
2005 and June 2007 due to absence of implementation progress caused by the slow and rigid procedures
impacting procurement and absence of M&E10 ; and (ii) between October 2009 and June 2010 due to the
JPIB being left without an M&E specialist from July 2009 to April 2010, thus unable to monitor and
document implementation progress11.

36. Some delays in implementation are discussed in paras. 38-40. Delays with procurement greatly
affected implementation at various stages. The most crucial procurement delays were due to reasons

beyond the control of the project or even the health sector, such as the required price verification imposed
by the Government after contract signing.

37. The Mid-Term Review took place from October 31 to November 5, 2007 and identified several
issues:

        a) Implementation of planned activities and progress towards meeting the project development
           objectives were on track;
        b) US$10.8 million were un-programmed, coming from US$6.6 million savings from earlier
           procurements and US$4.2 million unallocated from the beginning of the project. Together
           with the Government, the Bank team re-appraised and re-costed the project adding additional
           activities, maintenance of medical equipment and supplying dental equipment to SVPs;
        c) Need for refinement of Results Framework (RF) was identified in order to better reflect the
           progress towards achievement of development objectives and include newly added activities.
           New RF was developed and agreed with ECA Quality and applied as a monitoring tool; and
        d) Need for a first one-year extension of the closing date along with the refinement of the RF
           called for Vice President level restructuring and appropriate steps were undertaken.


38.   Several other factors affected implementation progress, both in positive and negative ways.


Positive factors and events that influenced project achievements

39. The Project has contributed to the successful implementation of the Government of
Uzbekistan’s Strategy on Development of PHC. Implementation of GP and PHC reforms in the
country has been successful. With support from the Project, the transition phase of moving the PHC
system from the previous system to SVP accelerated substantially. By the closing date, utilization rate of
PHC increased considerably, from 3.8 to 4.7 visits to SVPs per capita. The Project successfully supported
Government‟s efforts to accelerate the pace of health reforms in general and most specifically of SVPs,
particularly to: (i) expand the retraining and institutionalize GP training for physicians (complemented by
retraining and institutionalization of nurses training under ADB financed WHCD Project); (ii) broaden the
role of GPs and the scope of services they deliver; (iii) improve access, performance, quality, and provide
additional health promotion, prevention and extended PHC services; (iv) reinforce the gate keeping
function of SVPs with GP acting as the first point of contact for patients (see Table 1); (v) build the
financial management capacity through trainings and appointment of financial managers in SVPs; and (vi)
strengthen the SVP infrastructure, through civil works, and provision of medical equipment, supplies, and
vehicles (see Tables 2 and 3).

40. Changes in overall management of the sector and the Project positively influenced the
performance of the Project. At the initial stage of the Project, it was closely supervised by the MoF
while MoH had limited ownership and influence. JPIB had technical leadership, but was managed very
poorly. Initially, the JPIB Director was appointed by the MoF without MoHs influence. The overall
situation progressively improved through changes in JPIB leadership (JPIB Director changed three times
over the life of Project and Curator of the Project changed once). There were only two Ministers of Health
during project implementation. Initial problems with the management of the project by the MoH were
gradually solved with the change of “Curator? (Deputy Minister of Health in charge of the Project) in
2005, appointment of respective Heads of different departments in MoH, who became in charge for
corresponding Project components and sub-components and finally the new Minister in 2009. Gradually,
MoH demonstrated increased capacity, strong commitment to the Project with an increased sense of

                                                     9
project ownership. This resulted in notable progress in the completion of planned activities leading
towards achieving and overachieving project objectives.

41. The Project played an important role in strengthening the Public Health Sector by: (i)
developing and strengthening the institutional capacity through the establishment of the School of Public
Health; (ii) supporting a number of important national public health initiatives such as the development
and implementation of the Public Health Strategy 2008-2020, National Health Promotion Plan, and the
Republic of Uzbekistan Law “On Restriction of distribution and consumption of alcohol and
tobacco products?; (iii) introducing Iron Supplementation Program in four regions; (iv) enabling training
of health professionals on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment; (v) improving the Sanitary and
Epidemiological Services (SES) Laboratories Network; and (vi) developing an Information System for
Epidemiological Monitoring of infectious diseases.

42 The Project used both financial and human capacities efficiently and managed to keep the
momentum by preparing a new operation during implementation of Health 2. Per Government‟s
request, the Health 3 Project was included in the CAS 2008-201112. Right after receiving a request for a
new operation from the Government on September 3, 2008, the Bank team advised the Government that
PHRD grants for project preparation were no longer available, therefore the Government needed to make a
decision on whether to use a portion of unallocated funds from Health 2 or state resources for international
and local TA needed for preparation. It took several months, i.e. from September 2008 to June 2009 for the
Government to make the decision to use unallocated Health 2 funds for preparation of the new operation.
Nevertheless, preparation was successful and timely. Health 3 was approved by the World Bank Board of
Directors in April 2011.

Less effective factors and events which influenced project achievements

43. Insufficient capacity and poor JPIB leadership and staffing in the earlier stages of the Project
had a negative impact on project implementation. Changes of JPIB Directors (3 over the life of project),
staffing problems, especially in Procurement and M&E (Project was with understaffed Procurement and
without M&E unit during its first year of implementation and without an M&E Specialist for almost full
year in 2009) reflected on the project performance, including M&E as reflected in the ISRs13 and Aide
Memoires. Staffing problems were gradually resolved by new hires and intensive training of both newly

recruited and existing staff. Towards the second half of project implementation, the JPIB became a highly
competent and professional unit, which resulted in continuous and significant progress during the last
years of implementation, as well as achievement of project development objectives.

44. Inflexible legislation, especially regarding procurement significantly delayed project activities
during the first two years. The Uzbek practice (according to country legislation) of lengthy (four months
or more) price verifications, comparisons and negotiations after contracts are signed greatly affected
implementation. The same issues had also affected implementation of Health 1 project, other Bank-
financed project, and other internationally-financed projects. The JPIB staff found themselves having to
choose between adhering to local procurement rules and risk mis-procurement and cancellation of credit
funds by the Bank or following Bank procurement guidelines and facing local prosecution14. Frequent on-
site revisions of fiduciary and management processes by the Uzbek authorities contributed to JPIB's
passive management style for fear of reprimand. These issues were resolved by the signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding between the Bank and the Government to allow for Bank procurement
guidelines to be followed, but not before the third year of project implementation, thus affecting timely
completion of planned activities.

45. Lengthy and complex Government’s administrative procedures led to delays in restructuring
thus affecting project implementation. Even though the need to restructure the Project to refine the RF,
reallocate unallocated and saved proceeds, and extend the closing date was addressed during the Mid-Term
Review in October 2007, the actual restructuring took place only in June 2010 because, inter alia, of
numerous delays by the Government to make and confirm a decision on the use of unallocated funds. Even
though the refined RF agreed by the Government and the Bank and reviewed by ECA Quality was adopted
as a monitoring tool during the Mid-Term Review, it was only formalized two and a half years later. Table
4 shows the chronological order of events leading to the restructuring.

March 2008               MoH sent the Letter expressing the need for restructuring in order to reallocate project proceeds to the
                         Prime Minister and the MoF.
September 3, 2008        The Bank received Government‟s Request for a new Health 3 Project.
June 2009                The Bank received formal Request for Reallocation Letter from MoF (delay caused by lengthy
                         discussions within the Government on the use of unallocated/saved funds for procurement of dental
                         equipment for SVPs and TA for preparation of the Health 3 project) and proposed amendments to
                         Development Financing Agreement. The letter did not include the Request for extension of Closing
                         Date. The Bank team initiated restructuring immediately upon receiving the Request.
October 6, 2009          The Bank team pointed out to MoH of the need for extension of Closing Date in order for the Project
                         to complete all planned activities and advised the Government to send the request for for a one-year
                         extension to be processed together with restructuring
December 15, 2009        The Bank received Request for extension from the Government. However, discussions on refinement
                         of the Results Framework continued during following months.
May 14, 2010             The Bank sent Letter of notification regarding restructuring and extension of the Project up to June
                         30, 2011including Supplemental letter No. 2 of the Amendment to the Development Financing

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

46. Design, implementation, and utilization of M&E are rated Moderately Satisfactory for reasons
elaborated below.

47. Design. The PAD defined a rather comprehensive set of PDO and intermediate outcome indicators,
which reflected well the PDO and project components. As the reform progressed some of the indicators
became less relevant and introducing new activities created the need to make changes to better reflect the
new situation. A new RF comprising of 9 PDO and 18 intermediate outcome indicators was introduced in
agreement between the Government and the Bank after the Mid-Term Review. The new RF became the
monitoring tool until the end of the Project, even though the RF was only formally revised during the
restructuring of June 2010.

48. Implementation was a weak link at the beginning of the project. As indicated earlier, the M&E
Unit in the JPIB, who was responsible for this activity, was both understaffed and undertrained15. This led
to difficulties in defining baselines for some indicators and preparing monitoring progress reports. This
issue was addressed and overcome through hiring and training of staff, but got worsened when JPIB was
left without an M&E Specialist in July 2009 for nine months, resulting in the downgrading of the Project
to Moderately Unsatisfactory due to monitoring not being possible16. A new staff was hired in April 2010
and significant improvement has been noted since.

49. Utilization. M&E was used under the Project as a management tool to evaluate the status of
implementation of activities. In addition, it was used to inform policy makers for decision-making
purposes and help prioritize activities to support the reform agenda. The PDO indicators of the Project
have been integrated into the Government‟s Official Monitoring Agenda and are being monitored even to
date, which demonstrates their relevance in measuring the performance of the health sector.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

50. The environmental impact of the Project at the time of preparation was rated C. Originally,
the Project focus was on developing systems and structures, the supply of equipment and minor
rehabilitation. No civil works were planned to be financed under the Credit. However, over the life of the
Project, the Government‟s originally planned contributions to civil works multiplied almost nine times and
were aimed towards reconstruction and construction of existing and new SVPs (see Table 2)17.

51. The PAD Review conducted in December 2008 found that the project was assigned the
Environmental Category C based on the prevailing practice and OPCS guidance at the time that projects
involving only small scale construction with no special risk aspects (for example, no sensitive sites, no
land acquisition) should be classified as Category C. While more recently, all projects involving new
construction are classified as Category B to ensure the preparation of at least a simple Environmental
Management Plan, the practice adopted for the PAD review at that time was that Category C projects
would only be upgraded to Category B if either: (i) there were environmental or social issues raised by
construction undertaken up to the time of the Review; or (ii) further new construction was planned under
the project in the future. Neither of these circumstances applied to this project.

52. The Health 2 Project was built on the accomplishments of the Health I project by providing
additional support for the restructuring of primary care and outpatient services in rural areas. The
Government, for its part, had undertaken rehabilitation of selected facilities already in operation and the
building of new primary care centers. At the time of the Review, all construction had been completed and
no additional construction was envisioned.

53. The issue has been documented18 and management guidance sought. Upon recommendation of the
ECA safeguards coordinator, in June 2009 the team visited a sample of sites constructed under the project
and found no issues regarding compliance with local construction regulations, land acquisition or
resettlement. The new construction had been carried out with due diligence and in an environmentally
sound manner. The team reported these findings to the ECA safeguards coordinator and it was agreed that
there was no need to change the environmental rating at this stage since all works financed by the
Government were done in compliance with Bank standards and no additional construction was planned
under the project. This conclusion had also been discussed and agreed on with the ECA Quality Unit.

54. Financial Management (FM) arrangements at JPIB, including accounting, reporting, planning
and budgeting, and staffing is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Overall, the JPIB had acceptable
budgeting and planning capacity. The annual budgets were prepared on a timely basis by the JPIB,
approved by the MoF and entered into the accounting system by the FM staff of the JPIB.


55. JPIB‟s internal controls system was assessed on a regular basis by the Bank‟s FM Specialist and was
found in general to be reliable and capable of providing timely information and reporting on the project.
In particular, the JPIB performed monthly formal reconciliation of disbursement data with project‟s
accounting records. This was done using the Bank‟s Client Connection system. Proper data back-up
arrangements were followed. The JPIB utilized the 1C accounting software that was specially designed for
Bank-financed projects. The software was able to generate Financial Management Reports (FMR) and
statement of expenditures (SOEs). At the end of each quarter, the JPIB developed FMRs and submitted
them to the Bank. Usually these reports were submitted on time and found Satisfactory.

56. The audits reports for the project‟s financial statements were usually qualified (either except for or
adverse opinions). The reason for qualification of the auditor‟s opinion was as follows: counterpart funds
disbursed as in-kind contribution by reports of Regional Project Implementation Bureaus (hereinafter
referred to as RPIB – Oblast Project Implementation Bureau in Russian) were usually understated in the
financial statements of the Project due to the non submission of the information from RPIB. For several
years, the JPIB tried to get reports on the co-financed shares from regional Treasury offices, but failed as
Treasury was only allowed to provide such information to the Project with the permission of the Cabinet of
Ministers (CoM) or MoF. In 2010, this problem was partially resolved with the Bank‟s involvement, when
the MoF obliged Treasury to provide the JPIB with information on amounts disbursed. However, audit
opinions still were qualified as the auditor was not provided with supporting documentation to confirm
disbursements and expenditures. Disbursement applications were generally prepared accurately and
submitted regularly. By the end of the grace period (April 30, 2012), disbursements under the IDA Credit
and IDA Grant reached 99% of the total Credit and Grant amounts.

57. Lessons learned. There was a risk that similar issues would arise in regard to the in-kind
contribution spending under the Health 3 project. To avoid such potential problems, it was agreed that in-
kind contributions will not constitute part of the Government of Uzbekistan‟s co-financing for the Health 3
Project, which was declared effective on November 2, 2011.

58. The ICR team rated the procurement performance under this project as Moderately
Satisfactory. There were no significant deviations or waivers from the Bank procurement policies and
procedures, although the project faced numerous challenges in getting experienced staff on board at the
initial stage of implementation.

59. Two issues were identified as major ones affecting the project procurement. First, it is a principle
agreed between the Bank and any borrower that under Bank-financed projects, procurement procedures
and rules of the Bank should prevail when there is a discrepancy between the government public
procurement procedures and the Bank‟s procurement guidelines. In practice, this principle cannot always
be easily followed. The Bank team had to remind and persuade the Government to do so throughout the
project life. Each time when the Government would not accept Bank‟s comments on the bidding
documents or bid evaluation reports, discussion on which procedure should be followed had to be repeated.
JPIB had to shuttle between the Bank and MOH trying to find a balance by incorporating some of the
Bank‟s comments while answering to Government requests. In many cases, the process could drag on for
weeks and months, resulting in delays of contract awards and delays in project implementation. It is worth
noting that this is not a project specific issue. Most of the projects in other sectors and on-going projects
financed by the Bank are still facing similar challenges to a certain degree. It is clear that country public

                                                    15
procurement reforms remain a priority in Bank‟s support to public sector reforms. More efforts should be
made to bring the national procurement systems in line with good international practices. Second, the
contract registration requirement by Government agencies was a second bottleneck in procurement and
project implementation. All signed contracts had to be registered and price verified and the process could
take as long as six to eight months. Again this is a country requirement which applies to all sectors and all
projects. The health project may have suffered more than other sectors because health projects normally
have many more contracts with very small values in money terms. This could be part of the reason why a
lot more staff time was needed to address administrative requirements.


2.5.1 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

60. Support to the health sector is continuing through the Health 3 operation. The project
complements the current and planned support from Government and other donors and international
agencies. As such, Health 3 addresses in a more systemic way the challenges of the provision of quality
hospital services to the country‟s rural population, reforming the way those services are organized and paid
for, general public health education and promotion, and behavioral change of the population. The Health 3
project aims at bringing together the various interventions among donors while focusing on integrating and
scaling up major public health actions through deepening ongoing health sector reforms within the context
of the Government Welfare Improvement Program. It responds to two of the CAS‟s 19 four pillars,
specifically to: (i) enabling an environment for shared growth (under “increasing the efficiency of public
financial management for more effective service provision?), and (ii) improving human development and
social protection through improved basic services delivery. The objectives of the Health 3 Project are to:
(1) improve access to quality health care at the primary level and at Rayon Medical Unions, and (2)
strengthen the Government‟s public health response to the rise in Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs)20.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

61. The ICR team rates relevance of objectives, design and implementation Substantial. At the
time of approval on September 9, 2004, the Project was relevant and consistent with development
priorities of both the Government (as confirmed through several strategic documents) and the Bank (the
2002 CAS). The Project design addressed important Government‟s priorities and followed the footsteps of
the previous Bank-supported health operation in the country as well as other health reform projects in the
ECA Region taking into account key lessons learned. At the time of this ICR, the PDOs are not only
relevant, but integrated into the Government‟s monitoring matrix as a monitoring tool and are in line with
the Bank priorities (the 2012 Country Partnership Strategy 21). The Project has had significant impact in
supporting implementation of health reforms in the country and was used strategically to actively support
health reform activities and build up capacity in the MOH. Furthermore, reforms initiated by Health 1 and
Health 2 are now rolled out and brought to the next level by the ongoing Health 3 Project.

3.2   Achievement of Project Development Objectives

62. PDOs have remained the same throughout the life of the Project; however, RF has undergone
modifications that were formally restructured in June 2010. The ICR Team applied the methodology
found in Appendix B of the ICR Guidelines (rev. October 2011) by OPCS in evaluating the overall
achievement of the PDOs.

Rating: Substantial for the original PDO Indicators and Substantial for the revised PDO Indicators.

63. Evaluation of outcomes against the PDOs was challenging due to changes in the RF. The RF has
been refined to better reflect the progress towards the PDOs and agreed by the Government and the Bank
at the 2007 Mid-Term Review. However, as indicated earlier, the RF was formally revised in June 2010
and by that time the Project had disbursed 63 percent of the credit proceeds.

64. It was possible to evaluate the progress for 14 out of 15 original PDO Indicators. The project made
substantial achievements against the benchmarks prior to the formal RF revision (Tables 6 and 7).
Moreover, despite the delay in formally revising the PDO indicators as explained in paras 43 to 45 and
Table 4, there was a dialogue to restructure the project and to refine RF well before the formal revision.

66. Regarding the revised PDOs, the Project has achieved its development objectives to a large extent
(see Tables 8 and 9). Five outcome indicators out of nine have either reached the end of the project targets
or exceeded them. More specifically, the share of women who received antenatal care in the early stage of
pregnancy increased form baseline 77 percent in 2004 to 87 percent in 2010 , exceeding end of the
Project target of 85 percent. Furthermore, share of patents referred from primary health centers (SVPs) to
hospitals decreased from the 20 percent baseline in 2004 to 12 percent in 2011 showing greater
improvement as compared with the end of Project target of 15 percent, which is actually quite high by
itself and comparable to other countries. Likewise, end of the Project targets have also been reached for
key indicators related to financial and management reforms. Thus, the share of State expenditures for
primary and outpatient care gradually increased from 41.7 percent in 2004 to 45.2 percent in 2011. All
rural PHC facilities and urban pilot PHC facilities have been converted to per-capita financing and
management system.

67. Two outcome indicators have substantially reached agreed targets: 94 percent achievement in the
increase of the number of visits to PHC facilities and 96.3 percent achievement in the decrease in
hospitalization rate among the rural population. These results show a significant improvement in the
provision of basic health services at rural clinics and in the institutionalization of GP based PHC nationally.

68. However, the Project failed to reach its target in the provision of essential pharmaceuticals to rural
clinics. The percent of SVPs which were provided by at least 75 percent of essential pharmaceuticals has
not improved during the life of the Project despite Government‟s efforts during the last 2 years to allocate
additional resources for procurement of medicines. The situation with the availability of essential drugs at
SVPs is a reflection of two major factors: (i) insufficient volume of financing for non-salary expenditures
of health facilities, and (ii) insufficient administrative flexibility in the transition from decentralized
procurement of drugs to their centralized procurement and distribution. The latter action was aimed at
increasing cost-efficiency. However the implementation of the new procurement system was not properly
administered, which resulted in delays in the supply of a number of items from the list of essential drugs.
Meanwhile, 64 percent of SVPs are being provided with 50 percent of the drugs from the list.

69. The final assessment of the Project conducted by an independent consulting group (see Annex 5) has
revealed positive developments in patients‟ satisfaction with the quality and accessibility of SVP services
as well as in population awareness on disease prevention measures. The survey data shows that complex
measures on upgrading physical conditions of rural health clinics, providing them with modern medical
equipment and supplies, and improving knowledge and skills of doctors and nurses have reduced the need
of the population in rayon hospital to seek specialists‟ services.

3.3       Project Efficiency

70. Efficiency is rated Substantial. The Project has had a significant impact in the frame of ongoing
health reforms in the country. In particular, the Project has made significant achievements in: (i)
implementing PHC reform with emphasis on the GP model, (ii) institutionalizing CME, (iii) increasing
utilization and efficiency of health care in rural areas, and (iv) strengthening the public health system
through training, surveillance and control of CDs. The comprehensive nature of the reforms, with changes
in the legal basis of the health system, organizational arrangements, financing, provider payment systems,
and service provision, has meant that strong platforms have been established to expand and sustain the
changes achieved. The reforms have been welcomed by all key stakeholders. The Project has been
successful as demonstrated by improved key indicators on: (i) utilization of rural PHC, (ii) population
satisfaction with the quality and access to PHC services, and (iii) efficiency of outpatient services
provision. The survey conducted by an independent consulting group at the end of the Project (see Annex
5) has revealed positive developments in patients‟ satisfaction with the quality and accessibility of SVP
services as well as in population awareness on disease prevention measures. The utilization of outpatient
services among the rural population increased from 3.8 visits in 2004 to 4.7 visits to SVPs in 2011.
Equally, the referral rate from SVPs to hospitals in project target areas decreased from 20 percent in 2004
to 12 percent in 2011.


                                                                     20
3.4   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

71. The ICR Team rates Overall Outcome of the Project as Moderately Satisfactory. As per ICR
Guidelines (rev. October 2011), the ICR team weighed the overall outcome both against the original and
revised Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) based on amounts disbursed at the time of formal restructuring
(Table 10). The Project‟s overall outcome is considered Moderately Satisfactory based on the Project‟s
significant achievements, its continued relevance, its contribution towards strengthening Uzbekistan‟s
health sector program, and making it more accountable and efficient. While the ICR team has rated
outcome as Moderately Satisfactory, it is worth debating whether the project‟s strong outcomes merit a
higher rating (for reasons noted in para. 45, the formal restructuring did not take place in 2007, as might
have been desirable). As Uzbekistan continues its challenges regarding continuation of financing reforms
and further expansion of family medicine, especially in urban settings, the Project‟s contributions will
continue to be highly relevant having in mind that the Government has incorporated the project‟s Results
Framework into its regular monitoring schedule. The Project‟s contributions are being further supported
under the Health 3 Project, which is under implementation.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

72. While the Project was not explicitly classified as a poverty-targeted operation, it has had a positive
impact on the poor as it targeted the rural population, where most of the poor live. The 2002 CAS Report
No. 23675-UZ and the PAD identified that: (i) most of the country‟s population lived in rural regions (63
percent), (ii) 28 percent of the population lived below the poverty line, (iii) a third of them could be
considered extremely poor, and (iv) many, but especially the poor, were negatively affected by corruption
and informal payments including payments for social services. Furthermore, PHC was predominantly
used by women and children. Data on utilization of PHC services was monitored throughout the life of the
Project and showed the impact of improved access and quality of care of populations of all socio-
economic groups, including the poor and women, especially in rural areas. During ICR discussions,
patients noted that with the improved access, quality of care and physical condition of SVPs, they did not
have to travel (and spend money on transport) and could obtain diagnostics and needed treatment from
their GP instead of being referred to hospitals (thus potentially spending more money for medications and
informal payments/gifts). In addition, poor people have benefited from policy interventions that included
targeting rural communities through the SVP improvement program.

73. The PAD also identified and addressed MM rates that were overall high and excessive in poor
regions (over 90 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000 in Navoi region and 48 deaths per 100,000 live
births in 1999 in Karakalpakstan). Data on the share of women who received antenatal care in the early

                                                     21
stage of pregnancy were monitored throughout the project and showed significant increase from baseline
(77 percent in 2004 to 87 percent in 2010). Longer term benefits are expected for the whole society from
improved governance, public health policy making, and replication of best practices.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

74. It is not possible to attribute success in capacity building to a single project having in mind the
presence of other intervening factors such as the ADB 23 health project, the Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Deutsche
Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), and other agencies, which also contributed
to strengthening institutional capacities. On the other hand, during ICR discussions with MoH, MoF,
the Tashkent Institute for Advanced Medical Education (TIAME), Medical Academy, and the Institute for
Health and Medical Statistics, National AIDS Center, Regional Training Centers and SVPs, managers and
staff recognized that Project investments, including investments in capacity building and technology, have
resulted in substantial institutional development at different levels of the health system. Significant
progress was made through the Project in improving the capacity of MoH and health care institutions staff
to deal with modern management and policy analysis methods. The strong focus on management training
and capacity building under the Project has served to entrench modern approaches as part of the general
management culture on the health sector, thus helping to ensure that the PDO was achieved and could be
sustained beyond the closing date.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

75. Close coordination and synergies with activities financed by ADB, JICA, WHO, UNDP, GIZ
have resulted in better outcomes for the sector. ADB has supported efforts towards improvement of
PHC through civil works, equipment and capacity building. WHO has provided technical assistance
towards improving public health, mental health, nursing, nutrition and GPs capacity building, GIZ on
capacity development of nurses and maintenance health services and UNDP provided technical assistance
on renewable energy sources and integrated Energy Efficiency (EE) requirement standards.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

76. The final assessment of the Project was conducted by an independent consulting group 24 and has
showed positive developments in patients‟ satisfaction with the quality and accessibility of SVP services,
as well as in population awareness on disease prevention measures. The survey data showed that complex
measures on upgrading physical conditions of rural health clinics, providing them with modern medical
equipment and supplies, and improving knowledge and skills of doctors and nurses have reduced the need
of the population in rayon hospital to seek specialists‟ services. The assessment and its methodology are
discussed in more detail in Annex 5.




23 ADB Loan of US$40 million was closely coordinated with the WB Health 2, both in design and implementation stage. The two projects were complementing each
other as ADB was supporting renovation and equipment of SVPs, and training for GP nurses. The ADB and WB projects were implemented by the same agency, JPIB
and were also jointly supervised by the Bank and ADB teams.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

77. The risk at the time of the ICR that development outcomes will not be maintained is rated
Negligible. The Government‟s and related institutions‟ ownership and commitment to sustaining gains are
strong. In addition, the ongoing Health 3 Project continues to provide financial support for the various
areas addressed by this Project.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance


78. Team leadership changed three times over the life of Project, causing some adjustments in the way
the Bank guided implementation (see below).

5.1   Bank Performance


(a)   Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

79. This evaluation rates the Quality at Entry as Moderately Satisfactory. As described in Section
1.1, in the view of the ICR team: (i) the project objectives and scope were appropriate for the stage of
development of the sector in the country, (ii) the Project built on the findings of the functional review of
the health system conducted prior to appraisal by the Bank and 12 respective Government Working
Groups, experience with implementation of the previous Bank-financed health operation in Uzbekistan and
elsewhere in the ECA Region, (iii) the Project addressed the Government‟s objective of cost-containment
while promoting improvement in quality and access to PHC, and (iv) it supported key elements of the CAS
by promoting the institutional development of the MoH. Nonetheless, as noted earlier, this evaluation finds
that while selected objectives were appropriate for the status of reforms and addressing all the areas for
improvement in the system at the design stage, perhaps a less ambitious scope of design would have been
more appropriate given the limited institutional capacity and weak legal framework appropriately
identified in the PAD and what could have reasonably been expected to be achieved within a limited
timeframe. The targets set at the time of preparation were neither easy nor a foregone conclusion. The
fact that several of them were overachieved is a testament to the commitment of the Government to
addressing these issues.

(b)   Quality of Supervision

80. The ICR team rates the quality of supervision as Satisfactory. From the outset it was recognized
that given the limited institutional capacity of both MoH and JPIB, the Project would require close
monitoring and a hands-on supervision approach to ensure successful implementation. Supervision was
intense with frequent technically adept missions, ensuring consistency of the policy dialogue and the
messages delivered to the Government. The Task Team Leader (TTL) responsible for processing the
Project for approval, continued as TTL for two and a half years after Credit effectiveness. The second
TTL guided project implementation for eighteen months, i.e. up to September 2008. The third and last
TTL stayed with the Project to the closing date, i.e. for over three years and is the TTL for Health 3 project.
The engagement of the Bank staff in the country office was very helpful in ensuring continuity in the Bank
team.

81. For the most part, teams were responsive to client needs and demonstrated flexibility in adapting to
evolving priorities within the parameters of the PDOs. Equally, teams were diligent in their
communication with Government and Bank management, providing up-to-date information and analysis

                                                     23
on the status and impact of project activities, issues encountered, and suggesting options to address issues
that arose as a result of evolving needs. In the view of this ICR, the fact that the last TTL is fluent in
Russian, who understands the Soviet and Post-Soviet systems helped build trust with the client and made it
easier for the Bank to convey challenging messages.

(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

82. For the reasons stated above, the ICR Team rates Overall Bank Performance as Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2   Borrower Performance

(a)   Government Performance

83. Government’s performance during project preparation and implementation was Moderately
Satisfactory.

84. Prior to the Project, the Government had introduced key pieces of legislation to create an enabling
environment and to establish platforms for systemic, comprehensive, and multi-faceted health reforms to
reduce inefficiencies, enhance equity and access (financial and geographic), and improve quality of care.
It established supervision mechanisms at several levels, including MOH, MOF, and Ministry of Economy.
Government‟s commitment and buy-in for the reforms may be best illustrated with the fact that
Government‟s financial contribution by the end of the Project increased almost nine times, from an
originally appraised US$ 78 million to actually spending US$ 698 million invested towards
construction/reconstruction of SVPs, resulting in a significant increase in the number of SVPs from 1249
in 1999 to 3182 in 2010, thus providing even the most remote areas of the country with access to PHC. In
general, the Project benefited from strong support and active interest from the relevant agencies of the
Government.

85. Less satisfactory aspects of Government performance are related to: (i) inflexible procurement
procedures that have significantly affected project implementation especially in its early stages; and (ii)
lengthy and complex administrative procedures that, among other, affected timely restructuring of the
project. The Government was less effective during the first half of the project in: (iii) enabling legal
conditions for the results framework to be formally amended as per agreements reached during the 2007
Mid-Term Review; and (iv) ensuring that the implementing agency, JPIB, is appropriately staffed and
trained, thus enabling for timely and satisfactory implementation and monitoring of the Project.

(b)   Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

86. Performance of the Ministry of Health was mixed. There were initial deficiencies in the MoH due
to the lack of ownership and experience in project management and implementation. At the beginning,
Project was largely managed by MoF who appointed the Director and staff of the JPIB at its own
discretion, while JPIB was in charge of technical aspects of the Project. These deficiencies were gradually
overcome by capacity accumulated in MoH over the life of the Project. Commitment of the MoH to the
Project increased substantially and extended beyond the life of the Health 2 as the MoH is now
implementing Health 3 which in many aspects builds up on achievements of the Health 2. Likewise, as
stated earlier, the Monitoring Framework for Health 2 has been incorporated into MoH‟s monitoring and
reporting schedule. The Minister of Health changed only once, three years before the closing date of
December 2011. The Minister of Health took the supervision and management of Health 2 as a priority
and established an organizational scheme where the Curator of the Project (Deputy Minister of Health)
chaired the MoH Expert Committees comprising of Deputy Ministers, Heads of respective Departments in

                                                    24
the MoH in charge of different components and sub-components of the Project including (i) public health;
(ii) quality of medical services; (iii) education and training; and (iv) health financing. In addition, Deputy
Minister of Finance, Head of the Social Affairs Department was assigned responsibility for the Project on
behalf of the MoF. The ICR Team had the opportunity to meet and have discussions with the officials of
the respective Ministries and was impressed with their understanding, in-depth involvement, interest and
close follow-up of the Project.

87. The performance of JPIB is also mixed. Due to the severe understaffing in the initial years25,
especially in the M&E and procurement units and lack of adequate procurement training of the JPIB
project implementation suffered in initial years. Absence of a procurement specialist in the JPIB led to
slow procurement and low disbursements. Absence of an M&E specialist resulted in failing to update
progress against development objectives. As mentioned earlier, the first JPIB Director was appointed by
the MoF, against the wishes of the MoH and this did not help the ease of implementation. The JPIB
Director changed three times during the life of the Project. Staff salaries remained the same for almost ten
years thus impairing likelihood of attracting and retaining qualified staff. All these issues have been
gradually resolved in a satisfactory manner with a joint initiative of the MoH and the Bank. Appropriate
staffing, vigorous and intensive training along with accumulated experience resulted in significant increase
of capacity of JPIB for project implementation and monitoring, as reflected in project progress and
achievements during the final years. Moreover, the issue of low JPIB staff salaries has been recognized
and addressed by the Government through salary increases for JPIB staff under the Health 3 Project.

88. The MoH and JPIB participated actively in ICR discussions and prepared a remarkably good
contribution to the ICR (see Annex 7).


(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

89. The ICR team rates the overall Borrower performance as Moderately Satisfactory for reasons
elaborated above.

6. Lessons Learned

90. Strong Government ownership is critical, particularly with reform-oriented projects. Reform
does not only concern technical health-related changes, but relies heavily on the political process.
Government ownership and commitment were critical in the support of the reforms through adequate
legislation and strategies.

91. Close coordination with development partners was critical. Close coordination and collaboration
with ADB and other agencies in supporting implementation aspects of the program helped keep key
activities on track. Sharing the same implementation unit between two highly complementing projects
ensured harmonization of interventions and efficient use of funds.

92. Providing continuous guidance and actively engaging in the overall policy dialogue in the
sector was crucial in ensuring consistency of the messages being delivered to the Government. Bank
supervision must be continuous and intensive and adequate supervision resources must be allocated
particularly in the context of a limited institutional capacity as was the case in Uzbekistan.

93. Comprehensive and careful project design greatly facilitates project implementation. Health 2
Project built on the Government‟s National Strategy and on achievements of Health 1 incorporating
lessons learned.

94. Reflecting in-kind Government contribution as co-financing may lead to problems when
auditing the Project, consequently creating repeated issues with audit performance and acceptance of
audit reports. These lessons learned were incorporated in the design of Health 3.

95. Efficient use of funds and technical expertise is fully recommended and should be recognized.
This was demonstrated through preparation of Health 3 in parallel to implementation of Health 2 thus
keeping the momentum and naturally scaling up activities towards the next stage of reform.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners


(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

96. Authorities contacted by the ICR Team commented very positively on the role of the Project in
supporting complex reforms in the health sector. Both the MoH and MoF noted that beyond the
investments supported by the Project they saw the Bank as a strong technical partner, stressing that policy
dialogue and visits were frequent, timely, and technically superior, bringing along high quality expertise.
The MoH particularly highlighted the value added of the Bank‟s close supervision, follow-up and
responsiveness to addressing bottlenecks over the last three years of the project.

97. The MOH provided very useful comments on the draft ICR, most of which were incorporated in the
final report. However, there are two comments/suggestions by the MoH that the Team did not include in
this ICR for the following reasons:

        One comment which was not taken into account relates to the monitoring of Intermediate Outcome
         Indicators before restructuring, namely Indicators No.2 (GP Training Programs established) and
         No.3 (Average increase in annual expenditures for primary care as a share of all expenditures in 8
         regions under the project)26. The MoH said that the above indicators were not stated in any of the
         formally approved documents. However, as noted in the footnote No.1 of this ICR, Annex 1 of the
         PAD (attached to this ICR as Annex 11) lists 42 indicators, not all explicitly linked to the PDOs.
         However, per ICR Team findings only 4 Intermediate indicators including the indicators in question
         have been monitored and regularly updated prior to Mid Term Review in October 31, 2007 when
         new Results Framework was agreed upon with the Government and results monitored and updated.27

2006], 7 [June 21, 2007] and 8 [June 29, 2007


                                                                26
         Another is a suggestion of the MoH to upgrade revised PDO Indicator No.3 (% of SVPs stocked
          with (for at least 75% of) essential medicines for emergency care (Indicator introduced at
          restructuring on June 22, 2010)28 from NOT ACHIEVED to PARTIALLY ACHIEVED. The target
          set at the Project restructuring (June 22, 2010) was to have at least 50% of SVPs stocked with 75%
          of essential medicines for emergency care by the end of the project. However, despite many efforts,
          administrative inflexibility in transition from decentralized to centralized procurement and
          distribution of drugs caused delay in implementing new procurement system thus leading to delayed
          supply of a number of essential drugs. By the end of the project, 64% of SVPs have been provided
          with 50% of drugs from the list. Even though the engagement of the MoH and JPIB is fully
          recognized, the ICR Team agreed that this indicator could not be evaluated as PARTIALLY
          ACHIEVED. Furthermore, it should also be noted that the upgrading of this indicator would not
          impact the Overall Project Achievement Rating.

  The considerable lower than projected expenditures for the component reflect large savings in training costs (rental of training
venues and procurement of training equipment) as a result of the construction of a Training Center by the Government in 2008.
Most trainings under the component were conducted in the Training Center thereby avoiding the need for rental of facilities
throughout the country and procurement of training equipment.

32
   Disbursement under the Public Health Component increased due to: (i) additional procurement of iron-bearing supplements in
agreement with the Bank (procurement of iron-bearing supplements amounted to US$2.3 m instead of the planned US$0.4 m), and
(ii) additional funding needed for the maintenance of the increased number of health facilities (281 health facilities instead of 95).

33
  Increase of expenditures under the component is associated with the extension of the term of the Project implementation and
increase in the cost of services provided by the Procurement Agent and Delivery Agent.

34
     Differences reflect fluctuations of the SDR against the US$ dollar.

35
  In addition to the specified amount, the Government spent over US$620 m, including US$105.5 m for construction and
US$514.5 m for maintenance of health facilities. Originally it was planned to construct/reconstruct 2200 SVPs and 180 other
medical facilities for an estimated cost of US$43.7 m. However, 3044 facilities were constructed / reconstructed, including 2381
SVPs and 663 other medical facilities (see also footnote 36 below).

  Higher amounts reflect construction of additional health facilities. As explained under footnote 35, the GOU financed a great
deal of construction/rehabilitation of health facilities over and above the scope of the project.

                                      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

At the time of Project appraisal one of the main assumptions for Uzbekistan‟s macroeconomic
environment was “GDP increase to 5 percent by 2006 stabilizing at 2 percent during the rest of the
period?. Actually Uzbekistan‟s economy (GDP) grew by averaging 8.17% annually from 2004 to 2011.
Uzbekistan‟s gradual, state-led development strategy has delivered growth, somewhat reduced poverty,
and maintained essential human and physical infrastructure.

The main expected benefit from the Health 2 project was to improve the quality and overall economic
efficiency of the primary healthcare in the Republic of Uzbekistan. While an economic analysis was not
carried out, data presented in the final evaluation of Health 2 project and Project Outcome indicators
shows that there has been a positive trend in terms of greater efficiency in the health sector.

Focusing from secondary to primary health care. Starting from 1996, the Government initiated a reform
to increase efficiency in the rural primary health care sector by trimming its overgrown structure and by
diverting its focus from secondary to primary care. The World Bank supported reform at the same time
rationalizing system by transforming almost all FAPs, SVAs, and SUBs to into SVPs. However, some
SUBs and FAPs were left in the most remote and scarcely populated parts of the country.

The concept of General Practitioners has been widely accepted. SVP doctor‟s 10-month retraining program
has been acknowledged success and apparently upgraded skills have led to a reduced rate of referrals and
better patient satisfaction.

All rural primary healthcare facilities and pilot urban family polyclinics were switched to per capita
financing system and have been operating as independent legal entities. The share of primary healthcare
and outpatient health services in the 2011 expenditures structures has reached 45.2% as compared to
baseline level of 41% in 2004.

Quality of PHC services

The overall estimation of the quality of SVP services provided in the last 5 years remains quite high. In
2011, the share of the households stating the improvement of the work of their SVPs has increased from
90% up to 95%. 90% of the households are reporting to SVPs when seeking medical care for the first time,
and almost all of those who are doing that are satisfied with the quality of services provided40. The share of
patients referred from SVPs to hospitals reduced from the baseline level of 20% in 2004 to 12% in 2011.
The number of population‟s visits to primary healthcare facilities has increased from 3.8 in 2005 to 4.7 in
2011.

Therefore, health expenditures of population have been economized due to easy access to the modernized
primary health care facilities where General Practitioners and nurses with the upgraded skills.

                                    Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results


When developing the Project, a plan of basic research was designed within the Health-2 Project, with a
stipulated frequency of surveys; during the implementation of the Project, this plan was adjusted in view of
the project implementation status, and stipulated conducting of surveys in 2007 and at the final stage of the
Project in 2011. The consultant firm Expert Fikri has been contracted for this task. The baseline study for
the assessment of Health Project was conducted in October-November of 2007. The final study for the
assessment was conducted in June-July, 2011.

        The objective of the survey was to obtain quantitative and qualitative data that would help
evaluate the efficiency of reforms conducted in the public health system and provide useful information for
improvement of the quality and efficiency of health services provided by SVPs and maternity institutions.
These results were aimed to provide data for management of the public health system reforming process.
The tasks of the survey were the following:
    1) Assessment of consumers' satisfaction with primary health care services provided;
    2) Assessment of GPs' activities, their skills included;
    3) Assessment of implementation of safe motherhood in the primary health services sector;
    4) Survey of the primary health care sector financial management;
    5) Description of provision of SVPs with medical equipment, including photocolorimeters,
        autoclaves, hot-air sterilizers, electrocardiographs, and with laboratory equipment, as well as
        provision of SVPs with medical preparations.

        Methodology. The sampling proportional to the number of SVPs in the oblasts and the probability
sampling of SVPs was performed out of their total numbers according to their proportions in the surveyed
regions. These regions represented the whole rural territory of Uzbekistan. The sampling scheme and the
number of SVPs were done separately for Zone 1 (Health 1) and Zone 2 (Health 2), as well as for the
zones that shifted to SVP per capita financing and self-management. The total number of the surveyed
SVPs was 90 in 2007 and 70 in 2011. Cutting down the number of SVPs and a proportional reduction in
the number of the surveyed personnel and patients was the result of the 2007-2011 inflation which limited
the financial possibilities of the estimation; however, it did not affect the statistical validity and liability of
the results.

The instruments for the conducted surveys included and stipulated the following:
       Structured interviews with users and suppliers of health services with the use of specially designed
        standardized questionnaires;
       Random studying of financial, statistical and medical documentation, including the audit of
        patients' charts;
       Direct observation of admission and treatment of patients from the target groups;
       Examination of facilities‟ premises, checking the availability of medical preparations and
        equipment (including its working condition) on the day of visiting, with filling out forms with lists
        of mandatory equipment, medicines and preparations.
       Structured interviews with financial managers and Heads of SVPs;
       In-depth interviews with Rayon Public Health System key specialists and Oblast Health Ministry
        Department chief accountants and economists.

Summary

In the course of the implementation of „Health-2‟ and 'Women and Children Health Development' Projects,
the SVP personnel and GPs underwent training in reproductive health, – both at 10-month GP courses and
at short-term courses devoted to breastfeeding, reproductive health, antenatal care in GP‟s practice, etc.
These courses, attended by a significant number of personnel have improved GPs‟ knowledge and skills in
reproductive health issues, which has been confirmed by the results of the evaluation of personnel‟s skills
in newborn examination, in infant growth and development monitoring, in nutritional consultation, as well
as in the increase in the share of GPs performing examination of the mammary glands in women of fertile
age and administering cervical smear in at-risk women. The improvement of GPs‟ knowledge and skills
has resulted in a higher quality of services in breast cancer prevention and early diagnostics as well as the
quality of cervical cancer screening.

Maternity and patronage nurses‟ knowledge and skills have improved, too. They have shown better
awareness of the signs of abdominal pregnancy and other threatening conditions which, in its turn, resulted
in a higher efficiency of consultation provided to pregnant women and in an increased share of pregnant
women informed on these signs.
The audit of patients‟ charts has shown that the share of charts with gravidograms has increased 2 times,
the share of pregnant women tested for HIV – 4 times, and the share of pregnant women tested for alpha-
fetoprotein at the screening center – 4.5 times.

On the whole, the quality of antenatal care provided by SVPs has improved. In 2011, we can see a
significant increase in the share of personnel with correct а) management of pregnant women with anemia;
в) administration of iron preparations; ?) consultation in nutritional issues and medication taking control
methods.

Nevertheless, 18% of doctors have not attended training in reproductive health. In 35% of cases, pregnant
women‟s charts lacked gravidograms; some, – although not so many, – GPs did not know the signs of
threatening abortion, abortion in progress, abdominal pregnancy and threatening eclampsia. GPs are
willing to acquire knowledge and skills of conditions commonly dealt with at SVPs to be able to render
assistance in such cases without gynecologists.

A tendency of nurses‟ high rotation was observed: the experienced or trained under Health 2 Project nurses
were being replaced by young nurses having graduated from colleges, whose knowledge and skills were
evaluated by GPs as inadequate, resulting in inferior quality of services provided to the population, women
and children.

Organization and implementation of activities within the Ministry of Health and other agencies involved in
project implementation


The project was implemented by the Joint Project Implementation Bureau for the IDA Project “Health II?
and ADB Project “Mother and Child Health Improvement? that was established under the Ministry of
Health (Implementing Agency).

The JPIB is an independent organisation operating as a sub-division of the MoH and its staffing schedule
includes the executive director, coordinator and component specialists, financial manager/chief accountant,
manager and procurement specialists, accountants, administrator (office manager) and a number of other
support staff.

The JPIB has managed the project‟s day-to-day activities whereas more broad matters related to project
implementation, such as definition of policies and directions of reforming health sector were left with the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Health.

The role of the Ministry of Health was instrumental in attracting international donors involved in the health
sector, and, in particular, the Ministry of Health managed to attract the following donors‟ funds:

-   UNICEF involved;
-   USAID (Zdravplus) was involved in implementation of the financial reforms under the project,
    training general practitioners aimed at improving quality and developing evidence based medicine;
-   UNDP implemented a pilot project utilizing renewable energy technologies in rural medical centres;
-   WHO developed public health strategies and was involved in promoting healthy life style among rural
    population; and
-   EU‟s Tacis programme evaluated the existing medical equipment maintenance system and developed
    proposals to improve the system.



Expert committees and working groups were established involving leading experts of the MoH to focus on
the following tasks: preparation and approval of technical specifications for the equipment to be purchased
as well as terms of reference for international and local consultancy, evaluation of bidders‟ proposals, and
acceptance of consultants‟ reports.

The Ministry of Finance acted as the Borrower on behalf of the Government and was responsible for
timely allocation of co-financing in accordance with the loan agreement.

The Ministry of Economy ensured planning of the state investment programme, over-sought the project
performance and controlled the municipalities‟ participation in construction and reconstruction of SVPs to
be equipped by the project.

The Ministry of Labour and Social Protection provided legal frameworks institutionalising the
specialisation of general practitioner and participated in development of the qualification requirements for
the General practitioners at SVPs and FPs.

The Ministry of Justice provided legal support and approved the project‟s regulatory documents.
MFERIT has participated in the project ensuring registration of contracts.

The State Customs Committee registered import contracts and cleared the imported goods from customs.


                                                     55
The national foreign economic enterprise “Uzmedexport? acted as a Procurement Agent and conducted
procurement of goods (tendering, bid evaluation, contract implementation), part of this function was later
delegated to the JPIB.

The UzTibTehnika Joint Stock Company acted as a Delivery Agent and provided warehousing services
and delivery of goods to final beneficiaries in accordance with the schedules approved by the Ministry of
Health.

The Department for Quality Control and Medical Equipment and Medications was responsible for
registration of medical equipment, furniture, consumables and reagent procured by the project.


Project design, implementation and impact


Assessment of Project Design

The Project‟s objectives were in line with the Government‟s reform priorities and strategies in the health
sector, with a focus on PHC, optimisation of medical service delivery network, training of medical staff,
improvement of the healthcare management system and development of the public health system. The
changes made to the project components and sub-components during the course of implementation have
contributed to the achievement of original development objectives. Some additional financial allocations
and redistributions were made throughout the project lifecycle thus ensuring that the project‟s objectives
were fulfilled.


Main results achieved under each of the project development objectives (i.e. key performance
indicators) and each component/subcomponent

A network of new generation of medical/preventive facilities based on general practitioner services was
established in rural and urban areas as a result of the Health II project implementation. The undergraduate
and postgraduate general practitioner training was institutionalised. The specialisation of general
practitioner was officially approved and registered as a standalone medical position.

For the first time, all primary healthcare facilities in the country have independent legal statuses. All rural
primary healthcare facilities and pilot urban family polyclinics were switched to per capita financing
system. The share of primary healthcare and outpatient health services in the 2011 expenditures structures
has reached 45.2% as compared to the baseline level of 41% in 2004.

Five planned indicators contained in the project‟s results framework were achieved or exceeded; two
others are close to achievement. The share of women observed by primary healthcare facilities from the
early stages of pregnancy has increased from the baseline level of 79.1% to 87.7% (the target was at 85%).
The share of patients referred from SVPs to hospitals reduced from the baseline level of 20% in 2004 to
12% in 2011 (the target level was at 15%). The number of population‟s visits to primary healthcare
facilities has increased from 3.8 in 2005 to 4.7 in 2011 (the target was set at 5 visits per capita).

The final evaluation of Health II project conducted by an independent team of consultants revealed
positive changes in the patients‟ satisfaction with the quality and accessibility of SVP services as well as in
the level of population‟s awareness of disease prevention matters. Over 95% of the rural population

                                                      56
supported the choice of general practitioner method for SVP service delivery as opposed to using services
provided by medical specialists at other facilities. The results of the study show that the measures aimed at
improving conditions in rural clinics, providing modern medical equipment and materials as well as
improving the doctors‟ and nurses‟ knowledge and skills resulted in the population relying less on the
specialist assistance of rayon hospitals.

As a result of improved public health activities, preventive programmes aimed at promoting healthy
lifestyle among rural and urban population were developed successfully. The coverage of laboratory
screening for HIV amongst pregnant women increased (from 55% in 2007 to 85% in 2011). The
percentage of voluntary laboratory tests has increased from 40% to 73% during the same period. The
project has contributed to achieving stabilisation of HIV prevalence rates in the country and reducing
annual disease rates by 5-6% per year in 2009-2011.

As a result of implementation of the iron supplementation and programmes and promotion of healthy
nutrition habits in Bukhara, Navoi, Samarkand, Tashkent regions in 2009-2011, the iron deficiency has
reduced by an average of 22.3% as compared with the baseline level (from 37.9% to 14.9%).


Project coordination and management

The Governmental Committee for healthy generations, strengthening the women‟s health and improving
family culture created under the Cabinet of Ministers has been charged with coordinating project activities
and overall management of project implementation. Regional Committees for healthy generations,
strengthening the women‟s health and improving family culture were responsible for project
implementation at regional level.

The Ministry of Finance acted as the Borrower responsible for financial matters.

The Ministry of Health, as the Implementing Agency, manages the project through the Joint Project
Implementation Bureau; project Implementation bureaus of the Ministry of Health of Karakalpaksatn,
Departments of Health in the regions and the city of Tashkent (OPIBs), working groups (WG) and other
departments. The Ministry of Health bears overall responsibility for implementation of Projects, decisions
aimed at their development, and provision of government‟s contributions.

Oblast level project implementation bureaus were established at the regional health departments and the
Ministry of Health of Karakalpakstan to implement project activities which bureaus were comprised by
one PIB director and one health, finance and management specialist. These bureaus are responsible for
implementing the project in their respective regions and have dual subordination to both regional health
departments and to the JPIB.


Responsibilities of the Project Coordinator and of key personnel

The JPIB is headed by its executive director responsible for managing and coordinating all project
components and activities, including technical, financial, administrative aspects and procurement
activities, training and work organisation. The JPIB has 4 departments: management section, financial
section, procurement section, and administrative department.

The Management Section includes the executive director, the deputy executive director, project coordinator
and component experts. This section was responsible for implementing activities and monitoring
achievement of component targets.

                                                     57
The Finance Section comprises a financial manager/chief accountant, finance specialist/accountant,
accountant and a disbursement specialist. The finance section was responsible for planning and disbursing
the project‟s funds, payments, keeping records, compiling financial and accounting reports.

The Procurement Section includes a senior expert and procurement expert. This section was responsible
for planning procurement, putting up procurement budget and getting necessary approvals, drafting
bidding documents, coordinating and controlling the activities implemented by Uzmedexport (procurement
agent) while procuring goods, selecting and hiring consultants and providers of training packages,
monitoring implementation of the contracts signed, coordinating activities with Uztibtehnika (delivery
agent) and the main department for controlling quality of medications and medical equipment (expert).

The Administrative Section is responsible for ensuring working conditions, labour discipline, keeping
records on staff, maintaining project inventory, and workflow management.

The Project Coordinator has also acted as a specialist for the “Development of primary healthcare sector?
component. The deputy executive director supported the executive director in implementing projects,
particularly, in the area of healthcare in general and project coordination. The project coordinator and
component specialists ensured implementation of activities aimed at achieving the project‟s objectives. In
particular, this included development of implementation plans, compiling and coordinating the list of
beneficiaries, the lists, quantities and technical specifications of the goods to be procured, terms of
reference for the consultants, monitoring and evaluation of component results, delivery and installation of
equipment by the suppliers, interaction with other stakeholders.


Relationship between project coordinators, decision makers, organizations responsible for
implementation of activities and other stakeholders

Experts group established at the MoH comprised managers and specialists from the MoH‟s departments
and other stakeholders, who were responsible for coordinating activities of the project participants. In
general, interaction between the JPIB team and responsible institutions and international organisations was
productive.

The project’s impact on health sector reforms

The Health II project was implemented in the framework of the Uzbekistan‟s State Programme for health
sector reforms (Presidents Decree Nr UP-2107 dated 10 November 1998).

The government has been implementing a comprehensive step-by-step reform package in the health sector
aimed at providing the population with high quality medical services. The Health II project which was a
logical follow up to Health I project was implemented in line with these reforms. The need for these
project was apparent from the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan No.
182 dated 21 May 1996 “On Rural Infrastructure Development Programme? which defined primary
healthcare as a priority area. A concept for the development of the health sector in Uzbekistan was
developed based on the objectives specified by the said resolution, and on 10 November 1998 the
President of Uzbekistan signed Decree Nr UP-2107 “On State Programme for Reforms in Health Sector of
the Republic of Uzbekistan?. The programme of further reforms in the health sector aims at creating a
system that would ensure keeping and raising the population‟s health levels, create conditions for
upbringing healthy generations. The President‟s initiative was supported by the World Bank which made a

                                                    58
decision to invest into a project for reforming the primary healthcare sector. Implementation of Health I
project aimed at strengthening of the primary health sector in five regions (Karakalpakstan, Ferghana,
Navoi, Khorezm and Syrdarya). The Health II project has ensured replication and strengthening of the
reforms.

A new concept of medical services delivery by the primary healthcare sector was developed and
implemented nationwide in the framework of these projects in a relatively short timeframe along with
institutionalisation of general practitioner based practice in the facilities.

Measures for introduction of per capita financing at primary healthcare sector have been approved by the
Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 217 dated 28 September 2005 “On measures for further
reforming the system of financing and management of healthcare facilities in the Republic of Uzbekistan?.
In accordance with the approved schedule, transition of rural PHC facilities to financing based on the
expenditures per capita of population has been implemented as planned and applied to all SVPs
nationwide.

Based on the priority objectives of protecting and strengthening the population‟s health and in accordance
with the international commitments of Uzbekistan (UN Millennium Development Goals and
WHO/Europe‟s Health21 programme) a draft Public Health Strategy has been developed covering the
period until year 2025. The document is currently undergoing Government scrutiny.

In accordance with the Resolution of the President dated 27/01/2010 “On the State programme for the
Year of Harmoniously Developing Generations?, the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan “On restricting
distribution and consumption of alcoholic and tobacco products? was developed and adopted on 5 October
2011. The draft law of the Republic of Uzbekistan “On accession of the Republic of Uzbekistan to the
WHO Framework Convention against tobacco? was prepared.

Development of HMIS under the project resulted in the creation of the Data Processing Centre under the
Ministry of Health. This Centre promotes the information system for monitoring communicable diseases
throughout the country and supports the creation of and IS for monitoring non-communicable diseases. In
the future, the Centre shall become a major tool supporting justified decisions related to healthcare system
management. Namely, under the Health III project, the Centre shall support implementation of HMIS at
RMUs, thus accelerating the reforms of management and funding nationwide.

Critical analysis of actions undertaken by the World Bank, Government and technical assistance


World Bank’s performance during project preparation and implementation

Despite the fact that the Task Team Leader along with the whole team managing the project has changed
three times throughout the project life, the WB has ensured continuous support and direct management
during project preparation and throughout the implementation period. Project preparation was supported
by substantial analytical research and technical assistance provided by WB experts. The direct control
implemented by the WB‟s project team facilitated timely identification of problems and development of
solutions. Two local staff responsible for project implementation have been replaced during the life of the
project, but both staff members had ensured high quality cooperation. Immediate response to requests,
experienced experts‟ opinions and very useful comments and suggestions coming from the WB team were
instrumental to the success of the project. The Ministry of Health and the JPIB very highly rate the
efficient cooperation with the WB.


Assessment of the Government’s actions during project preparation and implementation

The Health II project was implemented in the framework of the State Programme of the Republic of
Uzbekistan on Reforming the Healthcare System.

Development and reforms of the health sector under the project have always been closely followed up and
actively supported by the Government. The Government‟s commitment to timely construction and
rehabilitation of SVPs, laboratories at central hospitals, urban polyclinics, training and information centres
before any procurement of equipment under the project started was an important step. Moreover,
Uzbekistan had been regularly providing co-financing for the Health II project since 2005.

Development and implementation of key/innovative changes by the project were backed by relevant
Government Decrees and Resolutions.

On 28 September 2005 the Cabinet of Ministers issued resolution “On measures for further reforming the
system for financing and management healthcare facilities in the Republic of Uzbekistan? that defined
measures aimed at expanding the new financing mechanism to cover all rural PHC facilities and piloting
the experiment at select urban PHC facilities. The volume of funding allocated for the primary healthcare
sector has increased by over 4 times throughout the project life.

In December 2005, the Government issued Resolution No. 276 “On approving the improved system of
remunerating medical workers?, which sets the remuneration rates of general practitioners on par with
other specialists in light of the complexity and difficulties of the profession.

The Ministry of Health ensured compliance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement. The Government
and the WB were regularly provided with project progress reports and audited financial statements; round
table meetings and information briefing sessions to cover the project progress were regularly organised.
The project progress was regularly reported at Government meetings.


Assessment of the efficiency and the quality of relations between the World Bank and the
Government during project implementation



                                                     60
The Government cooperates with the World Bank in an efficient and creative manner. The first project
aimed at creating the national model of primary healthcare was implemented in 1998-2004 and has
contributed significantly to successful development and implementation of healthcare reforms in the
country. Further cooperation between the Government and the World Bank under the Health III project
shall be aimed at improving the quality of secondary healthcare sector. Cooperation between the
Government and the World Bank is characterised by substantial success of healthcare reforms.


Assessment of different stakeholders

In general, stakeholders were actively involved in project implementation thus contributing to
institutionalisation of innovations.


The project’s impact on the institutional structure created and supported by the project

The project has not only facilitated introduction of General Practitioners but, most importantly, has
changed the psychology and attitude of both doctors and the population to the new system. The project had
an impact through: (i) improving quality and accessibility of primary healthcare providers; (ii) improving
the economic efficiency of the primary healthcare system; and (iii) improving the population‟s awareness
of healthcare reforms.

The project had a substantial impact on the institutional framework and availability of resources at primary
healthcare facilities in rural areas throughout the country as well on the institutionalisation of general
practitioner‟s profession.

The data available shows that improvement of the primary healthcare infrastructure was achieved thanks to
the combination of the project‟s impact and that of other programmes implemented by the Government
with the support from donors, thus contributing to fulfilment of the main objectives of Millennium
Development Goals.

The project had a significant institutional impact on improving the public health strategy, promotion of
healthy lifestyle and community level and national approaches. The results of the project are used for
developing and improving the efficiency of national programmes, standards and methods in further
developing the PHC and GP systems.

In order to address the issue of availability of resources at PHC facilities, a system of centralised
procurement of medications and consumables for the SVPs was established. A system for technical
maintenance of equipment aimed at ensuring uninterrupted operation of the equipment supplied has been
developed and is being piloted in several regions.


Main lessons learned

The project‟s activities have supported and contributed significantly to improvement of the primary
healthcare system in the country.

The integrated approach used during project implementation involving construction, reconstruction and
overhaul of PHC facilities, RMUs, public health laboratories, strengthening of personnel at medical
facilities, introduction of new financing methods can serve as a model for future projects.


                                                    61
Measurability and comparability of the project‟s results were affected by irrelevance of indicators to the
project‟s objectives, and indicators had to be further clarified. The monitoring and evaluation system of the
project was jointly reviewed and simplified with the Ministry of Health in March 2008. More measurable
indicators relevant to the project‟s objectives were selected. Three new indicators were added to the results
framework matrix of the project in May 2010 following the restructuring of the project and introduction of
new activities and extension of project term.

The reforms of financing cover not only the healthcare system but also related agencies, such as the
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, State Statistics Committee and others. An Inter-Agency
Committee needs to be set up to coordinate introduction of new provider payment methods.

Procurement activities under the project started with 10 months‟ delay. The first set of bidding documents
for procurement of medical equipment and tools for 1815 SVPs was prepared and sent to the WB in
February 2005 (the budget of US$ 13.1 million USD). However, the Bank recommended negotiating direct
purchase of these goods with UNICEF (Aid Memoire by the WB mission in March-April 2005 and
subsequent correspondence). Agreement could not be reached with UNICEF for the following reasons: (i)
high prices and incomplete list of goods offered by UNICEF; (ii) unacceptable payment procedures under
UNICEF contract (100% down payment requested by UNICEF); (iii) refusal by UNICEF to accept the
procedures for controlling quality of medical goods as prescribed in the laws of Uzbekistan. At the same
time, procurement guidelines state that UN organisations can be contracted for procurement of: “(i) small
batches of off-the-shelf goods, mainly for education and healthcare sectors; and (ii) specialised products
with a limited number of suppliers, such as vaccines and medications?.

At the beginning of implementation, the JPIB signed a six-partite agreement with the agencies involved in
project implementation: the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Finance, Uzmedexport (Procurement
Agent), Uztibtehnika (Delivery Agent) and the Main Administration for Controlling Quality of
Medications and of Medical Equipment (Quality Control Expert). The Procurement agent was charged
with responsibility for development and distribution of bidding documents, sending invitations to bid,
evaluating bids, concluding and implementing contracts. JPIB was responsible for getting the bidding
documents, evaluation reports and other documents related to ICBs/NCBs with the WB or other
government institutions. The use of this scheme resulted in delays in procurement procedures. In March
2006, all functions related to BD preparation, announcing the tenders were handed over to the JPIB, later,
in October 2008, the whole process from BD preparation till getting WB endorsement of evaluation report
was assigned to the JPIB, and this resulted in reduced time required to finalise procurement and improved
quality of procurement.

Re-tendering was necessary in some cases due to: (i) lack of compliant bids; or (ii) prolonged failure of the
suppliers to perform their contractual duties (resulting in termination of contracts). Failure to deliver by the
suppliers had the most significant negative impact on project implementation. Namely, some companies
offer prices substantially lower (by several times) than the market price for the goods than the prices
offered by competitors. The company was awarded a contract as a result of this. Once the contract was
signed, the company fails to comply with contractual requirements on quality control (registration of
medical goods) or fails to ship. 21 contracts with 8 suppliers were terminated under the Health II project
for these reasons (one supplier holding 10 contracts, another supplier with 5 contracts and six individual
suppliers having 1 contract each) for a total amount of US$ 2.61 million. The use of loan proceeds for
procurement of small medical goods with low value is considered to be inefficient.




                                                      62
Sustainability of Project’s investments

The network of outpatient PHC facilities was rationalised and access of rural population to PHC services
improved as a result of project implementation thanks to: a) institutional strengthening and provision of
materials and technical resources to PHC facilities; b) institutionalisation of GPs through creation of
training centres and implementation of 10-month long GP training programme, reform of undergraduate
education system and introduction of continuous education cycle; c) expanding the financing and
management reforms introducing per capita funding mechanisms; d) improved public health functions
including sanitary-epidemiological surveillance.

The reforms in the primary healthcare sector resulted in improved quality of medical services and
increased patient satisfaction reduced the number of outpatient visits and the rate of hospitalisation to
rayon and regional hospitals.

The sustainability of activities implemented under the Health II project was further reinforced by the
Decree of the President of Uzbekistan Nr UP-3923 dated 19 September 2007 “On main directions of
further reforms and on implementation of the State Healthcare Development Programme?, the Cabinet
Resolution Nr 48 dated 18 March 2008 “On measures for improving organisational structure and activities
of regional health institutions? and the President‟s Resolution Nr PP-1652 dated 28 November 2011 “On
measures for further deepening reforms of healthcare system?.

The Health III project has been developed and is being implemented in accordance with the above
regulatory acts; this is indicative of the government‟s commitment to institutionalisation of reforms
envisaged in the project.


Conclusions

The primary healthcare sector in rural areas has been reformed in the framework of the Health II project.
The project established: a) a network of new/reconstructed rural medical centres (SVPs) equipped with
modern medical and diagnostic equipment that provide qualified medical services to the population free of
charge; b) a sustainable system for training and retraining General Practitioners for rural medical facilities;
c) the concept of family based medicine in urban areas is currently being implemented on a pilot basis; d)
new mechanisms of financing and management based on per capita financing principles have been
introduced at primary healthcare facilities; e) conditions were created at SVPs to introduce new approaches
in promoting health, proper nutrition among rural population and to prevent diseases; f) an information
system for electronic monitoring of communicable diseases has been developed and is currently being
rolled out.

Rationalisation and optimisation of primary healthcare in rural areas were completed as a result of the
project. Rural medical-obstetrical stations were abolished and rationalised, rural outpatient clinics have
been liquidated and the number of rural district hospitals was reduced. At the end of the day, the patient
referral system now has two levels instead of five: the SVP can refer to central district hospital.

               Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders



       The ICR Team met with development partners whose activities complemented or went hand-in-
hand with the Project, including ADB, JICA, WHO, UNDP and GIZ. This Annex reflects some of their
comments.

        ADB Health Project (USD& 40 million) was designed in very close collaboration with the World
Bank and addressed: (i) women and child health services; (ii) improving financial management and M&E
system in MoH, and (iii) blood system safety improvement through investments in capacity building, civil
works and equipment. Projects complemented each other as a result of joint planning, consultations,
roundtables and sharing information in design and implementation stage. Projects shared the same
implementation agency, JPIB which contributed to improved efficiency on both sides and led to savings
and improvement in training, knowledge sharing and capacity building. Both sides made efforts to
synchronize their schedules to have joint supervision missions. ADB evaluated collaboration with the
Bank as superior.

       JICA complemented Health 2 project by supplying 114 SVPs with equipment for laboratories,
gynecology and with sterilizers. They evaluated joint planning and coordination very positively.

        WHO assisted Health 2 by providing expertise and technical support in areas of public health,
mental health, nursing, nutrition, and GPs capacity building. They described their relation to the Bank very
positively, highlighting regular exchange of information and follow up meetings during every Bank‟s
mission, and their relations to JPIB as a partnership. WHO illustrated cooperation the success and great
impact of the Primary Health Conference in Tashkent in September 2010 involving all the development
partners active in Uzbekistan, which was jointly organized by WHO and Health 2.

         UNDP collaborated with the Bank within the Health 2 project on supporting renewable energy
initiative for SVPs. Upon Bank‟s initiative, having experience with renewable energy, UNDPs support was
carried out in four phases: (i) Feasibility Study analyzing different options for 4 regions; (ii) technical
demonstration by equipping, testing, monitoring and exploring different options for 4 different buildings in
respective regions – 2 of 8 pilots were SVPs; (iii) analysis of findings based on criteria agreed with the
Bank, and (iv) presenting report proposing universal solution. UNDP evaluated collaboration with the
Bank very highly. However, the renewable energy initiative did not materialize due to the Government‟s
decision to opt for supplying SVPs with medical equipment instead.

        GIZ started its first health related project in Central Asia in 2009 and benefitted greatly from
resources such as tools and guidelines from Health 2 on capacity building of nurses and GPs. GIZ noted
that the Bank-financed projects created a good platform for normative basis and institutionalization of
CME which along with regular communication and information sharing created a favorable environment
for other donor‟s participation.
