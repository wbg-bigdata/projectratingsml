FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FIRST MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN)
Beneficiaries:      Katsina State Water Board (KTSWB), Kaduna State Water Board
(KDSWB), and Federal Ministry of Water Resources (FMWR)
Amount:             SDR 74.7 million (US$101 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity
Onlending Terms:    The Federal Government of Nigeria will onlend US$51.5 million to
Katsina State and US$47.5 million to Kaduna State at standard IBRD
variable interest rate for twenty years including a five-year grace
period. State governments will pass on the credit amounts for
technical assistance and rural water supply as equity and onlend the
remainder to the water boards at 15% interest, with 25 years maturity
including 6 years ol -ace, and will bear the foreign exchange risk.
US$2 million will ' retained by FGN to assist other states in project
preparation.
Project Description:  The primary objectives of the proposed project are to improve the
quantity and reliability of water supply to the more important
communities in the two states and to help in commercializing the two
water boards. Physical components include: (i) rehabilitating existing
facilities and/or increasing supply in seven towns; (ii) providing tools,
equipment and water meters; and (iii) limited rehabilitation of rural
water supplies. Technical assistance would be provided for: (i)
improving technical and financial management of the boards including
increased commercialization; (ii) improving operational efficiency; (iii)
improving planning procedures; (iv) institutional reorganization of the
rural water supply sector to improve the sustainability of future
investments; (v) improving environmental sanitation; (vi) traimng; and
(vii) preparing water projects in other states of Nigeria.
Benefits and Risks:   The provision of adequate potable water supply and sanitation is a
necessary prerequisite to improvement in public health, and to permit
the development of urban areas as centers of economic growth.
Industrial development in several of the towns included in the project
has been prevented by the lack of water supply, and the living
conditions, particularly of the poor, have become, in many cases,
intolerable. The project will help to create the proper conditions for
growth; it will improve the living conditions of the poor; and it will
reduce the time spent by women in water collection. Risks include the
possibility that counterpart funds will not become available as needed



- ii -
and that the states will hesitate to sufficiently increase tariffs to finance
the long term operation and maintenance needs of the water boards.
These have been addressed by arranging for counterpart funds to be
deducted at source, and by designing practical and politically
acceptable tariff increases, including up-front increases, consistent
with the expected improvements of service.
Rate of Return:      9.8%

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FIRST MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
A.    Background
1.01   Nigeria is the most populous country in Sub-Saharan Africa with a population, given
by the 1991 census, of 88.5 million. It is located between latitudes 4°N and 13°N and has an
area of approximately 925,000 km2. The climate varies from semi-arid in the north, with
about 500 mm of rainfall per year, to wet and humid in the south with over 2,000 mm.
There is a well defined wet season in the summer, -xtending for as little as four months in the
north to as long as seven months in the south. In the north, the terrain is flat with sparse
natural vegetation, across the center, there are hills and granite outcrops with savannah type
vegetation, while in the south the terrain is generally flat with tropical forest vegetation.
1.02   The form of government is a federation comprising 30 states plus the Federal Capital
Territory (FCT) of Abuja. Under the Constitution, provision of potable water supply is the
responsibility of the state govermnents. Within eacb state, the responsibility for water supply
in urban and semi-urban areas is usually assigned to a water board or corporation (the State
Water Authority (SWA)).
1.03   Over the last ten years, the states have made substantial investments in water supply.
However, the absence of maintenance coupled with economic constraints has led to severe
deterioration of even comparatively new systems. The recent depreciation of the Naira
relative to other world currencies has caused the water boards to have difficulty servicing
foreign loans incurred before devaluation, implementing new projects, and importing the
necessary spare parts and replacement equipment to keep existing public water supply systems
in good order. A study carried out in 1987 indicated that the cost of rehabilitating all urban
and semi-urban systems would be about US$800 million. Another study carried out in
preparation of the proposed project, indicated that a similar amount would be needed over
twenty years to rehabilitate and expand urban and rural water supply to provide a satisfactory
standard of service in just one state.
B.    Water Resources
1.04   The main rivers (Benue and Niger) and their major tributaries are perennial, as are
other rivers in the south of the country. Some rivers in the northern states draining into the
Benue/Niger system and into the Chad Basin are seasonal, and do not have any significant
flow in years of low rainfall. In these northern areas the exploitation of surface water for
water supply and irrigation requires impounding reservoirs, but because of high temperatures,
low humidity and paucity of deep reservoir sites, evaporation losses are high. In the central
and southern areas of the country, major perennial rivers are frequently exploited for water
supply by direct abstraction. The wide variations in rates of flow and water level, and the
meandering low flow channels in many places, tend to increase the costs of water intake
works. High intensity rainstorms cause soil erosion, and the resulting highly turbid water
increases treatment costs. Use of surface water for drinking water supply always requires full
treatment which includes clarification, rapid sand filtration and disinfection.



- n -
1.05   Parts of the country have underlying sedimentary deposits containing aquifers, which
are tapped by boreholes for water supply. Some of these are capable of sustaining high
yields, although over-abstraction in places is causing water levels to decline. In other parts of
the country, where crystalline rock formations occur, fracture zones can be exploited by
boreholes with relatively low yields suitable for rural and semi-urban supplies. Although
some large towns and cities have been supplied from boreholes in the past, most major cities
will be dependent on surface water sources, possibly supplemented by groundwater, within
the next few years. Groundwater usually requires treatment only by disinfection; however, in
some places it is very corrosive and has a high iron content, requiring additional treatment.
C.    Manrower Resources
1.06   The SWAs account for employment of some 25,000 staff nationwide. In general,
SWAs have too many low level staff with minimal qualifications (high rates of illiteracy are
reported in some states) and too few technically or professionally qualified personnel. There
is a low level of management awareness at middle and higher levels, with little emphasis on
managenment training for technical specialists who enter management. Many of the staff who
are academnically well qualified have not gained work experience in a supervised professional
environment and may, therefore, be unable to provide appropriate technical support to the
SWAs.
1.07 Review of staffimg profiles and training needs is required in most SWAs to define
where staff need to be recruited or retrained (para. 2.08), and where shedding of unskilled
and unqualified staff is required to improve management, operation and maintenance. SWAs
would be more efficient if they were free from civil service regulations regarCirg staff
grading, promotion and remuneration to enable them to compete effectively in the open
market in recruiting qualified, experienced and skilled staff for management, supervision and
technical duties.
D.    Level of Servce
1.08   Although accurate data are not available, most of the existing urban water supply
systems are not capable of meeting requirements. Due to failure of pumps, generators or
other equipment, fewer than 10 percent of all water supply systems are reported to be
operating at their design capacities. In addition, the output of some systems is limited by fuel
shortages as a result of insufficient funds. The average piped water supply to urban and semi-
urban populations is in the r.mge of 10 to 40 liters per person per day Ocd), but many semi-
urban communities do not have access to any public water supply. It is estimated that only
about half the total urban and semi-urban population has access to reliable water supplies
which mee: minimum quality requirements for drinking water.
1.09   Sanitation systems in most areas are the responsibility of Local Government
Authorities (LGAs). There is practically no sewerage service, most sanitation using on-site
waste disposal. Service provided is generally inadequate in the larger towns due to la.k of
financial and technical resources. Improvement of these services is vital in maintaining public
health and preventing further environmental deterioration (see Annex 2.9). Improvements
will require strengthening of the LGAs or other sanitation authorities and sustainable
budgetary provisions supported by realistic tax policies.



- 3 -
1.10  An estimated 55 million people live in rural areas. Despite the Government's recent
efforts to improve rural conditions, many households still rely on the most rudimentary water
and sanitation facilities. The majority is at risk from disease, particularly from Guinea
Worm, largely because access to reliable supplies of water of acceptable quality is still low.
E.    National Sector Institutions
1.11   The Federal Ministry of Water Resources (FMWR) is the technical and professional
arm of the Federal Government that advises on all aspects of water resource development in
Nigeria. It has eight departments, each of which is headed by a Director: (i) hydrology and
hydrogeology; (ii) irrigation and drainage; (iii) water supply and quality control; (iv) dams
and reservoirs; (v) flood and erosion control; (vi) plar-i4g, research and statistics; (vii)
finance and supplies; and (viii) personnel management. The Department of Water Supply and
Quality Control (DWSQC) has been established to carry out advisory and monitoring
functions in connection with water supply, sanitation and water quality control.
1.12   FMWR is responsible for overseeing the 11 River Basin Development Authorities
(RBDAs) (para. 1.14) and the National Water Resources Institute (NWRI) in Kaduna (para.
1.15). It is also responsible for monitoring both the hydrological networks throughout the
country and water use activities of SWAs, the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), the
Inland Waterways Department and others.
1.13   The National Technical Committee on Water Resources (NTCWR) is the main link
between organizations involved in water resource development and urban wate- supply. The
Committee which meets about four times a year, is chaired by the Director General of the
FMWR and members of the Committee are representatives of SWAs, RBDAs, NEPA,
Nigerian universities with water resource faculties, the meteorological services, the Inland
Waterways Department and the Nigerian Society of Engineers. Inputs to the NTCWR are
provided by five working level sub-committees, namely: irrigation and drainage; manpower
development; hydrology and hydrogeology; water supply and sawtitation; and dams. The
NTCWR advises the National Council on Water Resources, which is chaired by the Minister
of Water Resources.
1.14   The River Basin Development Authorities (RBDAs) were estz-'iOied during the 1970s
to develop water resources for multi-purpose use within their respective iver catchment areas
and to enhance agricultural produrtion. In 1985, the Federal Governmenit decided that the
role of the RBDAs would be limited to water resource development and irrigation works and
the collection of hydrological, hydrogeological and meteorological data. The main
involvement of the RBDAs in water supply has been the construction of multi-purpose dams
which provide water for irrigation as well as for some major urban water systems.
1.15   The National Water Resources Institute (NWRI), under the direction of FMWR, was
established to train middle level manpower involved in water resources development,
irrigation, water supply and related activities. The qualifications conferred by the Institute are
recognized by the education authorities of Nigeria. The curricula of the Institute are designed
to satisfy an increasing need for training in practical skills and at the middle management
level.

F.    State Water Agencies (SWAs)
1.16  In most of the 30 states and the FCT, responsibility for all potable water supply is
assigned either to a state water board or corporation or to a public utilities board which is also
responsible for rural electrification. SWAs have, however, for the most part concentrated on
urban and semi-urban areas. Each SWA is controlled by a Board comprising members
appointed by the state government, one of whom is designated chairman, and ex-officio
members designated by title (e.g., Commissioner of the State Ministry of Finance). The chief
executive is normally given the title of General Manager and is usually a professionally
qualified engineer.
1.17   The SWAs are responsible to their state governments, generally through Ministries of
Works or Water Resources, although in a few states they report through a Commissioner for
Parastatals or Special Duties or other special assistant to the Governor. The SWAs have, in
general, been established under well conceived legislation to develop and manage water
supply facilities within their respective states, and to meet sound financial objectives.
However, almost all SWAs depend on subvention from the state government to cover at least
part of their recurrent operating costs. In addition, all SWAs are dependent on funds for
major new construction work, either from state government sources or from external lending
agenciss channeled through the state government system. Thus, most SWAs have little
autonomy to decide on vital matters affecting their financial position, such as staffing levels,
staff compensation, tariffs and procurement.
G.    Katsina State Water Board (KTSWB)
1.18  The Katsina State Water Board was established by amendment of the Kaduna State
Water Board Edict of 1971 at the time Katsina State was divided from Kaduna State, under
the terms of the Katsina State Amended Edict 1987. The main duties of the Board are to
control and manage all water works vested in the Board; to establish, control, manage, extend
and develop new and existing water works as may be necessary to meet the requirements of
the general public, agriculture, trade and industry; to ensure that water is supplied at
reasonable cost and in potable quality and adequate quantity; and to conduct appropriate
research. In practice it is responsible only for urban and semi-urban water supply systems.
The Board is required by the edict to conduct its affairs on a commercial basis and is given
wide powers to establish and collect water rates and raise capital. Its autonomy is limited,
however, in that principal fiscal matters are subject to the approval of the Governor.
1.19   The KTSWB has a two-tier management structure. The first tier comprises the central
headquarters, and the second district and zonal operations. A Board of Directors, appointed
by the Commissioner for Water Resources, formulates policies and guidelines. The Board
consists of 14 members, ten of whom are members at large and include representatives from
Local Government Authorities and four of whom represent state ministries. The chief
executive officer is the General Manager, who has the responsibility to execute the policies
and directives of the Board. He is assisted by five Assistant General Managers, responsible
for Administratioui, Operations, Projects, Commercial, and Accounting and Finance. The
Board currently has 690 filled positions. Its principal weaknesses are the lack of experienced
middle management and inadequate finance to carry out its duties.

H.    Kaduna State Water Board (KDSWB)
1.20   The Kaduna State Water Board was established by the Kaduna State Water Board
Edict of 1971. Its duties and responsibilities are similar to those of the KTSWB (para. 1.18).
1.21   The organization ana management structure of the KDSWB are identical to those of
the KTSWB, but with an additional division which assists in the maintenance of rural water
supplies. There are currently 1,662 staff. As with KTSWB, its main weaknesses are lack of
experienced mnddle level managers and lack of financial resources.
1.    Previous Bank Group Involvement in the Water Supplv Sector
1.22   Past assistance by the Bank to the SWAs has mainly funded major new water supply
systems in state capitals and technical assistance for project planning and institutional
strengthening. The Bank has been involved in lending for four major urban water supply
projects, of which two, Borno (Ln 2528-UNI approved June 1985) and Lagos (Ln 2985-UNI
approved July 1988), are under execution and two, Kaduna (Ln 171 1-UNI approved May
1979 and Anambra (Ln 2036-UNI approved July 1981) have been completed. Lessons
learned from these projects, particularly from the Kaduna Water Supply Project (PCR No.
8961), have been taken into account in designing this project. These relate particularly to the
need to ensure a reliable flow of counterpart funds for implementation (para. 2.15), to define
clearly the needs for technical assistance (extending beyond immediate commencement of
operation of the project facilities) and to provide support for programs to reduce unaccounted-
for water (para. 2.07). In the ongoing projects, there have been long delays in procurement
and an apparent reluctance to go ahead with technical assistance, and the water boards have
generally not been able to meet the financial agreements. These concerns have been
addressed through up-front tariff increases (para. 3.08) and appointment of consultants for
most critical technical assistance as a condition of effectiveness (para. 2.11) as well as
preparation and covenanted use of standard bidding documents (para. 2.09) and covenanted
adherence to a dated, implementation plan (para. 2.11) and a feasible financial recovery plan
(para. 3.08). The Bank has also approved the National Water Rehabilitation Project (NWRP,
Ln. 3322-UNI, approved May 1991), which will provide limited funds (up to US$10 million)
to each state for urgently needed rehabilitation works and equipmen'. The NWRP will also
assist institutional strengthening by improving workshop facilities, providing vehicles for
maintenance, improving laboratory facilities, improving billing and collection, manpower
audit and training needs analysis, and training. States participating in NWRP would be
required to increase tariffs to meet all cash operating costs from revenues within five years.
J.    Sector Strategy
1.23  In common with most sectors of Nigeria's economy, the immediate needs in the water
supply sector are the rehabilitation of existing systems and improvements in operation and
maintenance. Initially these are being addressed by the NWRP which is expected to finance
about 25% of the total rehabilitation needs throughout the country, and to start to address
some institutional needs (para. 1.22). Many of the systems to be rehabilitated are more than
twenty years old, so capacity will be inadequate even after rehabilitation, due to large
population increases. Rehabilitation therefore needs to be followed by programs of carefully
planned expansion and improvement of existing systems as well as selected new systems to
provide acceptable service to the rapidly increasing population. Such programs would be



accompanied by institutional strengthening. Many water authorities in Nigeria have
experienced high costs relative to income, and this has been particularly severe during the
economic dislocation of the past decade. A strategy to improve the financial condition of
water authorities has been developed (see Annex 1.1 ). The proposed project would meet the
objectives of the strategy by minimizing costs and improving sources of revenue. It would, in
particular, improve the financial reliability of sector institutions through revenue collection
and cost recovery measures so that service can be maintained and expanded over the long
term. This would require more demanding cost recovery measures than under the NWRP,
whereby depreciation or debt service costs would also be recovered.
K.    Rationale for IDA Involvement
1.24   The project would form part of the Bank Group's program of assisting to develop
Nigeria's infrastructure and is an essential element of the country's economic development,
since adequate water supply is necessary for the efficient functioning of cities, maintenance of
health standards, and to improve the living conditions of women and the poor. It will
incorporate aspects of several of the Bank Group's programs of special emphasis such as
poverty alleviation, women's development, environment, and public sector management all of
which are important to development. The Bank Group now has considerable experience in
water supply in Nigeria, aid has a comparative advantage in encouraging institutional
development and long term sustainability, and ensuring the appropriateness of investments.
The NWRP commenced during 1991 and the proposed project and any similar future projects,
would provide additional finance and support for states which desire to further improve and
expand their water supplies and are prepared to adopt the necessary financial measures to do
so.
II. THE PROJECT
A.    Project Objectives
2.01   The project originated as a result of the large gap between available water supply and
demand and the need to improve the service offered by the State Water Authorities. Four
states were initially considered for inclusion in the project, however, coverage was restricted
to two states to lessen proJect complexity. It would aim to support economic growth by
enhancing health and productivity of growing urban areas; it would promote equity, helping to
alleviate poverty by improving health standards of the lowest income urban households and
the living conditions of women; and sustainability would be ensured by support for institution
building and financial self sufficiency. The primary objectives of the proposed project are to
improve both the quantity and reliability of water supply to the more important towns in the
two states to meet basic needs and as an essential step in promoting economic development, to
help in commercializing the water boards, and to assist in preparing water projects in other
states.
B.    Project Design
2.02   Existing water supply facilities are described in Annex 2.1. The water boards'
investment programs, including the physical components of the project, have been designed



- 7 -
by the boards assisted by consultants and IDA, to provide for the most urgent needs and to
maximize the utilization of existing water supply facilities. With this in view, rehabilitation
(including work under the NWRP) has been given highest priority, including the restoration
of existing works, the matching of distribution capacity with water production capacity, and
the repair of water leakage in the distribution systems. Systems have been designed with
limited capacity consistent with conservative demand projectioris, to account for considerable
tariff increases which will be required under the project. Demand projections have been
based on a usage of 20 lcd for users of public standpipes, and from 80 to 100 lcd (increasing
up to year 2005) for consumers with house connections (para. 4.07). Industrial and
commercial demands of up to 37% of the domestic demand have been added, depending on
evaluations made by consultants for each town. In determining the required production
capacity, allowance for unaccounted-for water has been made, reducing over five years from
a present amount of up to 50% (average 42%), to about 25% as a result of the works to be
undertaken under the NWRP and the improved management which would be achieved under
the proposed project. Annex 2.2 provides details of population and demand projections for all
towns serviced by the two water boards.
2.03   During project preparation, studies of Katsina State Water Board (KTSWB) and
Kaduna State Water Board (KDSWB) were carried out by consultants. They made similar
recommendations, concurred by IDA, including limited structural changes to the Boards'
organizations, and greater commercialization, including improvements in tariff and charging
policies, consumer metering, and accounting (including computerization). The Boards have
made modifications to their organizational structures in response to these studies, and have
accepted the other recommendations in principle. A program of technical assistance to assist
in commercialization of the Boards and to further strengthen their operations has been
developed (para. 2.07). Other studies recommended devolution of responsibility for rural
water supply to the LGA level and development of a mechanism by which a contribution
would be made by the beneficiaries to implementation and to operation and maintenance.
This concept has been accepted by both states, and Katsina has taken an initial step by
separating rural water supply responsibilities from KTSWB; appropriate changes would be
supported under the project (para. 2.07). Agreement was reached at negotiations that each
state will by December 31, 1994, reorganize the rural water supply sector accordingly and in
accordance with national strategy being developed by FMWR. The project allows for
financing a small amount of work to improve rural water supply after this reorganization has
been completed, to consolidate the proposed new methodology.
C.    Project Description
2.04   The project would include: (i) physical rehabilitation of existing systems; (ii) selective
increase of supply facilities; (iii) improved operation and maintenance practices; (iv) improved
investment planning; (v) setting and achieving realistic financial objectives; and (vi)
manpower development. The most urgent rehabilitation work in each State, including a leak
detection and repair program and the supply of some operational equipment and water meters
would be undertaken under the NWRP in accordance with an agreed program (para. 2.11).
Agreement was reached at negotiations that each state will participate in the NWRP.
2.05  In Katsina State, the project would include the following components (refer also to
Annex 2.1):



(i)    completion of about 15 km of water transmission, 65 km of distribution
pipelines and elevated storage in Katsina town and nearby communities to
permit distribution of the full supply from the existing water works;
(ii)   construction of a new system to augment the existing sul ply at Funtua. This
would include a new dam, water treatment plant, transmission pipeline to
town, system storage and extended distribution system;
(iii)  limited expansion of the Dlaura water supply system including new boreholes
to increase water production;
(iv)   remedial construction of the dam at Malumfashi;
(v)   supply of maintenance vehicles, tools and operational equipment, water
meters, and meter testing and repair facilities;
(vi)  limited rehabilitation of some rural water supplies; and
(vii)  institutional and financial strengthening as described below (para. 2.07).
2.06   The project for Kaduna State would include the following (refer also to Annex 2.1):
(i)   completion of the water treatment plant, and construction of transmission and
distribution pipelines and system storage at Ikara;
(ii)   construction of new regional water supply systems at Kwoi and Zonkwa, each
including intake works, water treatment plant, transmission mains and
distribution systems. Zonkwa would also include a small dam;
(iii)  supply of maintenance vehicles, tools and operational equipment, and water
meters;                                                                        U
(iv)   limited rehabilitation of some rural water supplies; and
(v)   institutional and financial strengthening as described below (para. 2.07).
2.07   The program of technical assistance in each state would include: (i) improvement of
the water board's operation and maintenance practices, including a review of technical aspects
of its operations to reduce costs (such as for power and chemicals) and minimize unaccounted-
for water, assistance to implement the results of the review, development of maintenance and
stores procedures (including inspection of dams), and improvement of planning procedures
(Terms of Reference at Annex 2.3); (ii) improvement of accounting, billing, collection, and
management information systems (building on work under NWRP), including computerization
where appropriate (Annex 2.4) and a thorough program of metering of consumers; (iii) a
tariff study including recommendations for collection from public standpipe users (Annex
2.5); (iv) undertaking a public relations and hygiene education program to improve the
awareness of the communities of their benefits and obligations regarding public water supply,
and how to maximize their health benefit (Annex 2.6); (v) support for the reorganization of



-9-
rural water supply (para. 2.03 and Annex 2.7); (vi) preparation of state-wide water resources
master plans including socio-economic studies (Annex 2.8); and (vii) development of plans for
sullage disposal, drainage and improved sanitation (Annex 2.9).
2.08   There will be a considerable amount of practical on-the-job training included in the
project under several components of the technical assistance program, which will commence
during the early stages of project implementation. Under the NWRP, consultants are now
being employed to analyze the required staffing profiles for state water boards, identify the
most critical training needs in the sector and the capability of local training institutions to
meet those needs. This is expected to be completed and reviewed with the Bank during 1992,
and provision has been made under the proposed project to finance formal training of KTSWB
and KDSWB staff in line with these proposals developed under NWRP.
D.    Status of Preparation
2.09  In Katsina State, the physical components of the project are in varying stages of
preparation. Designs for the new works for Katsina town, for Funtua dam and for remedial
works at Malumfashi dam, have been prepared by consultants and are ready for tendering. In
Kaduna State, designs have been prepared by consultants for most of the major works
required under the project, but will need to be reviewed and updated before inviting tenders,
expected to be within six months of credit effectiveness. A model bidding document has been
prepared for NWRP and agreement was reached at negotiations to its use in this proposed
project. Draft terms of reference for technical assistance have also been prepared (para. 2.07)
and agreement to their use was reached at negotiations.
E.    Proiect Implementation
2.10   Each water board would manage its component of the project under its Projects
Division. Consultants would be employed to assist the Boards in managing the project and to
take responsibility for contract administration and construction supervision, and to train board
staff. These consultants would also be responsible for review where necessary of designs
prior to tendering. Although the two projects divisions concerned have limited experience in
the management of projects of this size, with the assistance of the consultants for construction
supervision and with strong supervision by IDA, they would be able to implement the project.
Agreement was reached at negotiations that the state governments will continue to employ in
the SWB people with sufficient experience to manage the project.
2.11   A project implementation schedule is at Annex 2.10. Implementation of the project is
expected to be complete by the end of 1998 and the proposed credit closing date is September
30, 1999. During negotiations, assurances were received that each water board will follow
the implementation program in Annex 2.11 to ensure all aspects of the project are properly
implemented and to assist in the institutional development of the board, and regularly
exchange views with IDA on their performance and undertake appropriate remedial measures.
Appointment of the consultants for design review and construction supervision and for
improving the efficiency of operations of the boards (two consultancies are required in each
state) would be undertaken in at least one state prior to effectiveness of the proposed credit.
Appointment of these consultants in the other state would be a condition of disbursen   in
that state.

F.       Project Cost
2.12    The total project cost is estimated at US$128.2 million, including a foreign exchange
component of US$101 million, or about 79% of total project costs. These estimates include
about US$7 million equivalent in taxes and duties. Detailed cost estimates are in Annex 2.12.

2.13   Base costs are expressed in March 1992 prices. Cost estimates were prepared by
consultants in 1990 and have been updated to reflect increases in price since that time.
Physical contingencies of about 10% have been added to the base cost o' the physical
components. Price contingencies have been based on 20% increase in local costs in 1992,
15% in 1993, 12.5% in 1994 and 10% annual increases thereafter and on increases in foreign
costs of 2.5% in 1992, 4.6% in 1993 and 4.1% per year thereafter, to reflect anticipated
inflation in Nigeria and on a basket of Nigeria-specific imports.
2.14   Provision is made for about 2000 man-months (80% local) of consultant input to assist
the water boards witi. construction supervision, and about 400 man-months (45% local) for
the technical assistance and studies.
G.    Project Financing
2.15   An IDA Credit of SDR 74.7 million (US$101 million equivalent) to the Federal
Government of Nigeria (FGN) is proposed under standard IDA conditions with 35 years
maturity. This would be onlent to the two participating states, US$51.5 million equivalent to
Katsina and US$47.5 million equivalent to Kaduna, and US$2.0 million would be passed on
as grant to other states for studies. It would finance 100% of the foreign costs of the project,
about 83% of total cost exclusive of taxes and duties. For the Katsina and Kaduna States
components, Agreement was reached at negotiations that onlending will be at IBRD variable
interest rate for 20 years including 5 years of grace, and that the states will bear the foreign
exchange risk. Agreement was also reached that the states will pass on those parts of the
credit related to technical assistance and rural water supply as equity (US$2.3 million
equivalent for Katsina and US$2.4 million equivalent for Kaduna), and onlend the remainder
to the water boards, for 25 years including 6 years of grace, at 15% interest rate. The
interest rate has been set taking into account the poor financial situation of thr two SWBs,
which currently do not recover recurrent costs from revenues, and the need for a realistic
financial recovery program to be effected over the next six years (para. 3.0f ). A subsidiary
loan agreement would be required between FGN and each of dth two states and between each
state and its water board. Signing of the sub-loan agreements by one state would be a
condition of credit effectiveness and signing by the other state would be a condition of
disbursement in that state. Local funds required for the project would be provided by the
state governments as equity. During appraisal, each state's finances were reviewed and it was
indicated that the project would not create an unbearable burden on state finances (para.
3.03). At least one state would give instructions, binding over the life of the project, to the
Federal Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (FMF&ED) to deduct its share of
the project's finances from its Federation Account in equal monthly installments and deposit
into a state project account as a condition of credit effectiveness. An initial deposit equal to
the first monthly installment would be made in the state project account as an additional
condition of effectiveness. These two conditions would be required by the other state as
conditions of disbursement in that state. The financing plan for the project is indicated below.

H.    Procurement
2.16   Procurement arrangements for the project are summarized in the table below. For
procurement purposes, the project would be divided into about 12 major works components
(including the supply of the necessary materials). Contracts for these would be awarded after
International Competitive Bidding (ICB). In addition, about four contracts for the supply of
operational equipment and water meters would be awarded after ICB. The major
procurement packages are detailed at Annex 2.13 Operational equipment and other
miscellaneous goods estimated to cost less than US$100,000 per contract and not more than
US$1.0 million in aggregate, would be procured through international shopping with the
evaluation of price quotations from at least three suppliers. Procurement of further
operational equipment estimated to cost less than US$200,000 per contract would be under
local competitive bidding (LCB), up to a total value of US$1.0 million. For rural water
supply rehabilitation and other minor works there would be little interest by foreign
contractors, since it is scattered geographically and spread over time; procurement by LCB is
proposed, in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA which would include local
advertising, public bid opening, clearly stated evaluation criteria and award to the lowest
evaluated bidder. Foreign firms would be allowed to participate. The total value of such
procurement would not exceed US$1.7 million, about 1.3% of the total project cost with a
maximum contract value of US$0.5 million and an average of about US$200,000. Prior IDA
review of advertisements, bidding documents, tender evaluations, recommendations for
awards and draft contracts, would be required for all contracts over US$200,000 equivalent,
covering, in value, over 95% of the contracts to be awarded. Consultants to be financed
under the project would be selected in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines for the
Use of Consultants. Detailed consultant requirements are at Annex 2.14.

Total                                    101.0
Disbursements would be completed by September 30, 1999. Annex 2.15 presents the
expected annual disbursements for the project and the standard disbursement profile for
similar projects in Africa. Projected disbursements lead the profile in early years of the
project because of the advanced state of preparation of some components and the measures
that have been taken to advance project procurement activities.
2.19  In order to facilitate implementation of the project, a Special Account in foreign
currency would be established for each state and for FMWR in a commercial bank, on terms
and conditions acceptable to IDA. Initial deposits of US$1.5 million each would be made to
each state account, and US$0.2 million to the FMWR account, sufficient to cover estimated
eligible disbursements over four months. The accounts will be replenished against withdrawal
applications with standard documentation for eligible reimbursable expenditures. All
disbursements under the project would be made against standard documentation except for
contracts of less than US$50,000 equivalent which may be claimed under Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs), with related documentation retained for review by IDA supervision
missions. During negotiations, agreement was reached that, by June 30 each year, the state
water boards will submit to IDA the financial statements of the Special Account, Project
Accounts and SOEs for the preceding calendar year, audited by an independent auditor
acceptable to IDA.
J.    Land Requirements
2.20 Each water board has land rights for its water supply systems. Most proposed new
works, including reservoirs, will be located on land owne: oy the Government, which will be
available to the Boards at no cost. Land for the Zonkwa :eservoir has been reserved for
many years, and no resetdement is required. Land for the Funtua reservoir is being acquired,
and resettlement of a few hundred families is required. A satisfactory plan for resettlement
has been developed in consultation with the people being relocated.
K.    Project Supervision
2.21   Each water board would submit quarterly progress reports for review by IDA. In
addition, three IDA missions per year, each staffed by a sanitary engineer, a financial
analyst/institutional specialist and an operations analyst and other specialists, and each of
about two weeks duration, would be required during the first three years of the life of the



- 1S-
project and two per year thereatter to support project implementation. Missions would review
project management performance, progress with the physical components of the project and
the institutional development measures required, exchange views on SWB performance
compared to the agreed implementation program (Annex 2.11) and physical and financial
targets (para.3.13), and agree on remedial measures. A supervision plan is given in Annex
2.16. Total input required by IDA would be about double an average infrastructure project in
Nigeria. During negotiations, agreement was reached that a mid-term review would be
undertaken b3 the end of 1994 to review project management, progress against the action
program (Annex 2.11) and development of the Boards against agreed performance indicators
(Annex 3.3) and to agree on any necessary corrective actions.
111. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.    State Governments' Finances
3.01   A summary of Katsina and Kaduna State of 1990 actual and 1991 budgeted receipts
and expenditures is presented in Annex 3.1. Katsina State receipts and expenditures are
budgeted at N 1.1 billion for 1991. The State relies heavily on statutory revenue from the
Federation Account (N763.0 million or 69% of total receipts) and capital receipts
representing grants and external loans (N253.4 million or 23% of total receipts). Internally
generated revenues (N82.8 million or 8% of total receipts) provide the balance of Katsina
State financing. Kaduna State receipts and expenditures are budgeted at N 1.5 billion for
1991. The State is also heavily dependent on statutory revenue from the Federation Account
and capital receipts (combined N1,209.6 million or 80% of total receipts). Internally
generated revenues (N300.0 million or 20% of total receipts) comprise the remainder of
Kaduna State receipts.
3.02   The State governments have the main responsibility for ensuring the financial solvency
of the SWBs. They are the sole owners of the SWBs; approve all water charges; and provide
subventions to the SWBs to cover rural water supply operations and maintenance costs, debt
service payments, investment requirements and any shortfalls in operating income. The States
of Katsina and Kaduna in 1990 provided N27.9 million (3.6% of Katsina State total receipts)
and N 120.7 million (14.8% of Kaduna State total receipts) to their respective SWBs. Total
1991 contributions to the SWBs are budgeted to reach N41.6 million (3.8% of state total
receipts) and M 118.4 million (7.8% of state total receipts) in Katsina and Kaduna States,
respectively.
3.03   The financing plan for the project includes State governments' financing of all local
costs, amounting to N370.5 million for Katsina State and N321.3 million for Kaduna State,
spread over the implementation period. The State governments would be required to provide
counterpart funding in equal monthly installments (para. 2.15). In addition, the State
governments will be responsible for repayment to the Federal government of the IDA credit
and the associated foreign exchange risk. As both SWBs plan to participate in the NWRP
(para. 2.04), the State governments will also be responsible for a small amount of counterpart
funding and debt service on the related IBRD loan. The financial objectives under the
proposed project are two-fold: (a) to improve the financial performance of the SWBs to the
point where they are able to cover their recurrent costs and debt service payments, and (b) to
relieve the heavy burden on the State governments' finances. Under this approach, State



- 16 -
governments' subvention to the SWBs to cover their operating income shortfalls and debt
servicing would be phased out by 1998; State govermnents' financing to the SWBs would be
limited to provision of local counterpart funding of the investment program, if any, the debt
service related to NWRP and the foreign exchange risk on the IDA Credit. Under this
scenario, Katsina State government financing would drop from a peak in 1993 of 7.4% of
anrual State receipts and then fall rapidly to about 2% of State receipts in 1999, while Kaduna
State government financing would peak in 1992 at 11.3% of annual State receipts and decline
to less than 1% in 1999 (Annex 3.1).
B.     SWBs' Past Financial Performance
3.04   The SWBs' past (1989 and 1990) and budgeted (1991) financial performance is
summarized in the table below and detailed in Annex 3.2.

Operating loss          -9423      -16672    -20784    -64930    -49021   -39152
Past and budgeted financial results of the SWBs show large operating losses, a generic
problem in Nigeria as discussed in Annex 1.1. The State governments provide subventions to
cover the recurrent operations shortfall, rural water supply operating expenses, debt servicing
and investment funds.
3.05   The principal reasons for the SWBs' poor financial performance are:
(a)  Tariffs. Estimated average 1989 tariffs (Katsina, Nl. 19tm3 and Kaduna, N0.48/m3)
are well below production costs for even well-managed water utilities. The last tariff
increase prior to 1990 was in 1985. Over the four year period (1985-1989) local
inflation was 133% and the Naira was devalued by over 700%; real average tariffs
thus fell sharply.



- 17 -
(b)  Collections. Collection/billing ratios for 1989 (Katsina, 70% and Kaduna, 71 %) are
low. Part of the collection problem stems from consumer resistance to pay for poor
and unreliable service.
(c)  Unaccopnted-for Water. Estimated unaccounted-for water (Katsina and Kaduna, both
over 40%) is high, resulting in a combination of increased operating costs and
reduced revenues.
(d)  Staffing. Number of employees (Katsina and Kaduna, both around 35
employees/1,000 connections) is excessive, particularly at the unskilled level (para.
3.08).
3.06   Because of past poor financial performance, the KDSWB has a large accumulated
operating deficit resulting in negative capital of N283 million as of December 31, 1990. In
addition, the State government has been picking up the Board's debt service payments under a
previous IBRD loan. These payments totaling t381 million as of December 31, 1990, have
been treated on the books of KDSWB as an outstanding loan. As a condition of credit
disbursement for Kaduna State, the State government would restructure KDSWB's capital and
long-term liabilities by converting its loan to equity and make arrangements that debt service
payments on behalf of KDSWB during the transition to full cost recovery be treated as a
grant. The conversion of debt to equity would achieve a satisfactory debt/equity ratio. The
KTSWB capital structure is sound, with no long-term debt.
C.    SWBs' Financial Policy and Tariffs
3.07   The Edicts establishing the SWBs provide for a reasonable financial policy: revenues
shall be sufficient to cover operations and maintenance costs and debt servicing and such other
sums as may be proper to set aside for general reserves, extensions, renewals, depreciation,
etc. The Executive Council of each state is responsible for approving all water rate increases.
3.08   The State governments approved and implemented a three year (1990-1992) package
of water tariff increases designed to offset operating cost increases, particularly in chemical
and power costs, and improve the financial performance of the SWBs. Rate increases range
upward from 83% for public institutions, 133% for residential users, and 180% for
industrial/commercial consumers. Tariff structures are presented in Annex 3.4. Despite the
substantial rate hikes, the SWBs will need to carry out a medium-term program of further
tariff increases and operational improvements to meet minimum financial requirements, i.e.,
revenues sufficient to cover operations and maintenance costs and debt servicing. A sustaired
six year program of tariff increases in real terms (KTSWB, 17% p.a. and KDSWB, 14%
p.a.) plus operations improvements, including, inter alia, reductions in unaccounted-for water,
improvements in collections, manpower rationalization and reorganization of rural water
supply operations, is required. The KTSWB has recently begun its program to shed staff by
spinning off the rural water supply operation. The above program would allow: (a) the
KTSWB to fully cover from revenues its operations and maintenance costs by 1994 and, in
addition, its full debt servicing costs by 1998, and (b) the KDSWB to meet from revenues its
operations and maintenance costs by 1993 and additionally its full debt servicing costs by
1998. Agreement was reached at negotiations that each SWB will adjust tariffs and take other
actions as necessary to meet its operations and maintenance expenses and debt servicing costs
and performance indicators (para. 3.13) in accordance with the following timetable.

While projected tariffs appear to be affordable (para. 4.07), a study to be carried out under
the project would address the present differential tariff structures, including the need for and
effectiveness of cross subsidies among and within consumer categories, an overhaul of public
standpost billing and collection and effects on revenue of nearly universal consumption
metering (para. 2.07).
D.    SWBs' Billing and Collection
3.09   The KTSWB and KDSWB have 21,400 and 45,600 water connections, respectively.
Metering is limited, for the most part, to high usage industrial, commercial and public
institution consumers. Most residential accounts are not metered. Neither of the SWBs has
operational meter testing and repair facilities. Estimated unaccounted-for water is over 40%
in Katsina and Kaduna. A program to reduce unaccounted-for water, including consumption
and production metering, will be financed under the project (para. 2.07) and the National
Water Rehabilitation Project.
3.1L   Billing systems for the two SWBs are similar. Bills are prepared manually, except in
the Kaduna City District, where computerized billing by a private data processing bureau has
been recently introduced. Metered connections are billed monthly, while flat rate domestic
connections are billed quarterly in Katsina and bi-monthly in Kaduna. Collection/billing
ratios are poor, but improving: KTSWB collected 70% of billings in 1989 and 80% in 1990;
KDSWB collected 71 % of billings in 1989 and 80% in 1990. Net accounts receivable at
year-end 1990 amounted to N4.4 million, equivalent to about five months' billings, for
KTSWB, and N30.1 million, equivalent to almost nine months' billings, for KDSWB. Over
60% of the SWBs' combined accounts receivable are due from private consumers, which is
symptomatic of consumer resistance to pay for poor and unreliable service. Many of the
accounts are old or represent flat rate billings to consumers who received no water because of
supply outages or distribution breakdowns. The two SWBs should carry out a major accounts
collection and write-off exercise. Assistance will be provided under the project to improve
the billing and collection systems, including consumer relations programs and further
computerization (para. 2.07).

E.      SWBs' Accounts and Audits
3.11    The two SWBs have similar financial management systems. Annual budgets are
prepared, with actual revenues and expenditures compared with budget amounts on a quarterly
basis. Manual accrual basis accounting systems, with separate profit and loss accounts for
each district, are maintained. The SWBs prepare monthly district income statements and
semi-annual financial statements; yearly accounts are normally available within four months of
year end. The accounting and reporting systems are adequate but can be improved. Financial
management improvements under the project would assist the SWBs in fixed assets and
inventory valuation and control, micro-computerization of accounting systems and additional
training.
3.12    The Auditor General of each state appoints an external auditing firm to examine the
SWB's accounts. The external auditors expressed unqualified opinions on the SWBs' 1990
financial statements. Aereement was reached at negotiations that the SWBs' annual accounts
and audit reports will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal
y=ar.
F.      SWBs' Future Financial Performance
3.13    One of the project's main objectives is to improve the operational and financial
performance of the SWBs. The proposed financial strategy is aimed at complete coverage
from the SWBs' revenues of operations and maintenance costs and debt servicing costs. The
improvements are phased in over a six year period, with subventions from the states to cover
the operations shortfall and debt servicing gradually reduced to nil by 1998. Summary
financial projections for the period 1992-1999 are presented in the table below and detailed,
along with assumptions, in Annex 3.2.

- 20-
3.14  Improvement in the SWBs' future financial performance is predicated on a
combination of tariff increases, operational efficiencies and sales volume increases. The
effects on the SWBs' future financial performance of not fully achieving the projected
efficiencies arnd volume increases are discussed below and detailed in the project files. The
financial sensitivity analysis for 1998, the last full year of project implementation, shows that:
(a) if sales volume is 10% less than projected, operating income would fall (KTSWB,
N 17.2 million; KDSWB, N37.0 million), and an additional tariff increase (KTSWB,
7%; KDSWB, 9%) would be required to cover the decrease in operating income;
(b) if improvement in unaccounted-for water is 50% of projected, operating income
would fall (KTSWB, N13.9 million; KDSWB, PN13.9 million), and an additional
tariff increase (KTSWB, 5%; KDSWB, 3%) would be required to cover the decrease
in operating income; and
(c)  if collections rate is 90% of projected, operating income would fall (KTSWB, P25.6
million; KDSWB, N47.7 million), and an additional tariff increase (KTSWB, 11%;
KDSWB, 119e%) would be required to cover the decrease in operating income.
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND IMPACTS
A.    Project Be:iefits
4.01 When fully operational in 1999, the project will provide improved water supply to
about 1.0 million people in urban areas in Katsina and Kaduna States, including about 0.6
million who had not had water supply previously. For the 0.4 million already having supply,
service will be improved from providing limited quantities of water of marginal quality for
only a few hours each day, to a continuous supply of potable water sufficient to meet
domestic, commercial and industrial demands. A further 2.6 million will bene5it indirectly
from more commercially and service oriented water boards. In addition, some of the
groundwork will be done to improve water supply to over five million rural people.
4.02   Direct project benefits include increasing the quantity, quality and reliability of water
supplies, thereby improving public health by providing an adequate amount of potable water
for personal cleanliness and hygiene. Continuous pressure would eliminate the presene danger
in some areas of drawing back contaminated water into the network. The project would
reduce the time spent, mostly by women, in water collection duties. Water would also be
available to meet the projected demands of commercial and industrial users, thus removing an
obstacle to the development of these sectors, and permitting the development of urban areas as
centers of economic growth.
4.03   The project would reduce operating costs and improve the operating efficiency of the
two state water boards. It would improve the management ability and performance of the
water boards, thereby raising their public image, a prerequisite to encouraging consumers to
pay for their water supply. It would develop the water boards into self supporting and
sustainable entities with realistic long term development goals. It would also unburden them



- 21 -
from the difficult demands of the rural water supply sector, which will pass to the local
government and community levels which are better placed to bear them.
B.    Least Cost Solution
4.04   The proposed project has been designed following review of alternative development
programs and addresses the highest priority needs in this sector in the two states. The scope
of each sub-project is sufficient for anticipated demands, and where appropriate, only limited
first stage developments have been included in the project. Expensive investments in
headworks have been postponed where possible, and consequently further stages will be
required in the future as demands for water increase. The technology adopted has also been
kept at an appropriate level, but will be reviewed for some items and modified as necessary
before inviting tenders. The project is the least cost solution to the provision of water to the
project beneficiaries, a large proportion of whom are at or below the poverty level.
C.    Environmental Impact
4.05   The proposed project would not be expected to have significant adverse impact on the
enviromnent, but rather to improve well-being, health and sanitary conditions in the project
area. However construction of two new dams would increase the habitat for mosquitos and
bilharzia snails and could cause downstream pollution by sediments during construction if not
managed properly. In addition, both dams could be subject to pollution from activities in
their catchments. Environmental assessments have been prepared for both dams, and these
are summarized in Annex 4.1 for Funtua, and Annex 4.2 for Zonkwa. During negotiations, a
mitigation plan to minimize environmental impact relating to the two dams, including the
hiring of a health specialist by December 31, 1992, was discussed and agreed (Annex 4.3).
Where appropriate, the actions required under the mitigation plan have been incorporated into
the implementation program (Annex 2.11), or agreed terms of reference, or will be
incorporated into bidding documents. A limited resettlement effort is required and is being
undertaken (para. 2.20). The project would increase the use of water, and consequently the
amount of wastewater which must be disposed of. Guidelines would be developed under the
project to improve environmental sanitation in each state, and plans would be formulated to
improve drainage of sullage and stormwater in project towns (Annex 2.9). Any detrimental
effect would be minor with no lasting or irreversible impact.
D.    Poverty Impact and Affordability
4.06   About half of the beneficiaries of the proposed project are at or below the poverty
level. By 1999, most households within the project area would be served by the project,
including about 500,000 people at or below the poverty level. Project expenditure directly
related to the poor is estimated at about US$44 million, 34% of total project costs.
4.07   The poverty threshold in urban areas in Nigeria is estimated at about US$1180 per
year for a family of eight members, based on 1988 prices. Monthly household water
consumption for the poor, utilizing public standpipes, is estimated at about 4.8 cubic meters.
At the higher tariff levels required under the project, this would represent US$8 per year, or
about 0.7% of current family income, which is affordable. For those with house connections,
monthly household water consumption would be in the 15 to 30 cubic meters range, which



- 22 -
would represent more than US$36 per year, or in excess of 3% of poor family income. This
is probably near the limit of affordability, and hence .iany poorer consumers would
prefer to utilize public standpipes, or at least severely limit their water consumption. In
estimates of water demand for project design, about 43% of consumers were assumed to
obtain their water from public standpipes.
E.    Adequacy of Tariffs
4.08   The average incremental cost of water to be produced under the proposed project is
estimated at about N 12 per cubic meter. The highest block of industrial tariffs would
increase this level after proposed tariff increases, but the high ',lock domestic tariff would
remain below this figure even after being increased by about two and a half to three times (in
real terms) as is proposed under the project. A study to be carried out under the project
(para. 2.07) will establish appropriate tariff levels and structures to ensure that all high block
tariffs at least equal average incremental cost.
F.    Economic Rate of Return
4.09   Economic analysis of urban water supply projects raises difficult issues related to
quantification of benefits from the project such as the measurement of benefits from improved
health, improved productivity, and the promotion of further economic activity. There are
serious methodological issues associated with quantification of these economic benefits for
water projects and this will generally lead to serious under-estimation of benefits. For the
proposed project, perceived value of water to the consumer has been accepted as one measure
of its economic worth, although it does not necessarily incorporate its full value. In these two
states, consumers typically pay the equivalent of N 10 per cubic meter to vendors for up to 30
liters per person per day, and up to the equivalent of N250 per cubic meter for smaller
quantities during the dry season. The first of these figures has conservatively been adopted
together with the projected average tariff of N4 per cubic meter at a consumption of 90 liters
per person per day to provide a crude indication of willingness to pay, yielding a minimum
value of economic rate of return (ERR) for the project of 9.8%, 12.8% for Katsina and 6.3%
for Kaduna. Details of the ERR calculation are presented in Annex 4.4. Rate of return is
lower for Kaduna because of the nature of the developments being undertaken, economy of
scale factors and differing hydrological conditions. ERR is sensitive to the value placed on
the first 30 liters per person per day, a 10% decrease in this value reducing ERR to 9.1 %,
but less sensitive to average tariff, 10% decrease causing ERR to fall to 9.7%. A 10%
increase in capital costs would cause ERR to fall to 8.9%. Taking an alternative approach to
quantification of benefits, assuming a 10% reduction in health care costs, and a 5% increase
in per capita productivity as the value of benefits, yields an ERR of 14.4% for the project
(16.7% for Katsina and 11.8% for Kaduna), these figures being almost proportional to
assumed percentage improvement in productivity. To some undetermined extent this value
would be in addition to the values indicated by households' willingness to pay, however, no
attempt has been made to estimate this, or to quantify other potential benefits, and the figures
given are, therefore, likely to under-estimate the ERR. During project implementation an
imprc A means of measuring socio-economic benefits under the project will be established,
as part of the component to prepare follow-on investments.

G.    Project Risks
4.10   The type and scale of the various sub-projects to be undertaken are not uncommon in
the Nigerian context, and there is no unusual risk associated with their implementation. The
major risk associated with the project is that counterpart funds would not be available as
required, a factor which has delayed previous projects. To overcome this problem, at least
one state would agree, as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit, to give authority
to the FMF&ED, binding over the life of the project, to deduct its share of the project's
finances from its Federation Account and deposit into a project account according to an
agreed schedule, including the making of the initial deposit (para. 2.15). The same conditions
would be conditions of disbursement for the remaining state. Establishment of such a
mechanism is now being required by the Federal Government for all state development
projects in Nigeria.
4.11   A second risk is that the states will hesitate to sufficiently increase tariffs to finance
the long term operation and maintenance needs of the boards and to cover debt service.
Agreement was reached at negotiations to phased tariff increases to meet the agreed financial
objectives (para. 3.08). The tariff study to be undertaken under the project, would
recommend tariff levels and structures and agreement was also reached on implementation of
the recommendations of the study (para. 2.11).
4.12   Management of the project will be in the hands of the two water boards, under their
projects departments, assisted by consultants for contract administration and construction
supervision. This will be a major undertaking which could tax their capacities, but it is
important for each board to accept this responsibility as part of its development process.
Agreement was reached that staff of sufficient experience would continue to be employed by
the SWBs to manage the project (para. 2.10) and their performance will be continuously
monitored (para. 2.21)
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
A.    Agreements Reached at Negotiations
5.01   During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria, that it will onlend the proceeds of the IDA credit to the states at the
IBRD variable interest rate for 20 years, including five years of grace (para. 2.15).
5.02   Agreement was reached with each state and its water board that they would:
(i)     reorganize the rural water supply sector by December 31, 1994, by
devolving responsibility to the local government and community
level and in accordance with national strategy being developed
(para. 2.03);
(ii)    participate in the National Water Rehabilitation Project (para. 2.04);
(iii)    use the model bidding document prepared for NWRP (para. 2.09);



- 24 -
(iv)    use agreed terms of reference for technical assistance under the
project (para. 2.09);
(v)      continue to employ in the SWB people with sufficient experience to
manage the project (para. 2.10);
(vi)    implement the project (including all technical assistance components)
in accordance with an agreed program (Annex 2.11) and regularly
exchange views and undertake remedial measures. (para. 2.11);
(vii)    pass on those parts of the loan related to technical assistance and
rural water supply to the water board as equity, and onlend the
remainder for 25 years including six years of grace, at 15% interest
rate with the State bearing the foreign exchange risk (para. 2.15);
(viii)    by June 30 each year submit to IDA the financial statements of the
Special Accounts, Project Accounts, and SOEs for the preceding
calendar year audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA
(para. 2.19);
(ix)    undertake a mid-term review of the project with the Association by
December 31, 1994, to review project management, progress
against the action program (Annex 2.11) and development of the
Boards against agreed performance indicators (Annex 3.3) and to
agree on any necessary corrective actions (para. 2.21);
(x)     adjust tariffs and take other actions as necessary to meet its
operations and maintenance expenses and debt servicing costs and
performance indicators (para. 3.08);
(xi)    submit to IDA the SWB's annual accounts and audit reports within
six months of the end of the fiscal year (para. 3.12); and
(xii)    ensure that the environmental impact relating to two dams is
minimized in accordance with an agreed mitigation plan that
includes the hiring of a public health specialist by December 31,
1992 (para. 4.05).
B.    Conditions of Credit Effectiveness
5.03   All of the following actions would be taken by at least one state prior to credit
effectiveness:
(i)     appointment by the water board of consultants for construction
supervision and for improving its efficiency of operations (two
consultancies are required)(para. 2. 11);



- 25 -
(ii)    signing of subsidiary loan agreements between the Federal
Government and the state, and between the state and its water board
(para. 2.15);
(iii)   giving instructions, binding over the life of the project, to
FMF&ED to deduct its share of the project's finances from its
Federation Account in equal monthly installments and deposit them
into a project account (para. 2.15); and
(iv)    deposit of the initial installment into the project account (para.
2.15).
C. Conditions of Disbursement
5.04          All of the following actions would be taken by the second state prior to
disbursement in that state:
(i)     appointment by the water board of consultants for construction
supervision and for improving its efficiency of operations (two
consultancies are required) (para. 2.11);
(ii)    signing of subsidiary loan agreements between the Federal
Government and the state, and between the state and its water board
(para. 2.15);
(iii)   giving instructions, binding over the life of the project, to
FMF&ED to deduct its share of the project's finances from its
Federation Account in equal monthly installments and deposit them
into a project account (para. 2.15); and
(iv)    deposit of the initial installment into the project account (para.
2.15).
5.05   In addition, for Kaduna State only, KDSWB's capital and long-term liabilities would
be restructured by converting its loan to equity and arrangements made that debt service
payments on behalf of KDSWB during transition to full cost recovery be treated as a grant
(para. 3.06).
D.    Recommendation
5.06   Having reached the agreements and subject to the conditions indicated above, the
proposed First Multistate Water Supply Project is suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 74.7
million (US$101 million equivalent) to the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FIRST MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Nigeria: Water Supplv Sector Strategy
I. Background
1.    Water utilities in many Nigerian States have faced difficult financial problems and
deteriorating economic conditions for some time. The high cost of imported equipment in
terms of the depreciating domestic currency and inadequate cost recovery policies have
contributed to large financial deficits. This has left most water authorities dependent on state
subventions to operate and maintain their water systems, to service debt and to finance new
investments. The states' own financial constraints have often limited the amount and
dependability of recurrent and capital subventions requiring the agencies to defer maintenance
and limit new investment. The examples from three Nigerian states, below illustrate the
magnitude of the problem.
2.    The Kaduna State Water Board (KSWB), starting from a low revenue and cost base in
1979, has incurred lcsses in she last 12 years. Whereas in 1979 KSWB could recover two-
thirds of its operating costs, having relatively little fixed assets and expenses, by 1989
operating costs (including cost of finance) had grown to 5.6 times total revenues. The
Anambra State Water Corporation (ASWC) has made losses since 1983 and these increased
from N6.3 million in 1983 to N 167 million in 1989, mainly due to the interest on an IBRD
loan and increased depreciation on new investments. The financial performance of the Borno
State Water Authority (BSWA) remained about constant from 1982 to 1988. Both years
showed annual operating losses of about N i million.
3.    Improved financial ptrformance of water utilities is essential for the public sector's
ability to improve the reliability of water service and to extend its coverage. To achieve this,
it is first necessary to understand the underlying causes of the financial losses in the sector.
Several factors, including poor management, poor investment planning, inefficient production
and distribution, lack of timely tariff measures, absence of financial discipline and
accountability, and the increasing cost of imported inputs in terms of domestic currency have
contributed to lack of financial viability in water utilities. This annex presents estimates of
the relative magnitudes of the factors contributing to poor performance in three water utilities.
It shows how these factors would be addressed under the proposed project and it suggests
elements of a longer-term strategy which would be developed for addressing these issues in
Nigeria.



- 27 -
Annex 1.1
Page 2 of 10
II. Factors in the Rising Cost of Water
A. Low Investment Efficiency
4.    Water production and distribution in Nigeria is very capital intensive, as indicated by
a low value of output per unit of investment. In Kaduna, the value of fixed assets was 28
times the revenue earned in 1989 and 12 times that of 1990. Some of the low efficiency of
investment may be due to the semi-arid nature of the state. More expensive water supply
headworks, such as dams, may be more necessary here than elsewhere in the country. In
some cases lower cost technology may be overlooked. Some project designers are not
familiar with least cost approaches and in some instances there has been over-investment in
headworks and an imbalance between production capacity and capacity for transmission and
distribution. This is compounded by a lack of appropriate materials and expertise locally and
poor supporting infrastructure such as power.
5.    Water supply investment appears to have been more efficient in Anambra State due to
a strategy of developing lower cost water from boreholes and greater autonomy in tariff
setting which have enabled ASWC to gradually improve its financial performance. By 1989,
ASWC's revenues from water sales were covering 73 percent of recurrent expenditures. The
value of fixed assets averaged only 4.5 times income earned for both 1989 and 1990.
However, fixed assets have not been revalued since 1982, so the actual situation is likely to
have been worse.
B. Poor Utilization of Capacity
6.    Data on production capacity and sales volume are incomplete, but clearly there is
scope for improvement. The volume of water sold in Kaduna is estimated at about 40 million
cubic meters in 1989, and as much as 44 percent of this output was unaccounted for in 1990.
One objective of the earlier project was to limit water losses to 25 percent of production
(some water leakage is not economical to curtail), but this met with limited success. Few
water systems in Nigeria are metered which would help in leak detection and could lower
consumption by up to 40%, enabling existing capacity to be used more effectively. In 1886,
unaccounted-for water at BSWA was estimated at 50%. Funding has been included in a
Bank-financed project for meters and other equipment to reduce unaccounted-for water to
28% by 1991, but this part of the program has not yet been initiated.
C. Debt Service
7.    Water utilities have high levels of liabilities compared to their value of assets. In
Kaduna, high liabilities are due to the first IBRD loan as well as debts to the state government
arising from accumulated debt service. KSWB's liabilities amounted to N890 million in 1990
or 47 percent more than its total assets. Up to now KSWB has serviced its external debts by
borrowing interest free from Kaduna State and in effect letting the state service its debts. As
a result, liabilities to Kaduna State amounted to N380 million in 1990.
8.    In Anambra's case debt service, largely on an IBRD loan, increased considerably
between 1987 and 1989 due to the depreciation of the naira against the dollar. Table 7
indicates the debt service increase from N 11 million in 1987 to N33 million in 1989.



- 28 -                               Annex 1.1
Page 3 of 10
9.    BSWA's capital structure at the end of 1988 is very strong, with a debt/equity ratio of
less than 0.25. The foreign exchange risk for a Bank-assisted project is being borne by the
state government, insulating the BSWA from devaluation. Debt service payments were
minimal through 1988 and had little effect on BSWA's financial results.
D. Exchange Rate Related Costs
10.   Rapid depreciation of the naira has led to large increases in the cost of imported
inputs into water production, such as chemicals and spare parts. The nominal rate of
exchange for the naira rose by a factor of 13.5 between 1979 and 1990. As shown in Table
1, in 1990, the cost of chemicals was 35 percent and electricity and lubricants 41 percent of
KSWB's income. In addition, the income statement shows a separate 'exchange loss" item
which was 6.8 times revenue in 1989 and 1.8 times that of 1990. Increases in the price of
electricity, also partly due to devaluation, have also contributed to losses by KSWB.
Devaluation of the naira affected BSWA's operating costs mainly through increases in
electricity cost. Power costs amounted to 56% of BSWA's 1988 revenues.
11.   Exchange rate changes also have had a very adverse effect on water boards with
foreign currency denominated debt. In Anambra, if loan interest and exchange losses are
excluded, operating losses dropped slightly from N6.3 million to N6.0 million during the
1987 to 1989 period. However, if the loan interest charges are included, the losses rose to
N 167 million.
12.   As the book value of fixed assets is aijusted to reflect their higher replacement value
due to the increasing value of foreign exchange, and as new equipment is purchased from
abroad, larger amounts must be set aside for depreciation. In Kaduna, depreciation
allowances were as much as 175 percent of revenues in 1989 and 83 percent of revenues in
1990. In ASWC fixed assets were last revalued in 1982 and all the subsequent depreciation
charges are based on historical book values, even though the replacement cost of the imported
equipment have increased markedly. The 1990 depreciation charge of 14.6% of operating
costs would have been much higher if fixed assets had been periodically revalued.
E. Water Agency Related Costs.
13.     Although most water agencies in Nigeria are legally boards or corporations, they
often function more as government departments. Government must clear procurement,
authorize staffing and salaries and approve tariffs. This close relation to government often
inhibits the financial and administrative autonomy of the boards, contributes to increased costs
through delays in approvals and makes it difficult for the water agencies to hire and retain
competent staff.
m. Inadequate Income Generation
A. Tariffs
14.   In most water utilities, income has remained depressed with infrequent revisions of
water tariffs and often with most water consumers charged a low flat rate regardless of the
amount of consumption. Free riding is also present. In Kaduna there have been tariff



- 29 -
Annex 1.1
Page 4 of 10
increases but adjustments have been too infrequent and have not matched increases in the cost
of production. Since 1978, the average water rates which were less than NO.30 per cubic
meter were raised several times and a more differentiated rate structure has been adopted.
However, rate increases were relatively moderate up to 1990. BSWA's tariffs have not been
increased since 1987 leading to a serious deterioration in the Authority's financial
performance. ASWC took steps to improve its income in 1983 with a 75 percent tariff
increase. This resulted in monthly revenue collections almost three times those of the
previous year. A more fundamental improvement was achieved in 1988 when the State
Government allowed ASWC to make yearly tariff adjustments of up to 20 percent without
authorization from government.
15.   A comparison between the rate of increase in nominal wages and the changes in the
price of water would shed some light on prices that the low income households can pay for
water. Although wages and personal income data are not readily available for Nigeria, a
large decline in real per capita income, particularly in dollar terms has taken place since
1980. Between 1980 and 1987, real incomes are estimated to have fallen by 62 percent for
the urban households and by 30 percent for the rural households (see Table 2). This may in
part explain the political reluctance and the real limits to raising water tariffs more rapidly
and frequently. Lack of political autonomy of the Water Boards in most states adds to the
political difficulty of tariff adjustments in line with increasing costs.
B. Billing and Collection
16.   Inadequate billing systems and poor collections have often constrained the income of
water authorities. Water authorities do not appear to have a firm grasp on the volume of
output, amount of water lost through "free-riders" usage and uncollected accounts. In
Kaduna, amounts collected were about 80 percent of billings until recently. Large water
consumers, including the public sector, owed KSWB N35 million in 1990, an amount equal
to 85 percent of sales in the same year. BSWA did an excellent job of collections in 1988,
with a collection/billing ratio of 100%. Despite this effort, customer accounts receivable at
the end of 1988 still represented over 11 months of annual sales. In Anambra, billing and
collection operations have been relatively successful with 77% of the billings collected in
1990 and 80% in the first six months of 1991. This is mainly due to the commercialization
of these operations during the early stages of the project implementation.
IV. Sumrnny
17.   It is clear that the large and persistent losses by water authorities are due to a number
of factors. Much of the increase in cost was related to the economic instability, structural
adjustment and devaluation which took place in the 1980s. In 1989 in Kaduna exchange
losses (revaluation of debt in naira terms) were 55% of total expenses (see Figure 1). The
cost of finance, chemicals and energy, as well as higher depreciation allowances, all of which
are linked to the rate of exchange, increased as the international value of the naira fell adding
to the cost of devaluation. At the same time, water sales, denominated in domestic currency
and sensitive to the purchasing power of low income consumers, whose real incomes were
falling, could not increase in real terms. Even though revenues from water sales rose by a
factor of 4 in Kaduna from 1979 to 1989, costs rose by a factor of almost 8 during the same



Annex 1.1
Page 5 of 10
period (see Table 1). These factors help to explain the impact on Nigerian water utilities of
past financial deterioration .
18.     Even before Nigeria's economic situation worsened in the early 1980s, water
authorities faced difficulty charging and collecting economic tariffs for costly water systems.
In many states the cost of water production and distribution of a unit of water are high
relative to per capita income which suggests than the issues related to cost and income
outlined above must be confronted even in the absence of economic destabilization. Exchange
rate depreciaticon exacerbated an already critical situation.
V. The Proposed First Multistate Water Supply Project in the Context of Sector Issues
19.   The proposed water supply project for Kaduna and Katsina States is designed to
address, during the project period, most of the issues outlined above and thus reduce the risk
of repeating past problems.
A. Cost Factors
20.   Investment Efficiency. Alternative development programs have been carefully
reviewed, and the proposed program would address the highest priority needs in the two
states. The scope of each sub-project is sufficient for anticipated demands and, where
possible, limited to first stage development to minimize costs. Expensive investment in
headworks have been postponed where possible until demand increases, and the extent of
distribution will be balanced with production capacity. Appropriate technology has been
adopted, and some items will again be reviewed and modified before inviting tenders.
Assistance to reduce operating costs is also included in the project.
21.   Capacity Utilization. Unaccounted for water is estimated at about 44% in Katsina and
41 % in Kaduna. Each Board has already initiated a program of leak detection and repair.
An action program, including technical assistance, has been agreed upon to reduce losses
further. Managers are being made aware of the large potential benefits of loss reduction. A
program of metering is being introduced to enable an analysis of the water system efficiency
and particularly to identify leakage. Targets for water waste reduction are included in the
monitoring indications which will be reviewed carefully by supervision missions.
22.   Debt Service. The Katsina State Water Board is relatively new and has very little
debt. The Kaduna State Government has been repaying loans for KSWB which accumulated
up to N381 million up to the end of 1990 and has been treated as a loan to the KSWB. At
present KSWB cannot service the loan, so it has been agreed under the project that the State
Government will restructure KSWB's liabilities, converting its accumulated arrears to equity
and assuming its loan payments. In order to help the Board to return to financial viability,
the State Government will continue to service the loan on a grant basis until KSWB's income
permits it to resume the payments as well as to cover its other obligations under the loan.
(about 1998).
23.   Foreign Exchange Risk. In the proposed project, both State Governments will assume
the foreign exchange risk, thus relieving the Boards of a cost which has been heavy in the
past, which is very difficult to pass on to their consumers and which is beyond the control of



31 -                              Annex 1.1
Page 6 of 10
the water utilities. The experience of BSWC has shown that when water utilities are isolated
from foreign exchange risks, the financial position will stabilize.
B. Income Generation
24.   Water Tariffs and Collections. Both State Governments have agreed to cover
recurrent cost and debt service cost from beneficiaries by 1993 and 1998 respectively. As a
first step in achieving this, both State Governments have implemented large, up front tariff
increases ranging from 83% for public institutions, 133% for residential users and 180% for
industrial/commercial users. The rates now allow for a graduated structure based on volume.
Kaduna is already recovering 81% of recurrent costs, which is unusually high in the Nigerian
context, and Katsina is recovering 46%. A program of 10% to 35% annual stepped increases
in real terms has been agreed upon so that the boards will meet recurrent and debt service
costs by 1998.
25.   Billing and Collection. Both boards collected about 80% of billings in 1990, up from
about 70% in the previous year. Assistance will be provided under the proJect to further
improve the billing and collection systems and to write off uncollectible debts. A customer
relations program and further computerization will also be included.
26.   More Rizorous Enforcement of Covenants. Progress in meeting covenants in past
Credit Agreements is being monitored much more rigorously in Nigerian projects. As a
result one state government is being notified of the Bank's intention to suspend disbursements
if substantial progress is not made soon in addressing financial and institutional development
covenants. In addition, extension of closing dates on other Loans and Credits now depends
upon satisfactory progress complying with loan agreements.
VI. Confronting Longer-Term Issues in the Water SuDIly Sector.
27.   Some of the more fundamental issues in the sector are being dealt with over
the longer term through collaboration of the Bank and the Government of Nigeria.
28.   Use of Affordable Technology. It is important to keep project costs affordable. With
so much water supply equipment imported, devaluation of the naira has clearly been a driving
force behind the inflation of water supply costs. Present exchange rates should increase the
incentive to produce more water supply equipment and chemicals in Nigeria. Ways to
improve local production of inputs required should also be explored. The use of low cost
options should be explored where feasible. Especially until the financial incentives governing
investment decisions in water authorities are improved, it is important to improve investment
analysis, especially forecasts of demand to ensure appropriate scale and efficient use of
resources, and appropriate technical design.
29.   Enhanced Autonomy. More emphasis is needed in the future on the autonomy and
accountability of water supply agencies. More autonomy to control staffing, to enhance tariffs
(within established limits) and to manage procurement can significantly improve efficiency, if
combined with sufficient financial accountability. The case of ASWC demonstrates the
importance of autonomy in tariff setting. It was granted autonomy by the State Government



- 32 -
Annex 1. 1
Page 7 of 10
to make limited tariff adjustments. The result was a dramatic improvement in cost recovery
from 20% of recurrent costs in 1983 to 73% in 1989. Delegation of other types of authority
from the Lagos State Government to the Lagos State Water Corporation (LSWC), such as
authority to approve contract awards below certain thresholds, have been discussed but not yet
acted upon.
30.    Private Sector Participation. Private sector participation is a way to reduce costs,
assign accountability and improve efficiency. Water supply agencies in several countries have
increased the efficiency of their operations through private sector participation of various
types. Private participation can be used in fairly simple management contracts, for example,
maintenance contracts or contracts for billing and collection. Alternatively, the private sector
can be placed in charge of most aspects of the utility with contracts to maximize incentives for
efficiency. With growing world-wide recognition that public sector utilities invariably face
political pressures which compromise economic efficiency and financial performance, private
sector participation should be seriously considered. The World Bank, with the assistance of
federal and state water supply agencies in Nigeria, is currently examining specific ways of
introducing private sector participation in Nigerian water utilities under a separate study.'

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FIRST MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Description of Water Supply Systems
Katsina City
1.    The Katsina water supply system serves Katsina city and several neighboring towns
and villages. The system which was built in 1975, is supplied from the Ajiwa dam and 50
MLD (recently increased from 25 MLD) treatment works, approximately 20 km east of
Katsina. The treatment works use conventional processes of clarification, filtration and
chemical dosing. Water is pumped from the treatment works to a 14.5 ML ground level
concrete reservoir near Katsina. From this reservoir, water flows by gravity to a booster
station in Katsina which then feeds two identical 2.3 ML elevated storage reservoirs in
different parts of the city. Gravity feed distribution mains extend from the elevated reservoirs
to supply Katsina city as well as areas outside of Katsina.
2.    A large number of open wells throughout the city are still used consistently. Most of
these are polluted to some degree. Consumers in some areas experience inadequate water
pressure for more than 8 hours per day due to inadequate capacity of the distribution system.
3.    Under the project about 80 km of transmission and distribution pipelines, pumping
stations, and an additional elevated reservoir, will be constructed within the town.
Funtua
4.    The existing Funtua system serves Funtua town and extends about 20 km to Bakori
and Kabomo. Raw water comes from Mairuwa dam approximately 12 km northwest of
Funtua. The treatment works, near the dam site, consist of a conventional plant with a
capacity of 4.5 MLD and a prefabricated package plant having a capacity of 2.3 MLD. The
conventional plant was commissioned in 1971 and the package plant was added in 1983. At
present, only the conventional plant is operational, due to difficulties in conveying raw water
to the package plant in the dry season. Water is pumped from the treatment works to a 2.25
ML circular concrete reservoir on a hill in Funtua, and distributed from there. There is also
a borehole at Bakori which feeds into the system and produces about 100,000 liters per day.
The current water requirement far exceeds the existing supply, and numerous open wells
throughout Funtua make up the shortfall.
5.    Under the project a dam would be constructed on the River Gwagwaye located within
5 km of the existing Mairuwa Waterworks. A two staged program is considered. Stage 1,
financed under the project, would include construction of the dam and 15.2 km of 800 mm
diameter pumping main to Funtua designed for the maximum potential output available of 30
MLD. The treatment works, pumping stations storage reservoirs and reticulation network
reinforcements would be sized at 20 MLD. Stage 2 would provide the balance of the safe
yield available from the dam, 10 MLD.



Annex 2.1
37 -                           Page 2 of 3
Malumfashi
6.    The existing system consists of an impounding reservoir at the Turo dam, a 3.5 MLD
conventional treatment plant feeding a 4.5 ML elevated steel storage reservoir, and a
distribution system in Malumfashi town. The source and treatment works are located about
15 km north of Malumfashi, while the storage reservoir is located approximately 1 km south
of town on a large rock outcrop. A transmission main also extends 30 km to Kankara, which
has a 0.23 ML elevated storage reservoir and distribution system.
7.    The dam has many problems including poor construction, noticeable settlement,
seepage, inadequate spillway, erosion in spillway channel and vegetation growth on both
faces. The safety of the dam cannot be assured unless remedial works are undertaken. Work
to be done includes raising the dam crest by 1.9 m to prevent overtopping, construction of a
new spillway, repairs to intake tower outlet gate and landscaping the downstream face for
erosion control.
Daura
8.    The Daura city water supply is based upon 9 boreholes. Water is pumped from the
operating boreholes to two elevated steel storage tanks for gravity distribution throughout the
city. The tanks have capacities of 0.9 ML and 0.23 ML respectively. Water will also be
piped 12 km to Sandamu via a booster station. The current water supply from the operating
boreholes is approximately 2.9 MLD. The water distribution system consists of 75, 100 and
150 mm AC pipe, reaching most areas of the city. Work to be included in the project
includes augmenting supply capacity by increasing the number of boreholes, about 14 km of
distribution pipeline, stores, and repair facilities.
Ikara
9.    The present supply at Ikara is from individual wells, which are inadequate particularly
in the dry season. Commercial/industrial activity in the town (food processing) has been
hindered through lack of water supply. The civil works have been completed for several
years for the Gimbawa dam, pumping station, rising main, and water treatment plant,
however no mechanical or electrical equipment has been installed. The project will finance
pumping and water treatment equipment of 4 MLD capacity (of 8 MLD ultimately proposed),
10 km of 300/400 mm diameter transmission main to the town, about 20 km of distribution
network, and system storage.
Kwoi
10.   At present water supply in Kwoi is obtained from wells via water vendors or from
individual household wells, which are inadequate particularly in the dry season. Lack of
water supply is hindering further development of the town. The project would finance a weir
intake on the Gurare River, a pumping station and conventional water treatment plant of about
6.5 MLD capacity, about 14 km of 350/400 mm transmission pipeline to the town, system
storage, and about 75 km of distribution network up to 400 mm diameter.



- 38 -                            Annex 2.1
Page 3 of 3
Zonkwa
11.   The present situation in Zonkwa is similar to that in Kwoi. The project will finance a
new dam, intake pumps and treatment plant of about 5.0 MLD capacity, 5 km of 300 mm
transmission pipeline, system storage, and about 70 km of distribution network up to 250 mm
diameter.
Kaduna and Zaria Cities
12.   Although not benefiting directly from new works under the project, both Kaduna and
Zaria cities will feel the influence of institutional development bv the Kaduna State Water
Board. Each of these towns is served by a dam, conventional water treatment plants, and
distribution network. In Kaduna, there are three plants of capacity 150 MLD (financed under
Ln. 171 1-UNI), 54 MLD, and 27 MLD. In Zaria there are two, of 50 MLD and 10 MLD.
There is currently excess capacity in Kaduna, but a major shortage in Zaria where additional
reservoir and treatment capacity are required, subject to further studies.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FIRST MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Projections of Population and Water Demand
1.    Demand projections have been based on estimates made by consultants of populations
and forecast population growth, and an anticipated consumption per person, with allowance
for industrial and commercial needs. The last official census in Nigeria was in 1963, and the
results are generally considered suspect. However these results have had to form the basis of
population projections, with comparisons being made with other statistics such as school
enrollments and voting registers. Populations served by the various systems vary from about
30% up to 95% of total service area population at present, with an objective of 95%. The
estimated current populations and projected populations for all towns served by the two water
boards, including all project towns, are shown in the attached tables.
2.    In projecting water demands, towns have been divided into three categories, large,
medium, or small, and different proportions of consumers utilizing house connections (HC)
and standpipes (SP) have generally been assumed for each, as follows:
HC%/SP%
Large towns                1990                50/50*
2005                65/35
Medium towns               1990                30/70
2005                40/60
Small towns &              1990                15/85
semiurban                  2005                20/80
* Except Kaduna city and Zaria where alternative figures were adopted to better fit
current statistics, 62/38 in Kaduna and 45/55 in Zaria, increasing to 70/30 and 55/45
respectively.
Per capita demand has been projected conservatively to increase from 80 litres per day in
1990 to 100 in 2005 from house connections, and to remain constant at 20 litres per person
per day for standpipe users. In fact, these quantities will rarely be available in all towns from
house connections, since at all times there will be a deficit in supply capacity in at least one
town of the state. Averages for all towns supplied by the boards are indicated in the attached
tables. Additional water requirements for commercial and industrial uses have been estimated
by consultants as an additional percentage (ranging from 5% up to 37%), depending on the
nature of development in each town, to give the total water demand in each town.
3.    Water production requirements depend also on unaccounted-for water (UFW).
Accurate figures on UFW are not available, since neither water production nor amount sold is
metered. However assessment of available records indicates that between 35% and 50% of
water produced is not accounted for. Experience here and elsewhere would suggest that 20%
to 25% might be physical losses, and the remainder might be under-measurement of usage, in



- 40 _Annex 2.2
Page 2 of 4
various forms. It is assumed in making projections of future sales and production, that total
UFW will reduce over five years to about 25% for existing systems and will be 20% for new
systems. A comparatively small part of this reduction would be achieved by the proposed
leakage detection and repair program, and the remainder by reducing the undermeasurement.
It is expected that this will be possible since the cause of these "losses" can be clearly
identified. Typically, the amount of water billed to any consumer is a nominal amount based
on the number of fixtures he has at the time of connection. Typically also, connections are
extended to neighboring residences without reference to the water board, while billing is still
based on a single family. Where meters have been installed recently on a sample of
consumers, actual usage has been shown to be from 17% to over 200% in excess of the
nominal amount billed prior to metering. A comprehensive metering program and properly
designed tariff structure as proposed under the project, will account for a much larger
proportion of water used, and encourage consumers to obtain their own connection and
economize on water usage.
4.    Numbers of connections and public standpipes have been projected from current
numbers. Present statistics vary a great deal from town to town, but indicate that from 6 to
26 people are served per house connection, and from 200 to 2600 per standpipe, but with
considerable uncertainty in these figures. Surveys have indicated that a maximum of about 12
persons per house connection should be expected if each household had an individual
connection, and 300 persons per standpipe has been adopted as an objective. It is expected
that numbers will reduce towards these two objectives in the project towns during the life of
the project, for example reducing from 21 to 15 persons per connection and from 2600 to
1200 persons per standpipe in Kaduna city and remaining at about the current figures of 8 and
310 in Katsina city. Projected numbers of connections are given in the attached tables.

FIRST MULTI STATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Improvement of the Efficiency of Operation of the State Water Board
Terms of Reference
1.    The Kaduna and Katsina State Water Boards are expected to receive financial
assistance from the World Bank to carry out a program of rehabilitation and limited expansion
of water supply facilities, and to upgrade their capacities to carry out the functions of large
water supply authorities. To this end, a major program of assistance is proposed to each
Board to improve its ability to efficiently operate and maintain its facilities, and to plan for
the future, and consultants are required to assist with this program. These terms of reference
indicate requirements in the technical and engineering fields. Concurrently with this program,
other consultants may be assisting with improvements to accounting, billing and collection
procedures, and development of a management information system, including review of
computer needs for the Board as a whole and setting up of the necessary computer facilities.
The consultants carrying out these two activities are expected to liaise as necessary for the
efficient completion of their assignments.
2.    It will be of utmost importance for the success of this program that technicians and
engineers at the working level are fully trained and understand the objectives of the assistance
program and the techniques to be used. To this end, the assistance will include several
periods of mentoring, follow up, checking of achievement, and further instruction. In
addition, the consultant will be expected to make specific efforts to ensure that its objectives,
importance, program, techniques and achievements are transmitted regularly to higher levels
in the Board and to the political level.
Scope of Work
3.    The proposed program will consist of one major component directed towards
improving the operational efficiency of the Board in the engineering fields of operation and
maintenance, and four subsidiary components. The geographic coverage of the program will
be the whole state but with concentration of activities on the Board's head office. The
improvement of operational efficiency component will include the six urban systems operated
by each Board. Each Board has already initiated a program of leak detection and repair,
utilizing leak detection equipment. Relevant parts of this assistance will build upon that
program. Separate commission will be arranged for assistance in each state. The scope of
work will include but not necessarily be limited to the following:



Annex 2.3
- 44 -                                Page 2 of 4
Improve Operational Efficiency
(i)   Inventory all water resources connected to the system at present or
which could be readily reconnected. (These might include the existing
surface water supply and old groundwater supplies if of adequate
quality.) Determine the cost of producing potable water from each
source, investigate means to reduce these costs, and develop operating
rules to optimize use of water and minimize operating costs,
depending also on demand patterns and transmission and distribution
system capacities. This should include particularly a review of all
uses of power fuel and chemicals (especially coagulant), and
recommendations for maximizing the efficiency of their use.
(ii)    Analyze the distribution system and recommend a system of metering
by area to permit this analysis to be improved and to form part of the
leak and wastage detection and repair program. Recommend also any
necessary production meters and assist the Board with procurement
and installation. Analysis of the distribution system should include
setting up the system on an appropriate computer analysis program
and ensuring that Board staff are able to continue its use.
(iii)   Review the achievement of previous programs of detection of leakage
and wastage, and following the installation of meters as indicated in
the previous point, recommend a program of further loss reduction,
including loss through undermeasurement and illegal connections.
Recommend an appropriate program of consumer metering including
specification of suitable and cost effective meters.
(iv)   If necessary, prepare a program of leakage repair to be carried out as
part of the Board's maintenance activities and prepare contract
documents. (Leakage repair may extend beyond the period of this
program of technical assistance, in which case Board staff, trained
during this program, would take responsibility.)
(v)    Examine water catchments used by the Board and make
recommendations for protection of water quality including particularly
control of the use of biocides and fertilizers, and activities which
would increase erosion and subsequent sedimentation of the reservoir.
(vi)   Analyze the Board's field operations and establish manpower
requirements for operation and maintenance. Develop a program of
routine preventive maintenance. This should include a program of
safety inspections for all dams used for water supply.
(vii)   Analyze stores, stores procedures, and procurement arrangements.
Establish necessary holdings of spare parts and chemicals, and
locations of stores facilities, and recommend procedures.



Amnex 2.3
-45 -                              Page 3 of 4
(viii)  Recommend equipment, tools, vehicles, etc necessary for the Board to
carry out its duties, including establishment of a meter workshop.
(ix)   Determine suitable monitoring indicators for use by the Board
management to assist in its duties and in general quality control, and
assist in establishing a management information system utilizing these
indicators.
Laboratory Needs
(x)    Review existing laboratory facilities and the need for additional
equipment and supplies. Prepare specifications and assist with
procurement.
(xi)   Prepare a routine water quality monitoring program for potable water
and for stream and dam water quality related to town water supply,
and assist Board staff in commencing its implementation. For new
reservoirs, monitoring of stream water quality should commence
before commencement of dam construction.
Library
(xii)  Deternine library needs, assist with purchase of books and journal
subscriptions and establishment of a technical library. Train a Board
staff member to operate the library.
Planning Procedures
(xiii)  Assist the Board in the development of its medium and long term
investment planning procedures and demonstrate the relation between
system operation and monitoring, and system planning in a developing
water supply system.
Training
(xiv)  For all of the above activities ensure that Board staff are fully trained
and understand the procedures adopted so that they are able to
continue to utilize them in the future.
Implementation Timing and Reporting
4.    It is anticipated that the entire program of technical assistance will extend over a
period of three years. All of the analysis and recommendations arising therefrom should be
completed in draft form within the first six months. Following tl;is the program of assistance
would be intermittent depending on when the necessary equipment becomes available, and
would involve establishment of the recommended procedures and training of Board staff in
their implementation. This program, which will need to evolve as work proceeds, should



- 46 -                               Annex 2.3
Page 4 of 4
involve periods of assistance.followed by periods when Board staff work alone, to be followed
by further periods of follow up and assistance.
5.    An inception report is required at the end of the second month, detailing the proposed
work program and necessary inputs by others. Each month thereafter, a brief progress report
will be required detailing significant progress and benchmarks reached, causes of delay, and
points requiring clarification or decision. Reports on each investigation carried out will be
required in draft form at the end of the sixth month, these reports to be finalized on
completion of the relevant component. A final report will be required analyzing the
effectiveness of the whole program of assistance and making recommendations for further
assistance to the Board, and for suggested modification to future similar programs elsewhere.
6.    Budgeted funds for this assistance are US$1.0 million equivalent per state at present
day costs, including vehicles and other normally required equipment, however each consultant
should make his own estimate of the required resource inputs. The supply of special
equipment such as water meters would be additional.

Promotion and Hygiene Education Activities
Terms of Reference
1.    A promotion and public relations program will have to be established prior to the introduction
of the new water supplies (standpipes and house connections). In addition, involving the population in
making improvements in water use practices, excreta disposal and sullage disposal will help to
improve the sanitary condition of the urban environment. Promoting lasting changes in behavior is a
long term process and health and hygiene agents need to develop the skills and capacity to sustain
promotion and education activities.
Scope of the Work
2.    Water board staff and the project team as well as other sector staff involved in promotion
activities in the two States will be assisted in developing a promotion and public relations program for
connection and management of the new water supplies. In addition, key sector staff will learn new
skills and methods to assist them in improving community education and sensitization with respect to
hygiene related issues. There will be two main areas of work, the water supply promotion and
management program, and the hygiene education program. The scope of the work will include the
following:
(a)   review of current community mobilization/sensitization practices including financial
and human resources as well as equipment and training materials and media used.
(b)   review of water supply and sanitation related diseases endemic in the States and an
assessment of the degree of awareness of the urban population of the causes of these
diseases.
(c)   training of extension agents/health inspectors in participatory methods of interaction
with the population/communities.
(d)    development of program for promotion of new water supplies with information on all
aspects of (connection, metering, billing, fees/tariffs, promotion of sullage disposal
for house connections, management of public standpipes etc.), development of
appropriate promotion information and training materials and initiation of
implementation of the program.
(e)   review of requirements for staff training, training materials, equipment and financing
required and development and a proposal for funding to enable provision of improved
hygiene education in urban areas.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FIRST MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Reorganization of Rural Water Supply Sector
Terms of Reference
Background
1.    Many state, national, and international agencies have been involved in development of
rural water supply facilities in Nigeria, specifically in the states of Katsina and Kaduna, and in
their maintenance. Activities have been uncoordinated with the result that there has been
considerable overlap and dupliLated effort. The state water boards have had the major
responsibility for maintenance, but have not had the resources to do this adequately. Hence,
of about 1350 rural water supplies that have been developed in the two states (900 in Katsina
and 450 in Kaduna), only about one third are in operation. Less than 5% of the rural
population of about 5.3 million have access to safe water. It has been estimated that 20,000-
25,000 water points, costing perhaps US$100 million would be required to provide safe water
to all of these people by the year 2005.
2.    It is now proposed to reorganize the rural water supply sector to improve coordination
amongst various participating organizations and to ensure that maintenar,t e activities can be
properly carried out to ensure sustainability. This reorganization must be consistent with the
national policy and strategy currently being developed by the Federal Ministry of Water
Resources. The paramount concept of the reorganization will be that the users (communities)
will be the owners and managers of their own rural water supplies, with the local
governments and state agencies undertaking tasks and responsibilities to facilitate such
development. Development will be based on cost sharing and the users will be required to
contribute a significant part (10% to 25%) of the costs, in money or in kind. The state will
adopt a coordinated approach to sector development which all relevant agencies will be
required to adhere to, and the private sector will be stimulated and encouraged to actively
participate in sector development.
3.    When the new organization is in place, rural water supply activities would start with
the village (through its water supply committee) making request for water supply to the rural
water supply and sanitation unit of the local government. This unit would prepare a priority
list of those villages which are ready with their contributions and with an indication of the
type of supply required. The list would be forwarded to the state coordinating unit which
would prepare an annual state implementation plan, with budgets, resources and technical
inputs required. The state unit would package the different activities required for tender and
contracting, depending on financing available and other constraints imposed by the various
financiers. Local government would prepare itself and the communities for implementation
after an implementation schedule has been agreed. After commissioning the water supply, the
water supply committee of the community would continue to collect cash contributions for
maintenance and call on local area mechanics for assistance for larger repairs. Local
government would be called on to arrange a specialized agency to assist for repairs that are



- 55 -                              Annex 2.7
Page 2 of 4
beyond the capacity of local mechanics. Local government would also monitor operation of
the supplies by annual visits.
4.    The states now wish to appoint a consultant under these terms of reference, to help
establish the proposed new process for handling rural water supply. One individual consultant
is proposed to assist the two states.
Objectives of Consultancy
5.    The consultant will provide conceptual, managerial and technical support to the state
coordination units (SCU) for the purpose of making the unit professionally strong enough to
be able to handle coordination of the development of the state rural water supply and
sanitation program. The assistance would also support the state coordination unit in
implementation of a small scale project to demonstrate the use of the new approach and
consolidate the new organizational methodology.
Scope of Work
6.    The scope of work would be as follows:
(i)    Assist the SCU in preparation of detailed documentation for all project
activities including drafting a state rural water supply and sanitation
program document and advice on how to organize the logistics of the
implementation of the program including liaison with potential
financiers.
(ii)   Join the SCU in meetings with state agencies and assist and advise the
SCU in drafting state policies and strategies to be adopted by the state
government.
(iii) Participate in workshops for developing state sector policies and
strategies.
(iv)   Assist in defining needs for staffing, office facilities, equipment and
transport for the SCU and local government rural water supply and
sanitation units.
(v)    Assist the SCUs in preparation of terms of reference for short term
consultancy support covering:
- Drafting a training program at state and local government levels:
- state and local government decision makers
- local government unit staff
- technicians and artisans
- extension workers
-     Develop/facilitate training materials for use at community level
covering:
- approach to community involvement

FIRST MULTI STATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Updating of Water Resources Master Plan
Terms of Reference
Background and Objectie
1.    The State Water Board has recently prepared a feasibility study for the purpose of
identifying a water supply project for World Bank financing. Inherent to this project is a
thorough review and updating of two master plan documents prepared some years ago. The first
was prepared in 1973 and included Katsina emirate only. The other was completed in 1979, and
included all of present Kaduna and Katsina states, except for the area of the earlier study. A
number of their recommendations are no longer relevant, as certain developments have proceeded
along different lines than originally proposed. This has thus reduced or changed options for
further water projects.
2.    Since creation of Katsina State in September, 1987, the new government entities have
established their own priorities, which further render the earlier documents of reduced usefulness
for planning purposes.
3.    Within the State, several federal and state agencies are responsible for the development
and utilization of water resources for improvement of community health, irrigation, cattle
watering, rural development and urban potable water supply. Funding for development of these
resources has come from a variety of state, national, bilateral, and multilateral sources. The state
has designated the State Water Board as the main agency responsible for supply of potable water
to urban areas. It and other federal and state agencies have also constructed open wells and
boreholes in rural areas, and fund emergency water supplies in response to drought and other
disaster conditions, and rural water supply is likely to be devolved to communities and local
government authorities.
4.    There are no perennial rivers in the Katsina State and little perennial flow in Kaduna
State, but several major dams have been constructed to supply water for irrigation and urban
water supply.
Scope of the Work
5.    The role of the Consultant is primarily to update the information and recommendations of
the existing master plan documents and to provide a framework in which water resources can be
developed for the next twenty years. Inasmuch as there are always competing demands for
limited funding and for limited water resources, it is essential to develop a plan to maximize the
benefits to the greatest overall good, while eliminating or minimizing conflicts between the
various users. The work will cover the two states of Kaduna and Katsina, but separate reports are
required on each state. The consultant should particularly liaise with FMWR and ensure
compatibility of his work with the National Water Resources Master Plan.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FIRST MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Environmental Sanitation Component
Terms of Reference
Background
1.    Environmental sanitation (sullage disposal, drainage, human and solid waste
management) in urban areas is fast becoming a major issue of the 1990s, as urban populations
continue to grow at high rates and the need for pro .ision of adequate services becomes more
pressing. Of the eight project towns and urban areas in Katsina and Kaduna States, Katsina
city and Funtua have estimated populations of over 100,000 each and the others have
populations in the region of 50,000 (1991). Some of the project towns will be receiving their
first distribution system, whilst others will be extending existing ones. In either case there is
a need to ensure that the water being brought into the towns does not create an additional
environmental burden.
2.    Management of sanitation is divided up among several agencies although the limits of
responsibility are not clearly defined. The key agencies are the urban planning authorities,
the ministries of health, and the LGAs. Several others play limited roles. Both states have
environmental sanitation committees or task forces which comprise staff of all the agencies
involved with sanitation management. Both States have edicts covering various aspects of
environmental sanitation, but there are no clear guidelines on management practices and
options.
3.    There are two main ways in which sullage (kitchen and bath water) currently is
disposed o,. Where houses are enclosed in walled compounds, the majority of owners make a
hole in one of their walls and drain their sullage out into the adjacent pathway where it
eventually finds its way into public drains which are often blocked by garbage, weeds and
sediment. Those homes which do not have walled compounds tend to dispose of their sullage
on site either by surface spreading or in seepage pits. Off site disposal results in ponded
water and muddy pathways that make walking difficult and allow mosquitos to breed. Human
waste is disposed of primarily by traditional pit latrines in the poorer neighborhoods, and by
septic tanks/vaults with soakaways in others. In addition there are some institutional
improved latrines. The conservancy system and the open air are also options which are being
phased out. There is no sewerage in any of the project towns although there are a few
package sewage treatment plants in Katsina town. Garbage is a problem only in the big towns
where limited collection systems have been established. Otherwise it is generally dumped at
official or unofficial sites Environment day, the last Saturday of each month, is usually a
good opportunity to clean street drains and to remove garbage piles from the immediate
neighborhood. Existing water sources are surface waters, open wells, standpipes and house
connections. Surface waters and well water are often polluted and management of standpipe
sites is usually inadequate.



Annex 2.9
Page 2 of 6
- 62 -
Objective and Design of the Component
4.    The primary objective of the environmental sanitation component is to reduce possible
adverse environmental effects caused by the water which will be brought into the towns by the
project. In order to achieve this: (i) provision will be made for wastewater disposal and
management of new water points; (ii) extension agents will be trained to better promote
improved environmental sanitation; (iii) planning activities will be carried out to improve
existing domestic sanitation management practices including human waste, sullage disposal,
stormwater drainage, and solid waste. In doing this, special attention will be paid to
increasing the skills of sector staff and local consultants in working on sanitation issues.
5.    The water boards will ensure that standpipes sites include appropriate drainage
(soakaways or trenches for the wastewater produced at the water point) and that house
connections have appropriately dimensioned soakaways or trenches. It is assumed that
households which have multiple taps will have adequate wastewater disposal through septic
tanks and infiltration trenches. Sound management of standpipes to ensure that the water
points are not vandalized and that the surrounds are kept clean can be achieved by several
m:aY3 to be decided upon by the States. Sub-contracting or franchising of the standpipes to
private citizens to sell water, or putting in place a workable maintenance and management
system which will be the responsibility of the LGA or the water board, are two options.
6.    The promotion and hygiene education activities will include providing additional
training skills and tools to health inspectors and .xtension agents so that they can promote the
new water supplies and encourage better water use practices and proper disposal of sullage
including on-site soakaways and the upkeep of community drains. Sanitation planning will
consist of first reviewing existing conditions, institutional arrangements, policy and legislative
provisions, technology choice, financing and the willingness of the population to pay for
services, social and cultural conditions. Subsequently additional work will result in
recommendations on policies, guidelines and actions that can be taken to improve
environmental sanitation conditions in the two States.
7.    The sanitation planning, promotion and hygiene education activities in the component
will be implemented concurrently in both states by a full time, multi-disciplinary team of
sector personnel and two long term consultants (engineer and community development expert)
based in a lead agency. The team will be supported by an advisory committee comprising
sector agencies involved in environmental sanitation management in the State and short term
local and international consultants. Subsequent to completion of the activities described in the
component, the local teams will be in a position to continue planning activities, assisting other
urban areas in the states and coordinating and monitoring implementation of new projects.
Detailed terms of reference for each member of the team as well as the consultants will be
prepared in an initiating workshop (where additional technical assistance will be provided by
the Regional Water and Sanitation Group in Abidjan). Activities common to both states will
be supported and coordinated thrcugh joint workshops.
8.    In order to assist state govtinments to better manage sanitation services, it will be
necessary for them to develop clear guidelines and policies on the responsibilities of the
various institutions involved in the sub-sector, as well as on technology choice, financial and
legislative issues and on the role of the population. It is important that the guidelines for



Annex 2.9
- 63 -                             Page 3 of 6
management of the sanitation (human solid waste management, sullage disposal, and storm
water drainage) services are prepared by state officials who will be responsible for updating
them. These terms of reference therefore describe the work to be done and indicate where
consultants will be required to assist the states in implementation. A team of state officials
from the urban planning agencies, state ministries of health, local government and long term
consultants, will be based at the respective urban planning agencies, (KUPDA and
KASUPDA) and will be equipped to conduct a study to develop the guidelines.
Sanitation Management Guidelines
Scope of Work
9.    The main phases of the work to be conducted in each State which will lead to
recommendations to be adopted by Government, are as follows:
(a)   review of existing sanitation conditions in urban and rural areas in the State
including levels of service, and coverage;
(b)    detailed analysis (organizational structure, human and financial resources,
equipment, roles) of the institutions (public and private including NGOs)
involved in providing sanitation services;
(c)   sanitation survey including information on types of excreta and sullage
systems used by the population, water supply sources, how much they pay for
collection and disposal of solid and human waste and other related services,
how such services are organized, preferences and thoughts about existing
alternative services, determination of the willingness to pay for improved
services. The survey will be based on representative sampling in rural and
urban areas in the State and will require preparation of a questionnaire,
definition of a sampling procedure, identification and training of enumerators
and their supervisors and development of a database to process the results;
(d)   review of actual financing mechanisms for services (loans, subsidies, etc.) and
options for cost recovery and review of existing State policies, legislation,
edicts, regulations within the context of Federal requirements, and on the
basis of actual need within the State;
(e)   review of current technologies used and recommendations on criteria for
technology choice for the collection, treatment and disposal of human and
solid waste, sullage, and stormwater; and
(f)   recommendations for new policy decisions and guidelines on institutional,
financial and technical, aspects reviewed in order to improve management of
services to be acted on by State Government.

Roles of Consultants. Timing. and Reporting
10.   It is expected that the study will take six months. Two long term local consultants
(oart of the project team) will be responsible for coordinating activities between the two
states, providing technical assistance to the teams and assisting with report writing. A
consultant will be required for 2 months to assist with the sanitation survey and additional
input will be required from short term local consultants.
Sullage Disposal. Drainage and Sanitation Plans
11.   The additional standpipes and house connections to be introduced into the urban areas
as a result of the project will need to be better managed than the ones currently in place.
Furthermore, improved treatment and disposal of the wastewater produced is needed. Solid
waste management is an important aspect to consider since poor management often contributes
to drainage and wastewater disposal problems. Some information needed fcr these planning
activities, will already exist from the management guidelines study (paras 7-9).
Scope of the Work
Analysis of the Existing Situation
12.   A review will be made of actual sanitation services in Katsina city and Funtua. For
each town the following will be conducted:
(a)    An overview of existing water supply and sanitation facilities in all areas of
the town (domestic, commercial, industrial). Completed, current and planned
waste treatment and disposal facilities (and projects) will also be reviewed and
assessed. Determination of the current needs for sanitation and the
deficiencies in sanitation services throughout the town.
(b)    Determination of the costs of the different levels of sanitation service, who
pays for services and what are the current financing mechanisms.
(c)    Review of the status, operation and responsibilities of agencies and
organizations involved in the provision of sanitation services in the town
including their institutional, human resource, operation and maintenance
capabilities and financial situation.
(d)    Review of the current involvement of the private sector NGOs and the
population in sanitation services, for example septic tank emptying,
construction of on-site excreta disposal and soakaway systems, collection of
garbage, cleansing of drains, and an assessment for the capacity of the private
sector for participation improving sanitation services.
(e)    Examination of housing types and densities, demographic, socio-economic and
industrial growth patterns and population growth projections.



Annex 2.9
- 65 -                              Page 5 of6
(f)    Review of neighborhood, topcgraphical and drainage maps and aerial
photographs of the town and environmental considerations includ:ng soil and
groundwater conditions.
(g)    Review legal and policy guidelines as well as options for enforcement of
regulations.
Technology Options
13.   A proposal will be made of appropriate technology options for different areas of town
based on the criteria for choice developed in the management study and on the willingness of
the population to pay for services.
(a)   Identifiction and proposal of feasible technology options for each area/zone
of the town to meet sanitation needs taking into account institutional, financial,
human resource, legal, policy and social and cultural considerations and using
the criteria developed in the management study.
(b)    Comparison of technological options for collection, treatment and disposal
taking into consideration the costs of the different alternatives as well as other
relevant factors and propose feasible options for the different areas of the city
including assessing of rehabilitation, upgrading and service expansion options.
Financing Cntions
14.   Options for financing services in the town will be proposed.
(e)    Review the mechanisms for financing the different services and identify the
most suitable cost recovery mechanisms, determine the levels of subsidy
required, determine the need for credit to individual homeowners and propose
suitable administrative procedures for loans (such as through commercial
banks and or revolving funds).
Institutional Options
15.   The results of the management study will be the basis for institutional
recommendations on management of sanitation services in the towns.
(a)    Review the options for institutional support and organization (public, private,
the population) for the different technology choices proposed for the town.
(b)    Review the existing human resource capacity and propose solutions for
providing adequate human resources for management and implementation of
the plan. All training requirements (immediate and future) should also be
included.

Page 6 of 6
Implementation Strategy
16.   Preparation of a package of projects and activities (sanitation plan) to be financed by
the population, State and Federal Governments with the assistance of external financing as
appropriate, including an implementation schedule and investment plan. An on-going
planning process will be identified for each service level.
Sullage Disposal and DrainaFe
17.   The four towns and urban areas which will be receiving new or additional water
supplies are Zonkwa, Kwoi, Birnin Gwari, and Ikara. An analysis of the existing sullage
disposal and drainage systems will be made and recommendations made on improvements
required in the management of the systems. The recommendations will include: the roles to be
played by public and private institutions as well as the population being served; description of
new or improved systems to be constructed and training requirements for artisans and the
population; community organization, promotion and sensitization activities; financing
requirements from government, population and external sources.
Roles of Consultants. Timing and Supervision
18.   The planning process in Katsina will take about 12 monhs,, and will begin at the end
of the management study. Several consultants will be required to assist the team for periods of
up to two months each. There will be three supervision missions. A sanitation plan will be
available at the end of the 12 months. In Kaduna, it is expected that the planning process will
take about three months and will also begin at the end of the management study. An
international consultant (1 month) and local consultants will assist the project team.

FIRST MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Summary of Environmental Assessment of Funtua Dam
1.    The following are the main points made by consultants who carried out the
environmental assessment of Funtua Dam.
(a)    The construction of a dam on River Gwaigwaye to impound the requir-d raw
water for the proposed water supply scheme is the only economically viable
option. This conclusion was based on review of the results of previous
studies carried out on the project area and environmental assessment.
(b)   The location selected for the construction of the dam has no bearing of any
importance, whether archaeologically, historically, culturally, biologically, or
geologically. Also, it is not enriched with any environmental resources for
future exploitation.
(c)   It is strongly recommended that the construction base camp should be planned
on a permanent basis for future use as a housing and operational base for the
maintenance and operation staff. Such approach would enhance a favorable
environmental appearance.
(d)    Construction materials needed for the provision of the dam are abundantly
available within the reservoir area. All efforts should be made to use these
materials. Borrowing materials from areas outside the reservoir should be
avoided.
(e)    Practically, there are no existing policy, legislation. administrative framework
or established organization in Katsina to monitor environmental impact. It is
proposed to establish a new environmental monitoring unit directly under the
control of the Governor's office in Katsina. Man-power required for this unit
may be obtained from the various government organizations. However, the
Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) has prepared guidelines for
the whole country. Though these guidelines ar at preliminary stage and have
not been properly tested, they could be adopted with the necessary
modifications for Katsina State.
(f)    Extensive cultivation is practiced in the catchment area and as a result
vegetation cover is generally removed leaving behind only scattered trees.
The area is prone to excess sediment transport into the reservoir. Adequate
dead storage capacity (at least 20% of the storage capacity) should be allowed
in the design to sustain the lifetime of the reservoir.



Annex 4.1
- 95 -                      Page 2 of 2
(g)    No special type of species were encountered in the catchment area.
Domesticated animals are in existence. A few wild animals of common type
i.e. hyena, leopard, monkeys and antelopes exist in the hilly and forestry
areas, and do not have any danger of extinction.
(h)    Sewerage disposal in the catchment area is predominately the pit-latrine
system which does not directly threaten the quality of impounded water.
Action may be taken to modify the system to ventilated improved pit-latrines.
(i)    Agro-based chemicals are extensively used in the catchment area for
cultivation. Necessary legislation may be introduced to limit their use.
0j)    Funtua Textile Mills located witnin the catchment area is known to discharge
its waste effluents into the river system without any treatment. Action may be
taken to treat this wastage before discharging into the river, or to direct it
from the catchment.
Ik)    The field survey confirmed that no established settlements would be affected
by the construction of the dam. However, resettlement of scattered settlers is
required. The resettlement process should proceed much earlier than the
reservoir impoundment in order to avoid payment of compensation for crops
within the reservoir area.
(')    It is estimated that about 2,500 economic trees within the reservoir area have
to be uprooted and disposed. Some of these trees are mature and can be cut
and sold for lumber while the rest can be sold for firewood.
(im)   The use of the reservoir water for multiple purpose should be discouraged.
Limited angling may be considered. In addition, limited tourist facilities may
be provided.
(n)    An environmental monitoring unit consisting of about eight members is
recommended to monitor environmental aspects during construction. This
team could be obtained from the Katsina State Government functionaries.
About ten visits to the site during construction would be needed.
(o)    A panel of experts comprising three members is proposed for review of the
dam design and monitoring of construction. These experts can be selected
from the following disciplines related to the construction of the dam: General
Engineering/Hydraulics, Hydrology and Geotechnics/Geology.
(p)    New settlements should be sited well clear of the reservoir.
(q)    Other reservoirs constructed in the area have resulted in a significant increase
in the inciden^!e of malaria, bilharzia, and yellow fever.
2.    These recommendations have been incorporated into the Environmental Mitigation
Plan, Annex 4.3.

FIRST MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Summary of Environmental Assessment of Zonkwa Dam
1.    An environmental assessment of anticipated environmental impacts of the dam has
been made by consultants. Specific impacts are classified as either positive of negative and
assessed. Mitigation measures are identified and mitigation plans to reduce potentially
significant adverse effects to acceptable levels are proposed by the consultants.
2.    The study shows that the positive impacts are:
(a)    The site for the proposed project was acquired by the KDSWB in 1980, full
compensation has been paid to the landowners ard farmers, the acquired area
has been demarcated and sin.A; ihere crc no se.ttlements within the acquired
area, it would not incur any resettlement costs.
(b)    The dam has potential for multi-purpose use suci as water supply, irrigation,
fisheries and recreation. In the design of the r iisultants, allowance was only
made for domestic. industrial and livestock uses.
(c)    Zonkwa town and the surrounding villages have no pipe borne water supply.
The project would ensure adequate and reliable water supply. It would also
improve the sanitary conditions of the town and reduce the incidence of some
of the water borne and water related diseases such as dysentery, diarrhea, and
typhoid.
(d)    The project would cause an improvement in the local economy during the
construction and the operation stages by providing employment opportunities.
(e)    By attracting  *   lishment of small and medium scale processing and
manufacturing    . .ries it would improve the local economy and provide
more job opportunities.
(f)    The development of fish within the lake would not only be a source of
income but also an alternative source of protein.
3.    Among the negative impacts of the Zonkwa dam are:
(a)    Loss of agricultural land by the impoundment of water in the reservoir area of
102 hectares.
(I)    Disturbance of biota within the inundated area. However none of the plant
nor animal species is an endangered species as they are the normal entities
within the savannah region.



Annex 4.2
97 -Page 2 of 2
(c)    Malaria is already endemic in the area. There is a likelihood that the
impoundment of water behind the dam would cause an increase in the
incidence of the disease.
4.    The possible mitigation measures are:
(a)    Afforestation of the reservoir rim to encourage the recovery of the biota.
Trees to be planted should be evergreen trees of economic value.
(b)    Seeding the reservoir with fingerlings of tilapia and mud fish to control the
population of mosquito larvae.
5.    Necessary measures to improve the environmental quality of the area are:
(a)    Rehabilitation and proper organization of the facilities for disposal of waste
water, solid wastes and storm water runoff to prevent the pollution of the
reservoir.
(b)    Regrassing and afforestation of the valley slopes to minimize erosion and
sedimentation of the reservoir.
(c)    Encouragement of good agricultural practices such as contour tillage, and
proper use and management of fertilizers and pesticides to minimize any
harmful environmental impacts on the lake.
6.    Measures to minimize social conflict within the area should include:
(a)    demarcation and establishment of grazing tracks leading to possible watering
sites around the reservoir rim;
(b)    fencing of farmlands along the grazing tracks to prevent livestock
encroachment; and
(c)    as an alternative to (a) watering points can be provided downstream of the
bridge to avoid contamination of the reservoir by animal droppings and
prevent livestock encroachment on farmlands around the reservoir.

FIRST MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Environmental Mitigation Plan
To minimize the environmental impacts of construction of dams at Funtua and Zonkwa, the
State Water Boards would implement the following:
(i)    employ a public health specialist to advise on means to minimize the risk of
increasing malaria and bilharzia, by reducing the habitat for mosquitos and snails; and
to minimize other risks of disease;
(ii)   develop and implement a catchment management plan to minimize the impacts
of activity in the catchment, particularly the use of biocides and fertilizers, and
activities which would increase erosion and subsequent sedimentation of the reservoir;
(iii)  develop and implement a water quality monitoring program for water flowing
into the dams, and reservoir water itself, commencing well before construction starts
to give adequate baseline data;
(iv)   review dam design to ensure that proper allowance has been made for
sediment storage (including where possible some actual sediment measurements) and
to confirm spillway capacity;
(v)    monitor the effect on downstream farmers of changed river regime following
construction of the dam;
(vi)  establish a three person monitoring unit to regularly monitor environmental
impacts during dam construction;
(vii)  utilize the construction camp for operadion and maintenance staff after
completion of the dam, and ensure that it is designed accordingly;
(viii)  incorporate appropriate clauses into contracts to ensure minimization of
impacts during construction; and
(ix)   clear impoundment area prior to reservoir filling.
These activities are included in the Project Implementation Program (Annex 2.11) where
appropriate (items i, v, and vi). Items ii and iii are incorporated into the terns of reference
for efficiency improvement (Annex 2.3) and items iv and vii to ix will be incorporated into
the work of the consultant for construction supervision and into contract specifications.

FIRST MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Calculation of ERR
1.    The primary calculation of ERR has been based on conservative values of what people
are known to pay for water at lower consumption levels, and on expected tariffs after the
project is completed at higher consumption levels (N4 per cubic meter in March 1992 prices).
Typically, pecple pay 20 kobo for a 20 liter can of water from vendors, and use about one
and a half cans per person per day, equivalent to N 10 per cubic meter for 30 lcd. There is
also anecdotal evidence of people paying as much as five times this amount in some areas,
and the equivalent of N250 to N500 per cubic meter for about 10 lcd in the dry season,
however this has not been incorporatud into the analysis due to uncermainty about its extent
and applicability to the towns in question. Certainly it would raise ERR well above the
figures quoted, but the extent is not known, and hence the analysis gives only a minimum
measure of ERR. The demand curve adopted thus passes through N ln ner cubic meter at 30
lcd and N4 per cubic meter at 90 lcd, and a straight line has been adopted. This demand
curve has been taken to represent the value of water to the consumer.
2.    The average value of the water delivered by each system has been calculated
depending on characteristics of the consuming population. Water consumed through public
standpipes, at 20 lcd, has all been valued at N10 per cubic meter. Industrial water use has
been valued at N 13 per cubic meter, the anticipated industrial tariff at the end of the project.
Water resulting from the project and consumed through house connections (HCs) has been
valued at an average figure depending on whether or not there is an existing supply in the
town. Where there is no existing supply, the average value under the whole demand curve
has been adopted (N8 per cubic meter). Where there is an existing supply, the current
average per capita supply through house connections has been calculated, and the average
value of the demand curve between that amount and 90 lcd has been adopted as the average
value of water delivered through house connections. Average value of house connection
water thus calculated and average value of domestic water taking account of the portion
expected to be delivered through standpipes are as follows:
Town                Value (N/cu.m.)     Value (N/cu.m.)
(HC water)         (All domestic water)

3.    Costs have been based on present day costs (March 1992 prices including physical
contingencies). Adjustments have been made to exclude duties, for a shadow pricing
conversion factor of 0.85 on local costs. The cost stream has been based on the projected
expenditure pattern for the project with the addition of incremental operation and maintenance
costs.
4.    The above values applied to projections of water use from the project (difference in
water use with and without the project), derived as at Annex 2.2, provide the benefit stream
used to calculate ERR. Benefits have been extended to 30 years after project completion.
Cost and benefit streams are shown in the attached table.
5.    The alternative calculation of ERR based on productivity increase and health benefits
has beer, based on the number of beneficiaries, also sumizairized at Annex 2.2. Average GDP
of about US$316 has been taken as the basic measure of productivity, an increase of 5%
being valued at US$15.8 per person per year. Health care costs were taken as 7.8% of GDP
and a reduction of 10% in health care costs would be valued at US$2.5 per person per year.
The extent to which this is additive to the benefit calculated from consumers' willingness to
pay, and even the extent to which consumers' perceptions of the value of water represents its
real value to them, have not been addressed.
