REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUELIC OF INDONESIA FOR A DEV11OPNENT FINANCE COMPANY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $50 million to the Republic
of Indonesia for a develomprent finance company, Bank Pembangunan Indonesia
(BAPINDO). Interest on the loan would be at 8 percent per annum. The proceeds
of the proposed loan would be on-lent to BAPINDO at the same interest rate.
BAPINDO would be allowed a spread of 41 percent and would lend at rstes detenaned
by the Government from time to time. The proposed loan and the subsidiary loan
tc BAPINDO would be repaid in accordance with the aggregate amortization of
sub-projects financed by BAPINDO, over a mAxiuiium of 18 years, including 3 years
of grace.
PART I - THlE ECONC.IY
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia "The Indonesian Economy:
Recent Developments and Prospects for 1974/75", of November 26, 1973, (R73-273)
described and analyzed the substantial. changes which had taken place in the
Indonesian economy in 1973. Since then there have been important further de-
velopments, especially in oil prices. A Basic Economic Mission has just
completed field work for a report to reassess Indonesia's longer term develop-
ment prospects and policies.   Country data are shown in Annex I.
3.        The Indonesian economy, which was dualistic and export-oriented in
the colonial period, was severely affected by the great depression in the
'thirties, and the war, followed by the struggle for independence in the
'forties. After a relatively brief period of recovery in the early 'fifties,
the economy stagnated again ir. the decade 1957-1967 largely as a result of ad-
verse economic policies.  Thus, after a long period of economic difficulties,
in which the population nearly doubled, Indonesia had become one of the poorest
countries in the world.
4.        After the Suharto Government introduced an effective stabilization
program to combat the economic disruption and spiralling inflation of the
mid-1960's, there has been a period of recovery and rehabilitation under the
First Five-Year Plan. Real annual economic growth was close to 7 percent in
the period 1968-1972. Domestic savings and investments increased considerably,
thus providing the basis for continued economic expansion after the rehabilita-
tion phase. By 1972, investments, excluding those in the oil sector, vhich were
very substantial, had grown to an estimated 17 percent of the GNPP, of which more
than two-thirds were financed from domestic sources. Sustained efforts were made
to increase food production, with emphasis on rice. Although a drought in
the second half of 1972 led to a setback in food production and a steep increase
in prices, production has recovered since then. Efforts to expand food production
continue to receive high priority and in this connection, international supplies
permitting, the Government is increasing fertilizer imports in 1974. Expansion
of domestic fertilizer capacity is being pursued actively.



5.        Even before the increase in petroleum prices in the latter part of
1973, the money economy was boomiing, and real growth was prcbably iccelerating
under the influence of steep increases in Indonesia's export prices, a signi.fi-
cant physical expansion of production in the oil and forestry sectors, a rapid
growth in direct foreign investment (initially in petroleum exploration and
production and in forestry and mining, but increasingly in manufa'cturIng), and
a large inflow of short term credit. The same factors, however, also contri-
buted to significant inflation, reaching a rate of nearly 50 percent during the
fiscal year 1973/74. 1/ The Government took a number of measarea to combat the
inflation, most recently in April 1974. These included restrictive credit
measures ancl continued augmentation by import of supplies of rice and fertilizers,
sold domestioallY at the subsidized prices.  Since then, the anual rate of infla-
tion has been 17 percent, and in the most recent months, subaisntilj lywer.
6.         The contribution of the oil sector to the economy, which was
already increasing rapidly, has taken a quantum jump since September 1973. The
Indonesian oil price, which was $3.73 per barrel in that month, reached
$12.60 per barrel in July l974. In addition, early this year, indonesia re-
negotiated the contracts with the foreign oil companies to receive a larger
share of the total oil proceeds.  Thus, while the net oil contributions to the
balance of payments and the Government's revenues were below $0.5 billion in
1972/7.3 (less than 5 percent of the GNP), they are expected to reach sell over
$3 billion in 1974/75, an increase of $20 per capita.  Given also the external
and domestic inflation, both exports and budgetary receipts will probably ex-
ceed $5 billion in 1974/75, a rough quadrupling in two years.
7.        The inflation is, however, also affecting the expenditure side of
the balance of payments and the budget. Average Indonesian import prices are
expected to have increased by 80 percent between 1972 and 1974., with the
largest increases occuring in foodstuffs and agricultural inpats (rice, wneat,
sugar, fertilizer). To shield the domestic consumer against the exXCect of
high external prices, the Government is subsidizing these imports at an annual
cost equivalent to nearly $1 billion. In addition, the Governmant has to pay
more for domestic goods and services (including Government salaries).   Thius,
about one-half of the additional budgetary receipts will be eroded by the
different effects of inflation. Of the other half, a significant part will be
spent on real increases in Government outlays, including much-needed gradual
salary increases, development expenditures, routine material expenditures, and
grants in support of the budgets of the Provincial Governments. Nevertheless,
there will probably remain a budgetary surplus of $0.5 - $1.0 billion in
1974-75. The expected overal1 surplus on the balance of payments is larger,
and foreign exchange reserves may increase from $0.9 billion on Marh 31, 1974
to about $2.5 billion (about six months of imports at the then expected rate)
a year later.
8.      These surpluses are not large in relation to Indonesiats needs for
additional current and capital expenditures in nearly every field, as speci-
fied in the Second Five Year Plan (1974/75-1978/79). Moreover, earlier
problems of absorbtive capacity are being overcome gradually. Thus even
though some of the expenditures budgeted for 1974/75 (consumers' subsidies)
should only be temporary, it will probably not be long before the new re-
sources are fully absorbed.
1/ April 1, 1973 to March 31, 1974.



9.        The Second Five Year Plan also provides significant new directions in
emphasizing the social, regional, employment and equity aspects of development.
It is recognized that, while the Government's initial eccnomic stabilization and
rehabilitation programs, as well as a number of specific activities, have
benefitted large segments of the population, the benefits of investments in
industry - much of it in or around Jakarta - have not been widely spread.
Also, the continued high level of agricultural prices after the 1972 crop
failure has ultimately benefitted the rural areas, but is severely reducing
the real income of the urban poor. The Government's policy to keep the prices
of basic commodities in check through subsidization of imports is providing
relief, but it is the irntention to gradually work out and implement a number
of more basic socially oriented policies and programs in the fields of
employment, education, housing, etc.
10.       In the short and medium run, Indonesia will need continued international
technical assistance for project planning, implementation and institution
building. Along with its new financial resources, Indonesia will also still
need and should be able to use financial and technical assistance
from abroad to implement programs to accelerate its economic growth and, on
a wide spread basis, alleviate its poverty. There is therefore a strong case
for continued international assistance to Indonesia, even though the country
may generate relatively modest budgetary and balance of payments surpluses for
a limited period. In all probability, these surpluses will have been absorbed
by the time disbursements from new loans become significant.
11.       The soft average terms of foreign assistance provided in the context
of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesin (IGoI), and the re-scheduling
of pre-1966 external debt obligations (un(der the 1970 Paris Club Agreement
with the Western countries and Japan, and parallel arrangements with several
Eastern European countries) have kept Indonesia's public debt service ratio
relatively low. Service payments on rescheduled and subsequently incurred
public debt are estimated at $344 million in 1974, will reach a peak of
$371 million in 1975, and are projected to decrease gradually thereafter.
Comparing these amounts with the projected export level of over $5 billion
in 1974/75, and given the fact that Indonesia's external terms of trade will
probably remain favorable, it appears that Indonesia now has the capacity to
service significant additional debt.
12.       The changes in Indonesian economic circumstances discussed above
had become apparent at the time of the IGGI pledging meeting in May 1974.
As a result, it was generally agreed that program aid was no longer as
urgently needed as previously, although reduced amounts of such aid can
usefully continue for some time. At the same time, the meeting endorsed
the view that a considerable expansion in project aid was warranted to
assist Indonesia in carrying out its more ambitious development strategy.
Although some members were not, in a position to make pledges, it seems
likely that total aid commitments (including IBRD loans) in 1974/75 will
exceed the aid request o- $850 million.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
13.       As indicated in Part I, Indonesia will continue to need substan-
tial external financial and technical assistance to rehabilitate and improve
infrastructure and to expand production capabilities in agriculture, minerals,
forestry and manufacturing. With the continued growth of the economy, the
Government will also be able to devote increasing attention to development of'
effective programs designed to ensure that the benefits of development are
distributed widely. Agricultural programs to increase the productivity of
smallholder farmers and to alleviate the pressure on land in rural Java, the
expansion of labor-intensive industry, regional development (especially in
the outer islands), family planning, water supply, education and other social
programs will therefore have an important place in the development strategy
during the period of the Second Plan (1975-79). The work of both the head-
quarters and Resident Staff has been oriented toward these development objec-
tives.
1a.       The Bank Group has in the past financed some of the local costs of
projects in Indonesia.   A limited amount of such financing will continue to be
necessary in connection with Bank Group assistance to the agriculture and
social sectors, where projects frequently have a low foreign exchange compo-
nent.
15.       As of September 30, 1974, Indonesia had received 37 IDA credits
amounting to $561.8 million and two Bank loans amounting to $73 million.
The Five Cities Water Supply Project which was approved by the Executive
Directors on October 15 brings total Bank loans to $87.5 million. The Bank
Group accounts for less than 4 percent of Indonesia's total outstanding public
debt. By 1978 it is expected to account for less than 11 percent of total
outstanding debt and less than 5 percent of Indonesia's annual debt service
obligations. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of September 30, l974, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.
16.       In accordance with the priorities of Indonesiats Five Year Plans,
over 35 percent of lending to date has been for agriculture. IDA has extended
four credits to help rehabilitate and develop plantations in the Government
estates sector. Other credits for agriculture include five to assist rehabi-
litation and expansion of irrigation systems and one each for a fisheries
project, a seeds multiplication program, beef cattle development, smallhilder
rubber development, sugar industry rehabilitation and smallholder tea develop-
ment. Industry is of growing importance to the Indonesiarl economy and the
Association has assisted in four proJects in this sector. It organized a con-
sortium of lenders to finance a major expansion of the PUSRI fertilizer plant,
assisted in the reorganization and financing of the major state development
bank (BAPINDO), which would be the beneficiary of the proposed loan, provided
financial assistance for Indonesiats first industrial estate project, and
assisted in the establishment and financing of the Private Development Finance
Company of Indonesia (PDFCI). Other priority sectors to which credits have



been extended are power, transportation, t8lecommunications, education and
population. In addition, four credits have been made to assist the Government
in Preparing and formulating appropriate development programs. Projects in
tranamigration, agriculture research, irrigation, inter-island transport and
a second loan to PUSRI are being prepared and may be ready to present to the
Ekecutive Directors during thia fiacal year.
17.       The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in 1968, and about half
of all credits have been made since June 1971. Bank lending to Indonesia
began only in June 1974. The program has increased rapidly from a relatively
small base, and consequently the undisbursed portion of IDA credits is rela-
tively large. Many credits have financed projects planned for execution over
extended periods. Many, in addition, have been associated vith institutional
reforms involving, inter alia, the creation of new project authorities,
drafting of new charters and the enactment of new legislation, all of which
has taken time. Thus, a number of projects have experienced delays in the
initial stages of implementation and many are inherently slow disbursing.
However, the performance of project agencies has improved during the last
year as organizationa] improvements have begun to take effect and Indonesian
staff have become more familiar with Bank Group procedures and more experienced
in project execution.
18.       Despite the improved capabilities of project institutions, most de-
velopment projects, including those financed by the Bank Group, have been
adversely affected by cumbersome budgetary, procurement and customs clearance
procedurss. This matter has been discusaed with the Indonesian authorities who
recognize the need to streamline procedures and are considering the steps
necessary to accomplish this. AB a first step, the Government has requested
and we have arranged for assistance under the Fourth Technical Assistance Credit
(Credit No. 451-IND) to establish an effective control system in BAPPENAS to
monitor the progress under development projects. Additional measures to im-
prove overall project administration are now being discussed with the Government.



PART III - INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL ENVIXDNMENT
19.        Indonesia is still at the threshold of industrialization.  The
industrial sector is relatively under-developed; its share of GDP (estimated
at 9.8 percent in 1974) is lower than in similar countries. The sector is
characterized by the following broad features: a) a domestic market
orientation, based on a large population; b) increasing participation by
foreign private capital, in response to generous incentives and a favorable
investment climate; c) an apparent persistence of excess capacity in & few
lines of production due mainly to problems of input shortages and working
capital scarcity; d) low productivity of public sector manufacturing enter-
prises; and e) geographical concentration in Java, particularly in the
greater Jakarta area, Consumer goods, particularly food products and tix,tiles,
account for the bulk of manufacturing output.  Intermediate and capitC.;_ goods
industries are relatively less developed but are growing quickly.
20.        In the seven years ending December 1973, the value of appxurved
foreign investments in sectors other than petroleum and banking ainoun-cd te
$3.1   billion. Nearly 40 percent of this investment was to be in manufactur-
ing and 30 percent in mining and quarrying. Expenditures on these approved
foreign investment projects are estimated to have been only   $'I.1 billion
at the end of 1973 (35 percent of total approval amounts) New foreign
investments are now generally allowed only in the for,m of joint ventures, on
the understanding that the Indonesian share will be increased to 51 percent
within a specified period. The Government has recently reduced tax incen-
tives, expanded the list of industries closed to foreign investors and now
requires that a larger number of Indonesians be employed in foreign or joint
venture enterprises.
21.        Domestic investment approvals have also grown rapidly; 1,816
projects envisaging total investments of Rp 1,236 billion were approved from
November 1968 through December 1973. The ratio of domestic investment
approvals to total approvals rose from 28 percent in 1972 to 69 percent in
1973. Large new investments are being planned in fertilizer, steel, cement,
petrochemicals and mining. The expansion of the manufacturing sector is
encouraged by a new sense of urgenc:y on the part of Government and the
private sector to step up industrialization,
22.        The banking network consists of the central bank, Bank Indonesia
(BI); five large state-owned commercial Banks; a state-owned Developament
Bank (BAPIUDO); two joint venture Development Banks, the Indonesian Develop-
mrent Finance Company and the Private Development Finance Company of Iadonesia
(PDFCI, assisted under Credit No. h28-IND and an IFC investment) and a
number of Regional Development Banks, small private banks, branches of 11
foreign banks and about 9,000 savings and village banks, BI and the state
banks account for 90 percent of total outstanding bank credit0
23.       Money and capital markets are in a very early stage of development.
An Agency for Money and Capital Market DIvelopment was created in January
1972 and is currently working on the establishment of a securities and exchange
administration. At the request of the Ministry of Finance, IFC prepared a



long-term policy plan for the development of the capital market, which
includes changes in the legal framework and strengthening of financial
expertise in the banking and investment community. The Government has
also approved the establishment of several investment bank-type institu-
tions to deal in short-term debt-instruments, under-writing and hire-
purchase financing. Nine joint-venture merchant banks were licensed
during 1973 and 1974 and these will help to develop further the money
and capital markets.
24.       Short-term credit is extended by banks for periods up to one
year. Wbrking capital loans are generally hard to obtain. Term credit
for industrial projects is available from all banks, although foreign
banks must obtain BI's approval before making loans over one year. Of
the state banks, only BAPINDO can make loans for periods beyond five years.
Term financing is largely made available under the Investasi Program begun
by the Government in 1969. This program provides three to five year loans
through the state banks and Iogional Development Banks.   Total commitments
under the program at the end of January 1974 amounted to Rp 167.8 billion
and disbursements stood at Ip 116.1 billion (about 80 percent to the pri-
vate sector). Until early 1973, most of these loans had been made to
medium or large industrial enterprises. In April 1973 the Government
announced that 65 percent of future loans would be made to small enter-
pr-ises.  Diring 1973, the Government also established PoTo Bahana which
makes equity investments in, and provides management assistance to, small
businesses,  P.T. Asuransi Kredit Indonesia (Askrindo) insures bank loans
made to small businesses to encourage banks to increase their lending in
this sector. Askrindo's program was expanded in December 1973 and it now
insures automatically up to 75 percent of the amount of medium-term and
working capital loans made for small industries under the Investasi Program.
25.       To encourage further the growth of small industries, BAPINDO has
instituted a co-financing scheme in cooperation with a number of 1egional
Development Banks (RDB's). After satisfying itself that an RDB is financially
sound and well managed, BAPINDO then provides for each RIB sub-loan the
equivalent of 10 percent of the total financing for fixed assets and 20
percent for working capital, BI provides 80 percent and 70 percent respec-
tively,and the balance of 10 percent in each category is provided by the
RkB. As of April 1974, BAPINDO had extended total lines of credit of Rp 1.05
billion to these banks.
Interest Rates and Inflation
26.       The current minimum interest rate of the Indonesian state banks is
15 percent per annum for loans of Rp 100 million or more; smaller loans can
be made at 12 percent per annum. After a period of remarkable price stability
from 1969 to 1971, Indonesia experienced mounting inflation, like many other
countries in the last few years. In April 197h, the Government took a number
of anti-inflationary measures, including raising interest rates to their
present levels, which show signs of effectively slowing the rate of inflation
which was 47 percent for the year ending March 1974.   In the following four
months, prices rose 5.6 percent and preliminary figures indlcate further
significant slowing of the inflation rate in August and September.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
27.       The project was appraised in April, l174 and negotiations were
concluded in Washington on October 10, 1974; the Government was represented by
Mr. Sukandar from the Indonesian Embassy and BAPINDO was represented by its
President, Mr. Kuntoadji. The appraisal report dated October 22 , 1974
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III
contains a loan and project summary,
28.        BAPINDO has been the beneficiary of two IDA credits (No0 310-IND,
for industrial financing and No. 318-IND, for financing rehabilitation of
the inter-island fleet). The President's Report (No. P-1074) for Credit
No, 310-IND described BAPINDO's extremely weak financial and managerial
situation in late 1969 when the Association first began working with the
Government to improve the institutional arrangements for medium-and long-
term industrial lending. At that time, BAPINDO was an inefficient institu-
Gion, poorly managed and organized, and over-staffed. Its capital structure
was unbalanced  and Alliqtid   A subetantial part of its loane were bad or
doubtfuil.  Its accounts had never been audited by independent qualified
auditors qrj its financial position could not be exactly determined.   By
the time Credit No. 310-IND was considered by the Executive Directors,
BAPINDO had made substantial progress along lines agreed with the Associa-
tion,  BAPINDOtS managemenlt had been greatly strengthened and the Credit
enabled BAPINDO to consolidate its position and provided it with part of the
resources needed to meet its current and projected commitments, Since then,
BAPINDO has made further substantial progress as outlined in the paragraphs
below.
BAPLNDO's Operations
29.        BAPINDO's operations fall into three distinct categories:
induistrial loans, maritime sector loans and short-Lerm raw cotton loans,
Industrial financing was BAPINDO's original function, with emphasis alterna-
ting between medium-term and short-term lending. BAPINDO gave up short-
term lending in 1972, except for short-term loans to its long-term loan
clients. Maritime sector lending began in 1972 when the Government designated
BAPINTDO as the channel for foreign credits to that sector. BAPINDO will play
an even greater role in financing maritime sector investments in the future
both through normal lending through its M-ritime Credit Department and
through its equity participation in the Government's new National Fleet
Development Colporation, Lending for raw cotton began in 1967 when BAPINDO
wa-s designated administrator of raw cotton imports under U.S. PL-480
arrangements for distribution to sel2cted spinning mills at prices subsidized
by the Government,  This business accounted for 75 percent by value (but only
11 percent by number of loans) of BAPINDO's operations in 1973. As earlier
agreed between the Government and the Association, BAPINDO's raw cotton
lending will be largely phased out by the end of 1974. This change will not
seriously impair BAPINDO's financial position.



- 9 -
30.        Industrial loans for expansion of existing industries and
establishment of new enterprises accounted for about two-thirds of the
number of loans made by BAPIIDO in 1972 and 1973, but only for about 16
percent and 19 percent of the value of lending in these two years respec-
tively. In 1973, BAPINDO made 53 loans for capital investments totalling
Rp. 7.3 billion, compared with 26 loans for fRp 2.1 billion in 1972.
Textile projects accounted for 41 percent of cumulative commitments for
industrial investments, with rubber processing (14 percent) and tourism
(13 percent) being the next most important sectors.  In 1973, BAPINDO made
52 loans for permanent working capi-tal totalling Rp 2.6 billion to its
term-loan clients; these loans accounted for about 25 percent of total
industrial lending. About 60 percent of BAPINDO's loans were less than
$200,000 equivalent and only five out of a total of 105 industrial loans
were for more than $1 million equivalent.
Organizational Changes and BAPINDO's Charter
31.       Over the last two years, BAPINDO has improved its organizational
structure and its senior management has gained considerable experience.
In 1973, total staff was reduced by 40 percent through a retrenchment which
covered mainly clerical and support staff whose numbers exceeded BAPINDO's
needs. This reduction was handled imaginatively and compassionately and
has resulted in a general organizational streamlining, a renewed sense of
purpose among the remaining staff, and marked improvement in efficiency.
32.        The President's Report for Credit ?No. 310-IND (paragraph 32) reported
that the Goverenmnt had agreed with the Association that BAPINDO's authorized
share capital should be increased from Rp. 60 million to Rp. 20 billion, and
that the Supervisory Board, which consisted only of the Minister of Finance and
the Governor of Bank Indonesia, should be enlarged. To accomplish these changes
the Government intended to introduce in the Indonesian Parliament a new Act,
the draft of which had been agreed with the Association. However, the Govern-
ment has decided against having a separate legislatively approved Charter for
each state bank. Instead, it will control and amend by Government Regulation the
functions and operations of each bank under the existing General Banking Act.
BAPINDO's paid-in capital has already been increased to about Rp. 20 billion
and the Government has stated it will increase BAPINDO's authorized share
capital, probably to Rtp. 50 billion, by the end of 1974. The Ministry of Justice
is now investigating how the Minister of Finance and Governor of Bank Indonesia
can delegate the Supervisory Board functions to qualified representatives with
more time to devote to BAPINDO and how the Board can be enlarged.
Procedures
33.        BAPINDO's appraisal standards have improved considerably over the
past two years, in part because of the efforts of its Advisors, who were re-
commended and selected by the Bank Group, and in part because of staff train-
ing in project appraisal work. Financial and technical aspects of appraisal
are now usually handled satisfactorily; appraisal of marketing and economic
aspects of projects needs further improvement. Under a UNDP project for which
the Bank is executing agency, two senior officials from BAPINDO recently
visited the Industrial Mining and Developmer-t Bank of Iran and the Korea
Development Finance Corporation to study appraisal techniques.



- 10 -
34.       In order to improve project supervision, BAPIND0 established a
separate supervision division in late 1973. The division is developing
a practical supervision manual ana one of its senior officials has been
sent to the Private D3velopment Finance Corporation of the Philippines
to study supervision procedures.
Profitability
35.       BAPINDO's profitability remained poor in 1973 (after tax profits
were Rp. 608 million) largely because of the extraordinary expenditures
incurred for severance pay under its retrenchment program (para. 31). In the
past, its low profits were mainly due to the sizable losses on the older part
of its loan portfolio and adanistrative expenses which were high in relation
to its level of operations.
36.       Although arrears are still quite high, the quality oL BAPINfDO's
loan portfolio has improved considerably since 1972, wlen 46 percent of total
loarns outstanding were in arrears; the ratio declined to 30 percent in
1973. For the medium and long-term indlstrial loan portfolio the ratios fell
from 62 to 36 perrent for the respective years. Collection performance is
expected to continue to improve in the future with bettsr sub-project
appraisal and supervision, and the longer repayment terms under BAPIND0's
more recent loans.
Business Forecast
37.        Prospects for further industrial development and overall economic
growth remain good. The Second Five-Year Development Plan, which is being
reviewed in the light of increased investment resources and opportunities
resulting from sharply improved oil revenues, envisages that the industrial
sector will grow at 13 percent per annum during the Plan period and that its
share of GDP will increase from 9.8 percent in fiscal year 1973/74 to 12.5
percent in fiscal year 1978/79. The Government places particular emphasis on
developing indigenous Indonesian enterprise. In the foreseeable future,
BAPINDO's business will be limited by its own capacity to lend rather than by
lack of demand.
Resource Requirements
38.        BAPINDO is, and will continue to be, dependent on the Government
for the bulk of its domestic currency resources. The Government provides
funds in the form of equity, long-term loans and refinancing facilities from
Bank Indonesia.  BAPINDO0s foreign exchange resources consist of IDA Credits
No. 310-and 318-IND. The former has been fully cownmitted, while the maritime
credit had an uncommitted balance of $6 million as of September 30, 1974.
39.        There is a strong demand for industrial loans and by April 1,
1°74, BAPINDO's pending loan applications totalled Rp. 61 billion.



BAPIND0 expects total cumnitments between 1974 and 1978 to be about Hp. 320
billion. As of January 1, 1974, BAPIND0 had a surplus of dosestic currency
on a disbursement basis. However, on a commitment basis, it had a deficit
of about Rp. 4 billion.  Domestic currency resource requirements on a commitment
basis for the remaining months of 1974 and all of 1975 and 1976 are estimated
at Rp. 102 billion. Of this amount, Rp. 20 billion are estimated to be derived
from net collections, deposits and internal cash generation. The balance
of Hp. 82 billion would have to be provided by the Government in the form of
equity, direct loans and refinancing by BI under the Investasi Program.
To finance its estimated foreign exchange commitments during the period ending
Dscember, 1972, BAPINDO would need additional resources amounting to about
$100 million equivalent (Rp. 41.5 billion). The proposed Bank loan would
account for about one half of these foreign exchange resource requirements.
The Asian Development Bank and the Kreditanstalt fur a$ederaufbau are also
reported to be interested in providing part of EAPINDO's foreign exchange
resoarces.
Projected Financial Position
40.       A summary of actual and forecast balance sheets, financial ratios
and projected earnings are shoWn in Annex III. BAPINDO's financial position
has improved significantly during thelast few years.   The provision for
doubtful debts is now considered adequate by BAPINDO's auditors and BAPINII)'s
1973 financial statements received an unqualified opinion and clean report
from its independent auditors. As of December 31, 1973, BAPINDO's total
debt/equity ratio was 2.3:1.
41.       BAPINDO's medium and long-term loan portfolio is expected to rise
rapidly from about Pp. 14 billion at the end of 1973 to about Hp. 165
billion at the end of 1978. BAPINDO's profitability is likely to remain low
in 1974 because of significant increases in salary and other personnel
expenses resulting from improvements in pay scales. Profitability should
improve to a satisfactory level from 1975 onward and BAPINDD is expected to
realize a return of 9.4 percent on equity in 1978. Income from BAPINDO's
medium and long-torm portfolio will account for about 68 percent of total
income in 1978.
42.       The Government will provide BAPINDO with equity resources as needed
and its equity base should continue to be strong. The total debt to equity
ratio is expected to rise from 2.57:1 in 1974 to 3.65:1 in 1978; the ratio
of long-term debt to equity is estimated to rise from 1.2:1 in 1974 to 3.2:1
in 1978. The debt service cover, including short-term operations, should re-
main satisfactory.  Daring negotiations it was agreed that BAPINDO would maintain
a long-term debt/eauitv ratio of not more than 3:1 (Sections 3.03 and 3.05 of the
Project Agregment). BAPINDO should have no difficulty in meeting this require-
ment during the next three years, but by 1978 additional equity would have to
be provided or some other arrangements made.

Proposed Loan
43.       The proposed loan of $50 million would be used to finance mainly
the import of machinery and equipment for the industrial sector. Through
the proposed loan, the Bank would continue to support BAPINDO's operations
and assist the growth of the industrial sector. BAPINDO and the Government
share the Bankta view that the relationship, and the assiatance thereby
provided, which the Bank established with BAPINIX beginning in 1969 is still
important notwithstanding the very substantial progress made by BAPIMDO.
44.       BAPINDO's improved appraisal standards justify an increase in the
free limit for individual projects to $500,000 with an aggregate limit of
$15 million (compared to $100,000 and $2.5 illion respectively under Credit
No. 310-IND). The proposed Bank loan would be made to the Government and
would carry interest at 8 percent per annum. The Government would on-lend
to BAPIND0 the proceeds of the Bank loan (Section 3.02 of the Loan Agreement),
denominated in &zpiah, at 8 percent per annum. The subsidiary loan would
be repaid in accordance with the aggregate amortization of aub-loans financed
by BAPINDO, over a maxdmum period of eighteen years, including three years
grace. BAPINDO would charge its borrowers the rates prescribed by Bank
Indonesia, currently 15 percent per annum for loans of HP 100 million or
more and 12 percent per annum on smaller amounts. BAPIND would be per-
mitted a spread of 4 percent per annum on the proceeds of the subsidiary
loan. Any difference between BAPINDO's lending rate and the interest it
pays on the proposed subsidiary loan plus its spread would be retumned to
the Government as an exchange risk guarantee fee. The marmum term for
sub-loans made by BAPINDX would be 15 years.
45.       The proposed loan would be disbursed against 100 percent of the
foreign exchange cost of imports, 60 percent of the total expenditures for
vehicles, machinery and equipment procured in Indonesia, and 40 percent of
total expenditures for civil works. These percentages represent the esti-
mated foreign exehAnge component of expenditures in the respective cate.
gories. In order to provide continuity of Bank Group financing for BAPINDOs
foreign exchange requirements, BAPINDO would be permitted to finance from
the proceeds of the proposed loan up to $3 million equivalent for expendi-
tures which BAPINDO has made on sub-projects mince July 1, 1974, provided
the sub-projects are acceptable to the Bank (Section 2.03 of the Loan
Agreement).
PART V - LMkLL INSTRUKZNTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the lbpublic of Indonesia and

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONV
Cr. No. 127 Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$5 Million Credit
of September , 19681; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project includes the supply of earth-moving equipment and
machinery to augment hand labor in rehabilitation work on three irrigation
systems (in Java) and the construction of a fourth (in South Sumatra).
All the equipment supplied under the credit is being well utilized and
disbursements are 98 percent of appraisal timetable. Completion of the
project is expected to be delayed in order to complete much additional
needed drainage work, the financing of which was not provided for under
the credit. These additional costs will be met by the Government. The
revised economic rate of return on the project, which was calculated at
50 percent at appraisal, is now expected to be about 25 percent. The
closing date has been postponed to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 154 Highways; US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project is progressing satisfactorily. Due to delays in
the delivery of the remaining materials and equipment by suppliers, the
closing date might be postponed by six months.
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates; US$16 Million Credit of
June 20, 1969; Closing Date:  December 31, 1975
This credit is for the rehabilitation of two Government o-wned
estate groups in North Sumatra. With recent improvemaents in management and
much higher international prices for rubber the financial situation of the
PNP V estate is improving. Now that field and factory standards have been
raised to a good technical level the management has been advised to concen-
trate on cost control in order to prepare for the time when produce prices
are less attractive than they are today. The combined efforts of the manage-
ment, consultants and IDA supervision missions are yielding good results.
Cr. No. 165 Electricity Distribution; US$15 Million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Closing Date:   June 30, 1975
See comment for Credit No. 334. The closing date has been
postponed by 18 months to June 30, 1975.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 193 PUSRI Fertilizer Expansion; US$35 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970 (as amended May 1973); Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
The urea plant has now been completed and was inaugurated in
August by the President and is producing fertilizer.  The gas gathering
and transmission system is nearing completion and sufficient gas is
being delivered to the plant for operation.   Despite capital cost in-
creases the project will be quite remunerative. Gliven the capital costs
that are substantially lower than esLimates for similar projects presently
under consideration, and the preseintly expected long-range international
prices for urea, the economic rate of return, calculated at 14 percent at
the time of appraisal, is now in excess of 30 percent. Disbursements are
expected to be completed by the closing date of December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 194 Agricultural Estates; US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project is for the rehabilitation of two Government-
owned estate groups in North Sumatra. During 1973 a record 3,200 ha of
oil palm were planted on PNP VI estate.   The 1973 rubber program was
reduced following the adviceof the last Supervision Mission as PNP IV
estate was over-extended; if the high standards of replanting now being
achieved can be maintained, it slhould be possible to increase the size of
future programs. Management has improved in the field and factory and
reasonable standards are being maintained. More emphasis is required on
cost control and management has agreed to take the necessary action.
Solid progress is being achieved and PNP VI's financial situation has been
greatly helped by the present higher producer prices.   PNP IV estate has
also made marked progress during 1973 and 197T and is in a satisfactory
financial position.
Cr. No. 195 Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US$18.5 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: November 30, 1976
Problems of quality and progress still exist, but, the
consultants are tackling these vigorously, and the situation is improv-
ing. Costs are likely to exceed the overall appraisal estimate, but
the Government will  provide any additional fund1s required.  Completion
of disbursements will be about two years behind the original schedule.
Cr. No. 210 Telecommunications; US$12.8 Million Credit of
July 13, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Orders for all equipment have now been placed. The managemelt
consultants have completed their work but have been retained to implement
their recommendations. The Government has recently increased the tariffs
to achieve the required rate of return and a new charter for PERUMTEL has
also been prepared0 The closing datehas been postponed by 18 months due
to delays in delivery of goods.

Cr. No. 211 Fisheries; US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Closing Date: Jume 30, 1976
After a slow start, this project is now progressing satis-
factorily. Project management satisfactory to the Association has now
been appointed; contracts with engineering and management consultants
have been concluded and the consultants have begun work and the contract
for the shore facilities has been awarded.
Cr. No. 216 Technical Assistance II; US .0 Million Credit of
September 15     OI70  Closing Date:  Decemnber 31. 1974
This project is progressing satisfactorily, but it has been
necessary to postpone the closing date by one year to ccmplete disburse-
ments for on-going studies.
Cr. No. 219 Educationi US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6. 170;
Closing Date:  December 21, 1976
Project implementation is generally satisfactory. Civil works
are progressing well and will be completed before end 1975. Tenders for
furniture were invited in June and items will be delivered during the last
month of 1974. Contracts for about 60 percent of the equipment have been
awarded and will be delivered before the TTCs start operations in 1975.
The remaining equipment is being retendered because incomplete bids were
received. All equipment will be delivered by September, 1975. Technical
assistance is provided by Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of
the United Kingdom. Cost overrUns on construction, furniture, and equipment,
and savings on technical assistance will probably result in a total cost
overrun of about 30 percent above the appraisal estimate. The Government
will provide funds to meet this overrun.
Cr. No. 220 Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US$14.5 Million Credit of
Novemiber 6, 1270; Closing Date: December 31. 1975
This project covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabilitation and
re-introduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systems, two
in Java and one in South Sulawesi, Construction remains about two years
behind schedule. The problems with preparation of contract documents,
which have caused this delay, have been overcome and, while no further
delays are expected, it is unlikely it.hat the time lost could be regained.
There has been some increase in overall project costs, which is being met
by the Government. Sensitivity tests run at the time of appraisal showed
that a two year delay and 15 percent cost overrun would reduce the economic
rate of return from 25 percent to 21 percent.
Cr. No. 246  Seeds; US$7.5 Mlllion Credit of May 14, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 197
Project implementation is behind schedule due to initial
delays in organization, management and procurement. The latest
supervision mission has reported that development of the Seed Farm is



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 10 pages
hampered by the slow execution of a contract to develop irrigation infras-
tructure. Project agencies and the Government are now discussing steps
which need to be taken for timely completion of the irrigation works. The
establishment of rice-seed research facilities at the project site is
progressing slowly due to difficulties in recruiting qualified local staff
to work at the somewhat isolated site in the absence of adequate salary
compensation under civil service regulations. This matter is now being
reviewed within the Bank before being discussed with the Government. The
seeds certification service is performing well and development of the
Klaten Seed District is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 259  Tea; US$15 Million Credit of June 24_ 1971;
Closing Date: June 30. 1978
This credit is for the rehabilitation for two groups of
Government-owned tea estates in West Java. Despite management weaknesses
in cost control and efficiency, progress to date is satisfactory and
relationships between management and consultants are good. Recently
revised cost estimates for factory rehabilitation and expansion are sub-
stantially above appraisal estimates and project consultants are reviewing
them.
Cr. No. 260 HighwaysII; US$35 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Closing Date; September 3,0 1975
This project in Sumatra consists of construction of
about 200 km of highway, detailed engineering of further highway
sections and a regional development study. All construction work is
now satisfactorily underway. However, the delay caused initially by
slow progress on mobilizing contractors, difficulties in equipment
delivery, heavy rains and land slides will result in the project being
completed about one year behind schedule. Design standards for the road
sections have been slightly lowered and some savings will therefore be
achieved. These and other savings are expected to offset construction
cost increases.
Cr. Noo 275  Technical Assistance III;  US$4.0 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971;  Closing Date:. December 31, 1975
Progress on this project is satisfactory. The closing date
has been postponed to complete disbursements for ongoing studies.
Cr. No. 288 Second Education' US$6.3 Million Credit of
March 9, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Working drawings and furniture and equipment lists for all
project institutions are almost completed. Physical facilities will be
completed by October 1976 and all project institutions will begin opera-
tions by the end of 1976. However, this schedule depends greatly on
t'Unely provision of adequate government funds, which because of an expected
cost overrun of US$8.6 million will have to be substantially increased.
Postponement of the closing date by about six months is likely to be
required.

Cr. No. 289 Irrigation Rehabilitation IV; US$12.5 Milllon Credit
of March 9. 1972: Closing Date: June 30. 1977
The project is located in East Java and consists of rehabili-
tation of the irrigation system and the re-establishment of satisfactory
operation and maintenance procedures in five non-contiguous areas total-
ling 229,000 ha, known as Pekalen-Sampean, It also provides for the
employment of consultants to assist in the execution of Pekalen-Sampean
and for feasibility studies of further irrigation rehabilitation projects.
Civil works and equipment purchase for the main project, Pekalen-Sampean,
are just beginning and completion of civil works will be about one year
behind schedule. Consultants for the various studies are at work with
their counterparts. Groundwater investigations will be delayed due to
procurement difficulties. The rehabilitation and storage feasibility
studies are on schedule. Disbursements are on schedule.
Cr. No. 300 Population. US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Progress under the project continues to be hampered by manage-
ment weaknesses and delays in obtaining local currency funds because of
restrictive Government budgetary procedures. Vehicle procurement, which
has been delayed due to the Government ban on importing fully built-up
cars, is now proceeding satisfactorily. After initial delays, construction
of health centers is now proceeding.
Cr. No. 310 Development Finance; US$10 Million Credit of
June 7. 1972; Closing Date: December 31. 1976
This credit is now fully committed. Disbursements are
expected to rise rapidly.
Cr. No. 318  Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation; US$8 .5 Million
Credit of June 28. 1972; Closing Date: September 30. 1976
Progress on this project is satisfactory but the weak finan-
cial position of PELNI, the Government-owned shipping company and main
sub-borrower, has caused concern. An audit of PEINI has been completed
anid in consultation with the Asscoiation and BAPINDO, the Government is
taking appropriate action to strengthen PELNI's financial position.
Cr. No. 319 Agricultural Estates IV; US$I1 Million Credit of
Je     28. 1972;  Closing Date:  June 30. 1981
This project includes the rehabilitation of a Government-
owned estate group in southern Sumatra. The project has recovered



ANNEX II
Page 8 of lopages
from initial delays and has made the best progress of any of the Indonesian
estates projects. There is a need, however, for much increased attention
to training of the top management staff. Agricultural conditions are now
generally very good, rubber production is 50 percent higher than in the
corresponding period of 1973 and financial control is slowly improving.
Increased emphasis is now being placed on estate cost accounting and
accurate budgeting.
Cr. No. 33ity Distribu                     US$     Milli
ePtember 29, 1972; Closing Date:    December 31, 1976
The Jakarta Distribution Project, financed from Credits 165
and 334-IND (together US$55 million), is proceeding satisfactorily. The
total foreign cost is presently estimated at US$56.2 million, about
US$1.2 million above the Credit amounts. The Government is expected to
finance the overrun. Completion is expected by end 1976.
Cr. No. 355 Beef Cattle Developmelnt; US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31. 1973; Closing Date:   March 31, 1980
This project for development of beef cattle production in the
outer islands is now making progress after a slow start, caused largely
by delays in clearance of documents by Indonesian Government departments
and consequent lack of essential equipment. Land acquisition is proving
more difficult than expected.
Cr. No.      North Sumatra Sallholder Devalopment US$5     llion Credit
of Febru      1       Closin Date:    December 31, 1981
This credit became effective on August 13, 1973 and has suffered
from severe financial and organizational difficulties due primarily to the
lack of experience of project management, the remote location of the project
and inadequate Central Government support. The Resident Staff has been
following the project closely. Government has taken a number of steps to
ovetcome the problems and accelerate project implementation. Project
progress will continue to be closely monitored.
Cr. No. 387 Education III; US$3.5 Million Credit of
June 1. 197; Closing Date: December 31. 1981
This credit was declared effective on August 30, 1973. Manu-
script preparation and testing are on schedule and the first year's staff
training programs will be completed in sufficient time to enable the mobile
teacher training teams to start operation in Januay 1975 as planned.
Equipment procurement, which has been delayed by about nine months partly
because of the Government's reluctance to permit the import of vehicle is
now under way. Because of the sharp increase in worldwide paper prices and
shortage of supply, difficulty will be experienced in obtaining sufficient

paper under the Canadian loan included in the project financing for the
1975 printing schedule; the Central Government has undertaken to release
supplies from its stockpile. The expected cost overrun arising from
increased paper prices will be met by the Indonesian Government.
Project management is good and the team of technical assistance specialists
is operating effectively.
Cr. No. 388 Highwaya III; US$14 Million Credit of June 1. 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This credit is for the construction of 124 km, of highway and
two bridges in North Sulawesi and the study and detailed engineering of
further highways in Java. Construction bidding and consultant selection
have been proceeding on schedule. Some cost increases, due to inflation,
are expected, which might be partly offset by savings on other parts of
the project.
Cr. No. 399 West Java Thermal Power; US$16 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
This credit became effective on August 28, 1973. The contract
for design of the power station has been signed, initial progress is
satisfactory and bids for the major equipment items are due by mid-
October. PLN submitted on schedule the first annual program of measures
under its financial recovery plan as required by the Credit Agreement. The
Association agreed to the program, and it has been put into effect,
Cr. No. 400  Smallholder and Private Estate Tea; US$7.8 Million
Credit of June 22, 1973; Closing Date: March 31. 1982
This credit is for the rehabilitation and replanting of small-
holder and private estate tea areas, the rehabilitation of five privately
owned black tea factories and the construction of two new black tea
factories in Wbst and Central Java. Progress is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 405 Sugar Project: US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973: Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This credit is for rehabilitation of the Government-owned
sugar industry. Bids for about 60 percent of equipment required for
first phase major rehabilitation (Part A) have been invited, and the
bids for the balance of this equipment are due to be invited by
November 1974.

Cr. No. 428 Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate; US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14. 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Despite recent increase in construction costs, the project
remains financially viable because revenues from the sale of plots has
risen proportionately. Construction is proceeding at an acceptable rate
and developed land is being occupied as fast as it is made available.
While there is still a backlog of applications for industrial plots, the
rate of new applications has fallen off during recent months and the
estate is intensifying its promotional efforts.
Cr. No. 436 Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI);
US$10 Million Credit of November 20 1973; Closing Date:
December 31. 1978
