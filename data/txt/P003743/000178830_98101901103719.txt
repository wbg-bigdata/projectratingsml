INDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF BANK PEMBANGUNAN INDONESIA (BAPINDO)
SUMMARY, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND UNDERSTANDINGS REACHED
i.        The World Bank Group's (WBG's) association with Bank Pembangunan
Indonesia (BAPINDO) dates back to 1969. A detailed examination in December
of that year, made by a Bank mission at the request of the Government (GOI),
revealed that BAPINDO was organizationally weak, grossly under-capitalized,
with a portfolio of dubious quality, and with unacceptably low standards of
appraisal and follow-up. In June 1970, GOI and WBG agreed on a reorganization
and financial restructuring of BAPINDO, as part of a rationalization of
the institutional arrangements for providing long-term capital for industry.
BAPINDO was to become the main domestic source of long-term capital for the
private sector.
ii.       Since June 1970 considerable progress has been made in implementing
the agreed reorganization, helped by close cooperation among the Government,
WBG, and BAPINDO. BAPINDO's management was strengthened; its capital base
was improved by the conversion of Government loans into equity, and by fresh
infusions of cash; its portfolio was analysed, a part was transferred out of
BAPINDO's responsibility, and substantial provisions were made against doubt-
ful debts on the remainder; and its accounts were audited by outside in-
dependent auditors. BAPINDO also engaged six Advisors, selected and recom-
mended by WBG. In December 1971, after sufficient progress had been made,
Bank Indonesia (BI) rescinded its earlier prohibition against BAPINDO's
making loans to new clients, and in May 1972 the International Development
Association (IDA) made a Credit of $10 million to BAPINDO. In June 1972 IDA
made a second credit of $8.5 million 1/ for the rehabilitation of inter-island
regular liner service (RLS), when the Government designated BAPINDO the bank
for handling credits for the shipping sector.
iii.      Progress made by BAPINDO since the first Credit was made has been
remarkable. The Board of Managing Directors, with the help of the Advisors
and continuing advice from WBG, has worked hard to streamline the organization,
improve appraisal standards, bring order into the portfolio inherited from
the past and, particularly from the second half of 1973, to increase the
volume of new business. For its part, GOI has continued its active help and
cooperation; since the first Credit was made, GOI has paid an additional
amount of Rp 11.3 billion into BAPINDO's capital to strengthen its equity,
and to enable it to undertake a growing volume of business. Two of the more
significant developments in 1973 were a retrenchment of about 40% of its staff
(from 1263 to 750), and the closing of 8 uneconomic branches (out of a total
of 18), and their conversion into representative offices; both these actions
represented implementation of understandings reached earlier with WBG.
1/   This amount included $1.5 million for technical assistance.



- ii -
iv.       As a result of the improvements between 1971 and 1973, BAPINDO is
now a far more effective institution than it was in 1969, with a sense of
corporate purpose and direction, and growing confidence in its ability to ful-
fill its role. For the first time in BAPINDO's history, external auditors
gave it an unqualified report on its azcounts, (for the year ended December 31,
1973). During 1973, it committed 163 loans for a total of Rp 50.7 billion.
More significantly, the proportion of long-term loans to total commitments
increased substantially. BAPINDO's commitments in 1974 have shown further
growth, and with the transfer of raw cotton loan business to Bank Ekspor-
Impor, BAPINDO will now concentrate on providing long-term capital, the role
conceived for it by GOI and WBG in 1970.
v.        Notwithstanding the remarkable progress already made by BAPINDO,
there is both scope and need for further improvement. BAPINDO's Board of
Supervisors needs to be enlarged and made more effective; and BAPINDO's
authorized capital needs to be increased in view of its growing operations.
Internally, appraisal standards need to be improved further, particularly
to analyze more fully the economic aspects of projects. BAPINDO also needs
to institute an effective system of project supervision. These and other
weaknesses are recognized by the management and remedial actions are being
taken. Currently the emphasis is on staff training and improvement, and
recently three senior officials received training for up to three months
each in three of the more experienced DFCs associated with WBG; the training
programs were arranged by the Bank.
vi.       The economic, industrial, and financial environment in which BAPINDO
operates offers good prospects for BAPINDO's continued growth. The investment
needs of the private sector are large and continuing, and the shortage of
long-term capital continues. BAPINDO estimates that its commitments for the
three years, ending December 1976, would amount to Rp 151 billion, including
an estimated Rp 53 billion for foreign exchange commitments for the last two
quarters of 1974, 1975 and 1976. These foreign exchange commitments, the
equivalent of US$100 million, would involve imports. The estimated commitments,
although justified and achievable if viewed from the demand side, may appear
somewhat optimistic from the point of view of BAPINDO's current processing
capacity.
vii.      BAPINDO's domestic currency resources would be provided principally
by GOI in the form of equity, loans and refinance, and also through net col-
lections and retained earnings. Foreign currency needs in the immediate
future would be met from the proposed Bank loan, as BAPINDO does does not
have any other foreign currency resources. The Bank has suggested, and
BAPINDO is exploring, raising loans from other sources, including KfW, which
is considering making a DM 22 million loan.
viii.     The proposed Bank loan would continue the Bank Group's support of
the industrial sector in Indonesia. It would also provide continuity in WBG's
institution-building role which began in 1969, and which will continue to be



- iii -
important notwithstanding the very substantial progress made by BAPINDO.
In view of the foregoing, a Bank loan of $50 million is recommended, to be
made to GOI, and on-lent to BAPINDO.
ix.       During negotiations the following understandings were reached:
(a) GOI will raise BAPINDO's authorized capital to
Rp 50 billion by December 31, 1974 (paragraph 3.01);
(b) GOI will, if legally possible, arrange for delegation
of the authority of the Minister of Finance and the
Governor of Bank Indonesia to qualified representatives,
as it relates to their membership of BAPINDO's Super-
visory Board. GOI will also investigate the possibility
of appointing three additional members to the Board
(paragraph 3.02);
(c) GOI will assume the exchange risk on the proposed loan.
BAPINDO's spread will be restricted to a maximum of 4%
per annum on sub-loans. The difference, if any, between
BAPINDO's lending rate and the sum of the rate charged
by GOI to BAPINDO (the Bank's current rate), and the
maximum spread of 4% would be passed on to GOI as a
fee for assuming the exchange risk (paragraph 2.28);
(d) BAPINDO's free limit for individual sub-projects should
be raised to $500,000, with an aggregate limit of
$15 million on all free limit projects (paragraph 5.10);
(e) The debt equity ratio should be set at 3:1, and the
definition of debt should exclude short-term debt,
as is the case with most development finance companies
(paragraph 5.10);
(f) In order to maintain continuity of WBG financing, with-
drawals by BAPINDO aggregating the equivalent of up
to $3 million should be allowed under the proposed loan
for expenditures relating to sub-loans made on or after
July 1, 1974 (paragraph 5.11);
(g) the definition of eligible expenditures should be the
same as in the first IDA Credit (paragraph 5.09).






INDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF BANK PEMBANGUNAN INDONESIA (BAPINDO)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Since 1969 the World Bank Group (WBG) has worked with the Govern-
ment of Indonesia (GOI) to improve the institutional arrangements for the
provision of finance for medium- and long-term investment in the industrial
sector in Indonesia. The government-owned Bank Pembangunan Indonesia
(BAPINDO) has been and remains an important focal point of the joint efforts
of the Government and the WBG. By May 1972 progress in reorganizing and
strengthening BAPINDO had reached the stage at which the Association was
able to make BAPINDO a Credit of $10 million. It was followed in June 1972
by an additional Credit of $8.5 million to finance a rehabilitation program
for inter-island shipping.
1.02      The WBG has continued, since the first two Credits were made, to
follow BAPINDO's progress closely and to assist it whenever possible. As
will be detailed later in this report, BAPINDO's progress has been remark-
able, although there still remains room for much improvement. The WBG
intends to continue to make available to BAPINDO such advice and guidance
as BAPINDO considers it needs and the WBG considers it can offer. On the
basis of the WBG's experience with BAPINDO over the past five years, there
is good reason to believe that BAPINDO will make substantial further pro-
gress. The effects of that progress should carry beyond BAPINDO itself.
Paragraphs 2.24, 4.06 and 4.07 below, with respect to BAPINDO's appraisal
of and lending to Regional Development Banks in Indonesia, give an interesting
insight into the "multiplier" effect that the WBG's transfer of expertise
to an important financial institution in a member country can have. Since
the quality of the advice that BAPINDO is able to offer to the Regional
Development Banks will depend on the standards of performance BAPINDO is
able to achieve for itself, the continuance of BAPINDO's close association
with the WBG should have far-reaching, beneficial effects.
1.03      The recent growth of industry in Indonesia has exceeded expectations,
and the combined efforts of Indonesian term lending institutions have not
been adequate to meet the growing demand for investment funds. As a result,
foreign financial sources have been called on for significant investment in
Indonesia. In 1973, GOI decided that BAPINDO should henceforth concentrate
primarily on making loans to medium- and large-scale industrial enterprises,
and made arrangements for BAPINDO's lending to small-scale enterprise to be
supplemented by other sources of finance. With these considerations in mind,
and on the basis of the appraisal contained in this report, a Bank loan for
BAPINDO of $50 million is recommended.

II. ECONOMIC, INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT
Economic Environment
2.01      The performance and prospects of the Indonesian economy were
described in: "The Indonesian Economy: Recent Developments and Prospects
for 1974/75", November 26, 1973, 286-IND. A Basic Economic Mission assessed
Indonesia's longer term development prospects and policies during October
1974; its findings are not yet available.
2.02      Repelita I.  The First Five-Year Development Plan (Repelita I) ran
from April 1, 1969 to March 31, 1974. During this period, substantial im-
provements were made in rehabilitating the infrastructure, laying the founda-
tion for further development of the economy. GDP rose at an average rate
of 7% per annum. The share of the agricultural sector fell from 47.7% to
40.2% of GDP, while the industrial sector's share rose from 9.3% to 9.8%
of GDP. The agricultural sector grew by 3% per annum, mainly because of
increased rice production; the industrial sector grew at over 11% per annum,
following large domestic and foreign investment. Gross domestic capital
formation increased at an average rate of around 25% in real terms (34%
at current prices). The share of gross investment in GDP increased from
8.8% in 1968-69 to 17.7% in 1973-74, and foreign resources made a significant
contribution to this growth.
2.0:3     Repelita II.  The Second Five-Year Development Plan (Repelita II)
which will run from April 1, 1974 to March 31, 1979, aims at a more equit-
able distribution of development benefits through the expansion of social
welfare activities, and the creation of greater employment opportunities.
Real GDP is projected to rise at 7.5% per annum, and per capita income by
about 5.7% per annum, despite an estimated population increase of 2.3% per
annum. Total investment is expected to rise by 13.2% per annum in real terms
(23.4% at current prices). The proportion of gross investment to GDP will
rise from 17.7% in 1973/74 to 22.9% in 1978/79. Agriculture is expected to
grow at 4.6% per annum, but its contribution to GDP will fall from 40.2% in
1973/74 to 35.6% in 1978/79. The industrial sector is expected to grow at
13%, and its share of GDP will rise from 9.8% in 1973/74 to 12.5% in 1978/79.
2.04      Further expansion is projected for industries which process domestic
raw materials, effect import substitution or are export-oriented. The small-
scale sector will receive special attention because of its potential for
increasing employment. Exports of crude oil, timber, agricultural products
and other minerals are expected to continue their recent rapid growth. Import
policies will give priority to capital goods and industrial raw materials.
Substantial expenditures will be made on regional development to achieve a
more balanced growth. Policies relating to foreign and domestic investment
will aim at encouraging the growth of local industries, especially in the
small scale sector.



-3-
2.05      A total investment of Rp 11,023.4 billion is expected to be made;
the contribution of foreign resources to total investment is expected to
decline from 39% in 1974/75 to 22% in 1978/79. Government development ex-
penditures will rise to 45.6% of total investment in 1978/79, compared with
42.7% in 1974/75. Some of these figures and targets have, however, been
rendered obsolete by the jump in export earnings from oil, which already
totalled $1.724 billion for the first five months of 1974, exceeding the
$1.708 billion earned from oil exports during the entire year 1973. The
Plan's basic strategy, which was designed to reduce dependence on foreign
aid will, however, remain intact.
Industrial Environment
2.06      Features of Industrialization.  Indonesia is still at the thresh-
old of industrialization. The manufacturing sector is relatively undeveloped;
its share of GDP is lower than that usual in a country at a similar stage of
development, and of a comparable domestic market size. The estimated annual
value-added per capita by this sector is only $5.88; and the industry mix is
still dominated by consumer goods. Indonesia's industrialization process
exhibits the following broad features: (a) a domestic market orientation,
encouraged by a large population; (b) increasing participation by foreign
private capital, following generous incentives and a favorable investment
climate; (c) an apparent persistence of excess capacity in certain sectors
such as textiles, cigarettes and matches, due to such problems as input
shortages, shortage of working capital, and lack of effective demand; (d)
low efficiency and productivity of public sector manufacturing enterprises,
primarily due to poor management; (e) a geographical concentration in Java,
particularly in and around Jakarta; and (f) a small but heavily promoted
indigenous manufacturing sector. There is a new sense of urgency, shared
by both GOI and the private sector, in stepping up the pace of industrial
development, and large investments have been made during recent months
which will greatly extend the size and range of the manufacturing sector.
2.07      Industrial Structure.  Reliable statistical data are not easily
available. Some light was shed on the broad structure of the industrial
sector by the 1970 Industrial Survey, which found consumer goods, particularly
food products (including tobacco), contributing 62% of total manufacturing
output in 1969. The food processing, textiles, apparel, footwear and trans-
port equipment (assembly and repair) industries predominated. Intermediate
and capital goods industries are only recently making their appearance.
Industrial chemicals, including fertilizer and petro-chemicals, are in an
early stage of development. Several small steel mills exist, producing items
mainly for the construction industry; additional steel capacity is being
mobilised.
2.08      According to the 1970 Survey of Large- and Medium-Scale Manufac-
turing Industries, medium- and large-scale enterprises 1/ numbered 17,900 in
1/   The Survey defined "large" establishments as those having 100 workers
or more without power equipment or 50 workers or more with power equip-
ment. The "medium" establishments were defined as those having 50-99
workers without power equipment or 5-49 workers with power equipment.



-4-
1969. Large-scale firms accounted for only 11% of total industrial establish-
ments. Firms in the 'food and beverage' industry accounted for 35%, and those
in the 'textile' industry for 27%, of the total number of large- and medium-
scale enterprises.  No reliable data are available regarding the structural
characteristics of the small-scale sector.
2.09      In 1969, medium- and large-scale firms in the food processing in-
dustry employed more than one-third of the total labor force in the medium-
and large-scale sectors. Tobacco and textile industries were next in im-
portance. Medium- and large-scale enterprises together employed 849,000
workers, or about 3.7% of Indonesia's total labor force. Large-scale firms
employed on average 302 workers per plant, while medium-scale firms averaged
about 16 workers per plant. As stated earlier (paragraph 2.07), intermediate
and capital goods industries are only recently making an appearance; their
contribution to employment and output is still small.
2.10      Industrial development is concentrated on Java, which has 782 of
existing medium- and large-scale firms, and 86% of total manufacturing em-
ployment. Java also has the largest scale of production with an average
of 53 workers per plant.  Jakarta accounts for 11% of firms located, and 7%
of total industrial employment, in Java. Industrial activity also tends to
be concentrated in and around large cities elsewhere in the Indonesian
archipelago.
2.11      Industrial Investment.  From January 1967 through December 1973
the value of approved foreign investment projects, in sectors other than
petroleum and banking, amounted to $3.1 billion. 1/  Major shares were
as follows: $1.2 billion or 38.7% in manufacturing, $959.9 million or
30.6% in mining and quarrying, and $497.8 million or 15.8% in forestry.
In 1973 the value of foreign investments approved reached $615.8 million,
compared with $522.0 million in 1972. Approvals in the manufacturing sector
rose sharply to $455.5 million, mainly due to a $235.1 million share for
the textile and leather industries. The "implementation" of approvals
(expenditures) at end 1973 was, however, estimated at only $1.1 billion,
or 35'c of total approvals. Implementation dropped to $319 million in 1973,
compared to $344 million in 1972, mainly due to projects with slow gestation
in the mining and quarrying sectors. To improve efficiency, GOI set up the
Investment Coordinating Board (ICB) in June 1973, replacing the Technical
Committee on Capital Investment, and its subcommittees, the Foreign Investment
Board and the Domestic Investment Board. Various concerned ministries are
represented on ICB, and applicants both foreign and domestic need now deal
only with one agency.
2.12      Domestic investment approvals also grew rapidly; 1816 projects,
envisaging a total investment of Rp 1,236 billion, were approved from
November 1968 through December 1973 2/. In 1973 total approvals reached
1/   See Annex 1.
2/   See Annex 2.



- 5 -
Rp 569.4 billion, compared with Rp 297.6 billion in 1972. The share of
domestic investment approvals in total approvals rose from 28% in 1972
to 69% in 1973.
2.13      Some important investment regulations were amended in early 1974.
New foreign investments are allowed only in the form of joint ventures, on
the understanding that the Indonesian share be increased to 51% within a
specified period, usually ten years. Some tax incentives have been reduced,
the list of industries closed to foreign investors expanded, and a larger
number o' Indonesians are to be employed in foreign or joint-venture enter-
prises. Regulations regarding domestic investment were also revised to en-
sure greater participation by "indigenous" Indonesians. Effective February
1974, only indigenous or "pribumi" 1/ enterprises are allowed access to the
medium-term credit facilities under the INVESTASI program 2/. It is too
early to assess the effects of these changes on both foreign and domestic
investment, but the momentum of industrial growth is not expected to be
significantly diminished.
2.14      Obstacles to Further Growth.  There have been marginal improve-
ments in removing the following major impediments to further rapid industrial
growth: (a) the lack of adequate public infrastructure of all kinds; (b)
the scarcity of entrepreneurship, and of a broad range of business and manage-
ment skills; (c) administrative and bureaucractic obstacles which cause in-
vestors considerable delays and difficulties in getting decisions and obtain-
ing interpretation of laws; and (d) the scarcity of equity capital and of
finance for current assets. The Government recognizes these impediments
and remedial actions on a broad front have been taken or are being taken.
However, these are basic problems and solutions will emerge only over a long
period.
Financial Environment
2.15      Banking Structure.  The banking network consists of the Central
Bank, Bank Indonesia (BI); five large state-owned commercial banks; a state
Development Bank (BAPINDO); two joint-venture development banks, 3/ Indonesian
Development Finance Company (IDFC) and the Private Development Finance Com-
pany of Indonesia (PDFCI); 26 regional development banks; 128 small domestic
private banks; and branches of 11 foreign banks. There are also about 9,000
savings and village banks, but their assets are relatively insignificant. BI
and the state banks predominate, accounting for almost 90% of total outstand-
ing bank credit; domestic and foreign private banks account for the larger
1/   Indigenous or "pribumi" enterprises are those companies in which in-
digenous entrepreneurs control either 75% of the equity, or 50% of the
equity and key management positions.

part of the remainder. Foreign bank branches have grown rapidly in the last
few years, and are now larger and more important than local private banks.
2.16      The five State commercial banks have for historical reasons
specialized in providing finance for particular sectors, although there is
some overlapping 1/.
2.17      Money and Capital Markets.  Money and capital markets are in a
very early stage of development. G0I created the Agency for Money and
Capital Market Development in January 1972, which is currently working on,
among other proposals, the establishment of a securities and exchange ad-
ministration. Nine merchant banks (joint-ventures between foreign and
local banks) were given licenses during 1973/74 to help develop the money
and capital market. It is too soon to say how successful they will be in
meeting their objective 2/. At present they deal in short-term commercial
paper, real estate, and act as local agents for their parent banks in ob-
taining foreign currency loans for their clients. There is a small stock
exchange that deals mainly in shares of previously Dutch-owned pre-war en-
terprises, now largely owned by the State and recently converted into limited
liability companies. An important obstacle to rapid development of the
capital market is the weak financial position of most Indonesian companies.
2.18      Short-Term Credit.  Short-term credit is extended by banks for
periods of up to one year; most loans are for three or six months duration,
and can be renewed depending upon the bank/borrower relationship. There is
no broad, well-developed bill market for discounting trade paper, and working
capital is generally hard to obtain.
2.19      Medium- and Long-Term Credit.  Term credit for industrial projects
is available from all banks, although foreign banks must obtain BI's approval
to make loans for more than a year. No state banks, except BAPINDO, can make
loans for periods beyond five years. Term finance, except that part extended
by local institutions out of foreign currency lines of credit, is largely
extended under the INVESTASI program (Annex 3) introduced by the Government
in 1969. The total amount of loans approved under this program up to
January 31, 1974 was Rp 167.8 billion, and total disbursements stood at
Rp 116.1 billion. The private sector received Rp 91.1 billion or 78.5% of
total disbursements, and Rp 25.0 billion or 21.5% went to the public sector.

2.20      One of the major institutional developments during 1973 was the
setting up, with active WBG assistance, of P.T. Private Development Finance
Company of Indonesia (PDFCI), a privately-owned development finance company.
PDFCI, in addition to making term loans, will actively seek equity invest-
ments and will also play a role in promoting new enterprises.
2.21      With the establishment of PDFCI there are now three domestic
specialized institutions for providing long-term capital. BAPINDO is by far
the largest. PDFCI's initial resources amount to $21 million equivalent,
and it is yet to enter the operational phase; IDFC had total outstanding
resources of less than $10 million equivalent. BAPINDO is, and will continue
to be, the principal domestic source of medium- and long-term capital for the
private industrial sector.
Financing for Small-Scale Industry
2.22      Until early 1973 most loans under the INVESTASI scheme had been
directed to medium or large industrial enterprises. In April 1973 the
Government announced that 65% of future assistance under the INVESTASI
program would be reserved for small loans. During 1973, the Government
also established a new agency, P.T. Bahana, for making equity investments
in, and providing management assistance to, small businesses. The Govern-
ment had also earlier set upP.T. Asuransi Kredit Indonesia (ASKRINDO) to
insure bank loans made to small business up to certain limits, to encour-
age banks to increase their lending to this sector.
2.23      ASKRINDO's program was expanded in December 1973; medium-term and
working capital loans to small industry are now automatically insured up to
75% of total risk. This change accompanied an expanded INVESTASI program of
assistance to small businesses, under which an amount of Rp 12 billion was
set aside for such loans made through the state banks, including BAPINDO.
An overall limit of Rp 2 billion was initially set for each state bank.
Maximum amounts that can be borrowed by each customer are Rp 5 million for
investment loans, and a similar amount for permanent working capital.
2.24      To reach a larger number of small borrowers and to improve the
institutional arrangements for financing small borrowers, BAPINDO instituted
a new co-financing scheme with selected Regional Development Banks (RDBs).
Under this program BAPINDO appraises the RDBs, and extends them a line of
credit. The agreement provides for BAPINDO's financing in each sub-project
to be limited to 10% of the total loan for fixed assets, and 20% of the total
loan for working capital; BI provides 80% and 70% respectively, and the balance
of 10% is provided by the RDBs. BAPINDO has appraised and entered into agree-
ments with 8 RDBs. BAPINDO's plans call for 5 more appraisals during 1975.
Inflation
2.25      Indonesia achieved a remarkable degree of price stability during
1969-71. However, the inflation rate which had declined to 2.6% in 1971 shot



-8-
up to 25.7% in 1972, largelybecause of an increase in rice prices following
a serious drought. Strong inflationary pressures continued during 1973 and
the early part of 1974, caused by domestic demand, fueled by a sizeable
credit expansion, the strong rise in export prices (particularly oil) and
the increase in prices of imported goods and raw materials used by domestic
industries. The Jakarta consumer price index rose by 27% during 1973, and
by a further 16% in the first quarter of 1974. Prices rose by 472 over the
twelve-month period ended March 1974, compared to a 21% increase in the
previous comparable period. Alarmed by the rapid inflation, the Government
announced a package of strong anti-inflationary measures on April 9, 1974,
including credit rationing and changes in interest rates. The inflation
rate for the period April-July 1974 has already been contained to about 5.6%,
and the months of August and September have shown a further reduction.
Interest Rates
2.26      Current interest rates and changes made in the recent past are
given in Annex 6. Interest rates for all state banking institutions are
prescribed by BI.
2.27      In the 60's when inflation in Indonesia was very high, the Government
followed a policy of high interest rates as part of the economic stabilization
program. By the beginning of the new decade, GOI was able to bring inflationary
pressures under control, and interest rates were reduced across the board in
May 1972 and again in April 1973. However, the long-term lending rate, already
low, remained unchanged at 12%. When inflationary pressures developed once
again in 1973 and the early months of 1974, the Government increased interest
rates on most loans and deposits. The term lending rate was also increased
to 15% p.a. (The rate for loans not exceeding Rp. 100 million, however,
remained unchanged at 12%). In relation to inflation during the last 12 to
15 months, the interest rate for term loans is negative. Simply raising the
interest rate would not help, however, because policy objectives are complex
and would be affected differently by such a change. Formulation of an interest
rate policy is made more difficult by the fact that the country has a free
foreign exchange system, and medium-term capital is freely available from
overseas capital markets, currently at rates around 12%. These foreign markets
have been tapped mainly by joint-venture companies and Indonesian businessmen
of Chinese origin who have long established contacts overseas. This causes
political and social strains since indigenous entrepreneurs are at a dis-
advantage, paying rates of interest on locally borrowed funds higher than
those available to competitors with access to foreign capital markets. All
factors considered, the 15% rate appears reasonable. If the recent containment
of price pressures proves short-lived, and inflationary trends re-emerge, GOI
will need to review its interest rate policy. In the past, the Government
has been quite sensitive to monetary developments which threaten price stability.
2.28      In 1972 and 1973, when IDA made the first Credits to BAPINDO and
PDFCI, GOI insisted on assuming the exchange risk itself on the grounds that



-9-
the Indonesian Rupiah was a relatively stable currency, and that most sub-
borrowers were not sophisticated enough to understand the complexities of
multiple currency exchange risks. The Bank has accepted GOI's view that it,
rather than the ultimate borrower, should assume the exchange risk under the
proposed loan. However, the spread allowed to BAPINDO would be restricted
to a maximum of 4%, as in the case of the first Credit. The difference, if
any, between the final on-lending rate and the sum of the rate charged by GOI
to BAPINDO (the Bank's current rate) and the maximum spread of 4%, would be
passed on to GOI as a fee for assuming the exchange risk.
III. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
BAPINDO Act
3.01      The draft of a new BAPINDO Act had been agreed upon by the Associa-
tion, GOI and BAPINDO in 1972. Two key provisions were: (a) increasing the
authorized capital from Rp 60 million to Rp 20 billion, and (b) expanding the
Supervisory Board to a minimum of four members, including persons with expe-
rience in industry and finance. The new Act was expected to be passed promptly
by the legislature. In the event, the revised Act has not yet been passed
by the legislature because of a crowded schedule. GOI has now concluded that
the procedure of using a separate Act of Parliament to establish or amend the
charter of a state bank is too cumbersome, and that it should control the
functions of banks like BAPINDO through the provisions of the existing Banking
Act. GOI, therefore, does not intend to press Parliament for passage of the
draft BAPINDO Act, but will take administrative steps to implement the main
changes contained in the Act. BAPINDO's authorized capital will be increased
to Rp 50 billion by end December 1974. Arrangements will also be made for
appropriate changes relating to BAPINDO's Supervisory Board (see paragraph 3.06).
Policy Statement
3.02      BAPINDO's operations are guided by a policy statement 1/, drafted
in consultation with the Association, adopted by its Board of Managing Directors,
and approved by the Supervisory Board early in 1972. It is similar in most
respects to policy statements adopted by other development finance companies
associated with the WBG, and is acceptable to the Bank. No change has been
made in the statement since its adoption, and none appears necessary at the
present time.
Organization Structure
3.03      Head Office.  In mid-1971, the Association agreed with the Govern-
ment and BAPINDO on a scheme for a radical reorganization of BAPINDO. By
early 1972, sufficient progress had been made to justify a first Credit to
1/   See Annex 7.



- 10 -
BAPINDO. BAPINDO's capital structure had been greatly improved, the senior
management had been strengthened and BAPINDO had engaged four competent
Advisors recommended by WBG. The selection of managers for, and allocation
of staff to, different departments had been completed, except for the Maritime
Credit Department (MCD) which became operational in mid-1973; two additional
Advisors, recommended by WBG, were also attached to MCD. Since then, the
departments have settled down and are working fairly smoothly. Better inter-
action is needed between the Research Department, which does the economic
work for BAPINDO, and the Credit and Follow-Up Department, and BAPINDO's
management is seeking to bring about the required improvement. The Project
Promotion Department spends most of its time supervising problem loans, instead
of doing its stated job of project promotion. This anomaly has been recognized,
and BAPINDO's management expects that a modest beginning in project promotion
will be made in the near future, without detriment to the supervision of pro-
blem loans.
3.04      Branches.  In 1972 BAPINDO had agreed with the Association that it
would close down uneconomic branches. During 1973, 8 out of 18 branches were
transformed into Representative Offices, each with a reduced staff. These
offices will concentrate on developing new business and supervising existing
projects.
3.05      General performance at the branches has been weak.  The best avail-
able talent has become concentrated at Head Office, although the branches
still perform important operational work. The weakness of the branches slows
down the overall pace of activity. The branches also feel isolated from the
broad currents of activity at Head Office. BAPINDO is trying to correct the
situation through a systematic training program conducted at the Head Office
for staff from the branches, regular rotation of assignments, and by frequent
Head Office staff visits to the branches. This approach seems appropriate
and should gradually bring about improvement in the efficiency of the branches.
Supervisory Board, Management and Staff
3.06      Supervisory Board.  The present BAPINDO Act designates the Minister
of Finance and the Governor, Bank Indonesia, as the two members of the Super-
visory Board. The preoccupation of its members with state business has
prevented them from effectively supervising, and providing policy guidance
to, BAPINDO's Board of Managing Directors. GOI has agreed that, if legally
possible, the Minister of Finance and the Governor of Bank Indonesia will
delegate their authority to qualified representatives who will have more time
to oversee BAPINDO's operations. GOT will also investigate the possibility
of appointing three additional members to the Board, under the provisions of
the original BAPINDO Act. An enlarged, effective, Supervisory Board would
better represent BAPINDO's interests in the councils of Government, as also
in the financial and business communities.
3.07      Board of Managing Directors.  BAPINDO's Board of Managing Directors
is composed of a President and four Managing Directors. Except for one mem-
ber promoted from within, all other members, including the President, were



new to development banking, when they were appointed. They drew heavily on
Advisors (see the following paragraph) and outside consultants for specific
tasks, and on the WBG for advice. They have all worked hard and learned
quickly, gaining experience and with it confidence. During 1972 and 1973
their attention was focussed on implementing the reorganization and improv-
ing internal procedures, so that BAPINDO could effectively take on new
business. This preoccupation with internal reorganization, required by
BAPINDO's specific situation, resulted in insufficient attention to long-
range planning and operational planning systems. The management has now
started to remedy these deficiencies, in particular in the area of longer-
term financial planning. The WBG will continue to assist BAPINDO's manage-
ment in whatever way it can.
3.08      Advisors.  As part of the reorganization, four Advisors were
appointed, in 1971 and early 1972, togrovide support to BAPINDO's new
management. Two more advisors were appointed in late 1972 when the Maritime
Credit Department was established. All the Advisors were selected and recom-
mended to BAPINDO by the WBG. The contracts of all the Advisors were due to
expire between May and October 1974, prompting, earlier this year, a thorough
evaluation of their performance. BAPINDO and the WBG concluded that the
Advisors had collectively contributed significantly to BAPINDO's development
and improved performance. It was agreed with BAPINDO that the time had come
to start a gradual reduction in the number of Advisors. Accordingly, the
contract of one Advisor was allowed to expire in May 1974, and that of another
was renewed until December 1974. The contracts of two others have been
extended, one to expire in the summer of 1975 and the other in 1976. Required
changes in the terms of reference have been agreed upon. The contracts of
the Maritime experts will be renewed for one more year up to October 1975;
the need for continuing their services beyond this period will be reviewed in
summer 1975. UNDP and the Governments of Japan and Australia have contributed
towards meeting the cost of these technical experts.
3.09      Staff.  One of BAPINDO's achievements during 1973 was a 40% reduc-
tion in total staff, both at Head Office and at the branches (from more than
1,263 to 750). The retrenchment mainly covered clerical and lower support
staff, whose numbers were bloated beyond BAPINDO's needs in the past. BAPINDO
handled the reduction imaginatively and compassionately, in close cooperation
with the Department of Manpower. Major results of this staff reduction have
been a general organizational streamlining, a sense of renewed purpose among
the retained staff, and marked improvement in efficiency.
3.10      BAPINDO's staff at the professional level is generally well quali-
fied. Following the resumption of lending activity in early 1972, technical
assistance from the Advisors, the Association's extension of two Credits in
1972, adoption of systematic training methods, a significant reduction in
staff numbers, and improvements in compensation, staff morale and motivation
have improved visibly. BAPINDO needs to hire some economists (see paragraph
3.12) and engineers, particularly in the Maritime Credit Department. BAPINDO's



- 12 -
Personnel Department has drawn up a long-term staff development plan and,
significantly, the training budget for 1974 was increased by 80%, reflecting
the high priority accorded this activity.
Procedures
3.11      Appraisal.  BAPINDO's appraisal standards have improved consider-
ably over the last two years, in part because of the efforts of the Advisors,
and in part because of the priority BAPINDO's management assigned to staff-
training in project appraisal work. Appraisals are now undertaken in a
systematic manner, and the financial and technical aspects are usually handled
satisfactorily. The Management and Advisors are conscious of the need to
continue improving appraisal work, and two senior officials from BAPINDO made
4-month visits this year to the Industrial Mining and Development Bank of
Iran and the Korea Development Finance Corporation, under a UNDP project for
which the Bank is Executing Agency, for further study in appraisal techniques.
3.12      BAPINDO's appraisals are less satisfactory in covering marketing
and economic aspects. Reliable statistics are hard to come by in Indonesia,
and this problem is compounded by the fact that most of BAPINDO's clients
are not sophisticated enough to undertake detailed market studies on their
own. Emphasis in BAPINDO's economic appraisal is given to partial indica-
tors and effective rates of protection, but economic rates of return are not
calculated. BAPINDO has agreed to upgrade its capability in this area, and
to develop a suitable methodology with the WBG's assistance.
3.13      Supervision.  A separate division to concentrate on supervision
activity was not set up until late 1973. Follow-up work done so far has been
largely in conjunction with processing of applications for rescheduling old
loans, or making additional loans to old customers.  One of the major diffi-
culties encountered was inadequate past appraisals. Supervision work must
now be concentrated at the branches; this is where the actual supervision
takes place. BAPINDO is currently actively engaged in drawing up a practical
supervision manual, and has sent one of its senior officials to the Private
Development Corporation of the Philippines to study its supervision procedures,
at the WBG's suggestion.
3.14      Procurement and Disbursement.  BAPINDO's guidelines for procurement
appear satisfactory but implementation in the past was not strict, (e.g. for
imported items the requirement that the applicant obtain several quotations
was not always followed), and depended on the initiative of the engineer
concerned, varying considerably from project to project. Branch staff were
lax in following procedures, but the Engineering Advisor has now worked out
clearer procedures which are expected to make procurement more efficient.
IDA's comments on subprojects also helped tighten procedures.
3.15      Loan disbursements for imported items are made after checking
appropriate documents, including suppliers' invoices and bills of lading.



- 13 -
Loan disbursements for local expenditures are made on the basis of physical
inspection and verification of documents supporting expenditures. Disburse-
ment procedures are satisfactory, and no problems exist in following WBG
procedures.
3.16      Internal Control and Accounting.  BAPINDO hired outside consultants
to improve its internal control and accounting systems. Their recommendations
received in August 1973 are currently being implemented throughout the organi-
zation. The shift to the new system was completed at Head Office and Jakarta
branch by August 1974, and should be in place throughout the institution by
mid-1975. Retraining of staff and upgrading of procedures is proceeding
simultaneously. The transition to the new system has been smooth and imple-
mentation is currently ahead of schedule.
IV. OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Summary of Operations
4.01      BAPINDO's operations fall into three distinct categories:  (i) in-
dustrial loans, (ii) maritime sector loans, and (iii) short-term raw cotton
loans. Industrial lending was BAPINDO's original function, with the emphasis
alternating between medium-term lending and short-term lending. Within the
design of institutional financing arrangements agreed upon by GOI and the WBG,
BAPINDO was to concentrate on medium- and long-term financing; it, therefore,
gave up short-term lending in 1972. It has however continued to finance per-
manent working capital and to make short-term loans to its term loan clients.
Maritime sector lending commenced in 1972 when BAPINDO was designated as the
channel for foreign credits to the maritime sector. Lending for raw cotton
started in 1967 when BAPINDO was designated administrator for importing raw
cotton under US PL 480 agreements, for distribution to selected spinning mills,
at prices subsidized by GOI.
4.02      Except for making raw cotton loans, BAPINDO was relatively inactive
during 1971, because GOI had stopped it from making new loans in late 1970,
and before that it did not have adequate resources. It restarted operations
in 1972, after the reorganization had made some progress. A summary of
BAPINDO's loan operations is given in Annex 8, and commitments for 1972 and
1973 are shown below:

/1   Including Investment and Permanent Working Capital Loans.
During most of 1972 BAPINDO was still preoccupied with reorganizing and
sorting out the weak portfolio inherited from the past. It was not until
1973 that BAPINDO began to operate more normally, and was better geared
to handle an increasing volume of new business.
Industrial Loans
4.03      Investment Loans. -/ BAPINDO made commitments for 53 investment
loans for Rp 7.3 billion in 1973, compared with 26 loans for Rp 2.1 billion
in 1972. Total commitments as of December 31, 1973 amounted to 165 loans
totalling Rp 19.5 billion. Textile projects took 41% of cumulative commit-
ments, reflecting the predominance of this sector in Indonesia's industrial
structure. The next largest sectors were rubber processing with 14% and
tourism with 13% of total commitments. Most loans for rubber processing
were made between 1969 and 1971, when BAPINDO was administrator of'a spe-
cial GOI loan program for this sector.
4.04      The average size of BAPINDO's commitments in 1973 was Rp 133 mil-
lion 2/ ($320,000), a substantial increase over the comparable figure of
Rp 80 million ($193,000) in 1972. The larger size of loans mainly reflected
worldwide inflation, and involvement in textile projects of relatively larger
size. The average loan size, other than textiles, rose only marginally from
Rp 61 million to Rp 68 million between 1971 and 1973. About 60% of BAPINDO 's
loans were below $200,000 equivalent, and only 5 out of a total of 165 invest-
ment loans were for more than the equivalent of $1 million. 70% of cumulative
1/   Data on Investment Loan Commitments by size, duration, geographical
location, and by industry are shown in Annexes 9 and 10.
2/   Because BAPINDO finances, on average, about 75% of total project cost,
its share reflects a total average project cost of about Rp 177 million.



- 15 -
commitments at year-end 1973 were made to clients in Java, reflecting the
geographic concentration of 78% of all medium- and large-scale enterprises
in that island. Within Java, however, commitments in Central Java rose to
21% of total commitments in 1972 and 1973 compared to 8%in 1971. BAPINDO's
loans committed during 1973 had an average repayment period of between five
and six years, while nine out of a total of 53 loans were made for more than
an eight-year period. There has been a visible lengthening of loan maturities,
which is par'tly a result of comments made by the WBG on BAPINDO's generally
over-optimistic estimates of the repayment capacity of sub-projects it pro-
posed to finance.
4.05      Permanent Working Capital'Loans (PWCL). -/  BAPINDO's PWCL's are
extended to its term loan clients, and accounted for about 25% of total
industrial lending in 1973 (52 loans for Rp 2.6 billion). Until mid-1973,
PWCLs were usually made for one year and were renewed every year. Since
mid-1973, however, repayment schedules have been fixed according to the
estimated debt servicing capacity of customers. In 1973, PWCLs had an
average repayment period of between four and five years. The industrial
distribution of PWCLs was similar to that of equipment loans, with textiles
accounting for 51% of cumulative commitments. PWCLs were also concentrated
in Java (69%). In 1973, the average size of PWCLs was Rp 50 million, double
the 1971 size, but only half the average size of investment loans.
4.06      Small Business Co-Financing with Regional Development Banks.  A
good example of BAPINDO's growing confidence and ability to innovate is
the co-financing scheme set up with selected Regional Development Banks
(RDB's) 2/. BAPINDO has been actively concerned with increasing its assist-
ance to small-scale industry.  In 1973, two pilot projects were set up with
the RDB's of Central Java and Bali jointly to finance small-scale enterprises.
BAPINDO set up lines of credit of Rp 50 million each, to be used by the RDB's
to extend investment loans and PWCLs not exceeding Rp 5 million each for
individual customers. Arrangements were made for,P.T. ASKRINDO to insure 80%
of the loan risk, the balance being borne by BAPINDO and the RDB in proportion
to their share in the sub-loan. Following changes in the constitutional
structure of the RDB's late in 1973, which freed them from direct interference
by provincial Governors, Bank Indonesia brought this co-financing scheme within
the ambit of the INVESTASI program (see Annex 3).  This provided BAPINDO with
a welcome additional source of funds. By April 1974, BAPINDO had added three
more RDB's to this scheme, and revised its earlier agreements to bring its
total lines of credit to,RDB's to Rp 1.05 billion. Four more agreements
have been signed since that date.
1/   Data on PWCLs by size, duration, geographical location and by industry
are shown in Annexes 10 and 11.
2/   Further details of this scheme are provided in Annex 12.



- 16 -
4.07      Before extending lines of credit to the RDB's, BAPINDO made care-
ful appraisals of each institution. A program for correcting organizational
deficiencies was agreed upon with each RDB's management. Selected RDB offi-
cials are already attending training courses at BAPINDO, and officials from
BAPINDO are expected to be deputed for tours of duty with the RDB's. BAPINDO
does not involve itself in sub-project appraisals, but those exceeding
Rp 2 million require ASKRINDO's prior approval.
Maritime Sector Lending -/
4.08      The MCD, established in 1972, started with a portfolio of four
short-term and nine medium-term loans of Rp 513 million. Three loans
amounting to commitments of Rp 64 million were made in 1972. MCD operations
quickly gained momentum and 40 loans for Rp 2.2 billion were committed in
1973, or 17% of BAPINDO's total commitments for that year. MCD is now an
important factor in BAPINDO's lending operations.
4.09      Although the use of funds from Credit 318-IND is limited to financing
the rehabilitation of the existing inter-island Regular Liner Service fleet
(RLS), BAPINDO also makes loans for other shipping sectors using funds obtained
from other sources. At the end of 1973, non-RLS loans exceeded RLS loans,
both in number and amount, as shown below:
(Rupiah Millions)
PELNI /1             OTHER           TOTAL

/1  The wholly Government-owned shipping corporation, Pelayaran Nasional
Indonesia (PELNI).
BAPINDO's largest shipping client is PELNI, which accounts for about 25% of
the total tonnage of Indonesia's RLS fleet, and received 65% of MCD's total
commitments. BAPINDO expects that PELNI's predominant share in its portfolio
will decline as the RLS rehabilitation project is completed, and other fi-
nancing areas such as new ships, dry-docks, shipyards and terminals are cov-
ered. The average size of MCD's shipping loans in 1973 was Rp 56 million.
More than 80% of commitments made in 1973 had a maturity of between three
and five years.
1/   Details of commitments up to December 1973 are shown in Annex 13.

Raw Cotton Loans
4.10      The unsettled state of BAPINDO's organization during 1971-72
did not affect its raw cotton business, because it did not appraise these
short-term loans. GOI identifies borrowers, indicates amounts to be loaned,
and BAPINDO acts only as an executing agency, concerned with opening LC's,
handling documents, and collecting repayments. Bank Indonesia provides
BAPINDO with the major part of funds for financing the import of cotton.
BAPINDO finances freight and other local currency costs from its own funds
(about Rp 10.5 billion or 20% of ttal raw cotton loans in 1972 and 1973).
The raw cotton loans are usually for a period of one year.
4.11      Raw cotton commitments totalled 11 loans for Rp 13,062 million in
1971, 10 loans for Rp 14,360 million in 1972, and 18 loans for Rp 38,538
million in 1973. The sharp increase in average loan size from Rp 755 million
in 1972 to Rp 2,141 million in 1973, reflected increased world market prices
for cotton, and reduction (subsequently abolition in 1973), of government
exchange rate subsidies for raw cotton imports.
4.12      In 1972, the Association had agreed with GOI and BAPINDO that raw
cotton lending would be phased out and that BAPINDO would concentrate on
making medium- and long-term loans. A sudden termination of.raw cotton lend-
ing was not envisaged, as this would have affected BAPINDO's-profitability
adversely. Term lending operations have now developed sufficiently so that
an end to raw cotton lending should not seriously impair BAPINDO's financial
stability. GOI has decided to transfer, by the end of 1974, the raw cotton
import lending to Bank Ekspor-Impor (EXIM) with which BAPINDO already shares
this business. One textile mill importer's account will remain with BAPINDO,
because it is also a long-term loan client.
Equity Financing
4.13      BAPINDO had not made any equity investments before mid-1974, when
it agreed to invest up to 40% of the proposed equity of the newly established
National Fleet Development Corporation (PANN). The WBG did not earlier
encourage such investments because BAPINDO had still to demonstrate the organi-
zational competence to undertake an adequate appraisal of such operations
inherently more risky than lending. With the recent improvements in its
organizational structure and appraisal capability, it should now consider
making modest equity investments. It should thus play a role in implementing
GOI's decision to encourage the growth of "pribumi" entrepreneurs. One way
of converting "non-pribumi" customers t a "pribumi" status would be for BAPINDO
to buy a share of the equity of such companies, for later resale to Indonesian
private individuals or companies. GOI also plans to use BAPINDO as a channel
for equity investments in joint-venture companies to ensure that such com-
panies achieve the required minimum Indonesian participation. BAPINDO is
not expected to assuime the risk for such investments, and will be supplied
with the required funds by GOI. Guidelines for such investments are presently
being formulated by GOI.



- 18 -
Resources
4.14      For the bulk of its domestic currency resources BAPINDO is, and
will continue to be, dependent on the Government. Funds are provided in
the form of increases in its share capital, through'Bank Indonesia in the
form of refinance facilities (INVESTASI), and through long-term loans. During
1973 when BAPINDO's liquidity position was good, Bank Indonesia withdrew
the refinance facility; but this will be restored in late 1974 with the
quickening pace of BAPINDO's commitments.
4.15      BAPINDO's foreign exchange resources consist of the two IDA Credits
made in 1972. The general industrial credit has been almost fully comnitted;
the maritime credit had an uncommitted balance of $5.6 million as of
September 30, 1974. Because BAPINDO continues conditionally to approve
projects which it plans to finance from the proposed Bank loan, it has asked
for a relaxation of the "90 day rule", covering commitments made prior to
the effectiveness of the loan. The request is acceptable since it is desirable
to maintain the continuity of Bank Group financing (paragraph 5.11).
Financial Position
4.16      BAPINDO's December 31 summary balance sheets for 1970, 1971, 1972
and 1973 are given in Annex 14.
4.17      In the two years following the lifting of the restriction on term
lending in 1971, BAPINDO's total assets grew by 16.8%. Significant changes
were a 15.3% increase in the raw cotton loan portfolio to Rp 15.2 billion,
and a 29.5% increase in the portfolio of medium- and long-term investment
loans to Rp 14.4 billion. BAPINDO's loan portfolio, including investment
loans, raw cotton loans and working capital loans, rose from 80.8% of total
assets in 1971, to 84.1% of total assets in 1973. The loan portfolio and
total assets grew in spite of massive write-offs amounting to Rp 1.86 billion
during 1972 and 1973. Write-offs of such magnitude are not expected in the
future.
4.18      BAPINDO's financial position has improved significantly during
the last two years, mainly due to the conversion of Rp 6.5 billion GOI loans
into equity in 1971, and the receipt of cash towards additional equity of
Rp 4 billion during 1972 and 1973. The Government paid in an additional amount
totalling Rp 9.3 billion during the first quarter of 1974. The provision for
doubtful debts is now considered adequate by BAPINDO's auditors; for the
first time in its history, BAPINDO's 1973 financial statements received an
unqualified opinion and clean report from its auditors.   As of December 31,
1973, BAPINDO's debt/equity ratio was 2.2:1, well within the maximum 3:1
stipulated in the IDA Project Agreement.
Profitability
4.19      Summary income statements for the years ended December 31, 1970,
1971, 1972 and 1973, are given in Annex 15. BAPINDO had a spread of about



- 19 -
7% on its loan operations in 1972 and 1973. Despite the high spread, its
profitability was poor. In 1973 it made a net after-tax profit of Rp 608
million, as compared to a negligible profit of Rp 54 million in 1972. The
1973 profit would have been Rp 1,023 million, but for the extraordinary ex-
pense of Rp 415 million, incurred on severance pay under the massive re-
trenchment program. The poor profit performance in the past was largely
due to sizeable provisions for losses on the older portion of its loan port-
folio, and also to its administrative and personnel expenses, high in rela-
tion to a somewhat stagnant portfolio. These factors will be less impor-
tant in coming years, because the staff has already been considerably re-
duced and the loan portfolio will grow rapidly.
4.20      The raw cotton loan portfolio has been crucial to BAPINDO's
profitability. Thp income from this activity was Rp 832 million in 1973;
without it BAPINDO would have made a loss of Rp 577 million for the year.
It is expected that increasing income from the fast growing medium- and
long-term portfolio, will adequately compensate for the loss of income
from raw cotton loan operations after 1974.
4.21      BAPINDO is not expected to pay dividends to its sole owner, GOI,
and profits, after adjustments, will be retained.
Quality of Portfolio -
4.22      In assessing the quality of BAPINDO's loan portfolio, due consid-
eration has to be given to the fact that the loan repayment record has been
generally unsatisfactory in Indonesia. All financial institutions suffer
from this problem; some seriously. In BAPINDO's case, the situation has
improved considerably since 1972, although arrears 2/ are still quite high,
as the following table shows:
1/   Annex 16 gives an analysis of BAPINDO's loans in arrears.
2/   BAPINDO considers loans to be in arrears on the day an instalment
becomes due, and no allowance is made for a grace period or for a
transit period between branches and Head Office. In measuring the
quality of BAPINDO's portfolio, arrears of more than six months have
been considered. If arrears of more than 3 months were to be con-
sidered, the 1973 percentages would change from 15% to 20% and 36% to 53%
for medium- and long-term loans, from 59% to 61% and 60% to 62% for
short-term loans. Percentages for raw cotton loans would remain
unchanged.

/1   These loans were made before 1971 (BAPINDO no longer makes short-term
loans), and BAPINDO does not have any leverage unless a new loan is
sought. These clients are still being pursued with the hope that
some part of these loans may be recovered.
4.23      The maritime and raw cotton loan portfolios are in much better
condition than the industrial loan portfolio. The maritime portfolio im-
proved dramatically after PELNI, the largest maritime client, cleared its
arrears, following a reorganization required by BAPINDO as a condition of
continued financial assistance. Raw cotton loan clients always had a strong
incentive not to default, in order to remain eligible for the following
year's cotton quota; textile mills are also relatively more profitable. In
the industrial loan portfolio, textiles, tourism and pharmaceuticals projects
had relatively good records; while metal works, pulp, paper and printing,
transportation and rubber processing were among the group of troublesome
projects.
4.24      As of December 31, 1973, BAPINDO undertook an account by account
analysis which resulted in the following qualitative classification of the
total medium- and long-term loan portfolio:



- 21 -

Good loans /a                            36.9

Problem loans /c                         34.6
Bad loans /d                             11.8
100.0
/a   Payments regular and on time.
/b   Payments regular, but often late.
/c   Projects needing special attention, with active BAPINDO involvment
aimed at improving repayment records.
/d   Companies in, or close to liquidation, with no reasonable hope of resump-
tion of regular payments.
One of the more important reasons for high arrears is inadequate past
appraisals which stipulated unrealistically short repayment schedules, since
the INVESTASI program did not allow a repayment period exceeding 5 years.
Many customers, with otherwise satisfactory growth and pr4fit performance,
found themselves unable to repay term debt without adversely affecting opera-
tions, because of a general shortage of working capital. Some arrears also
resulted from genuine financial difficulties due to technical, marketing or
management reasons.
4.25      BAPINDO is acutely conscious of the need to upgrade the loan port-
folio through both better appraisals and greatly strengthened supervision
work at Head Office and branches. The arrears situation should improve
substantially as a result. However, following the recent imposition of a
severe credit squeeze as part of GOI's anti-inflationary measures, a slowdown
in repayments may result for the entire banking system, and BAPINDO cannot
hope to be an exception. The provision for bad debts, however, appears to
be adequate.
V. PROSPECTS
General Outlook
5.01      Indonesia's overall economic prospects remain bright.  During
Repelita II (see paragraph 2.03) total gross investment is expected to rise
from Rp 1,100 billion or 17.7% of GDP in fiscal 1974 to Rp 3,150 billion or
23% of GDP in fiscal 1979. The share of the industrial sector is expected to
grow from 9.8% of GDP in fiscal 1974 to 12.5% in fiscal 1979; the growth rate
of the industrial sector is expected to average 13% annually during the Plan
period. Within the industrial sector, GOI is committed to a policy of giving



- 22 -
full scope and encouragement to the private sector, and to developing indigenous
Indonesian enterprise. Despite the obstacles mentioned in paragraph 2.14,
the recent growth of industry has resulted in an investment demand which the
local term lending institutions have not been able to fulfill; reliance has
had to be placed on private external financial institutions to make up the
difference. In the foreseeable future, as in the past, BAPINDO's business
will be limited by its own processing capacity rather than by a lack of demand;
the needs for long-term capital are large and continuing.

5.03      BAPINDO's past performance is not a good indicator of its potential
for the future. The above projections appear optimistic but are fully
justifiable from the point of view of the demand, and are backed up by a
strong pipeline of pending loan applications (Rp 61 billion as of April 1,
1974). The projections indicate that the proportion of short-term loans in
total commitments will decline significantly, from about 75% in 1973 to about
30% throughout the projected period. This is because while medium- and
long-term loans increase much more rapidly than in the past, (a) raw cotton
loan business is being transferred to EXIM and (b) BAPINDO has restricted
short-term lending to its term clients. With the single exception noted in
paragraph 4.13 above, BAPINDO has not made equity investments in the past
but expects to make a start in 1974.  Maritime sector operations will account
for 20-25% of total estimated commitments. An analysis of the pipeline
indicates that the textile industry could account for about a third of
BAPINDO's industrial lending followed by the chemical industry (about a
fourth) in the next two years.
Resource Requirements
5.04      Domestic Currency.  Other than retained earnings, deposits and
collections, BAPINDO is completely dependent on the Government for domestic
currency resources. As of January 1, 1974, BAPINDO had a surplus of Rp 2.8
billion on a disbursement basis. However, BAPINDO had a deficit of Rp 3.8
billion if undisbursed commitments are also taken into account. Domestic
currency resources needed to meet new commitments, including Project Aid
projects, stated in paragraph 5.02 would amount to about Rp 98 billion for
1974, 1975 and 1976. Including the deficit as of January 1, 1974, total
resource requirements for the three years 1974-76 would be about Rp 102 billion
(including Rp 7 billion for Project Aid projects) on a commitment basis. Of
this amount, Rp 20 billion are estimated to be provided by net collections,
deposits and internal cash generation. The balance of Rp 82 billion would
have to be provided by the Government. BAPINDO has assumed that its capital
will be increased by Rp 20 billion during 1974-76, and that the balance will
be provided in the form of loans and INVESTASI refinance facility. Consider-
ing the amounts of funds provided by the Government in the past, it is not
unrealistic for BAPINDO to expect Rp 82 billion in a three year period. Early
in 1974 GOI paid more than Rp 9 billion in equity funds. During the negotia-
tions for the proposed loan, understanding was reached with GOI that it would
continue to provide BAPINDO with the rupiah resources needed by the latter,
either in the form of equity or loans, to allow it to effectively carry out
its    rations.
Foreign Currency.  BAPINDO's only foreign currency resources are
two IDA Credits made in 1972.  Credit 310-IND is almost fully committed;
Credit 318-IND still has a balanc?'o75.6 million but its use is restricted
to financing of RLS clients. For its estimated commitments during remaining
months of 1974, 1975 and 1976, BAPINDO would need about Rp 53 billion
equivalent (including about Rp 11 billion for Project Aid projects). The
Bank has informed BAPINDO that it cannot continue to be its sole source of



- 24 -
foreign exchange funds. Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) will send an
appraisal mission to BAPINDO in late November this year for a proposed DM 22
million loan. BAPINDO is also exploring the possibility of securing financial
assistance from Belgique Maatschappij voor Investeering (BMI) and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB). It is recommended that the Bank consider $50 million
for the proposed loan which would account for about one-half of BAPINDO's
foreign exchange resource requirements (excluding Project Aid projects for
which the Government provides the needed resources) for the period ending
December 1976.
Projected Financial Position
5.06      Forecast Balance Sheets, Income Statements, Cash Flow Statements,
and Financial Ratios are given in Annexes 19, 20, 21 and 22 respectively.
The projected Balance Sheets show a rapidly rising medium- and long-term
loan portfolio: from Rp 14.4 billion at the end of 1973, an estimated
Rp 31.9 billion at the end of 1974, to Rp 164.4 billion at the end of 1978;
the rate of growth of foreign currency loans will be much faster than that
of domestic currency loans. The short-term loan portfolio will decline
relatively from being greater than the medium- and long-term loan portfolio
at at the end of 1973 and 1974 to being less than one-third of it at the
end of 1978, indicating the emergence of BAPINDO as an institution principally
providing long-term capital.
5.07      BAPINDO's profitability remained depressed in recent years because
of high salary and administrative expenses and massive provisions for doubtful
loans. The profit will be low in 1974 because of a significant increase in
salary and other personnel expenses (from Rp 1.1 billion in 1973 to Rp 2.5
billion in 1974) following a justified improvement in pay scales. Profitability
improves to satisfactory levels from 1975 onwards and is expected to return
9.4% on equity in 1978. Corresponding to a rapid rise in the medium- and
long-term loan portfolio, the income from this source will account for an
increasingly high proportion of total income (68% in 1978). Income from equity
investments is not expected to be significant. BAPINDO is not expected to
pay any dividends to the Government.
5.08      With the Government providing the needed resources as projected by
BAPINDO, its equity base should continue to be strong. The total debt to
equity ratio is expected to rise from 2.57:1 in 1974 to 3.65:1 in 1978; the
ratio of long-term debt to equity is estimated to rise from 1.2:1 in 1974
to 3.2:1 in 1978. The debt service cover (calculated by including short-term
operations) is expected to remain satisfactory throughout the period of
projections; the lowest will be 1.2 in 1974.
Proposed Loan
5.09      As stated in paragraph 5.05, a loan of $50 million to be made to
GOI, and on-lent to BAPINDO is recommended; the proceeds would be utilized
to finance the import of machinery and equipment, mainly in the industrial



- 25 -
and transportation sectors, and for meeting the estimated foreign exchange
component of expenditures on "off-the-shelf" purchases (60%) and local civil
construction expenditures (40%) as was the case with the first Credit. In
the selection of projects, BAPINDO will give priority to import substitution,
export oriented and labour intensive projects, to projects which result in
the development of indigenous enterprise, and to projects which generally
conform to the Government's priorities. The Bank would continue to help the
growth of the industrial sector in Indonesia, through the proposed loan.
It will also provide continuity in the institution-building role of the WBG
which began in 1969, and which is still important notwithstanding the very
substantial progress made by BAPINDO.
5.10      In view of the improvements in BAPINDO's appraisal standards, an
increase in the present free limit from $100,000 to $500,000 is justified and
is proposed. The Bank should still expect to receive projects requiring
its prior approval accounting for about 70-80% of the total loan amount. As
a safeguard, however, an aggregate free limit of $15 million is also proposed.
At the time the Credits 310-IND and 318-IND were made, BAPINDO's short-term
lending and commercial banking operations were significant and therefore the
debt/equity ratio was defined to include all liabilities. The short-term
loans and deposits have declined in relative importance and are expected to
decline further (see paragraph 5.06). 'Debt' for the purposes of debt/equity
ratio should now be defined to include only loans of more than 1 year's
maturity, as is the case with most other DFCs associated with WBG.  With this
change in the definition of 'debt', the present ratio of 3:1 should be retained.
A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Annex 23.
5.11      In order to maintain continuity of WBG financing, withdrawals by
BAPINDO aggregating the equivalent of up to $3 million should be allowed
under the proposed loan for expenditures relating to sub-loans made on or
after July 1, 1974.
5.12      Other terms and conditions of the proposed loan would be substantially
similar to those in recent Bank loans to development finance companies, in-
cluding the standard commitment fee. BAPINDO's repayments to GOI would conform
substantially to the aggregate schedule of individual repayment schedules of
BAPINDO's sub-loans.

Medium-Term Investment Credit Program (INTESTASI)         Page 1 of 4
Description of Program
1.        A medium-term investment credit program (INVFSTASI),was introduced
in April 1969, to provide three to five year development loans, mainly
through Indonesia's state-owned banks and the Regional Development Banks,
at a concessional interest rate of 12% per annum.  It is the main domestic source
of investment finance, other than the government development budget and private
equity investment. The specific financing arrangements have been changed
several times since 1969. Prior to April 1970, the development budget provided
a third of total resources, at no cost to the participating banks, while Bank
Indonesia charged a rate of Ii% per annum on the portion that it provided..
Since 1970 no budget funds were committed to the program . In January 1971
the financing arrangements were changed, and INqVESTASI loans were financed 80%
by Bank Indonesia (BI) and 20% by the state banks.
2.        Coinciding with a major revision of interest rates on April 12, 1973,
changes were announced making the program potentially more beneficial
to the small business sector in Indonesia, which previously enjoyed no special
concessions under the scheme. A summary of the revised scheme follows:
3.        Investment credits were classi-ied into four broad groups, on the
basis of the amount of credit extended per project:
Group I            up to Rp. 25 million
Group II    :            Rp. 25 million and up to Rp. 100 million
Group III   :            Pp. 100 million and up to Rp. 300 million
Group IV    :            Rp. 300 million and above
4.        At the start of each fiscal year, the total amount of investment credit
to be made available to the state banks would be fixed. The relative
allocation for the groups mentioned in paragraph 3 would be as follows:
Group I      :     30%
Group II    :      35%
Group III          20%
Group IV    :      15%
5.        Borrowers in the various groups, would have to provide the following
proportion of the overall investment cost of individual priority 1/  projects
from their own resources:
Group I     :      25%
Group II    :      25%
Group III   :      25%
Group IV    :      35%
All the   groups would, however, have to put up 50% for non-priority projects.
6.        The state bank concerned would act as the "executor bank" for each
approved credit, and funds would be jointly provided with BI
I/ Priority projects include among others those in the field of basic industry,
infrastructure, tourism, transportation, agriculture, fisheries, exportss,
pharmaceuticals and nine essential commodities.



ANNEX 3

in the following proportions:
Group I            BI-80%  and state bank-20%
Group TI    :      BI-75$'% and state bank-25%
Group III   :      BI-70% and state bank-30%
Group IV    :      BI-65% and state bank-35%
7.        State banks could extend loans under the scheme with a maximum
maturity of five years, but for the first time loans with longer maturities
could be extended by Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (BAPINDO).
8.        On December 1h, 1973 the following changes were made in the program
for medium-term investment credits made to small businesses in the urban/rural
sectors, for amounts not exceeding Rp. 5 million each:
(a)   the amount to be provided by the borrower was not specifically indicated,
and was to depend on the "real" capacity of the borrower)
(b)   there would be no collateral required in addition to the assets of
the proposed projects;
(c)   the interest rate would remain at 12%;
(d)   Bank Indonesia would provide 80% of the amount of the credit, with
the state bank providing the remaining 20%.
9.        Credits for permanent working capital would also be made available
to small business under the following terms:
(a)   the amount of the creditwouldnot exceed Rp. 5 million;
(b)   the periodwouldnot exceed three years;
(c)   the interest rate  to be 15% p.a.;
(d)   Bank Indonesia would provide 70% of the credit and the state bank
the remaining 30%.
A slightly different ratio was worked out for loans made jointly by BAPINDO
and the ReRional Development Banks (RDB's). 1For investment loans BI would
provide 80% BAPINDO 10/' and the RDB 10%; while for loans for permanent working
capital BI would provide 70%, BAPINDO 20% and the RDB 10%.
10.       From December 18, 1973, medium-term credits were no longer available
to units in the building material industry,using fully me^..aalized production
systems.
11.       From January 1, 1974,medium-term credits above Rp. 300 million to any
one customer could only be financed by consortiums of state banks, and on March 1,
1974 similar consortiums were required for credits above Rp. 500 million to any
one borrower, for permanent working capital.
12.       On February 22, 1974,it was announced that henceforth state banks



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 4
would only make loans under the INVESTASI scheme to "pribumii" borrowers, who
were defined as enterprises where at least 75% of the equity was owned by
indigenous individuals, or at least 50( of the equity was owned by and the
majority of operating management was composed of, indigenous indivuduals.
13.        Loans under the INVESTASI program have been used mainly for financing
capital goods, both for modernizing and rehabilitating existing projects, and
for setting up new ones. As of January 197h, net approvals amounted to
Rp. 167.8 billion, and net disbursements to Rp. 116.1 billion, an increase
of 18.1$ and 23.4% respectively over the figures at the end of December 1972.
The ratio of disbursements to approvals was 69.2%, as of January 1974,compared
to 65.2OJ as of December 1972. During 1973, disbursements on a net basis were
about Rp. 17.8 billion, at about the same level as in 1972. But the rate of
net approvals dropped from Rp. 27.0 billion in 1972 to Rp. 25.2 billion in 1973.
A breakdown of the credits extended under the program (see Annex 4a); shows
that about 78% of credits disbursed went to the private sector, and the remainder
to state enterprises. Since larger repayments under the program began to
be m-ade to Bank Indonesia and the Government during 1973, the proportion of
outstanding credit financed by the banks rose from 23% at the end of 1972 to
33% at the end of 1973.
14.        The allocation of credit to various sectors under the program detailed
in Annex 4b, shows that the share of agriculture in total approvals fell
sharply from 25.5% in 1970 to 10.2% in 1973; the share of manufacturing rose
from 42.9% to 49.2% and the share of communication and tourism rose sharply
from 29.8% to 35.14 in the same period.  Outstanding credit to agriculture
as a percentage of total outstandings fell from 28.7% in 1970 to 7.6% in 1973;
outstanding credit to manufacturing grew from 37.4% to 5h.6%, while communication
and tourism grew from 32.0% to 34.2% in the same period. The drop in loans
to agriculture reflects partially provision of credit through alternative
special programs of agricultural credit. The lower share of loans to the
manufacturing sector in 1973,appears mainly due to a larger proportion of term
credit being raised from external lenders denominated in foreign currency, and
not reflected in the INVESTASI statistics.
Achievements and Problems
15.        Seen from the broad national perspective, the INVESTASI program
provided sorely needed investment funds, when they were not easily available
from other sources at reasonable terms. It also introduced the banks in the
state sector to term lending, an area which was relatively new to most of them.
However, some major problems still remain and need to be solved to improve the
effectiveness of the program.
16.        Among the major drawbacks of the scheme is the low and subsidized
interest rate of 12% per annum for smaller borrowers and 15% per annum for
larger borrowers (loans over Rp. 100 million), which prevents the normal
development of a market for long-term funds, since these rates are lower than
those offered for one-year deposits, and charged for short-term loans. Central
bank refinance is the only major source of funds for the INVESTASI program.
A large volume of arrears has developed variously estimated at between 30
to 45% of total outstandinrsi  due largely to inadequate appraisals by the state
banks.  Due to a shortage of trained staff state banks depended too heavily on
project reports of consultants whose competence was open to question. The ar-
tificial maximum limit of five years for repayment hurt borrowers whose normal



ANNEX 3
Page ) of 4
cash generation did niot allow them to repay within this period. A general
weakness also exists in calculating realistic working capital requirements,
which often prevent projects from producing at adequate capacity levels for
profitable operations, due to a shortage of working funds. There was also a
relative concentration on large borrowers,which has been largely redressed
through changes in the program described earlier.
16.        Despite these problems, the DIVESTASI program has made and will
continue to make an important contribution to the rapid economic developnent
of Indonesia, and to the manufacturing sector, in particular.

BANK PENBANGUNAN INDONESIA
The Monea and Capital Market in Indonesia
Present Stage of DeveloPment
1.         Money and capital markets are in a very early stage of development
in Indonesia. In January 1972, the Government created the Agency for Money
and Capital market Development, which is currently working on, among other,
proposals, setting up a securities and exchange administration.           - -
2.         The Jakarta Stock Exchange is a relatively small operation and deals
mainly in shares of previously Dutch-owned pre-war enterprises, now owned largely
by the State and recently converted into limited liability companies. It also
lists goVernment bonds and state bank debentures. The Exchange recently began small
trading in bonds issued by US and Dutch firms to state banks. These include
bonds issued by Musi-Mortgage Edison Company, American Electric Railway Company,
Canadian Pacific Railway Company, Koninklijke Olie, and Unilever.  Stock brokerage
activity has not attracted sufficient talent or capital in recent years, although
if the number of issues traded increases substantially, this deficiency could
be overcome.
3.        An inter-bank call market has recently become active in Jakarta,
involving mainly the branches of foreign banks, the larger state commercial
banks, and some of the newly established merchant banks (or so-called investment
finance companies).
St:ructural Problems
4.        The major hurdle facing a rapid development of the capital market
is the weak financial position of most Indonesian companies, particularly the
meiium and small-scale "pribiLmit companies, owned by indigenous Indonesians.
There is a serious overall shortage of equity capital, which continues to act
as a strong brake on the normal development of the private sector in Indonesia.
This problem is accentuated by the recent trend of rising prices of cspital goods,
which tends to raise total project costs, straining the already relatively
weak debt-equity ratios common in Indonesia. In 1973 the Government set up
P.T. Bahana to help provide a portion of the equity needed by small and medium-
scale industries. Its initial resources (about $5 million) are clearly
inadequate for meeting the larger needs for equity capital in the burgeoning economy.
The financial weakness of most Indonesian companies, therefore, makes them
less credit-worthy, and eventually less attractive to investors.
Another major difficulty that prevents a more rapid growth of capital
ma-rkets is the widespread unreliability and unavailability of company financial
s-taements. This is partially due to lack of financial ac    --ng know-how,
(thaere is a serious shorgage of trained accountants in Indonesia), and ageneral
fear of divulging information that can be used by the tax authorities. Even
the so-cal ed'lon-pribuml' companies, generally controlled by Indonesians of Chinese
extractiorL, are weak in this area; the only significant exceptions being the so-
called joint venture companies, that require financial statements prepared according
to international standards set by their parent companies. Bank Indonesia has
tried to solve this problen by introducing several measures, including a require-
memt that any credit application exceeding the equivalent of US$25,000, made to
financial institutions, be accompanied by financial statements, audited by



ANNEx 5
Page 2 of 3
recognized independent auditors.  Since many companies promote new projects, and,
therefore, have no historical financial statements, applications are usually
accompanied by feasibility studies prepared by firms of consultants who may
not be objective,because they are paid on the basis of a percentage of the
project cost, and often only if the application is approved.

6.        In p73, at the request of the Ministry of Finance, the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) prepared a long-term policy plan for the development
of the securities market, which included recommended changes in the legal frame-
worlc, and the strengthening of financial expertise in the banking and investment
sectors. An important part of the program is the establishment of a new institute
of accounting, and more stringent auditing standards.  These projects  are,however,
making very slow progress.
Nerchant Banks
79        The GOI had at firlst looked towards the foreign banks operating in
Indonesia, with their sophisticated expertise, for assistance in the development
oJ' the money and capital markets.   After 1968 when inflation was brought under
control and time deposits regained their popularity, First National City Bank
introduced certificates of deposit into the market, an example soon followed by
the State commercial bancs, the most successf.ul being Bank Bumi Daya. The
foreign banks operating in Jakarta had wanted to set up their own merchant banks,
but the Government,wanting to increase the number of foreign financial institutions
involved in Indonesia's development, decided that only foreign banks not already
operating in Indonesia would be allowed to set up local merchant banks. These
institutions would be companies registered in Indonesia, with local banks as
par-tners. Control of equity capital and management was to be transferred to
Indonesian hands within ten years. INine merchant banks applied for operating
licences, their names and details of share ownership are shown in Annex 5a.
S.        rerchant banks are not allowed to accept deposits from the public, and
are also  rot allowed to make term loans directly to Indonesian enterprises.
At the present time, they largely deal in short-term paper, and some have entered
vigorously into real estate development activity.  They are actively engaged
in channelling long-tern credit opportunities to their parent banks abroad,
involving the largest companies in Indonesia, particularly Pertamina (the State-
owned oil corporation). They are also wooing the major state-owned mining and
logging firms. Due to the absence of an active stock exchange,some have taken
equity positions of a venture-capital nature in local companies. The merchant
ba7nks are very interested in leasing operations, but the legal and tax questions
on which the profitability of this type of business depends, have not yet been
sorted out; they have also expressed interest in providing a range of financial
services to industrial clients.  It is too early to judge the performance of the
merchant banks, but they are a welcome addition to the rather thin supply of
j7inancial institutions in Indonesia.

i'uture Development
9.       -oince early 1974 the entire financial community, with strong
official direction, has been geared to strengthening the ?Ipribiinjt? companies
in Indonesia. They wvill receive credit in a preferential manner', and most
existing credit schemes have been revised to ensure this objective. Banks are
also expected to provide assistance in improving the financial expertise of
their borrowers. The development of the capital market in Indonesia will gain
momentum when local cormorate managements realize that they will profit
by improving their financial operations, End begin hiring adequate numbers of
financial experts on their staff.  The conscious combined efforts of the
Covernment, commercial banks, merchant banks and the industrial and business
community should hasten the modernization of the capital market.

BANK PEMBANGUNAN INDONESIA
Small Business Co-Financing with Regional Development Banks
1.         BAPINDO has been actively concerned with increasing its assistance
to small-scale industry.  In 1972, following a study by its Research Department,
it decided to associate itself with selected Regional Development Banks (RDBs)
in making joint loans for investment and working capital purposes, to this sector.
2.         A pilot project was started with the RDB of Semarang in Central
Java in April 1973, with an initial limit of Rp. 50 million. BAPINDO would
provide 80% of the funds, and the RDB the balance 20%. In August 1973, a
similar scheme was set up with the RDB in Bali. Both the schemes provided
for a maximum sub-loan amount set at Rp. 2 million, (increased to Rp. 5
million on April 4, 1974) with a maximum three year term. Arrangements were
simultaneously made with P.T. ASKRINDO to insure 805 of the loan risk, the
balance being borne pari-passu by the lenders.  During April 1974, additional
agreements were signed with the following RDBs: (a) West Java (Bandung);
(b) West Sumatra (Padang) and (c) North Sumatra (MIedan). All these agreements
run for an initial period of one year, but contain provisions for further
renewals.
3.         Following changes in the constitutional structure of the RDBs, late
in 1973, which freed them from direct interference in their operations by
the Provincial Governors, and granted them a reasonable degree of autonomy,
Bank Indonesia agreed to bring the co-financing scheme within the abhit of
the INVESTASI scheme. This provided BLAINDO with an additional source of
funds for its operations under the co-financing program.
4.         The following is a brief summary of BAPINDO's arrangements with
the five RDBs, as at the end of April 19741:

5.        Ceilings for each type of credit facility (investment or permanent
working capital) have been set at Rp. 5 million per customer. P.T.
ASKRINDO covers 80% of the credit risk. The RDB's have"free
limits" of Rp. 2 million,(except North Sumatra, which is not yet considered
to have a fully competent appraisal staff). Loans above this limit require
ASKRINDO's prior approval.
6.        BAPINDO undertook a careful appraisal of each RDB before setting
up the co-financing arrangements. A program of correcting organizational
deficiencies has been agreed upon with each RDB's management. Special
attention is being paid to  Dpgrading the capabilities of the Nor-h Sumatra RDB.
Selected officials of the RDB's are already attending training courses at
BAPINDO, and it is also intended to depute BAPINDO officials for tours of
duty with the RDB's.
7.        Four more agreements are expected to be signed with the following
RDB's in 1974:  (a) East Java; (b) North Sumatra; (c) West Kalimantan; and (4)West
Nusatenggara.     Technical assistance arrangements are already being discussed
between BAPINDO and these RDB's, in anticipation of the signing of the formal
agreements.
