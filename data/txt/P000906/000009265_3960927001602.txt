MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OP THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO TEE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Ghana for SDR 13.8 million (US$19.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help to finance
rehabilitation of the telecommunications network. The project would be
cofinanced by the Dutch government for SDR 13.7 (US$18.8 million
equivalent), French Government for SDR 15.8 (US$21.8 million equivalent),
Japanese Government for SDR 67.1 (US$92.4 million equivalent), and a
supplier's credit of SDR 1.2 (US$1.7 million equivalent) from Ireland.
2.       Background.  Public telecommunicaticn services in Ghana are
provided by the Ghana Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (GPT), an
autonomous government-owned corporation under the Ministry of Transport and
Communications (MOTC). Although Ghana has invested about $80 million in
its telecommunications (TC) sector since 1980, inter alia through the $23
million First Telecommunications Project (Loan 1122-GH), the existing
facilities are inadequate for the level of economic activities. The number
of waiting applicants exceeds the number of connected lines (now at
38,000), and the quality of service is unacceptably low. At present the
overall call completion rate is below 202, and less than 50? of subscriber
lines are working at any given time due largely to poor maintenance and
deterioration of local cable networks. Consequently, the present service
fails to meet expressed demand and significant costs are being incurred by
the economy. The Project Completion Report for the first
telecommunications project identified the lack of adequate staff and
management in GPT particularly in project management, operations and
maintenance, and finance as a major contributory factor to poor sector
performance. Due to the poor quality of service and weak financial
management, GPT has failed to generate enough cash and had to rely on GOG
subsidies for capital works, despite major tariff increases in 1983, and
1986.  GOG recognizes the economic cost of the present poor state of TC
services and the need to rehabilitate GPT if TC requirements for the
targeted growth and efficiency improvements in the productive sectors under
the Economic Recovery Program are to be met.  A first step was GOG's
request for a first PPF advance of $750,000 (approved in May 1987) to
finance studies for TC master plan and a GPT corporate plan and to
reorganize and strengthen GPT. A second PPF advance of $750,000 to finance
the employment of a telecommunications adviser at MOTC and financial and
project management consultants for GPT, was approved in May 1988.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA is taking a leading role in
the reform and rehabilitation of the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector in
Ghana through the Structural Adjustment Credit and the Public Enterprise



- 2 -
Project. The expected benefits of these programs will not materialize
without major and detailed improvements in individual strategica'lly
important SOEs such as GPT. IDA is in a unique position to help formul e
and implement such a program for GPT on account of: (a) its specific c:(As
country experience in Africa on TC management and organization, financi
management, investment planning and implementation, and staff training;
(b) its involvement in the TC sector in Ghana since 1971 and the lesson.
learnt from the first te.ecommunications project and (c) its comparative
advantage to focus and coordinate the various sources of bilateral
assistance.  IDA's involvement in this sector has already been catalytic in
attracting financing from France, Holland and Japan, and in focussing
assistance on priority areas such as cable network rehabilitation.
4.       Project Obiectives.  The project has the following main
objectives: (a) to support a program of institutional and management
improvement; a major element of the program will be strengthening GPT's
management capability (organization, financial and engineering) to plan,
maintain and operate the network efficiently; (b) to improve the quality of
service offered to telecommunications subscribers through, inter alia,
rehabilitation and replacement of old obsolete and defective assets,
improving maintenance and providing complementary assets to enable optimum
utilization of existing assets; and (c) to improve GPT's financial
performance so as to eliminate existing subsidies from GOG.
5.       Project Description.  The proposed project would strengthen sector
management, improve the quality of service, and increase the number of
subscribers from the current 38,000 to 61,000 through: (a) institutional
development to include training and consultancy for reorganization and
corporate planning of GPT, TC master plan, manpower planning and
development, tariff policy and review, management assistance to fill
existing skill gaps in GPT in network planning, project management,
operations and maintenance, and financial management; and
(b) rehabilitation and expansion of subscriber and exchange networks of
Accra, Kumasi, Cape Coast, Tema, Takoradi, Tamale, Koforidua, Sekondi and
26 rural towns; rehabilitation of national long distance network and
international networks, and provision of spare parts for existing network.
The project, to be carried out over six years, provides funds for cables,
exchanges, satellite earth station, telephones, PABX, PMBX, teleprirters,
power plant, air-conditioning, civil works, vehicles, tools and test
equipment. It also provides funds for 636 man-months of consultancy
services. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$173.0 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$150.3 million (87X).
A breakdown of ccsts and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ghana are given in
Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7163-GH dated June 6, 1988, is also attached.
6.       Agreed Actions.  The GOG and GPT have already taken some key
actions towards strengthening the management of the telecommunications
sector including appointment of a Board of Directors for GPT, appointment
of a telecommunications adviscr at the MGTC and issuance of letters of

ot a telecommunications advisor at the MOTC and issuance of letters of



-3-
*nvltaticn fcr consu'tancy services for project management and financial
vs.e!ment.  the following further actions were agreed during negotiations:
- ts:vaI'.e fe,r   o-ment ef consultants and implementation of
~;:.;tan-.ts recmme.nat. :  ) identification cf counterpart personnel
sach  ssgr.zozt as seon as the letter of invitation for proposals tor
;,e assigrmment is issued; (c) provision by GOG of local funds required for
S.-'s a-> roved -nvest:nent program through 1990; (d) formalization by GO-G of
tne mortor3um on GPT's obligations to pay the interest and principal on
,G's loans until GPT's financial restructuring plan is implemented;
\e  Pvsical and finr.ancial targets including detailed action plans to
achib-v  them and timetable for reporting progress on the performance;
,f  maintpnance by GPT of an annual level of net internal cash generation
net of debt service not less than the local funds required for GPT's
ap?roved investment program, or to cover at least 402 of total investment
requirements in each year, whichever is greater from 1991 onwards; and
(g) consultation with IDA before any new works outside the approved
investment program exceeding in the aggregate the equivalent of one million
dollars per year is undertaken. The conditions of credit effectiveness
are: (i) the selection of consultants for project and financial management;
(ii) submission of audited FY1986 financial statements; (iii) signing of a
subsidiary loan agreement between the GOG and GPT; and (iv) effectiveness
of OECF financing for the project.
7.       Benefits.  Compared with alternative means of communication,
telecommunications are more efficient in terms of capital, energy
consumption, and user time. With adequate facilities, the level and
variety of productive communication can be increased considerably, and
activities which would otherwise not be feasible can be realized. In terms
of the specific constraints on Ghana's economic and social development,
telecommunications services can be expected to play a significant role
in:(a) increasing the efficient use of existing transport infrastructure to
alleviate domestic and international transport bottlenecks in delivering
inputs to agriculture and industry and produce to markets, both domestic
and exports, and to promote energy conservation; (b) improving the
operation of the market mechanism by expediting and extending access to
information, encouraging more efficient marketing of agricultural products
and supporting export trade; tc) improving the efficiency of government and
parastatal administration, including extending the coverage of advice and
supervision by scarce middle and higher level technical and management
personnel and reducing administrative bottlenecks and unnecessary travel;
and (d) improving the delivery of health care and emergency services. The
estimated economic rate of return of the project is 21Z.
8.       Risks.  There are three principal risks: (a) the project may fail
to satisfactorily address the sector institutional problems. This will be
m nimized by up front commitment by GOG and GPT to recruit necessary
management assistance from external consultants to fill in staff gaps in
management and technical pcsitions in the interim period; (b) GPT's initial
dependence on GOG for local funds required for the project may lead to
delays in implementation due to lack of timely allocations of funds by the
government; to minimize such a risk, IDA will ensure, through the Public
Expenditure Review, that GOG will make timely allocation of funds for the



- 4 -
project; and (c) funds for equipment comvitted by cofinanciers could be
dissipated; this will be minimized by the Bank ensuring close coordination
of all donors involved.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
