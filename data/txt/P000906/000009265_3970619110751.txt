GHANA
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(Credit 1946-GH)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second
Telecommunications Project in the Republic of Ghana for which Credit No. 1946-GH in
the amount of SDR 13.8 million equivalent was approved on July 26, 1988 and made
effective on December 15, 1988.
The credit closed on June 30, 1996, three years later than originally projected.
Final disbursement took place on November 18, 1996, at which time a balance of SDR
480,411.07 was canceled. Co-financing for the project was provided by the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan, the Japanese Government, the Netherlands
Government, and Caisse Franqaise de Developpement.
The ICR was prepared by Ms. Marilyn S. Manalo (Economic Management and
Social Policy Department, Africa Region) with input from Messrs. Paul Bermingham,
Rogati Kayani, and Peter Wright (Industry and Energy Department), and the Ghana
Telecommunications Company Limited. Comments received from co-financiers were
taken into consideration in the report.
Preparation of this ICR began during IDA's final supervision mission and is based
on material in the project file. The borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by
providing its views as reflected in the mission's aide memoire and furnishing data
incorporated in the report.

GHANA
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(Credit 1946-GH)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.   In 1987, Ghana had over 300 active state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The SOEs
performed poorly as evidenced by their large operating losses, low productivity,
increasing liquidity problems, inability to pay taxes and service debts, and growing
requirements for government subsidy. The Ghana Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation (GPT), the state-owned monopoly providing all telecommunications
services, experienced these same problems. It also impeded the Goverrnent of Ghana
(GOG) from advancing its objectives under the Economic Recovery Program (ERP),
launched in 1983. IDA provided resources under a number of operations to support the
ERP and address the country's economic decline. The Second Telecommunications
Project (STP) was one of these projects and was designed to address specific reforms in
the telecommunications sector.
2.   IDA's assistance in Ghana's telecommunications sector started in 1975 under the
First Telecommunications Project (Loan 1122-GH). The project objectives were not
satisfactorily met and the sector continued to perform poorly. It constrained economic
improvements envisaged under the ERP and required significant Government budgetary
outlays for equipment rehabilitation and maintenance. Recognizing the critical role the
telecommunications sector had to play for the ERP to achieve its objectives, the
Government decided to embark on a program to support reforms and development in the
sector.
Project Objectives and Description
3.    Consistent with the telecommunications sector goals, the objectives of the STP
were to: (a) improve the institutional and management structure of the
telecommunications sector; (b) realize the optimum utilization of existing assets through
the rehabilitation or replacement of old apparatus and the maintenance and provision of
complementary equipment; and (c) improve GPT's financial performance. Two
components supported the project objectives: the technical assistance and training
component and the rehabilitation and expansion component. With this assistance, GPT
was expected to eventually function as a commercial enterprise and become a net
contributor to the Government treasury.



ii
4.    The project objectives were justified given the critical role telecommunications
played in the Government's efforts to reform and rehabilitate SOEs, implement a
divestiture program, and develop the private sector. Acknowledging sectoral weaknesses
and lessons learned from the first telecommunications project and responding to the
country's development priorities and IDA's country assistance strategy, steps were taken
to promote the achievement of the project goals. Funds were provided for preparatory
work and covenants intended to strengthen GPT's financial management capacity were
incorporated in the legal documents. The project correctly focused on the need for
network reliability and operational competency to reverse the financial drain on the
treasury and improve the efficiency of the productive sectors. It did not unrealistically
burden an already weak system with sector expansion to meet the rising demand for
communications services. The program goals also served to restrict co-financing
programs to implementation levels manageable by GPT.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.    The project was originally scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1993 but was
delayed by three years. Delays were mainly due to the Government's interference and
inefficiencies in procurement procedures and a series of senior management turnovers in
the early years of project implementation.
6.    The following physical components of the project were completed and contributed
to the improved performance of GPT: installation of a new international telephone
exchange; rehabilitation of the satellite earth station for international services;
rehabilitation of the external cable network in key areas in Accra; rehabilitation,
replacement, and expansion of exchanges; and the rehabilitation, acquisition, and
expansion of equipment and transmission systems. Support for the rehabilitation and
expansion work was provided by external cable, switching, transmission, power and
engineering experts. Also, consultants assisted in the development and validation of
technical courses on teletraffic, power and air-conditioning, switching, outside line plant,
and transmission. Local instructors received training in these areas overseas.
7.    On the institutional side, achievements included the: development of a
telecommunications policy, telecommunications master plan, corporate plan and a
manpower development plan; establishment of a Corporate Department and functional
units (network planning, project implementation, network maintenance, traffic operations,
finance, supplies, management information systems, and manpower planning and
development) in GPT; capacity building in the Finance Department; and development of
a management accounting system, an electronic data processing center, and materials
management policies and procedures. These developments notwithstanding, GPT's
inability to operate fully as an autonomous and commercial entity continued to render it
organizationally weak and financially insolvent. GT was unable to consistently comply
with some of the financial covenants of the legal agreement with IDA. As a result, for
example, issues relating to debt service and investments were addressed later and in the
context of the privatization of GT.



iii
8.   Improvements made to the telecommunications infrastructure and GPT's
institutional capacity enabled GPT to belatedly (only in 1995) achieve some 1992 target
performance indicators provided in the appraisal report. The Government's intervention
in the procurement of consulting services, implementation delays or cancellation of some
co-financed commitments, the absence of tariff increases, a series of senior management
turnovers, and GPT's difficulty in improving and carrying out its manpower planning and
development policies and procedures (also reflected in poor incentives for GPT's staff)
were the main contributing factors to the poor performance in the early years of the
project.
9.    The total project cost was approximately US$210 million with IDA resources
amounting to approximately US$18 million and co-financing resources approximately
US$192 million. Compared to the appraisal estimate of approximately US$173 million,
the higher costs resulted from additional investments and changes in the rehabilitation
and expansion work. The financial and economic rates of return of the project is
estimated at 23 percent compared to the appraisal estimate of 13 percent and 21 percent,
respectively.
10.   Recognizing that the existing telecommunications sector structure continued to
fail to meet the communication requirements necessary for the economic growth of the
country, the Government commenced its efforts to reform the sector in 1993. The
objectives of this program were to achieve rapid expansion and improve the quality of
service through increased private sector participation, the promotion of competition and
the establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework. Considerable progress has
been made in the implementation of the reform program as evidenced by the: split of
GPT into GT and GP; ongoing work to sell a controlling interest in GT to a strategic
investor, to sell a license to a second network operator (bids had already been opened in
December 1996), and to restructure GT's debt; creation of a regulatory agency, the
National Communications Authority (NCA); preparation of draft model licenses,
interconnection agreements and a tariff policy paper for the sector; and implementation of
a staff retrenchment program.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
11.   Overall, the objectives of the project were partially achieved. The project
contributed to the development and modernization of the telecommunications
infrastructure; increased the volume, quality and coverage of telecommunications
services; and supported the implementation of a sector reform program which
incorporates the private delivery of services in a competitive market.
12.   Overall, IDA's performance was satisfactory. Project preparation and supervision
were adequate. Following unsuccessful efforts to develop the financial management and
manpower capacity of GPT, in 1993 and 1994 IDA, adopting a participatory approach,
assisted the Government in the formulation of a strategy to reform and improve the
performance of the sector.



iv
13.   The performance of the Borrower and GPT was satisfactory particularly regarding
the implementation of the physical component of the project. Unfortunately, the benefits
of the improvements on the infrastructure were reduced by GPT's inability to fully profit
from the capacity building efforts made under the project. GPT could not function
autonomously from the Government nor competitively within the market structure it was
operating in to sustain the institutional and financial management improvements it
achieved in the early years of the project. This notwithstanding, the Government, starting
in 1993, recognized and adopted essential steps to solve the root problems of the sector.
It continues to make progress in implementing an ambitious sector reform program based
on market liberalization and private sector investment.
14.   The project outcome is satisfactory based on the fact that: (a) many of the
objectives under the rehabilitation and expansion component were realized; (b) many of
the sub-components under the capacity building component were carried out although not
all the goals were fully attained; and (c) the Government is well advanced in the
implementation of a far-reaching sector reform program which includes privatizing
communication services and developing a competitive market and improvements in the
telecommunication policy and regulatory environment.
15.  It is likely that the sustainability of the operations and benefits achieved under the
project will be maintained and improved as the Government continues to implement its
ambitious sector reform program. The Government recognizes that reforms should be
carefully implemented and used to improve the technical and operational capabilities of
GT. Sustainability depends critically on the changes in management responsibility and
accountability, the introduction of a sound financial management program, updated
telecommunication operations and maintenance procedures, and implementation of
sectoral reforms in a coordinated manner.
16.   The plan for the project's future operation and the measures to maximize the
project benefits will have to be built into the laws and expansion program governing the
sector. The National Communications Authority (NCA) will define the key elements to
the development of a competitive market by decree, including the functions, organization,
and financial resources of the service providers, and the regulatory issues governing
market entry, licensing, price regulation, and abuse of dominant position. A new Bank
operation is under preparation to support the NCA and the implementation of this phase
of the sector reform program, and the development of telecommunications services in the
rural areas.
17.   The key lessons learned from this operation are that: (a) state-owned monopolies
are generally unable to satisfy the demand for services and to mobilize the investment and
skills needed to develop the telecommunications sector; and (b) in today's increasingly
global and competitive economy, performance in the telecommunications sector can be
improved significantly through the introduction of fundamental sector reforms which
allow private participation and the introduction of a competitive market structure.

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(Credit 1946-GH)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background
1.   In 1987, Ghana had over 300 active state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The SOEs
performed poorly as evidenced by their large operating losses, low productivity,
increasing liquidity problems, inability to pay taxes and service debts, and growing
requirements for government subsidy. The Ghana Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation (GPT), the state-owned monopoly providing all telecommunications
services, experienced these same problems. It also slowed down the ability of the
Government of Ghana (GOG) to advance its objectives to address the country's economic
decline under its Economic Recovery Program (ERP), launched in 1983. In support of
the comprehensive reform program for the SOE sector under the ERP, IDA provided
resources under a number of operations. One operation, the Second Telecommunications
Project (STP), was designed to address specific reforms in the telecommunications sector.
2.    Prior to the STP, IDA's involvement in Ghana's telecommunications sector
started in 1971 when preparation work for the First Telecommunications Project started.
This first operation (Ln. 1122-GH), for US$23 million, was approved in 1975. The
project was designed to: fund part of the 1976-1980 investment program of GPT;
improve the quality of telecommunications services; extend services to new subscribers;
and strengthen GPT. The project objectives were not met' when the project closed on
June 30, 1985. The main contributing factors were: the difficult economic conditions in
Ghana; lack of adequate staff and management at GPT; delays in implementing an overly
optimistic schedule; large overruns in local costs that GPT could not finance without
Government support; and delays in meeting a cost overrun in foreign exchange due to a
decision to change switching technology from electromechanical to digital electronic.
3.    When the STP was prepared in 1987, the telecommunications sector was still
performing very poorly. This was reflected in: low telephone density (0.3 DELs, down
from 0.4 DELs in 1981 per 100 people); inadequate and uneven distribution of telephone
facilities between urban and rural areas; unreliable and delayed service; GPT's unhealthy
financial position and inadequate investment levels; and a weak organizational structure.

2
As a result, the sector continued to significantly constrain economic improvements
envisaged under the ERP and to require significant Government budgetary outlays for
equipment rehabilitation and maintenance. Recognizing the critical role the
telecommunications sector had to play for the ERP to achieve its objectives, the
Government decided to embark on a development program to support the
telecommunications sector.
B. Project Objectives and Description
4.    The STP was designed to support the telecommunications development program
and, consistent with the sectoral goals, its objectives were to: (a) improve the
institutional and management structure of the sector; (b) rehabilitate old equipment,
replace obsolete assets, and maintain and provide complementary assets to realize the
optimum utilization of existing assets; and (c) improve GPT's financial performance.
Support was provided to enable GPT to function as a commercial enterprise so that it
could become a net contributor to the Government thereby eliminating the need for
government subsidies.
5.    The project had two components to support these objectives: the technical
assistance and training component; and the rehabilitation and expansion component.
About 54 percent of the IDA credit supported the first and third objectives of the project
with financing for consultancy services (organization, finance, regulation and policy,
engineering), training (telecommunications management, digital technology, finance,
accounts and procurement, curriculum development). With the availability of co-
financed resources for the physical components of the project, the remaining 46 percent
of the project resources provided for the achievement of the second project objective.
Funding was provided for spare parts for existing equipment; replacement parts for
defective exchanges and cables; replacement for obsolete exchanges; telephones,
teleprinters; private manual branch exchanges, private automatic branch exchanges;
public call offices; replacement equipment for digital trunk exchanges, microwave
equipment, multiplex equipment and power plant; replacement of microwave and UHF
transmission systems; provision of: a coast station, rural transmission facilities,
VFT/TDM systems and sub-base band insert equipment; vehicles for planning,
construction, operation, maintenance work; power and air conditioning equipment;
computer, tools and test equipment; and construction materials for flood protection works
and for residential buildings.
6.    The project's objectives were justified given the critical role the sector was
playing in the Government's efforts to reform and rehabilitate SOEs, implement a
divestiture program, and develop the private sector. Moreover, at the time the project
was prepared the available resources and expertise were limited qualitatively and required
improvement. The comprehensive changes pursued under the project were expected to
have wide ranging effects in increasing efficiency in the market mechanisms, health and
transportation sectors, and the government and parastatal administration, among others.
These objectives were clearly stated and realistically responsive to the country's



3
development priorities and IDA's country assistance strategy. The project correctly
focused on the need for network reliability and operational competency to reverse the
financial drain on the treasury and improve the efficiency of the productive sectors. It did
not unrealistically burden an already weak system with sector expansion to meet the
rising demand for communications services. The program goals also served to restrict co-
financing programs to implementation levels manageable by GPT.
7.    Taking into account the sectoral weaknesses and the lessons learned from the first
telecommunications project, steps were taken before the approval of the project to
promote the achievement of the project's goals. Two advances under the Project
Preparation Facility funded consultancy services for the preliminary work to split and
reorganize GPT, develop a telecommunications master plan and a corporate plan, and
support project management and accounting. To advance the project goals, the legal
agreements included, among others, covenants requiring: (a) the Government to
formalize a moratorium on GPT's debt service obligation on loans made by the
Government from its own resources; (b) GPT to generate sufficient internal resources to
fund the greater of either the local costs of their investment program or the annual
average of their capital expenditure; (c) prior approval from IDA on GPT's investments
exceeding $1 million; (d) GPT to establish functional units covering network planning
and maintenance, project implementation, traffic operations, finance, supplies, MIS and
manpower planning and development; and (e) annual audit reports.
C. Achievement of Project Objectives
8.    Overall, the objectives of the project were partially achieved. The project
contributed to the development and modernization of the telecommunications
infrastructure; increased the volume, quality and coverage of telecommunications
services; and paved the way toward sector reforms, which incorporate the private delivery
of services in a competitive market. A summary of achievements under the project are
provided below and in Part II of this report.
Rehabilitation and Expansion Component
9.    GPT's performance improved following the completion of rehabilitation and
maintenance work. This included the installation of a new international telephone
exchange (co-financed by Caisse Francaise de Develloppement (CFD); rehabilitation of
the satellite earth station for international services (co-financed by Japan Exim Bank);
rehabilitation of the external cable network in key areas (co-financed by the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF, Japan) and the Dutch and Japanese governments);
rehabilitation, replacement, and expansion of exchanges; switching equipment; the
rehabilitation, acquisition, and expansion of equipment and transmission systems; and
civil works (co-financed by Japan Exim Bank, Telectron and those mentioned above). A
network optimization study for Accra and Kumasi, completed in early 1993 by
consultants, provided direction to infrastructural developments. By 1995, there were
63,740 connected lines (compared to 38,046 in 1987, 49,847 in 1994 and the projected



4
target of 61,000 by 1992); the targeted capacity for the telex exchange was attained; and
the number of telex subscriber lines exceeded expectations at 1,010 lines. While there
were improvements in the exchange fill, the number of faults per year per DEL, the call
completion rates, the average operator answer time to book calls, and the number of
telecommunications staff per 1,000 DELs (performance targets listed in the SAR) were
not attained.
10.   External cable, switching, transmission, power and engineering experts were part
of a project management team which assisted GPT in implementing the STP. They
supported the rehabilitation and expansion work program including the provision of
design and detailed engineering; materials procurement; equipment installation,
acceptance testing, and commissioning; network operations and maintenance; and
manpower training and development services.
Technical Assistance Component
11.   A telecommunications master plan was developed in response to the need to
continue with a substantial program of network rehabilitation and in recognition of staff
shortages and the lack of a coordinated telecommunications planning function in GPT. A
master plan for 1987-2006 was drawn which established development targets for the
sector, defined target standards of service, and determined key policy decisions required
to implement a consistent long-term network development program.
12.   The development of a reorganization plan was funded under the project.
Emanating from this work were recommendations on the options and modalities to
implement the separation of GPT into two entities corresponding to the
telecommunications and postal functions. In 1990, an action plan for splitting up the
corporation and an organizational structure were developed. The subsequent process of
splitting the corporation was drawn out primarily due to the lack of management and
legal capacity in the Government and in GPT. It was only in December 1993 that the
Statutory Corporations Act was passed and provided for the conversion of GPT into two
limited liability companies. Following the adoption of a new telecommunications sector
policy (approved by the Cabinet in April 1995),2 the Government formally split GPT into
the Ghana Telecommunications Company Limited (GT) and the Ghana Postal Services
Corporation (GP) in August 1995. A certificate to commence business was issued to GT
in October 1995. Currently, the Government is in the process of selling a 30 percent
stake in GT to a strategic investor (who also will have management control) and expects
to conclude the sale by early 1997.
2The telecommunications sector reform policy aims to achieve rapid expansion and improve the quality of
telecommunications services through increased private sector participation, the promotion of competition,
and the establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework. In 1995, IDA approved advances under the
Project Preparation Facility totalling US$2 million to assist the Government in implementing the reform
policy.



5
13.  In response to the Government's agreement under the IDA-financed Structural
Adjustment Credit (Cr. 1777-GH) to have corporate plans prepared for all major
parastatal organizations in Ghana, allocations under the STP were made for a five-year
corporate plan. During project preparation, it was agreed that the plan would focus on the
short-term financial performance of GPT and would establish objectives and define
program and resource requirements necessary to meet these objectives. A corporate plan
for 1990-1994 was prepared by consultants and a Corporate Affairs Department was later
established within GPT. With inadequate resources, however, the department has not
been able to function effectively and to complete an update of the corporate plan for years
1994-1998. Also, prior to the split of GPT into two companies, functional units were
established for network planning, project implementation, network maintenance, traffic
operations, finance, supplies, management information systems, and manpower planning
and development. A further reorganization of GT took place after its split from GP.
14.   To overcome management deficiencies and develop an information base for
financial planning, funds were provided for the services of the following experts: a
commercial manager, management accountant and stock and stores accountant. These
consultants were contracted to focus on the development of systems and procedures and
train local counterparts in GPT in areas including: financial management and reporting,
budgets and forecasts, billing and collection, debt management, tariff review, and stock
inventory, control and pricing. Though their appointments were delayed by the
Government's cumbersome procurement procedures and their performance was
unsatisfactory to GPT (except for the management accountant), the consultants' work led
to the preparation and implementation of a management accounting system and the
development of materials management policies and procedures. In the future, to meet
acceptable reporting requirements, additional work will be necessary to improve the
accounting system, particularly with regard to the preparation of an accounting manual
and the development of policies and procedures for supporting account systems.
15.   An electronic data processing center (EPDC) was established in 1993 with project
funds. After experiencing start-up and implementation delays and switch over problems
during acceptance testing, the center is now fully operational. While it provides facilities
for billing (national and international), payroll and financial management, the
effectiveness of these tools has been undermined by problems with the operating
procedures. Also, given its uncompetitive salary structure, GT has difficulties recruiting
and retaining qualified staff to run the EPDC. These problems, plus the need to cope
with a larger client base, have made providing useful and timely financial management
tools problematic for GT.
16.   Resources under the project were also allocated to improve GPT's financial
performance. Despite assistance under the project, its financial position continued to
remain weak (summarized in Part II of the report). Several factors contributed to this:
high investment costs to finance network expansion, delays in connecting new capacity to
subscribers, delayed billing, poor collection practices, high accounts receivables, and
insufficient tariff increases. The billing process continued to be plagued by difficulties



6
due to, among others, late processing or batch processing of bills by computer houses,
poor coordination between the engineering and commercial sections of GPT, delayed
implementation of a rationalization exercise to identify subscribers whose lines were not
working but continued to receive bills, delays in completing an aging analysis to identify
the uncollectable arrears that had to be written off, high cross debts between government
agencies, and the shortage of qualified and motivated staff. Improvements in the
collection process during the earlier years of the project was not sustained by a collection
task force.
17.   Sales revenues also continued to remain low because, despite an acceleration of
inflation in recent years, tariffs were increased only twice during the project
implementation period: in May 1988 and again in April 1993. A tariff study to develop
principles and procedures that would guide GPT in the formulation and implementation
of a tariff structure was planned but not undertaken. With approval from IDA, resources
for this component were reallocated to other components. A review of tariffs and tariff
setting procedures commenced in 1995 in the context of the on-going sector reform
program. Tariffs remain low compared to some countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
18.   When assets were revalued at the time of finalizing the split of posts and
telecommunications, it became clear that GT's liabilities significantly exceeded a fair
valuation of their assets. GT has been unable to service its debt obligations to the
Government for several years. The Government has agreed to absorb a large portion of
this debt as part of the privatization of GT.
19.   GPT's compliance record on the financial covenants of the legal agreement with
IDA was insufficient in some areas and absent in others. While they regularly submitted
audit reports, these were late because of the problems described above. They did not
comply with the Project Agreement, Section 2.04 (settlement of its debt obligations to the
Government) and Section 4.02 (a) (internal generation of funds for investment purposes).
On the Government's part, they did not comply with the Development Credit Agreement,
Section 3.01 (c), requiring that they fully exercise their rights on GPT's debt obligations.
The debt service and investment issues were addressed later and in the context of the
privatization of GT.
20.   Under the manpower planning and development component of the STP,
objectives were partially met. With the provision of services from consultants and a
technical advisor, 26 courses on teletraffic, power and air-conditioning, switching,
external line plant, and transmission were developed and validated. Also, seven
instructors were trained overseas under a fellowship program covered in the consultant's
contract. However, funds originally allocated for overseas fellowships in management,
engineering and finance were reallocated (following Idea's clearance) to finance
equipment and other requirements for the training school and additional resources
necessary for the network optimization study. Rehabilitation work on the training school
was completed and all training equipment delivered. Also, Gut's uncompetitive salary



7
structure made it difficult for the company to retain some trained staff beyond a period
predetermined to compensate GPT for the training provided to the staff.
21.   On other miscellaneous project components, the project funded the purchase of
20,000 telephone sets. Because of lack of funds, the Government decided to cancel the
payphones and PABX components. The construction of housing units, incorporated in
the project to serve as an incentive to staff, was delayed by procurement and materials
storage problems. After the resolution of these problems, construction of 100 housing
units is now underway.
22.   As summarized in Tables 8a and 8b in Part II, the total project cost was
approximately US$210 million with IDA providing approximately US$18 million and
co-financiers approximately US$192 million. Compared to the original project cost
estimate of US$173 million, the higher costs resulted from additional investments and
changes in the rehabilitation and expansion work. The financial and economic rates of
return on these investments is estimated at 23 percent compared to 13 percent and 21
percent, respectively, estimated at appraisal.
D. Major Factors Affecting the Project
23.   The key factors which affected project execution were:
(a)  excessive interference by the Government in the procurement of consulting
services during the early years of the project. They repeatedly prevented
the early appointment of consultants serving key functional areas in the
project management unit. Also, their procurement clearance process was
cumbersome and long for foreign consultants and some co-financed
components. These procurement problems resulted in a two-year delay in
project implementation.
(b)  GPT's inability to function autonomously and on a commercial basis.
Given the absence of a conducive market structure, it could not operate
competitively and efficiently nor make investment, financing, tariff, and
personnel decisions to improve its overall performance.
These factors, along with delays or cancellation of some co-financing commitments and
changes in the rehabilitation and expansion work, contributed to the Credit closing three
years later than originally forecasted.
E. Project Sustainability
24.  It is likely that the operations and benefits achieved under the project will be
maintained and improved as the Government continues to implement its ambitious sector
reform program. Since 1993 when the Government started preparation work for its
telecommunications reform program, considerable progress has been made as evidenced



8
by the: split of GPT into GT and GP; ongoing work to sell a controlling interest in GT to
a strategic investor and to sell a license to a second network operator (bids had already
been opened in December 1996), and to restructure GT's debt; creation of a regulatory
agency, the National Communications Authority (NCA); preparation of draft model
licenses, interconnection agreements and a tariff policy paper for the sector; and
implementation of a staff retrenchment program.
25.   The Government recognizes that reforms should be carefully implemented and
used to improve the technical and operational capabilities of GT. Sustainability depends
critically on the changes in management responsibility and accountability, the
introduction of a sound financial management program, updated telecommunication
operations and maintenance procedures, and implementation of sectoral reforms in a
coordinated manner.
F. IDA's Performance
26.   Overall, the Association's performance was satisfactory. The project was
adequately prepared as manifested by the: correct analysis of the major constraints to the
development of the telecommunications sector; careful assessment of the background,
experience and qualification of Government and GPT staff; design of the project that
supported realistic goals and the development strategy and priorities of the Government
and IDA; and correct identification of the project's risks. In considering lessons from the
first telecommunications operation, conditions for credit effectiveness were established
and some technical assistance and training commenced prior to the signing of the credit.
27.   Supervision of the project was adequate as reflected by the quality (skills mix and
continuity) of Bank staff, frequency and length of field visits, accuracy in reporting of
implementation progress and problems, and established harmonious and cooperative
working relationships with GPT and other co-financiers. Following unsuccessful efforts
to develop the financial management and manpower capacity of GPT, in 1993 and 1994
IDA adopted a participatory approach in assisting the Government to formulate a strategy
that would improve the performance of the sector.
G. Borrower's Performance
28.   The performance of the Borrower and GPT was satisfactory particularly regarding
the implementation of the physical component of the project. Unfortunately, the
Borrower's returns on the infrastructural investments were reduced by GPT's inability to
fully profit from the capacity building efforts made under the project. Unable to function
autonomously and competitively within the market structure it was operating in, GPT
could not consistently sustain the institutional and financial management improvements it
achieved.



9
29.  In spite of these deficiencies, since 1993 the Government has been implementing
a comprehensive reform program to solve the root problems of the sector. It continues to
support a program that is based on market liberalization and private sector investment.
H. Assessment of Outcome
30.   The project outcome is satisfactory based on the fact that: (a) many of the
objectives under the rehabilitation and expansion component were realized; (b) many of
the sub-components under the capacity building component were carried out although not
all the goals were fully attained; and (c) the Government continues to implement a far-
reaching sector reform program which includes privatizing communication services and
developing a competitive market and improvements in the telecommunication policy and
regulatory environment.
I. Future Operations
31.   The plan for the project's future operation and the measures to maximize the
project benefits will have to be built into the laws and expansion program governing the
sector. The NCA will define by decree key elements to the development of a competitive
market, including the functions, organization, and financial resources of the service
providers, and the regulatory issues governing market entry, licensing, price regulation,
and abuses of a dominant position. A new Bank operation is under preparation to support
the NCA and the implementation of this phase of the sector reform program, the
expansion of telecommunications services in the rural area, and the development of the
postal sector.
J. Key Lessons Learned
32.   The key lessons leamed from this operation are that: (a) state-owned monopolies
generally are unable to satisfy the demand for services and to mobilize the investment and
skills needed to develop the telecommunications sector; and (b) in today's increasingly
global and competitive economy, performance in the telecommunications sector can be
improved significantly through the introduction of fundamental sector reforms which
allow private participation and the introduction of a competitive market structure.

For 1988 through 1995 incremental operating costs are calculated as the excess of total operating costs in
each year compared to those in 1987; for 1996 through 1998, incremental operating costs are projected
based on the incremental number of lines; the incremental operating cost for 1998 was used for 1999
through 2008.
For 1988 through 1995 incremental operating revenues are calculated as the excess of total operating
revenue each year compared to those in 1987; for 1996 through 1998, incremental operating revenues
are projected based on the incremental number of lines; the incremental operating revenue for 1998
was used for 1999 through 2008.

GHAINA
SECOND TELECONMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
World Bank Supervision Mission, February 1996
Aide Memoire
I.    An International Development Association (IDA) mission, represented by Messrs.
Paul Bermingham and Peter Wright and Ms. Marilyn MNanalo visited Accra from February
19 through March 8, 1996 to conduct the final supervision of the Second
Telecommunications Project (STP). The mission would like to thank the officials at the
Ghana Telecommunications Corporation Ltd. (GT) and the M\linistry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) for the assistance and courtesies extended to it. At the
conclusion of the mission, a meeting chaired by Ing. J. Aggrey-Mensah, Managing
Director of GT, reviewed the team's findings and agreed on the next steps
2.    The objectives of the mission were to conduct IDA's final review of the status of
the STP and arrange for the preparation of an implementation completion report for the
IDA-funded project after its closing scheduled for June 30, 1996. Following is a summary
of the mission's findings and the next steps agreed between the mission and GT, which are
subject to confirmation on return to Washington.
A. Recent Developments in the Sector
3.    Since the last formal supervision mission in October 1994, the Government of
Ghana (GOG) has made major progress in implementing its telecommunications sector
reform program which aims to meet the demand for customer lines (forecasted at between
300,000-500,000) by the end of the century. A new telecommunications sector policy
(debated in a workshop in October 1994) was approved by the Cabinet in April 1995 and
aims to achieve rapid expansion and improve the quality of service through increased
private sector participation, the promotion of competition, and the establishment of an
appropriate regulatorv framework. In implementing this policy, the follow-ing steps have
been taken:
* the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation was formally split into Ghana
Telecommunications Company Limited (GT) and the Ghana Postal Services Corporation
(GP) on August 31, 1995, GT was issued a certificate of incorporation on June 16, 1995
and a certificate to commence business on October 19, 1995. An organizational structure
is now in place (Annex 1)
*  a project coordinator and financial and legal advisers have been appointed by 'MOTC
and have commenced their work to advise the Government on the sale of a controlling
interest in GT to a strategic investor and the sale of a license for a second network
operator,



2
* a Preliminary Information Memorandum for GT has been prepared,
*  accounting consultants have completed the first draft of their report which provides
separate accounts for GP and GT and makes recommendations for restructuring GT's
debt to establish an acceptable opening financial position before it is privatized,
*  consultants have submitted a draft report providing an appraisal of GT's fixed assets,
*  MOTC's policy advisers have drafted model licenses, interconnection agreements and
a tariff policy for the sector;
*  the bill creating the National Communications Authority was submitted to Parliament
for consideration,
* as part of its program to rationalize costs through a restructuring of its labor force,
474 workers were laid off in November 1995 at an average severance pay of
approximately $2,000 per employee;
*  GT is presently considering proposals to increase and re-balance its tariffs prior to its
pnvatization.
B. Implementation Status of the STP
4.    The STP was developed to support GPT's investment program for the period
1987 to 1992, a program prepared by GPT with IDA assistance and designed within the
framework of GOG's overall Economic Recovery Program. The objectives of the project
were to rehabilitate, modernize and expand the telecommunications network and provide
institutional capacity building support. The total project cost was estimated at USS 173.0
million equivalent (approximately Cedis 35.2 billion in 1988), with a foreign exchange
component of US$150.3 million (87% of total cost) and local component of Cedis 4.6
billion. The foreign component of the project was funded by Caisse Centrale de
Developpment (CFD, France, loan), the Netherlands Government (soft loan and export
credit), Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF, Japan, grant and export credit),
Telectron (Ireland, supplier's credit), and IDA.
5.    Although technical assistance and training commenced prior to the signing of the
IDA credit in 1988 under an IDA-financed Project Preparation Facility (PPF), completion
of the STP was delayed by around three years (since 1992) because of a number of
factors: some co-financing commitments to undertake major telecommunications projects
were delayed or canceled, GPT experienced a series of senior management turnovers in
the period through to 1992, major telecommunications projects designed to address the
backlog of demand only commenced in 1993 with equipment cutovers and service
connections beginning in 1994/1995 and expected for completion throughout 1996 In
spite of the delays in project completion, there are significant achievements now being
realized in the project objective for rehabilitation and expansion of the telecommunications
network and more modest results in the objective of institutional capacitv building. A
status report of each of the project's sub-components is provided in Annex 2 and a
summary of the implementation progress of on-going components is provided below



Rehabilitation and Expansion of the Telecommunications Network
6     CFD funding of FRF 8 million for an extension to the Accra International
Telephone Exchange was abandoned due to the delay in commitment of funds GPT
funded the critical extension from their resources. CFD funding of FRF 57 million for the
provision of external plant facilities in the Dansoman area of Accra was not provided,
requiring GPT to undertake the purchase of wireless local ioop equipment to temporarily
service the area and seek further suppliers credit to service the exchange outside the STP
and under the scope of the Accelerated Development Program (1994-1996). CFD funding
of FRF 116 million to provide services to the rapidly developing port area of Tema was
delayed until 1995 (after the last Bank supervision mission), and is programmed for
completion by December 1996.
7.    Japanese OECF and EXLMI Bank funding was delayed leading to major projects
for telephone switching, transmission and external plant facilities only commencing
construction in October 1993. Although some major equipment installations were cutover
for service in 1994/1995, the majority of equipment will be available for service only
through 1996.
8.    The Dutch funding of NLG 94.4 million for rehabilitation and upgrading of
external plant facilities in six district and regional capital towns is currently under revision
and negotiation, and will be encompassed in the scope of the ADP.
9.    Under the STP as of 31 December 1995 the total exchange capacity has increased
from 48,000 direct exchange lines (DELs), in analog and manual exchanges, to 106,249
exchange lines, 85 % as digital exchanges. The number of connected DELs has increased
from 38,000 to 63,024 in the same period. Although all exchange extensions of switching
equipment are installed, external plant facilities are not yet complete and available in 13
smaller towns, limiting the availability of 700 lines of exchange capacity Performance
indicators (Annex 3) show an improving trend in most categories. However, achievement
of the targets set in 1987 and to be achieved through the completion of this project show
service criteria relating to call completion rates and operator answering time have not been
achieved nor are they expected to be fully achieved by the end of 1996.
10.   The mission undertook a field trip to see the digital switching exchanges at
Achimota (4,000 lines of NEC) and Nsawam (500 lines of Fujitsu), both of which were
cutover from manual exchanges in 1995. The mission also visited Dome, where outside
plant construction of manholes and ducts for buried cables was in progress, and the
satellite earth station at Knutunse to look at the new DKK antenna for international
service directly with Japan.
Institutional Support
11.   Progress under this component was discussed in the context of the overall sector
reform program and the recent meetings between representatives of NIOTC and their



4
consultants, GT, and IDA held at the World Bank headquarters in Washington February
12-16, 1996. MOTC provided the mission with a copy of the draft proceedings of these
meetings
12.   As agreed during these meetings, the mission provided GT with its comments on
the draft reports of the consultants on the appraisal of GT's fixed assets, balance sheets for
GT and Ghana Postal Service Corporation, the financial restructuring recommendations
for GT, and the draft Preliminary Information Memorandum. On the appraisal of fixed
assets and the opening balance sheets, the mission's main comments related to (i) the
seemingly very high revalued amount of fixed assets, and (ii) the need to clarify the basis
for the revaluation of other assets and the 60:40 asset allocation between GT and GP, the
gross book value of accounts receivable, conversion of equity and reserves, accruals and
provisions, tax liability, the investment program and certain loans.
13.   The mission's main observation on the financial restructuring review included the
recommendation that: (i) detailed schedules showing time profiles of the Government's
future repayments to lenders be completed in USS equivalent and Cedis, (ii) information
on the amounts borrowed directly by GT and guaranteed by the Government be provided;
and. (iii) more innovative and realistic options for financial restructuring be developed.
GT also informed the mission that it will request the consultants to provide them with a
good indication of the cost implications of each of the restructuring scenarios developed
by the consultants to allow GT and the Government to better make informed decisions.
14.   Discussions also took place on the problem of land title. Although this is currently
a systemic problem experienced by SOEs in the divestiture program, GT informed the
mission that they have commenced work on this issue and appointed consultants to perfect
the titles. GT is presently working with the Government and its legal advisers to develop
proposals to resolve the land title and right of way problem in a way which will allow the
privatization to proceed quickly.
15.   Following the split of GPT, 474 workers were laid off in November 1995 with a
severance package costing approximately $950,000. GT and GP estimate that further
redundancies will be required as they both work towards financial viability. The mission
agreed with GT that assistance would be provided under the project to finance consulting
services to develop and implement a strategy to manage the reduction in the workforce of
GT and GP.
IDA Project Funds
16    IDA's support for the STP was provided under Credit 1946-GH and amounted to
SDR 13.8 million (S19 million equivalent). Approximately SDR 1.7 million remained
undisbursed as of mid-February 1996 (Annex 4) of which approximately SDR 760,000
remains uncommitted The mission agreed with GT a list of activities to be financed from
remaining funds in the credit, including instrumentation and power equipment, computer
equipment, technical and professional training, and consulting services in support of the



5
restructuring (labor redundancies) and privatization of GT. With the project closing date
scheduled for June 30, 1996 (following a third and final extension), the mission reminded
GT that all contracts and purchases to be covered under the project should be executed
and completed by this date to ensure that they can be financed under the credit. Also,
withdrawal applications for all eligible expenditures should be sent to IDA soon after the
closing date and not later than October 3 1, 1996 to avoid cancellation of amounts
allocated to eligible expenditures.
Status of Legal Covenants
17.   A summary of the status of the legal covenants is set out in Annex 5
Implementation Completion Report
18.   The policy of IDA is to evaluate completed projects together with the Borrower
and to record this evaluation in an Implementation Completion Report. The ICR assesses
primarily the (a) degree of achievement of project objectives; (b) prospects for the
project' s sustainabilitv; (c) performance of IDA and the Borrower; (d) project outcome;
and (e) plan for the project's future operation. The ICR provides the data and analysis to
substantiate these assessments and also identifies the lessons learned from implementation.
19.   The mission discussed with GT the requirements to complete the report and it was
agreed that GT would assist IDA in its preparation by providing IDA by mid-April with
the information listed below (and as formatted in Annex 6).
Rehabilitation and Expansion of the Telecommunications Network
a) For all the studies: estimated completion date, actual completion date, status, impact
of study
b) Actual technical performance data for years 1988 through 1996
Institutional Capacity Building
a) For all the studies: estimated completion date, actual completion date, status, impact
of study
b) GT's organizational chart, staffing information (1988 to 1996), investment procram
c) By technical area, the number of courses developed and the number of staff trained
locally and overseas by year
Other Information
a) ActuaLtotal project costs by project component and by funding agency, broken down
by local and foreign cost components
b) Information to obtain the project's internal rate of return and economic rate of return



6
20.   In addition to the above information, GT would commence preparation of their
section of the ICR and would submit this together with any comments to IDA's draft ICR
within 6 weeks from receipt.
21,   The mission also met with representatives of the co-financiers, CFD, OECF, and
the Netherlands Government. It was agreed that the co-financiers would review the IDA-
draft ICR and send their comments to IDA not later than one month from receipt of the
draft report.
C. Future Operations
22.   In April 1995, GT signed a contract for JY 140 million (80% credit) for the
expansion of the OECF II telephone facilities in four exchanges in Accra - 34,000 lines
switch capacity, 5,600 transmission circuits, and 25,900 external plant facility cable pairs -
to be installed by December 1996. At present, GT is evaluating three proposals to utilize
OECF, Dutch and TCIL credits to provide an additional 14,500 lines switch capacity,
41,800 cable pair in 1 7 district capitals and towns, plus a new satellite earth station at
Nkutunse, for a cost of US$ 49.8 million equivalent (81 % credit). With contract signing
by April 1996, the majority of the switching, transmission and external plant facilities is
expected to be in place by December 1996. The mission noted that GT had significantly
scaled back its 1996 investment program to the above amount and that most of the
program would be financed on concessionary terms. The mission agreed to provide GT
with IDA's written comments on the program by March 15, 1996.
23.   The GOG has approved a licence for Capital Telecom Ltd. to provide up to
40,000 lines of telecommunications equipment in three phases to more than 95
towns/villages in the Southern Sector - Western, .Central, Eastern, Greater Accra and
Volta regions of Ghana. The initial phase of three phases will provide service to over
10,000 customers and is to be in operation beginning in the first quarter through the third
quarter of 1996. Other than interconnection, there is no financial relationship between GT
and Capital Telecom.
24.   MOTC floated a limited tender in the third quarter of 1995 to choose a BOT
operator for the Northern Sector - Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Northern, Upper East and
Upper West regions. The tender was not successful as potential bidders found the
Northern Sector to be unprofitable. In December 1995, GT examined an offer for a
Canadian Government grant to utilize point-to-multipoint (PMP) radio technology of
2,500 lines to about 60 district centers in all the regions except Ashanti, at an estimated
cost of C$ 11.8 million. The proposal, if approved by April 1996, will provide coverage in
the Brong Ahafo region by the end of 1996 and to the other three regions by mid-1997.
25.   GT has had two C-DOT, India small switches under field trial evaluation, with
favorable results, and is now planning to utilize this technology in smaller centers not
covered under the projects above to provide service. The estimated cost is S 675,000.

26    The mission agreed on targeted operational performance indicators for 1996. It
was also agreed that it was not useful to determine targets beyond that date due to the
imminent privatization.
D., Next IDA Operation
27.   The mission advised that arrangements for the preparation of a further IDA
operation to support the implementation of the Government's sector reform program are
under way. The status of project preparation, and the next steps to be taken, are recorded
in the note of the meetings held in Washington from February 12 to 16, 1996 (Annex 7).
