COMHUNAL IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of the Philippines has requested the Bank and the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to assist in financ-
ing the National Irrigation Administration's (NIA) program of communal irri-
gation development. The project would strengthen the Provincial Irrigation
Offices (PIOs) which are responsible for implementing the program. It would
finance the construction of about 25%, by area, of the expected NIA program
for communal irrigation works during the project period, adding about 3% to
the existing area, and would also rehabilitate 3% of the present communal
irrigation area.
The Rural and Agricultural Sector
1.02      Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy,
accounting for about 30% of the gross domestic product (GDP), 60% of foreign
exchange earnings and over half of total employment. About 70% of the
population lives in rural areas, where nearly two-thirds of the households
depend on small farms for their main source of income. About 85% of the
2.35 million farms in the Philippines are smaller than 5 ha; the average
size is 3.6 ha, and rice farms average only 1.8 ha each. Between 50% and
60% of all farmer and farm-laborer households subsist below the absolute
poverty income level of US$195 per capita (in 1980 prices). Population
pressure has caused even the most marginal lands to be brought under culti-
vation, and most future increases in production must come from higher yields
and cropping intensities. Yet adverse price ratios retard the use of
yield-enhancing fertilizers and crop protection chemicals; supporting ser-
vices of research, extension, marketing and training are often inadequate;
formal credit is severely limited and informal credit expensive; and
insecure land tenure limits many farmers' willingness or ability to adopt
innovations in production techniques. Hence higher yields do not come
easily. Higher cropping intensities are also limited by existing crop
varieties, inadequate extension support, and inadequacy of water through
rainfall or irrigation. Rural social services are inadequate, nonagricul-
tural production activities are limited, agricultural productivity is low
and underemployment is high.
1.03      Although agriculture's share of GDP has been falling relative to
other sectors, food production rose during the 1970s at an average of 7%
p.a. This was facilitated by heavy government investments in high-yielding
crop varieties and technical packages coupled with extension and farm
credits and to a lesser extent irrigation. Most of these initiatives were



- 2 -
directed at rice and corn, which together account for about 36% of the value
of agricultural production, 57% of the area, and 70% of employment.
1.04      Rice is the primary staple of over 80% of the population, and
accounts for about 30% of total harvested area. The Masagana 99 program of
rice production support was instrumental in helping the country to achieve
rice self-sufficiency in 1977, and since then the Philippines has exported
small quantities of rice each year except 1981, when adverse weather and
lower prices limited production to about the level of consumption. Corn is
the primary staple of a sixth of the population and the main feed component
of the livestock industry. Recent progress in developing varieties resistant
to downy mildew offers the prospect that corn yields, now among the lowest in
Asia at under one ton per ha, might rise enough to reduce or even eliminate
the chronic need for corn imports, but this is only now being tested on a
commercial scale. Coconuts and sugarcane are the third and fourth most
important crops, both major foreign exchange earners whose profitability and
production depend on unstable and currently depressed world prices. A
combination of factors including relative prices, yields, soils and climate
has limited the use of the expanding irrigation infrastructure largely to
rice cultivation.
1.05      Government Objectives and Strategy.  The Government's current
(1978-82) five-year development plan sets general objectives of high growth,
greater resource mobilization, reduced income disparities and improved
environmental quality. All of these apply to rural sector development, but
specific goals most relevant to the agricultural sector are poverty reduc-
tion, continued food self-sufficiency and more diversified agricultural pro-
duction. These goals are closely interlinked, since policies aimed at
achieving one goal inevitably affect the others. Recognizing this, the
Government has chosen to place most of its agricultural sector investments in
infrastructure-building to support the broadest range of economic activities,
while launching specific programs to address particular problems. The
specific programs include land tenure reform, crop research, and a wide range
of crop production programs combining credit, input supply and/or technical
support. The infrastructure investments emphasize power, irrigation and
highways. The problem of poor and often deteriorating ratios between prices
of production inputs and farmgate prices of the major crops is a major con-
straint on the poverty reduction and agricultural production goals, and has
not yet been adequately addressed.  The Government s draft development plan
for 1983-87 states that performance during the current plan period has been
satisfactory, and sets the attainment of sustainable economic growth, equi-
table distribution of the fruits of development, and total human development
as the major national goals for the next plan period.
Irrigation Subsector Institutions
(a) National Irrigation Administration
1.06      Organization.  NIA, the central institution in irrigation
development, was established in 1963 as the successor organization to the



- 3 -
irrigation division of the Bureau of Public Works. NIA's mandate is a broad
one. It is responsible for the planning, development, construction, and
operation and maintenance (O&M) of nearly all irrigation works in the
Philippines. Specifically, NIA is to (a) investigate and study all water
resources for irrigation purposes; (b) construct, operate and maintain all
national irrigation systems; (c) construct, temporarily administer and
periodically repair communal and pump irrigation schemes; (d) collect water
charges; (e) construct multipurpose water resource projects; and (f)
construct drainage facilities in collaboration with the Ministry of Public
Works and Highways (MPWH). In the past NIA has largely concentrated on
construction of large new schemes and rehabilitation of existing ones, and
O&M have received relatively lesser support. For both technical and
financial reasons this historical concentration on large new capital works is
shifting largely to smaller works with increasing attention to rehabilitation
and O&M issues. The smaller works are largely located in the communal
irrigation subsector.
1.07      Although as a semiautonomous agency NIA has a large degree of oper-
ational freedom, it is attached to the MPWH for program and policy coordinat-
ion. NIA is governed by a Board of Directors appointed by the President. At
present Board members are the Minister of Public Works and Highways
(chairman), the Administrator of NIA (vice-chairman), the Director General of
the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the Minister of
Agriculture, the General Manager of the National Power Corporation and a
Secretary. The Board takes an active role in setting guidelines and
directions for the agency. The President appoints the Administrator and all
Assistant Administrators of NIA. Within the headquarters at Manila, NIA's
operations are divided among four Assistant Administrators: (a) Project
Development and Implementation; (b) Operations; (c) Finance and Management;
and (d) Personnel and Administrative Services. Most field activities are
under the supervision and control of Regional Irrigation Directors (RIDs).
(See Figure 1.1 for organization chart of NIA.)
1.08      NIA has a Regional Irrigation Office (RIO) in each of the 12 Regions
as well as PIOs in 72 provinces. (See Figure 1.2 for the organizational
structure of each Regional Office.) The identification, preparation and
appraisal of communal irrigation systems (CISs) is initially handled by the
PIOs. The RIOs review these proposals and assist in further preparation,
particularly on agricultural and economic aspects. The proposals are then
sent to the headquarters office where they are screened and annual
operational programs are established. Detailed engineering and economic
aspects are reviewed first by RIDs and then at headquarters by the Project
Development Department (PDD). The approved program is then carried out by the
PIOs.
1.09      Financial Situation.  At the end of 1980 NIA had total assets of
P 8.8 billion, the bulk of which (68%) represents civil works completed or
in process. Equity capital from the Government amounted to P 1.0 billion.
Total assets grew 27% over the previous year, although there is also an



-4-
element of overstatement as NIA's investments are carried at original cost.
NIA's current liabilities have been growing rapidly and at the end of 1980
amounted to f 2.2 billion. Government public works appropriations and
equity contributions are by far the largest sources of NIA's income, but
recent cutbacks have caused a constriction of liquidity which is slowing the
implementation of some large projects. Increased irrigation fee collection
(6% of total revenues in 1980) and reduced salary overheads (as completion of
some major projects has allowed staff reductions) have not been sufficient to
ease the tight liquidity.
1.10      Accounts.  As regards individual foreign-funded projects, NIA's
accounting procedures and staff are good. For the agency as a whole, how-
ever, there are problems with the present system. First, the number of
separately maintained accounts leads to errors. Second, NIA has some
difficulty in ensuring accountability of cash disbursement officers in the
field. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the financial records system
is too unwieldy to supply timely financial information to managers and to
provide at any one point in time a complete picture of all NIA financial
operations. Improving financial reporting and accounting for nonforeign-
funded opeations is a high priority for NIA's management, and steps have been
taken to strengthen reporting at the head office. In addition, a private
auditor has been engaged to review selected accounting subsystems. Much
remains to be done, however, to ensure development of a fully integrated
and responsive accounting system and to train requisite numbers of staff.
(b) Farm Systems Development Corporation (FSDC)
1.11      The FSDC, created in 1975, plays a minor role in the irrigation
subsector. It has responsibility for farm technology development and
extension, and entered the irrigation field largely through its work in
establishing small pump irrigation systems and irrigators' associations (IAs,
see para. 1.25). Until 1981 it had responsibility for organizing CIS farmers
into IAs under an agreement with NIA in which NIA undertook all engineering
tasks and FSDC all organizational tasks. This agreement also assigned FSDC
the task of collecting on NIA's behalf the capital costs of CISs from the
beneficiaries. In practice, there were many problems with this arrangement.
NIA's PIOs were inadequately equipped to carry out their engineering tasks;
FSDC's institutional organizers were too few, often inadequately trained in
problems of irrigation, and isolated from the PIOs. Farmers did not get
involved in the design and construction of irrigation systems; their
involvement only began when the completed systems were turned over to them.
Further, farmers' problems during O&M of the systems related mainly to
technical matters which FSDC's institutional organizers were not trained to
resolve. Disputes over design and costs have kept nearly half of the 350
CISs built in the last four years from being turned over to farmers. FSDC's
organizers made little or no progress in improving the capital repayment
record. In view of these problems, NIA and FSDC have agreed to phase out
their joint operations by 1984, after which NIA will take full responsibil-
ity - organizational and engineering - for all CISs of over 100 ha and also



- 5 -
for many smaller systems, amounting to about 80% of the communal irrigation
subsector; FSDC will assume responsibility for the small systems only,
mainly in pump irrigation, constituting not more than 20% of the CISs. NIA
has always had, and would continue to have, full responsibility for the
national irrigation systems.
Agricultural Support Services
1.12      Extension.  A number of institutions provide extension and other
forms of support to farmers in irrigated areas.  The Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) is responsible for the extension service, providing on the average one
agriculture and food technician (AFT) for every 104 farmers nationwide. The
Bank's National Extension Project (Loan 1626-PH) is strengthening this
service. Various credit institutions, rural banks, FSDC and the Ministry of
Agrarian Reform (MAR) also provide some technical support to farmers. NIA
itself trains water management technicians to help farmers use their irriga-
tion systems efficiently. The National Food and Agricultural Council (NFAC)
is responsible for coordinating the activities of all national agencies in
food production while local municipal action committees and IAs coordinate
at the level of individual irrigation systems. It is recognized that the
extension and other support services provided by various agencies need
better coordination, and that extension agents need broader training. AFTs
are often ill-trained to advise farmers on irrigated rice production tech-
niques, and water management technicians seldom receive much training in
agronomy; the two sometimes provide conflicting advice to irrigators. The
proposed project's training component addresses this need in relation to the
communal irrigation subsector.
1.13      Rice Research.  In addition to the central research facilities
provided by the College of Agriculture of the University of the Philippines
and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), both at Los Banos,
there are six rice experiment stations run by MOA and a number of
substations located all over the country. The main emphasis of the work on
rice in these stations is on varietal screening, foundation seed production
and certification, fertilizer trials and intensified land utilization through
multiple cropping. High yielding varieties (HYVs) of rice, better farm
management techniques and more appropriate farm machinery and tools are
continually being developed at these facilities. Irrigated rice yields at
these stations often exceed seven tons per ha per crop.
1.14      National agricultural research is coordinated and evaluated by the
Philippine Council for Agriculture and Resources Research which assists in
the formulation of relevant research programs and assists MOA in the
packaging of technology for promotion by the extension service. Likewise,
the National Nutrition Council, together with the concerned ministries and
such agencies as the National Media Production Center, the Nutrition Center
of the Philippines and the Food and Nutrition Research Institute are engaged
in drawing up nutrition technology packages suitable for national programs.

Agricultural Inputs
1.15      Seed.  At present the average seeding rate is about 80 kg/ha,
mainly because of poor germination, damage to seedlings during transplanting,
too many seedlings per hill, improper spacing, and anticipation of drought or
floods. Most of the seed is obtained by retention of on-farm production,
though it is not uncommon for farmers to purchase seed from registered
growers or from other farmers who grow the desired variety. In the future,
given an assured supply of high quality seed and irrigation water, it is
estimated that the average seeding rate will be about 50-60 kg/ha. No
difficulties are foreseen in the production and distribution of registered
seed. Most farmers are well informed about the new improved varieties and
their characteristics and readily purchase the output of registered seed
growers.
1.16      Fertilizers.  The 1980 national annual consumption of fertilizer
was about 820,000 tons, of which three fourths was imported. About half of
the imported fertilizer was urea. Application rates on rice farms vary from
50 kg/ha or less in some rainfed areas subject to flooding to 250-300 kg on
better farms with reliable irrigation.  Farmers often use the wrong
fertilizers or apply it at the wrong time, and tend to underrate the
importance of a proper basal dressing. Sometimes, however, farmers are
hesitant to apply the recommended amounts of inputs because of unassured
water supply and unattractive price ratios between palay and fertilizer.
The existing fertilizer distribution network is adequate and could easily be
expanded to meet increased demand.
1.17      Agrochemicals.  Agrochemicals are readily available in the
Philippines and are widely used in small to modest quantities. Surveys show
that most rainfed areas and almost all irrigated areas receive some
pesticide application but these average only half or less of the recommended
dosages. Consequently the applications are not always effective. Serious
outbreaks of insect pests and diseases are, however, not common. Farmers
are also well acquainted with herbicides, and about 50% of all rice farms
receive some herbicide application, often at a lower dosage than recommended.
Extensive rat damage has been reported for most irrigation systems at one
time or another over the past six years. A rodent control component is
included in the BPI-German Surveillance Program which, among other
activities, trains plant pest control officers. For the future, the
application rates of agrochemicals are not expected to increase dramatically,
mainly because of increasing prices of these petrochemical products.
1.18      Credit.  CIS farmers receive an estimated 35% of their seasonal
and investment credit from formal credit institutions; the remainder comes
from various informal sources. The major formal credit program affecting
CIS farmers is the Masagana 99 program launched in 1973 to boost rice
production by combining a noncollateralized supervised credit program with a
production input package. This input package combines HYVs, fertilizers,



- 7 -
biocides and technical advice on cultural practices. Masagana 99 credit is
extended through Philippine National Bank branches and the rural banks under
a rediscount arrangement with the Central Bank. Credit is for a term of
about six months at an annual interest rate of 12%. All supervised credit is
required to be insured to 100% of the value of the inputs. Repayment rates
have been low, and a problem now facing many Masagana 99 beneficiaries is
that, having defaulted on past Masagana 99 loans, they no longer qualify for
credit on such attractive terms. Many rural banks, victims of widespread
loan defaults have become ineligible to participate in the supervised credit
programs, and are therefore precluded from access to the Central Bank's
rediscount facilities. The Government has recently reviewed the arrears
problem and has taken steps which will result in the requalification of a
number of rural banks, and hence a corresponding increase in credit availa-
bility. Loan defaults under Masagana 99 are also being rescheduled under
some circumstances to allow a larger number of borrowers to participate.
Irrigation Development in the Philippines
1.19      Farmer associations were building, operating and maintaining irri-
gation systems in the Philippines before the Spanish era. Many of these
systems are still in operation, as are about 180,000 ha of similar systems
constructed in the Spanish times. Under American rule, the area covered by
these simple systems is estimated to have doubled. Establishment of irriga-
tion systems remained largely a local voluntary affair until the mid-twen-
tieth century. The first government-financed irrigation project was comple-
ted in 1923. By 1940, ten such irrigation systems covering 80,000 ha had
been completed. By 1981, irrigated area totaled over 1.2 million ha out of
about 3.5 million ha judged suitable for irrigation. The country's projects
can be classified in three groups: national systems, communal systems and
pump systems.
1.20      National irrigation systems are constructed, operated and main-
tained by the Government through NIA (see paras. 1.06-1.10). Irrigators
within the systems are expected to pay water fees sufficient to cover O&M,
insurance and capital costs. These systems range in size from less than 200
to 78,000 ha, and average about 3,300 ha. Much of the post-independence
national systems were financed with foreign assistance, including that of the
Bank. Actual irrigated area under the existing 144 national systems now
totals about 470,000 ha. Foreign-assisted national irrigation projects now
under construction are expected to add about 300,000 ha of new area to the
total of national irrigation systems by the end of 1985, while foreign-
assisted rehabilitation efforts should improve the operation of a further
220,000 ha in existing systems.
1.21      Communal irrigation systems are the type constructed in the
Philippines in the pre-colonial and Spanish periods. Unlike national
systems, they may be built with or without government assistance. An
association of irrigators rather than a government agency owns, operates and
maintains the facilities of most systems. When Government assistance is



-8-
involved in construction, IAs are expected to pay fees to cover capital
costs, excluding the costs of roads and NIA's engineering and overhead costs.
With the rising cost of investment, farmers are increasingly seeking
government assistance to improve their systems as well as to construct new
ones. Government assistance to communals rose very rapidly from about
30 systems in the late 1950s to over 900 systems in the late 1970s. At
present, the communal irrigation development program has a budget
appropriation of about P 150 million per year. Table 1.1 shows the growth
of government assistance to communals. This assistance, mainly in design,
construction and financing, was carried out with little local consultation or
local contribution. Hence farmers were often reluctant to identify with the
systems, and felt that the works were poorly adapted to local conditions and
also that system maintenance was the Government's responsibility and not
their own.

/a  Includes new as well as rehabilitation
schemes.
1.22      Pump irrigation systems are nearly all privately-owned and opera-
ted. Most of these draw water by diesel, gasoline or electric pumps from
rivers or lakes and a few tap groundwater resources. The Irrigation Service
Unit of NIA is responsible for the construction and supervision of pump
schemes. About 190,000 ha are presently irrigated by pump systems. The high
cost of fuel or electricity to operate the pumps reduces their financial
attractiveness and constrains the further growth of pump irrigation. NIA is
gradually phasing out its pump irrigation program.
Communal Irrigation Subsector
1.23      Economic and Physical Aspects.  The roughly 5,700 CISs account for
about 45% (550,000 ha) of total irrigated area and 38% of irrigated rice
production. A 1980 survey indicates that nearly 85% of CIS service area is



- 9 -
irrigated (systems seldom being managed and maintained well enough to achieve
100%); virtually all of it is devoted to rice. About 13% of CIS farm area is
devoted to coconuts, corn, sugarcane and vegetables. CISs comprise about
390,000 farm households with nearly 2.4 million people. They range in size
from a few hectares to over 4,000 ha, but average slightly under 100 ha each,
with half under 50 ha and over 70% smaller than 100 ha. Over one third of
the systems, covering less than 20% of the total area, are in Region 1
(Northwestern Luzon), although they can be found in nearly all of the 73
provinces, along small rivers and tributaries of larger rivers as they flow
out of the foothills into the river basins. The modest water supply and
moderate topography in these areas have enabled local farmers to achieve
limited water control with very simple temporary diversion structures often
built of rocks or brush. Yields are generally low, about 2.8 tons per ha per
crop of irrigated rice.
1.24      CIS Farmers.  The farmers within CISs operate small farms, averag-
ing 1.4 ha each. Farms are smallest in Region 1 (Northwestern Luzon - less
than 0.9 ha) and largest in Region 11 (Southeastern Mindanao - about 1.8 ha).
Farm households have an average of six members. With such small farms and
low yields, farm income is low, and farm families earn about half of their
total income from off-farm sources (nonfarm labor or labor on neighboring
farms). Even with this supplementary income, the average per capita income
of CIS households is estimated to be US$150-190 p.a., below the absolute
poverty level. Contributing to their hardships is the fact that half the CIS
farmers do not own their lands, but operate as share tenants (about 30%) or
leaseholders (about 20%). Just under 50% are owners, ranging from 74% in
Region 1 to 30% in most other regions.
1.25      Organizational Aspects.  Communal irrigation systems vary widely
in the way they are managed. Smaller systems tend to depend on informal
leadership by village leaders or large landowners. These leaders call on
irrigators to perform needed maintenance and may reprimand violators of the
tacit water distribution rules. Management structure becomes more formal
as system size increases. Over 90% of systems over 100 ha have IAs. 70%
have people responsible for water distribution, 50% have paid personnel
to operate control structures, perform maintenance and carry out
administrative duties, and 40% have regular maintenance schedules and
irrigation fees. Less than 25% of systems under 50 ha have any of these
characteristics. A typical IA is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), and has an elected board of directors and a roster of
officers, and has monthly meetings of members. In most cases, canals and
farm ditches are cleaned, desilted, reshaped, repaired or cleared at least
once per year, and usually twice per year. Most farmer-members contribute
free labor and materials for system maintenance.
1.26      At present, irrigation service fees are collected by slightly less
than half of all IAs. Fee collection arrangements are more common among
NIA-assisted systems and systems in Mindanao and Southern Luzon. Most IAs



- 10 -
collect fees in kind based on area irrigated.   Fees range from 0.5 to 4.5
cavans of palay per ha per year, with a mode of about 2 cavans. About 80% of
the members pay at least part of their dues. Delinquent farmers are three
times as common among NIA-assisted systems as among non-NIA systems. This
may be because NIA-irrigator consultations were inadequate during design and
construction, leading irrigators to the conclusion that their CIS is really
the Government's responsibility. It may also be connected with the fact
that fee collection is more common in NIA-assisted CISs. Delinquent
farmers in general report that they receive poor water service, get water
from elsewhere, have crop failures or financial problems, or simply are
never billed.
Future Development of the Communal Irrigation System
1.27.     Potential.  NIA is placing increasing emphasis on the development
of communal systems. These can be completed in as little as one year and
give immediate benefits, and their future operating burden on NIA is far
lower than that of national systems because O&M is largely performed by IAs.
A preliminary NIA planning document envisages about 500,000 ha of communal
irrigation development during the decade 1981-90; however, funding limita-
tions and higher design standards could limit the area to under 250,000 ha.
Additionally, small national systems covering an area of about 25,000 ha are
planned for conversion to communal systems.
1.28      Problems.  General agricultural sector problems such as adverse
price ratios, inadequate support services, insecure land tenure and
infrastructural inadequacies were noted in para. 1.02. Three other problems
more specific to CISs must be resolved if the subsector is to be developed as
envisioned:
(a)  Institutional Support.  The PIOs of NIA are ill-equipped to carry
out the type and scale of communal irrigation programs assigned to
them. Training of PIO staff in organizational aspects of communal
irrigation development is crucial, as is the provision of equipment.
(b)  Irrigation Association Development.  In the past, most NIA-
assisted systems were constructed with little or no effort to pre-
pare the IAs which were expected to operate and maintain them.
This has resulted in poor water distribution, water use conflicts
and unsatisfactory conflict resolution, unfulfilled farmer
expectations, poor maintenance, and low capital cost repayment.
These problems are serious also on many non-NIA-assisted systems.
Careful organization and training efforts are necessary to build
strong IAs which can make the best use of available physical
facilities.
(c) Engineering Design. Most CISs depend on diversion weirs of
rocks or brush which cannot withstand floods. Frequent



- 11 -
rebuilding of these weirs is a major drain on labor which
might be better employed in other tasks. Most systems also
fail to divert as much water as farmers need to maximize
cropping intensities, allow further losses through unnecessary
seepage and poor design of distribution systems, and lack control
structures and roads for maintenance. NIA-assisted CIS works are
of a far superior design, and generally eliminate the drawbacks of
traditional designs.
The Participatory Approach to Development of Communal Systems
1.29      In order to deal with the above constraints, and at the same time
realize the full potential of CISs, NIA has developed a new participatory
approach to the planning, design, construction, and operation and maintenance
of CISs. Under this concept the active collaboration among irrigation
officials and farmers organized in IAs is an essential feature of some
existing and all future CISs in the Philippines. The need for a new or
improved irrigation system is the unifying element, and the strategy is to
ensure full participation by officials and farmers from initial planning
through construction, operation and maintenance. The technical goal is to
construct properly designed physical systems; the institutional goal is to
improve the capability of farmers to organize and sustain their association,
improve their farm practices, and assume responsibiity and a sense of
ownership of their system.
1.30      The organization of the IAs is built from the base upwards, rather
than the conventional procedures of centralized, top-down design,
construction and operation of most irrigation systems. The observed
weaknesses of that conventional approach prompted NIA in 1976 to launch a
special experimental communal project with Ford Foundation assistance to test
new methods to integrate institutional and technical development by having
farmers participate actively with NIA officials in both of these functions
from the earlier stages of design through construction to operation. The
encouraging results of this experimental project prompted NIA and the Ford
Foundation to extend the program to 2 additional pilot projects in 1979, to
12 more in 1980, and to 24 more in 1981.
1.31      The participatory approach benefits NIA, its PIOs and the irri-
gators. It enables NIA to reduce per hectare construction costs, transfer
virtually all O&M costs to IAs, and improve the rate of cost recovery from
the IAs. It enables the PIO to construct or rehabilitate more hectares of
communal irrigation on a constant budget by shifting more costs to the
direct beneficiaries.  Finally it enables the farmers to get permanent
well-designed and well-located systems requiring minimal maintenance and
rehabilitation costs, achieve better responsiveness in their dealings with
officials, and acquire their own modern systems. The result is a
better-operated and -maintained set of systems, which ultimately means
higher and more stable incomes for the farmers.



- 12 -
1.32      The participatory approach includes activities, both institutional
and technical, for farmers at every stage of the project process. In the
identification phase, the farmers organize themselves into an IA and request
NIA assistance. In the design phase, they formulate by-laws, register their
IA, obtain a water permit, establish IA committees as needed, conduct a man-
power survey of IA members in preparation for construction, work with tech-
nical staff on land surveys and negotiate over each version of the technical
design, secure rights of way, and sign a pre-construction memo of agreement
with NIA on the estimated cost of the proposed communal system. In the
construction phase, they contribute labor, monitor construction materials,
equipment, and costs, reconcile construction costs with NIA records, attend
various training seminars, accept the completed system, and sign the loan
with NIA. In the O&M phase, they take over full control of their system and
continue attending training courses for water management, and financial
control. The participatory approach thus combines the benefits of local
initiative and self-reliance of the old indigenous communal systems with the
benefits of modern technical design and construction. The historical context
and details of the participatory approach to the implementation of CISs are
available in the project file.
Experience with Past Lending
1.33      NIA has extensive experience in the planning, design and construc-
tion of irrigation projects.  Sixteen projects have received Bank assistance,
while thirteen others were assisted by the Asian Development Bank. Other
main agencies involved in irrigation development include the United States
Agency for International Development and Japan's Overseas Economic Coopera-
tion Fund. NIA has established itself as a well managed and technically
competent organization. Of the sixteen Bank-assisted projects, one was for
watershed management and erosion control, and three for rural development.
The remaining twelve Bank loans were mostly for large national irrigation
projects providing irrigation and drainage facilities for new as well as
rehabilitation areas, better road systems for efficiency of system operation
and for marketing of farm products, and support services to assist farmers in
adopting the new irrigation techniques needed to increase production.
Implementation progress has been generally satisfactory on most projects.
Some projects have experienced delays because of local funding constraints,
design changes, contractor problems, or local order problems. Two projects
have been completed. The first Bank-assisted project, Upper Pampanga River
Irrigation Project (Loan 637-PH), was completed in December 1977. The
Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR), prepared by the Bank's Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) in June 1980, found that the dam was completed 10
months ahead of schedule, despite changes in design. However, there were
delays of up to 30 months in construction of the irrigation facilities due to
procurement problems, poor performance of contractors, and interruptions of
work to allow for delivery of irrigation water to farmers. The cost overrun-
was 105%, of which about 80% was due to inflation during the implementation
period. While dry season cropping rose rapidly from less than 10,000 ha in
1974 to 55,000 ha in 1976 as a result of the project, the appraisal estimate
of increase in annual cropping intensity proved overoptimistic. However, the
paddy yields achieved in the project were higher than expected. The PPAR
computed the revised economic rate of return of the project at 14% compared



- 13 -
to 13% estimated at appraisal. The PPAR concluded that NIA's current excell-
ent project preparation and farmer support capabilities were developed and
nurtured within the organization which was created for the Upper Pampanga
Project. The second project, Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation Project (Loan/Credit
984/472-PH), was completed in December 1981 and preparation of the Completion
Report is underway. While work on the two dams and the transbasin canal was
completed about one year ahead of schedule, difficulties in awarding con-
struction contracts delayed the start of improvement works in the service
areas which were further hampered by severe typhoon damages in 1978 and 1980.
1.34      Bank assistance to communal irrigation development began in 1975
with the Mindoro Rural Development Project (Loan 1102-PH), which included a
small communal irrigation component of about 3,000 ha in conjunction with the
development of about 12,000 ha ot national irrigation systems. These irriga-
tion systems were completed about two years behind the appraisal schedule,
mainly due to design changes and difficulties in right of way acquisition and
shortages of construction materials and supplies. Under the Rural Infra-
structure Project (Credit 790-PH), about 9,400 ha of CISs in six provinces
were included which were subsequently expanded to 10,400 ha. Implementation
progress is satisfactory in four provinces but is behind schedule in two pro-
vinces. Delays are due to inadequate or late release of local funds,
unusually severe weather, late design finalization for diversion weirs, and
FSDC's ineffectiveness in organizing the farmers. The project is expected to
be completed in 1983, one year behind the appraisal schedule.  About 2,000 ha
of CISs form part of the Samar Rural Development Project (Loan 1772-PH).
Construction progress of one of the new subprojects is satisfactory, while
the second was abandoned due to strong protests by the concerned farmers
as they were not satisfied with the selection and preparation of the
subproject which had been done without adequate prior consultation with them.
Substitute subprojects are under investigation and evaluation. Rehabilitation
ot the 23 existing CISs and improvement of buildings is progressing
satisfactorily with 20 systems completed, one system under way, one system
deferred and one system deleted.
1.35      The Philippines Agricultural Sector Operations Review by OED
(Report No. 3796 dated February 10, 1982) concluded that while irrigation
associations in the large national schemes have posed problems, communal
associations have been relatively more successful. As communal schemes
ultimately become the property of the associations, construction or rehab-
ilitation is usually carried out using their ideas and suggestions. They are
especially successful where local farmers have actively participated in the
design and siting of structures and canals.
2. THE PROJECT AREA
2.01      The project would involve institutional strengthening in 67 provin-
ces in eleven of the Philippines' twelve regions, and construction or reha-
bilitation of 144 communal irrigation subprojects covering about 33,500 ha



- 14 -
in 35 provinces of 11 regions. A summary of areas by region and province
where irrigation facilities would be provided or upgraded is shown in
Table 2.1.
Natural Conditions
2.02      Climate.  In general the climate in the Philippines is wet tropical
with average temperatures around 270 C throughout the year in the whole
country, allowing a twelve-month growing season with irrigation. The Philip-
pines lie under the influence of the monsoons and in the path of tropical
typhoons. The generally north-south alignment of mountain ranges leads to
wide variations among regions in annual rainfall and its seasonal distribu-
tion. Four main types of climate can, however, be distinguished. Type A and
Type B climates are similar in that they both have annual rainfall of
1,500-2,000 mm and well defined dry seasons, although Type A has a more
pronounced seven-month dry season beginning in October whereas Type B has a
five-month dry season starting in December. The Type C climate has annual
rainfall of 2,500-4,200 mm. Rainfall is heavy from October through March,
and at its maximum from November to January. There is effectively no dry
season since monthly rainfall between April and September is generally about
200 mm. In the Type D climate, annual rainfall of 2,000-3,500 mm is more or
less evenly distributed over most of the year, with the wettest period from
April to December, but rainfall is not as intense as in Type C; the dry
season is short from January through March or April. The rainfall is gener-
ally adequate in the country for a single rice crop in the wet season except
in the southern part of Mindanao, although provision of irrigation would
reduce risk and improve yields. Dry-season cropping entails, however, a
greater risk, and irrigation is essential to ensure a crop. Typhoon frequen-
cies generally increase from south to north with the largest incidence in
Northern Luzon (averaging about seven a year in the 1948-77 period). Only
Southern and Central Mindanao are relatively free from typhoons. Annex 1
gives details of climatic conditions for each of the Philippines 12 regions.
2.03      Topography.  The Philippines has complex physiographic patterns.
The entire country rests on a series of stress lines along which numerous
faulting, folding and volcanic activities have taken place. The extensive
earth movements have resulted in numerous mountain ranges which divide the
islands into small watersheds with short and usually rapidly flowing rivers
and isolated alluvial plains. The project areas are located along small
rivers and tributaries of larger rivers as they flow out of the foothills
into the river basins.
2.04      Soils.  The dominant soil types are relatively young silty clay
loams, clay loams and sandy clays.  These soils are mostly derived from
basalt andesites, volcanic rocks and tuffs, and limestones under intense and
rapid natural weathering caused by high temperature, heavy rainfall and
limited forest coverage. Most of the irrigable soils are in plains and
valleys with deep alluvial deposits. Where volcanoes are present, as in

Bicol and Southern Mindanao, volcanic ash or tuff material is mixed with
these deposits. The soils in the lowlands are usually heavy textured and
well-suited for paddy production. On higher ground, soils are generally
deep and loamy, with moderate to good internal drainage. There are no real
problem soils in the Philippines, except for small spots of saline soils in
Mindanao.
Socioeconomic Conditions
2.05      Population.  In 1980, when the population totalled 47.9 million,
the population growth rate nationwide was about 2.4%, down from the average
of 2.7% during the 1970s. However, population pressure on land is severe,
and relatively little unexploited cultivable land remains. The project
beneficiaries, an estimated 144,000 people in 24,000 families, would
represent a cross section of the ethnic groups of the Philippines and the
rural poor. A survey in 1980 of sample communal systems reported an average
annual household income of P 7,140, a per capita income of P 1,190 or 80%
of the rural poverty income level in 1980 prices.
2.06      Farm Size and Land Tenure.  Philippine agriculture is characterized
by the predominance of small farms (70% are smaller than 3 ha) and the per-
vasiveness of tenancy, particularly among rice and corn farmers. The average
farm holding in communal systems ranges from 0.9 ha in Regions I and II to
1.8 ha in Mindanao, with a national mean of 1.4 ha. In national irrigation
systems the range is much wider and the national mean 70% larger. Average
farm sizes by region are shown in Table 2.2. According to a detailed tech-
nical and economic survey of 25 communal systems proposed for financing under
the project, the average size farm was 1.6 ha, ranging from about 0.4 ha to
3.1 ha. About 54% of the farms in these systems range from 1.0 to 2.5 ha,
and 29% are less than 1.0 ha. About 50% of the total area of the 25 sample
systems consists of farms of 1.0-2.5 ha, 22% of 2.6-4.0 ha, 20% over 4.0 ha
and about 8% less than 1.0 ha.

National Average              2.37                          1.39
2.07      About 50% of all farmers cultivate their own land, almost 30% are
share tenants, paying an agreed percentage of their harvest; and the rest
either rent extra land for their own use (11%) or are partowners (about 9%).
In the 25 sample communal systems included in the project, about 46% are
owner-operators, 25% are share tenants, 18% are lease holders (paying a fixed
rent), and 11% are part-owners. The Government has pursued a program of
agrarian reform aimed at the transfer of land ownership to tenant farmers on
rice and corn lands since 1972, when the country's one million tenanted rice
and corn farms covering some 1.5 million ha were declared land reform areas.
The Land Reform Program is being implemented in two ways: "Operation Land
Transfer," begun in 1972, applicable to all landowners who have more than
7 ha, whereby the tenants become owner-cultivators of rice and corn land in
excess of 7 ha undertaking to pay for the land over a period of 15 years; and
the Leasehold Enforcement Program for all farms up to 7 ha whereby the tenant
receives security of tenure on the land being cultivated. Overall by October
1981, Certificates of Land Transfer had been issued to 416,000 tenants farming
645,000 ha, or about 88% of the area originally targetted for transfer.
Leasehold contracts had been given to 550,000 tenants farming 615,000 ha, or
64% of the originally targetted area.

Existing Infrastructure
2.08      The 35 provinces in which construction and rehabilitation under the
project are planned include over 13,000 existing irrigation systems with a
service area of about 744,000 ha, or about 61% of the total irrigated area in
the country. By category, 68 are national systems irrigating about 289,000
ha, over 3,500 are communal gravity systems covering about 360,000 ha, and
nearly 9,600 are small pump systems serving about 95,000 ha. The actual
irrigated area in 1980 in the various regions of the country as a percentage
of the technically potential irrigable area ranges from about 16% in Region X
(Southern Mindanao) to about 60% in Region I (Ilocos).
2.09      The network of roads over most of the project area is sparse,
averaging about 0.4 km per 100 ha. Road structures vary from paved national
and provincial highways to gravel surfaced and unsurfaced barangay and
private roads. Nationally about 80% of the freight and 60% of the passenger
traffic move by road. Interisland traffic is largely by small vessels and to
a limited extent by airplane. The Government and private sectors are cooper-
ating in the development of port facilities. Postal and telecommunications
services are available at major provincial cities and towns. Most of the
communication facilities are still generally inadequate. Domestic water
supply is also inadequate, although some of the areas included in the
proposed project are provided with piped water systems. Most barangay
families get their water supply from shallow wells.
3. PROJECT FORMULATION
NIA Program
3.01      NIA's management recognizes that budgetary constraints and decreas-
ing opportunities and need for large national projects will gradually change
NIA's role. Inevitably, NIA's operations must shift from large new construc-
tion toward the operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of existing sys-
tems. Many of the remaining opportunities for new construction would tend to
be smaller in scale, and well suited for communal system development. This
suggests that future NIA programs will rely heavily on the PIOs. The PIOs
are responsible for O&M and some rehabilitation of completed national sys-
tems, and for the construction and rehabilitation of communal systems. As
national projects now under implementation are completed, as the communal
irrigation subsector expands, and as all systems age and begin to require
rehabilitation, the demands on PIOs will grow. However, while the NIA cen-
tral office, the RIOs, and the offices of project managers managing large
foreign-assisted irrigation projects are well-equipped and competent organi-
zations, the PIOs, who have not yet had the advantage of participating in
foreign-assisted projects, are deficient in staff, buildings and equipment to
carry out their tasks. The cornerstone of NIA's future program is,



- 19 -
therefore, the strengthening of its PIOs. A concomitant element of the
program is increased relative emphasis on communal irrigation development.
And the most successful method of implementing communal irrigation projects
has been found to be the participatory approach described in Chapter 1. The
components of the proposed project reflect these conclusions.
3.02      In consultation with the Bank and IFAD, NIA prepared a proposal for
Bank and IFAD assistance in financing the strengthening of its PIOs and the
construction of a portion of its communal irrigation development program.
The proposal was designed to be an integral part of NIA's overall irrigation
development program, and to address directly the three specific CIS problems
identified in para. 1.28.
Major Components
3.03      The most important element of NIA's program, PIO strengthening,
became the central element of the proposed project. Strengthening of PIOs
involves training of staff and providing buildings and equipment. The
specific support for each PIO was determined on the basis of its present
resources and its potential role in communal subsector work. These were
determined in a collaborative preparation effort by the PIOs, the RIDs, and
the PDD, Equipment Management Department and Farmers' Assistance Department
of NIA's headquarters. Sixty-seven PIOs were selected for strengthening;
the other five PIOs are already being strengthened under other projects.
3.04      The preparation of the communal irrigation construction component
followed similar lines. PIOs identified subprojects on the basis of present
problems which could be addressed by irrigation works (low yields, low
cropping intensity and poor land drainage), and potential for irrigation
development (available water resources, extent of arable lands, potential
irrigable area and possible alternative developments). PIOs are well suited
to the task of identifying subprojects because they have grassroots contacts
with the farming community and first-hand knowledge of the relative needs and
potential of areas within their jurisdiction. Subproject proposals were
reviewed by the RIDs, then forwarded to the NIA headquarters for final selec-
tion. This is the normal procedure for approval of communal subprojects,
and the PIOs identified a large number of subprojects for possible Bank
financing. The list of 144 subprojects covering 33,500 ha, picked up for
inclusion in the project, is indicative of the type and quality of subpro-
jects to be financed. Specific subprojects included for Bank financing may
change if unforeseen problems arise with some, while a few subprojects not
currently included may qualify for inclusion in the project. Thirty-three
sample subprojects, prepared by NIA in sufficient detail, were appraised by
the Bank mission, and the financial and economic viability of the construc-
tion component extrapolated from the sample results. This procedure is
justifiable since the sample size is large, and the sample subprojects are
fairly representative; the complete list of subprojects to be financed is not



- 20 -
firmly determined, but NIA will subject it to the same criteria stipulated
for the 33 subprojects noted above.
3.05      The innovative aspect of communal system financing in the proposed
project was the decision that all subprojects would be prepared under the
participatory approach described in paras. 1.29-1.32. As noted, this approach
has been tested on about 40 subprojects, and found to strengthen the IAs.
While the participatory approach itself is no longer innovative, its use in a
Bank-assisted irrigation project in the country is. NIA was attracted to the
approach after seeing many of its engineering efforts wasted because IAs were
not prepared to operate and maintain communal systems properly. The partici-
patory approach to be pursued under the project proceeds within the same
institutional structure as is used in existing systems, but relies on improv-
ing its operations. The only organizational changes have been the establish-
ment of an advisory Communal Irrigation Committee under NIA's Assistant
Administrator for Operations to set policies and goals and to monitor parti-
cipatory developments, and the fielding of community organizers (COs) at the
village level to work with farmers to build strong IAs in preparation for
taking full responsibility for their part in designing, constructing and
operating their own communal system. The participatory approach depends on
farmers organizing themselves to play an active role in developing their
communal system, and on PIO officials accepting farmers as partners in this
development. The training of officials and farmers in joint, consultative
planning was from the beginning recognized as a prerequisite to the success
of the new approach.
Other Components
3.06      NIA already has a training program but it is not large enough to
meet all the needs of the communal subsector. Under the project, the ongoing
training program would be expanded to include not only all PIO staff, but also
farmers, NIA regional staff and technicians from the Ministry of Agriculture.
The Asian Institute of Management and the Institute of Philippine Culture
assisted in the design of the training component. To test the effectiveness
of the participatory approach and the subproject design standards, a monitor-
ing and evaluation component was also included in the project. It would be
much simpler and more specific than similar components in past Bank-assisted
irrigation projects in the Philippines, using only a sample of project and
nonproject systems, and aimed at measuring differences in net benefits to
irrigators on communal systems of varying types. Finally, the Bank appraisal
team suggested, and NIA agreed, to include in the proposed project a study to
prepare the way for an integrated financial management and reporting system
(see para. 1.10).
3.07      Funds for detailed engineering studies for two multipurpose pro-
jects (Lower Agno and Jalaur II) were included in NIA-s project preparation.
Feasibility level studies for these two projects have been completed recently
with Bank assistance. NIA had proposed, and the appraisal mission had



- 21 -
agreed, to include financing for the second phase of the studies in the
proposed project. Subsequent to the appraisal, however, it was concluded
that these studies may be financed from the unutilized funds available under
the Second National Irrigation Systems Improvement Project (Loan 1526-PH) and
the Jalaur Irrigation Project (Loan 1367-PH). At negotiations the Bank would
review justification, funding needs and sources for these studies. If they
are to be included in the proposed project, total project cost would rise by
about US$2.0 million.
3.08      In sum, a large share of the Philippines infrastructure development
budget has been invested in irrigation, many future irrigation projects are
planned, and further investments must be made to ensure that the full
potential of past and future projects is realized. The inevitable shift in
NIA's activities from new construction toward operation, maintenance and
rehabilitation, and the expected shift from national to communal system
development, creates a need for strong PIOs. The growing emphasis on
communal irrigation development calls for more effective communal system
institutions and better training of those involved in communal irrigation to
ensure proper design, construction, and O&M of the new system. Efforts to
improve communal system development need to be monitored and their
effectiveness evaluated. Finally, the management of NIA must have easy
access to accurate and complete financial information in order to plan and
implement the entire irrigation development program efficiently. The
proposed project was formulated to meet these needs.
4. THE PROJECT
project Objectives
4.01      The project would have the following objectives:
(a)  supporting a national program under which farmers would effectively
participate in planning and construction of CISs and, after
completion, would assume full control of the O&M of the systems;
(b)  strengthening the ability of PIO's to select, design and implement
efficient CISs, and to maintain and operate small national
systems. The project would also enhance NIAs capability to
support IAs in the repair of CISs in case of exceptional
damage to the systems by typhoons, etc.;
(c)  increasing the incomes of about 12,000 farm families currently
growing rainfed crops by providing irrigation and support services
to produce rice, and improving the incomes of another 12,000
families by rehabilitating and upgrading their present run-down
CISs; and



- 22 -
(d)  development of NIA's capability to undertake the selection of CIS
subprojects according to criteria agreed with the Bank (para. 4.15),
and to determine the phasing of their implementation. In this
respect, the project places substantial responsibility on NIA to
plan and execute nationwide CIS investments in the coming years,
with regard to both new projects as well as the rehabilitation
of existing projects.
Project Description
4.02      Over a period of five years, the project would:
(a)  strengthen 67 PIOs through provision for:  (i) construction and
improvement of office buildings and workshops; (ii) equipment
and vehicles for construction, improvement, and O&M of irrigation
facilities; (iii) equipment for offices and workshops; and (iv)
instruments for topographic surveying and hydrological
observations;
(b)  support training of about 2,600 COs and technical staff of PIOs,
MOA extension staff, and farmer leaders from about 1,900 IAs;
(c)  provide for the construction of about 94 new communal irrigation
subprojects on about 22,800 ha, and for the rehabilitation and
extension of about 50 communal irrigation subprojects covering
about 10,700 ha;
(d)  establish a system for monitoring the implementation, and
evaluating the impact, of the project; and
(e)  finance a study to improve NIA's internal financial reporting
system.
Detailed Project Features
4.03      Strengthening of Provincial Irrigation Offices.  Under the project,
the PIOs would be directly involved in, and be principally responsible for,
the organization of IAs and the application of the participatory approach
in the planning, design, and construction of CISs. In order to remove
constraints which are inhibiting the efficient performance of PIOs and also
to enable them to handle a considerable increase in their responsibilities,
the project would include: construction of 23 new office buildings and work-
shops; rehabilitation of 36 existing office buildings and workshops; and
provision of office and workshop equipment, and instruments for topographic
surveying and hydrologic observations. The project would also provide
equipment, machinery and vehicles for the construction of minor and
scattered works under force account and for O&M activities.



- 23 -
4.04      The 67 PIOs to be strengthened are in eleven regions.  The follow-
ing criteria were used to determine the appropriate level of investments:
(a) Office buildings would be similar in all provinces. These
would have a floor area of about 200 sq m and workshops of about
100 sq m; plot areas would be about 1,000 sq m.
(b) Requirements of equipment for offices and workshops, instruments
for topographic surveys, mapping and hydrologic observations, and
construction machinery and vehicles have been based on a classi-
fication of each province. For this purpose the provinces were
graded by giving numerical weights to: (i) estimated annual poten-
tial area for planning and investigation, (ii) average annual
construction program of communal irrigation development, (iii) the
O&M support to the existing CISs (pump and gravity), and (iv) the
O&M requirements of the existing small national irrigation sys-
tems. Level I would represent the basic operating office.
Requirements of office, survey, hydrological, and construction
equipment and vehicles would progressively increase to Level V.
4.05      The basic facilities to be provided in PIOs of differrent classifi-
cation levels are summarized in Table 4.1. The classification level of each
of the 67 provinces is given in Annex 2, Table 1. Total equipment require-
ments for the project are listed in Annex 2, Tables 2 and 3. Incremental
technical staffing requirements for each PIO would be one planning engineer,
one construction foreman, one mechanic, on instrument man, one survey aide,
one accounting clerk and one driver. Additional COs would be appointed in
each PIO on the basis given in para. 6.04. Most of the incremental technical
staff is available within NIA as some of the ongoing projects are nearing
completion. Recruitment of the remaining staff is expected to be completed
by end of July 1982. Recruitment of 46 COs for the project was completed in
February 1982; they are undergoing training prior to their assignment to the
field.

4.06      Training.  The project would support expansion of a program ini-
tiated with assistance from the Ford Foundation to train officials and
farmers to work together effectively to develop CISs. Training provided to
PIO staff would also enhance their ability to operate and maintain small
national systems. The program would extend to all provinces of the country,
reaching some 2,600 NIA and MOA staff and some 1,900 IAs during the next
five years. Training would be provided to a wide variety of staff including
RIO and PIO economists and engineers, monitoring and evaluation teams, COs,
MOA extension workers, technicians, construction workers and equipment
operators. They would receive broad based training in their own functions
and would become familiar with the functions of others with whom they must
collaborate.
4.07      COs would get training in three modules of about two weeks each.
The first module would be given immediately after hiring. It would include:
orientation to NIA, particularly communal irrigation development using the
participatory approach, subproject profile writing, integrating with the
farming community, mobilizing farmers and assisting them in organizing them-
selves, and matters related to subproject design. The second module would be
given about two months before the start of construction. It would include:
the technical and institutional process during the construction phase,
coordinating IA organizational work with construction work, recording
construction costs, organizing farmers counterpart participation, financial
management for farmers, and cost reconciliation. The third module would be



- 25 -
given about six months after the start of construction. It would include:
assistance to farmers in O&M, water management, conflict resolution, fee
collection, crop production, and communal monitoring procedures.
4.08      The technical staff of PIOs would receive training in three
modules of about two weeks each at times appropriate to their working needs.
It would include feasibility studies and project planning, the institutional
process during the planning, design and construction phases, project program-
ming and budgeting, and design of irrigation structures, canals and on-farm
facilities, organizing and staffing, construction cost recording, project
accounting, performance measures, potential problem analysis, assistance to
IAs in the O&M phase, water management, communal system monitoring
procedures, and follow-up activities with IAs.
4.09      Planning Engineers and CO supervisors of RIOs would be trained
together in the review and assessment of socio-technical project profiles.
They would also receive two weeks of training for trainers, with subsequent
brief refresher courses. The training of irrigation technicians would be
basically similar to that of CO supervisors, with additional emphasis on
assisting farmers during the O&M phase in water management and crop produc-
tion. To improve coordination they would receive water management and crop
production training together with farm management technicians of MOA. Design
engineers working on communal irrigation systems would further their skills
through training with NIA engineers who have been trained abroad under the
NISIP II project (Loan 1526-PH). Field engineers and construction foremen
would receive an orientation on the participatory approach lasting about a
week. This would be followed by a planning workshop held jointly with
construction staff, COs and IA leaders before starting construction of any
communal system. The NIA central office monitoring and evaluation super-
visory team and nine regional teams would be given about two weeks of train-
ing in monitoring and evaluation of CISs. It would include an orientation to
the organization and work of the regional offices, PIOs and IAs, the partici-
patory approach, and the main tasks and problems of O&M.
4.10      IA leaders and selected members would be given training in sessions
of one to three days at different times through the course of development of
their system. The first module would be a one-day session for the entire
membership and would include a presentation and discussion of feasibility
designs and an introduction of the technical and institutional processes to
be followed during the detailed design phase. In the second module, about
one month before construction, training would be provided to IA leaders on
keeping records of construction costs, cost reconciliation procedures, and
of counterpart participation by the IA. For the farmers convenience, this
two-day module would be divided into shorter one-day or half-day sessions,
as would the later modules. About three months after the beginning of con-
struction, a two-day training module would be held for IA leaders in the
management of the financial affairs of the IA, stressing bookkeeping proce-
dures for all expenditures and receipts. Before completion of construction



- 26 -
but at least a month before the IA begins to operate the system, the first
training for O&M would be given. It would include: O&M procedures, conflict
resolution, management of fee collection, follow-up on record keeping, and
the procedures for subproject monitoring (for those systems to be monitored).
This module would last one day for the entire membership and about two days
for selected IA leaders. Shortly after the IA begins operating the system a
second training session of about three days would be provided for the O&M
phase, stressing water management and crop production for all members of the
IA.
4.11      A team drawn from three of the 40 pilot communal systems composed
of about nine IA farmer leaders and about six NIA personnel (engineers, COs,
CO supervisors) would be sent overseas in 1982 to study various aspects of
irrigation practices, water management, O&M and crop production. A second
team from three other systems would receive similar training in 1983. By
1984 six model communal systems would be established, two each in Luzon, the
Visayas and Mindanao. These would serve as demonstration and training cen-
ters for farmers from other communal systems in the Philippines.
4.12      At the beginning of each year PI0 technical and institutional
staffs would meet for a three-day regional workshop to review their exper-
ience in coordination, study cases, receive additional training in coordina-
tion and conflict resolution skills, and set their general coordination
plans for the year. The technical and institutional staff would then meet
at least once each month with their PIE for a review session.
4.13      Communal Irrigation Rehabilitation and Development.  The project
would provide for the improvement of irrigation facilities on about 10,700 ha
in 50 existing CISs and the construction of new irrigation works on about
22,800 ha, consisting of 94 new communal irrigation subprojects. The sub-
projects range in size from 50-1,000 ha and would be based on run-of-the-
river supply, served by gravity irrigation. Typical subprojects would be
served by diversion weirs; a few would need intake structures only. The
diversion weirs would be of concrete ogee type with a crest height of 1-2 m
above the stream bed. The length of each weir would be determined by the
25-year frequency flood. Intake structures would be steel-gated with
constant head orifice turnouts for discharges up to 1 cu m/sec. Water flow
measuring devices would be included in structures discharging more than 1 cu
m/sec. Generally, the main canals would be unlined: concrete lining would
be used only where soils are susceptible to erosion and where possibility of
excessive seepage is identified. Check structures and gated turnouts would
be provided as necessary to ensure effective water control.
4.14      For areas smaller than 100 ha or where the service area is
elongated, secondary canals would be eliminated and the main canal would
serve the distribution system. Secondary unlined canals would be provided
for larger subprojects, as necessary. Service roads of 4.0 m width and 15 cm
thick gravel surface would be built along the main canals, and access roads



- 27 -
would connect service roads to the nearest barangay, provincial or national
road. Drainage would be provided through outlets to secondary drains and
natural channels. Farm drainage, in most cases, would be from one field to
the adjacent lower field.
4.15      Subproject Selection Criteria.  All NIA communal irrigation sub-
projects would meet following minimum criteria:
(a) the expected cropping intensity should be at least 130%;
(b) the proposed subproject area should be suitable for irrigated crop
production;
(c) there should be minimal conversion of land use from productive
permanent crops like coconuts and orchards;
(d) the area should not be less than 50 ha or more than 1,000 ha;
(e) the average farm size should not be more than 2 ha;
(f) the internal economic rate of return of the subproject should be
not less than 10%; and /1
(g) farmers should be actively involved in preparing, and should concur
with, the initial feasibility design of the subproject.
During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government that NIA would
by December 31, 1983, begin to implement a phased program satisfactory to the
Bank and IFAD with a view to achieve by December 31, 1985, a uniform set of
selection criteria and design standards satisfactory to the Bank and IFAD
to be applied to all its CISs, regardless of financing source.
4.16      Subproject Preparation and Evaluation.  Feasibility studies of
33 sample subprojects were prepared before appraisal. These were evaluated
in detail by PDD and appraised by the Bank mission. Detailed engineering
design of these subprojects would be undertaken by the RIDs of NIA and
reviewed by the Project Manager. Construction is scheduled to start by
January 1983. The preparation of the remaining subprojects including topo-
graphic mapping, soil and water resources studies, layout and cost estimates
would be done by the respective PIOs. Short gestation subprojects would be
given priority. Completed feasibility studies and subproject profiles would
be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team from the PDD. Detailed engineering
/1 The rate of return of the 33 sample subprojects evaluated by PDD
varies from 10% to 36%.



- 28 -
design would then be undertaken by the RIDs and would be reviewed by the
Project Manager against standard design criteria. The technical and
institutional staff of the PIOs would be responsible for finalizing the
design and undertaking requisite preconstruction and construction activities
in consultation with the IAs. Supervision of field work would be the
responsibility of the RIDs who would regularly report their findings to the
Project Manager. During negotiations agreement was reached with the
Government that NIA would submit for review by the Bank prior to
implementation full evaluation reports for subprojects costing more than
P 5.0 million each and summary data forms for subprojects costing less than
P 5.0 million.
4.17      Monitoring and Evaluation.  In order to learn from experience
gained under the project, NIA would improve its existing monitoring and eval-
uation (M&E) system with the intention of improving CIS policy and adminis-
trative procedures and developing more effective training programs for the
staff and farmers involved. This would be done in two ways: NIAs existing
reporting requirements for communal works would be expanded and a new M&E
scheme would be implemented.
4.18      NIA has an established program of monthly reporting of CIS con-
struction progress from the PIO to the RIO and then to the NIA central
office. This system is being computerized to increase its usefulness to
NIA's senior management. Under the project, reporting would be extended to
include progress during the design phase of a CIS including establishment of
the IA, fielding of the CO, obtaining of water permit, completion of design,
and selection of farmer committees.
4.19      NIA would also establish a system to monitor the O&M of a sample
of communal subprojects by lAs during the first three years after the
completion of construction and to evaluate the impact of these subprojects
after the first and third years of cropping. The sample would comprise
40 Bank-assisted subprojects and 40 locally-funded subprojects in order to
compare the benefits achieved in the two sets of CISs with regard to types,
amount and distribution of benefits to members. A supervisory team in NIA's
Farmers' Assistance Department would design and oversee the M&E work. This
national team would comprise a statistician, an economist, an agriculturalist
and a sociologist. Nine comparable teams at the regional level would conduct
studies, supervise local data collection, and supervise and train one farmer-
member from each of the 80 IAs who would be employed at a modest wage to
conduct periodic data collection. Regional teams would comprise an agri-
cultural economist, an agriculturalist and a sociologist. Work would proceed
in three phases: benchmark survey, O&M monitoring, and O&M evaluation.
During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government that NIA would
submit for review by the Bank and IFAD before December 31, 1982, the
indicators that would be monitored and other details of the M&E system.



- 29 -
4.20      A benchmark survey would be carried out during construction of each
of the selected systems. This would measure level of farmer organization,
water control and cropping practices, use of inputs, level of outputs and
level of agricultural incomes. Regional teams would verify data before
analyzing and summarizing them for the IA, the PIO, the RIO and the NIA
central office team.
4.21      During the wet and dry cropping seasons of the first three years
of system operation, simple surveys would be conducted of a sample of IA mem-
bers twice each cropping season regarding input availability and distribution
system, input utilization and farm management practices, adequacy of irriga-
tion water and water management practices, O&M of irrigation facilities, and
crop production levels and farm income. The regional teams would also gather
data once each cropping season regarding IA organization, management and
performance. The regional teams would verify data and analyze and present it
for review by the IAs, PIOs, and RIOs. Results of each periodic survey would
then be presented and discussed in a provincial meeting of IA leaders and the
PIO. This joint IA-PIO review of progress and problems arising from monitor-
ing reports would be a critical channel for improving the performance of some
CISs, providing useful recommendations for training and helping PIO staff
improve their contribution to the large number of CISs not included in the
M&E sample.
4.22      After the second year of monitoring, survey forms and system-level
monitoring studies would be modified to prepare for evaluation. Provisions
would be added that would help compare third year system outputs more com-
pletely with the benchmark data and would help compare system benefits more
completely with project objectives. The third year of monitoring would thus
be somewhat more extensive in that it would enable NIA to make a thorough
evaluation of impacts and benefits from the sample systems. After completion
of the third year of monitoring (in the fourth and fifth years of the
project), the regional teams and central M&E teams would produce a general
evaluation of accomplishments and recommended redirection of NIA strategies.
A copy of this report would be forwarded for review by the Bank and IFAD.
4.23      Review of NIA's Financial Reporting System.  The project would
support a consultant study of NIA's financial reporting system. The
purpose of the study would be to review the present system and prepare a
five-year work program to develop an integrated financial management and
reporting system. Work undertaken for this component would be coordinated
with NIA's ongoing efforts to improve its electronic data processing and
management information sytem. It is estimated that about 35 man-months of
local consulting services would be required at about US$4,500 per man-month
inclusive of overheads, office costs, and local travel. Assurance was
obtained during negotiations that NIA would prepare by December 31, 1982, for
review by the Bank, terms of reference for consulting services for the
financial reporting system study.



- 30 -
Status of Engineering
4.24      Feasibility grade designs, layouts, and drawings have been prepared
by NIA for 33 sample subprojects (22 new areas and 11 rehabilitation areas)
covering 6,700 ha in 24 provinces or about 20% of the total project area.
This would serve as the basis for the entire first year construction program.
Construction quantities have been estimated for the diversion works, main and
secondary canals, tertiary canals and drains, access and service roads and
all appurtenant structures, from plans and profiles supported by field
surveys and site investigations. Adequate investigations have also been
conducted to ensure the availability of ample supply of construction mater-
ials. Designs and drawings for buildings in all provinces have been prepared.
Preparation of bid documents for equipment and vehicles is underway. Prepa-
ration of detailed designs and tender documents is thus sufficiently advanced
for procurement and construction to start soon after loan effectiveness (see
para. 6.06).
4.25      Hydrological and soil studies, and determination of water require-
ments for the 33 sample subprojects have been completed. Studies for the
remaining subprojects are underway. Hydrological studies were carried out
by the Research and Development Section of the Agricultural Division in each
regional NIA office. Data on temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity
and rainfall were collected from the various ordinary rainfall and synoptic
stations operated and maintained by the Ministry of Public Works and Highways
(MPWH), and the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Service
Administration. Evaporation data for the study were taken from eleven
stations located near the project areas. In areas where no evaporation data
were available, Penman's formula was used to estimate the monthly evaporation
rate. Estimates of monthly stream flows for ungauged rivers and creeks and
for areas with incomplete data on river discharges were correlated with
nearby gauged streams, using concurrent periods of operation studies using
synthesized flow records and estimated water requirements and assuming no
return flows. Available water supply was assumed to be about 90% of river
flow for subprojects with diversion dams and about 70% for subprojects pro-
vided with intakes only. Water quality is suitable for agriculture. Only
5 rivers out of the 33 sample project rivers have prior approved water rights
to users other than the proposed communal subprojects. Previously appropri-
ated waters are small compared to the total discharges of the rivers and
would not affect the irrigation supplies for the project.
4.26      For each of the sample subprojects, available supply of water was
matched against the projected water requirements for an annual cropping
intensity of 165%. The proposed cropping calendars for the sample projects
would maximize the use of rainfall for both wet- and dry-season crops
without exceeding local manpower constraints. Field water requirements have
been estimated for most provinces and differ from each other mainly because
of varying evapotranspiration according to different climatic conditions,
growth stage of the crop, and varying percolation losses depending on the
permeability of the soils. The annual diversion requirements were estimated



- 31 -
by adjusting the field water requirements with the effective rainfall in the
area and the efficiency of the irrigation delivery system.
4.27      Studies done by NIA show that all sample subprojects have soils
suitable for rice cultivation. Soil maps and land-use maps from the Bureau
of Soils were used in the identification of subproject areas. Composite
soil samples (four samples/ha) were processed either in the regional soil
laboratories of the Bureau of Soils or in one of NIA's own soil and water
laboratories.
5. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Cost Estimates
5.01      Detailed cost estimates for 33 sample subprojects based on feasi-
bility grade designs (para. 4.24) were examined at appraisal. Cost estimates
for the remaining 111 subprojects, for which surveys and designs are being
prepared, have been derived from the detailed estimates of the sample sub-
projects by a process of comparator extrapolation. For the canal systems,
the sample subprojects were grouped into new and rehabilitation schemes.
Each of the two categories were further divided into three subgroups accord-
ing to size: below 250 ha, 251-500 ha, and 501-1,000 ha. Based on the
sample subproject estimates, the average costs per ha for each subgroup were
determined. The costs of the canal systems for the remaining 111 subprojects
were then determined using the appropriate unit cost per ha corresponding to
the size and category of each subproject. For the diversion works, the
estimated cost per meter of weir length for various heights of weirs were
determined on the basis of actual detailed engineering designs and layouts of
the sample subprojects. These unit costs were then applied to determine the
costs of diversion weirs for those of the remaining subprojects wherein the
approximate heights and lengths of diversion weirs had been decided by actual
field investigations. For rehabilitation of diversion works, the average
cost of the sample rehabilitation subprojects was used to determine the cost
of the remaining rehabilitation subprojects.
5.02      Total project costs are estimated at US$120.8 million, of which
US$61.5 million or about 51% is foreign exchange. Including a capitalized
front-end fee of US$1.05 million on the proposed Bank loan, the total
financing required for the project is estimated at US$121.85 (rounded to
US$121.8). Taxes equivalent to 3% of the costs of contracts for civil works
are included in the cost estimate. The Government exempts NIA from paying
taxes or duties for equipment, materials and consulting services procured
under foreign-assisted projects. NIA's costs for design and construction
supervision are included. Unit prices are based on recent quotations for
similar items received by NIA and are indexed to mid-1982. Physical
contingencies of 20% for irrigation works, 10% for buildings, training and
monitoring and evaluation, and 5% for equipment have been applied. Price
contingencies have been applied at the following rates:



- 32 -
Annual inflation rate (%)
1982   1983   1984   1985   1986   1987

Foreign                     8.0    8.0    7.5    7.0    6.0    6.0
Over the implementation period these amount to about 24% of the base cost
plus physical contingencies. Cost estimates are presented in Table 5.1.
Financing
5.03      The proposed Bank loan of US$71.1 million, including capitalized
front-end fee, and the IFAD loan of SDR 10.8 million (US$12.0 million
equivalent) would together finance about 71% of total project costs
excluding taxes and the cost of land acquisition, or about 68% of the gross
total costs. The loan would cover 100% of the foreign exchange requirement
(US$62.5 million) and also about 35% (US$20.6 million) of the local costs.
Financing of local costs is justified by the shortage of counterpart funds
in the Philippines. Of the remaining project cost of about US$38.7 million,
Government would finance about US$33.7 million and the rest would be
contributed by farmer beneficiaries through their equity contributions to
communal irrigation system construction through land, labor, materials or
cash. The full amounts of the loans would be channeled through Government
directly to NIA. In the past, the Goverment has treated transfer of these
resources as direct public works appropriations or as an equity contribution
to NIA and no onlending arrangement between the Borrower and NIA has been
necessary. At present Government is considering changes in its financial
treatment of NIA and other autonomous institutions. At negotiations
Government agreed that in the event NIA would be responsible to service this
debt obligation, the terms and conditions of the onlending agreement would
be discussed with the Bank and IFAD.
5.04      In order to begin construction of project works in 1983, the first
year of project implementation, certain preparatory works would have to be
undertaken. PIO buildings would need to be constructed and office equipment
and construction machinery purchased for the provinces where the first sub-
projects, selected from among the sample communal systems for which feasibi-
lity studies and preliminary cost estimates have been prepared, are to be
implemented. Staff would need to be trained and community organizers mobi-
lized to help form IAs to review and concur with the preliminary design and
cost proposals. Detailed topographic surveys would be carried out and the
detailed design prepared in advance. To provide for these preconstruction
activities during the course of 1982, expenditures of up to $1.5 million, made
after January 1, 1982, would be considered for retroactive financing.

5.05      Special Account.  Government's time-consuming reimbursement pro-
cedures and sometimes untimely budgetary allocations during each fiscal year
have presented difficulties for smooth project implementation. At the level
of project implementing agencies, such as NIA, liquidity is frequently
constrained by the agency's inability to plan and manage its own working
capital resources. This situation would be exacerbated in the communal
irrigation project because its geographically dispersed nature and the large
number of small individual disbursement requests to be submitted for each
subproject extend further the processing time between agency expenditure and
final reimbursement. Moreover, the whole approach to participatory communal
development assumes continuity of work and timely responsiveness to farmer
inputs and places a premium on smooth implementation. And finally, because
the small contractors and suppliers who will be servicing the project have
very limited financial resources, prompt payment of their claims is vital for
ensuring continuity of their services which would otherwise be subject to
frequent and serious interruption. Because of these considerations, and at
the specific request of NIA and the Government, it is proposed to establish a
special account to accelerate disbursements.
5.06      A peso account (the Special Account) would be established in the
Philippines National Bank with advances from the proposed loans. The initial
advance from the Bank loan account would amount to $250,000 rising to a
maximum of $850,000, as needed. IFAD would advance up to $150,000 pari passu
with the Bank advance. Disbursements from the Account would cover the Bank-s
and IFAD's shares of expenditures for force account civil works, small civil
works contracts (less than P 1,000,000), and small local purchases of equip-
ment and materials (items costing less than P 50,000 equivalent).
Replenishment of the Special Account would take place periodically on the
authorization of requests by NIA-s Assistant Administrator for Finance.
Justification for disbursements made out of the Account would be submitted by
NIA prior to replenishment, and a separate annual audit by an external auditor
would be provided. It is NIA's intention, with which the Bank agrees, to
extend gradually the purposes for which funds in the Account are used and to
ensure that the Account continues to provide liquidity after loan closing.
Therefore, NIA would fund its liquidity by opening and maintaining a counter-
part account (the Operating Account) during project years 2-6 with the deposit
of the equivalent of US$250,000 per year from its own resources. This would
result in an established fund of over US$1.5 million equivalent for general
corporate purposes after the end of the Bank replenishment of the Special
Account. The creation of the Special Account would constitute, therefore, an
important institution-building element, the significance of which extends well
beyond the proposed project. During negotiations, agreement was reached with
the Government that NIA would establish the Special Account and the
counterpart Operating Account and maintain and operate the accounts in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank and IFAD.
Procurement
5.07      Goods.  Construction machinery, vehicles and spare parts, equipment
for offices and workshops, surveying and hydrologic instruments and con-
struction materials and supplies, totalling about US$19 million equivalent,



- 35 -
including contingencies, would be grouped in appropriate bidding packages and
procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank
Guidelines. Qualifying domestic manufacturers would receive a preference in
bid evaluation of 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods, or the import
duty, whichever is lower. Miscellaneous items of equipment and machinery,
costing less than US$20,000 each and totalling not more than US$3 million,
including contingencies, would be procured under local competitive bidding
procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank and IFAD.
5.08      Works.  Office buildings and workshops totalling about US$5 mil-
lion, and the diversion works, main canals and roads totalling about US$56
million, including contingencies, are scattered over 67 provinces and 145
locations. The small size and wide geographical dispersion of these works
are unlikely to attract foreign contractors. To the extent possible,
contracts would therefore be let by local competitive bidding procedures
which are satisfactory to the Bank and IFAD and in which foreign bidders have
the opportunity to participate. In cases, where the small size or remoteness
of works discourage even local bidders, works would be done by force account,
up to a maximum of US$14 million. The balance of civil works, totalling about
US$18 million, including contingencies, consist of minor works related to
distribution systems, onfarm facilities and appurtenant structures and are not
likely to interest local contractors. Therefore these works would be carried
out under force account. Assurance was obtained during negotiations that the
aggregate cost of civil works done by force account (including US$18 million
for minor works and up to US$14 million of the diversion works, main canals
and roads) would not exceed 40% of the total cost of civil works, or US$32
million.
5.09      Contract Review.  Between 300 and 400 bidding packages are expected
to make up the estimated US$61 million in domestic civil works contracts and
US$22 million in the procurement of goods, including US$19 million under ICB
procedures. All bidding packages for works estimated to cost over US$400,000
equivalent and bidding packages for goods over US$200,000 equivalent would be
subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation. This would
result in a coverage of about 40% of the total estimated value of civil works
contracts and about 75% of goods contracts. About 25% of the total number of
packages or between 75 and 100 contracts amounting to about US$41 million
(US$17 million in goods and US$24 million in works) would be subject to prior
review over the five-year period, which represents a reasonable work load for
Bank staff and is consistent with NIA-s record of good performance in the
preparation of procurement documents. The balance of contracts would be
subject to random review by the Bank after contract award.
Disbursements
5.10      Disbursements would be made as follows:  (a) 100% of foreign expend-
itures for directly imported equipment and materials, 100% of the ex-factory
cost of such items manufactured locally, and 80% of the cost of imported
items procured locally; (b) 75% of expenditures for civil works; and (c) 100%
of expenditures for training, consultants' services, and the monitoring and
evaluation of component. Disbursements for force account civil works would
be made against statements of expenditure based on agreed unit rates. NIA



- 36 -
would submit a detailed unit rate analysis with supporting documents for Bank
review before September 30, 1982, or before claiming the first reimbursement
for force account work, whichever is earlier. These unit rates would exclude
depreciation of the equipment directly financed under the project. Disburse-
ments for minor civil works contracts (less than P 1,000,000) would also be
made against statements of expenditure based on actual progress payments made
to contractors. In addition, statements of expenditure would be used for
minor local expenditures for equipment and materials (items costing up to P
50,000 equivalent), for local training programs, and for expenditures under
the monitoring and evaluation component. The use of statements of expenditure
for these items is justified because of the small and frequent payments
involved. NIA has the institutional capability to maintain related records in
a satisfactory manner, and supporting documentation would be made available
for review by visiting the Bank missions. All disbursements shall be
apportioned by the Bank, as nearly as practicable in the circumstances,
between the Bank loan and the IFAD loan in the ratio of 6:1.
5.11      It is expected that disbursements would be completed by June 30,
1988, approximately one year after the end of construction, due mainly to
required lagtime for releasing contractors' retention monies. An estimated
schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 2, Table 5, which also includes a
comparison with regional and country disbursement profiles for the irrigation
subsector. The proposed allocation of IBRD and IFAD loan proceeds is given in
Annex 2, Table 6. The country disbursement profile shows higher disbursement
percentages than the regional profile during the first four years of
implementation but both profiles indicate that full loan disbursement is
accomplished in eight years. Despite these indications, it is expected that
the proposed loan would be disbursed in six years owing to the following
factors:
(a) the project provides for retroactive financing from January 1,
1982. Therefore, the effective disbursement period is 6-1/2 years;
(b) the proposed project is essentially different from other projects
in the disbursement profile insofar as it would pick up a
time-slice of ongoing activity in the subsector. CISs covering an
area of over 300,000 ha have been implemented during the decade
1971-80;
(c) the project comprises a large number of small subprojects which
are easy to design and construct under the authority delegated to
a large number of regional and provincial offices;
(d) a large number of subprojects would be implemented simultaneously
by small contractors and independent force account crews in
different provinces;
(e) the status of engineering on 33 subprojects is sufficiently
advanced to permit an early start on project implementation, and
the engineering of the remaining subprojects is expected to be
completed well ahead of implementation;



- 37 -
(f) the project would not suffer from land acquisition delays (see
para. 6.07).
Accounts and Audit
5.12      The NIA is a government agency and its accounts are audited annually
by the Government's Commission on Audit (COA). Assurances would be obtained
during negotiations that NIA would cause all its regional and provincial
offices to maintain separate accounts for the project. The project accounts
would be collated by the Project Manager. After audit by the COA, the pro-
ject accounts, together with the auditor's comments, as well as his opinion on
the certification of expenditure on force account works, would be sent to the
Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal year. Accounting proce-
dures for force account work and minor contracts are given in Annex 6.
6. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
6.01      NIA would be responsible for all components of the project, which
would be under the Assistant Administrator for Operations. An ad-hoc advisory
committee, named the Communal Irrigation Committee, consisting of specialists
from within and outside NIA, has been in existence for some years and would
continue to advise the Assistant Administrator for Operations on policy issues
and provide feed-back on the state-of-the-art in communal irrigation develop-
ment. A Project Manager has been appointed to handle the day-to-day imple-
mentation of the project and supervision of the work of concerned Provincial
and Regional offices, and of the project-connected functions of other agencies
in NIA central office. He would also assist the Assistant Administrator for
Operations to oversee the entire communal irrigation subsector and partic-
ularly to monitor the adherence to the subproject selection criteria (para.
4.15). He would be responsible for compiling and submitting to the Bank
quarterly progress reports covering all project activities. The organization
of the Project Manager-s office and its interrelationship with other agencies
concerned with the implementation of the project are shown in Figure 6.1. The
Project Development Department of NIA central office would have responsibility
for support functions related to the overall preparation and economic
viability of the subprojects; Design and Specifications Department, for the
engineering design of civil works; Equipment Management Department, for
equipment specifications and procurement; Farmers' Assistance Department, for
institutional development and agricultural coordination, and for the M&E
component; and Training and Development Division, for the training component
of the project. The Project Manager took up the assignment end-October 1981
and started preparatory activites for project implementation.



- 38 -
6.02      The Project Manager, under the guidance of the Assistant Adminis-
trator for Operations of NIA, would plan, schedule and coordinate the various
activities of the project. He would arrange for release of funds, maintain
records of financial transactions and exercise overall control of funds for
the project. He would conduct inspections of project works to ensure compli-
ance with standards of quality, examine progress of work in all regions to
ensure that status of construction and institutional development is on target,
coordinate with other departments to facilitate extension of agricultural
support services to the project areas, and arrange for the training of project
personnel and farmers. He would prepare required reports on the project for
submission to the NIA Board and the Bank.
6.03      The regional directors would review the plan of work prepared by the
PIOs and request the Project Manager for release of funds. They would also
review subproject designs prepared by the PIOs and prepare the design of
structures beyond the technical capability or delegated authority of PIOs.
They would supervise construction, conduct inspections, watch progress of
work, supervise formation and organization of IAs and conduct training of
project personnel and farmers. One CO supervisor in each RIO would assist the
regional directors in the functional supervision of the work of institutional
development under the participatory approach. RIOs have adequate staff and do
not need further strengthening.
6.04      The PIOs would be the principal functionaries of the project.  They
would maintain lists of promising communal irrigation sites and undertake
sociotechnical profile studies of potential subprojects as a basis for initial
selection. A feasibility study would be done of selected subprojects to
ascertain that necessary conditions exist for development. The PIOs would
prepare plans of work for subprojects included in the project, prepare designs
of canals and structures, assist farmers in formation and organization of IAs,
and arrange and supervise construction of subprojects. They would process
disbursement vouchers, maintain accurate records of financial transactions and
control budget. Aside from the technical staff, a number of COs would assist
each PIO in the work of institutional development under the participatory
approach. Normally, one CO would be assigned in each subproject less than
200 ha. Additional COs would be assigned in larger subprojects or in sub-
projects with unusually small land holdings. NIA already has about 150 COs
and there is a continuing program of further recruitment and training.
Project Implementation
6.05      Project implementation would follow established NIA procedures
with some adaptations for the participatory approach in which NIA staff and
farmers would together build viable IAs and work together through all phases
of designing and building the system. Farmers would be organized into an IA
prior to final design, and the IA would agree to the construction of the
subproject. The coordinated technical and institutional process is derived
from NIA's experience with about 40 communal projects undertaken in the past
five years with assistance from the Ford Foundation.



- 39 -
6.06      Implementation of a typical subproject is depicted in the flow
chart Figure 6.2 which describes the sequential steps from feasibility study
of the subproject to completion of construction and turnover of the system to
the IA for O&M. COs were fielded beginning January 1982 in about 20 sub-
projects, where IAs were already sufficiently organized, to review and concur
with feasibility design and cost proposals. While the technical staff would
conduct detailed surveys and investigations, and prepare final designs and
cost estimates, the CO would assist the farmers to adopt a set of by-laws,
register with the SEC, obtain a water permit, and acquire land for construc-
tion. Continuing close coordination between officials and IAs would enable
farmers to understand and jointly review the construction designs and cost
estimates, so that tender and contract documents could be prepared to permit
an early start of the tendering process and the award of construction con-
tracts for diversion works, main canals and service and access roads soon
after loan effectiveness. The cycle would be repeated and the number of
subprojects increased in subsequent years of the project. Land acquisition
and procurement of materials for construction of buildings and workshops for
22 PIOs was started in November 1981 and construction would be undertaken in
1982. Land for the remaining 45 PIO buildings and workshops would be
acquired, and tender documents prepared, so as to commence construction early
in 1983. Preparation of tender documents and technical specifications for
construction machinery, office and workshop equipment, surveying and hydro-
logical instruments was started in November 1981 and is making good progress.
Bid invitations would be issued soon after loan effectiveness so that award of
supply contracts can be made in early 1983. To enable an early start of
noncontract activities and force account works, a limited quantity of con-
struction machinery and equipment for offices and workshops would be procured
locally. Field investigation, preliminary design, consultation with IAs,
design finalization, and preparation of tender and contract documents would be
carried out for groups of subprojects covering about 5,500 ha in 1982, 7,500
ha 1983, 9,500 ha in 1984, and 11,000 ha in 1985 for implementation in the
respective subsequent years. An estimated schedule for project implementation
is given in Figure 6.3.
6.07      In the past, some projects for the construction of national irri-
gation systems have experienced land acquisition delays.  The proposed project
design specially addresses this problem. Firstly, since the farmers would
themselves own the irrigation system after completion of construction, the
Government or NIA would not be "acquiring" land in the usual sense, but the
farmers would be "contributing" land to the IA, of which they would be
members. So the farmers would in a sense continue to own the "acquired" land
which would vest in the community. Secondly, the farmers would fully parti-
cipate in all stages of designing and constructing the irrigation system.
Various alternative layouts of the system would be fully discussed in farmers'
meetings, and the layout finally adopted would be fully acceptable to the
farmers. By the same token, once a layout is adopted, it would be very
difficult for any member of the community to refuse to provide his land to the
IA. Finally, if any subproject has land acquisition problems which cannot be
satisfactorily resolved, it would be dropped in favor of another as the size
of the subsector affords a large field of selection.



- 40 -
6.08      Overall supervision of the project's training component would be the
functional responsibility of the NIA Training and Development Division. The
Division-s functions include preparing long-range manpower development pro-
grams, establishing training needs and course curricula, evaluating training
effectiveness and administering NIA's external and overseas training program.
NIA's training capability has been strengthened through implementation of
previous Bank-assisted projects, particularly the substantial training compo-
nent under the Second National Irrigation Systems Improvement Project (Loan
1526-PH). Staffing is adequate both in the central Training and Development
Division and in the regional Farmer's Assistance Divisions. Only eight addi-
tional positions of trainers would be required in NIA. MOA's Bureau of Agri-
cultural Extension would train the agricultural extension workers. Outside
specialist assistance would consist of three consultants from the Asian
Institute of Management, two from IRRI, and one from the Development Academy
of the Philippines. The Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok, would assist
NIA in the formulation of a training program for supervisors on subproject
design and management. Training would be provided at the 11 regional centers
and at NIA's national training center at San Raphael.
6.09      NIA's Farmers' Asistance Department would have overall functional
responsibility for the M&E component of the project. Two previous Bank-
assisted projects, Chico River Irrigation Project (Loan 1227-PH) and the
Second National Irrigation Systems Improvement Project (Loan 1526-PH), helped
in the establishment of a large scale input-output monitoring system in NIA.
These projects have helped to enlarge NIA's responsibilities and shift NIA's
concern just with irrigation to concern for the broader problems of produc-
tion. NIA no longer concentrates solely on how to design dams or align
canals, but is now also interested in securing adequate inputs for producers
and in arranging for well-organized disposition of their products. NIA has
acquired substantial experience and expertise in the M&E of large irrigation
systems which would be modified and simplified for the small-scale, widely
scattered systems under the project. This process of adaptation and applica-
tion has already started. Incremental staff required for the M&E component of
the project is given in para. 4.19.
Operation and Maintenance
6.10      Upon completion of construction and the computation and final recon-
ciliation of costs, the PIO would turn over the system to the IA. The IA
would accept this responsibilty by contracting with NIA to pay back the
construction costs. Before operations begin, IA leaders and members would
receive training in O&M, including record keeping, fee collection and system
supervision. After operations have begun they would have another training
workshop in water management and crop production. With this training and
continuing help from various officials, the IA would take charge of all
irrigation functions: water allocation, system maintenance, conflict reso-
lution, and fee collection. The CO would remain with the IA during the
initial settling-in phase and facilitate assistance from MOA extension agents,
suppliers of inputs and sources of credit. The technical and institutional



- 41 -
processes would become integrated into a joint process of continuing efforts
by the IA to deal with both the technical and organizational problems of
sustaining the irrigation system in order to improve agricultural production.
During negotiations agreement would be reached with the Government on a
typical proforma of the memorandum of agreement that would be signed by NIA
and the concerned IA at the time of turnover of a completed system, setting
out the rights and obligations of both parties, and the terms of repayment by
the IA of the construction costs of the system.
6.11      The IA would pay water tenders to inspect structures, canals and
ditches regularly and to do minor maintenance work, such as clearing debris
from the water and from the screens of intakes, and patching minor cases of
erosion. IA members would form work parties to repair eroded places along
canals and remove silt from them. The IA capacity to maintain the physical
system and collect water fees regularly is essential to keeping the system
solvent. Further, capacity to resolve disputes, deliver water to members
reliably, and to increase the availability of agricultural inputs and
marketing facilities to members is crucial to lAs benefitting from the
system.
6.12      For purposes of analysis, the annual O&M cost has been estimated
at about P 125 per ha (see Annex 5). This would include materials and
supplies (P 20); salaries of gatekeeper/water tender, ditch tenders and
honorarium and traveling expenses for officers of the IA (P 80); equipment
rental and operation (P 15); and miscellaneous expenses (P 10). Free
labor would be contributed by the IA members. Fee collections by the IAs
from their members would cover the O&M expenses - either in cash or in kind -
as well as the loan repayments to NIA. Major repairs beyond their technical
capability would be referred by the IAs to NIA for execution assistance as
well as funding. The amount incurred by NIA for such major repairs would be
charged to the IA concerned, and would be capitalized as an addition to the
loan for construction of the system.
7. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Present Cropping Pattern
7.01      In most of the project systems land preparation for the first or
wet-season crop begins in May or June and transplanting is usually completed
by July/August, while the harvesting is done between November and January.
The second or dry season crop usually extends from December to April/May.
In general, cultivation is by animal-drawn implements. The cropping
calendar for rainfed paddy is dependent on the arrival of the southwest
monsoon which can vary by a month or more from year to year. According to
a national survey, about 75% of all rice paddies (irrigated and rainfed) are
planted with high yielding varieties (HYVs). These HYVs require high levels



- 42 -
of physical inputs and management which are often lacking. Practically all
rice is transplanted from field nurseries onto previously puddled land. In
general, farmers use low levels of fertilizer and only small amounts of
insecticides and herbicides. Crops are usually hand-weeded twice during a
season and are manually harvested and threshed. Grain is sun-dried on mats,
roads, drying floors or other suitable surfaces, and stored in the house for
home consumption, seed or sale.
Future Cropping Patterns
7.02      In the absence of the project, there would be no significant
change in cropping patterns. The majority of the potential subproject areas
would continue to have one wet season rainfed rice crop or an inadequately
irrigated crop and only a limited area would have a second, rather risky, dry
season crop depending on water availability, rains and timely planting.
However, with the project, farmers would grow only irrigated rice in the
proposed CISs. Cropping intensities for the individual systems would depend
on the available water supplies. However, no subproject with a realistic
potential for future cropping intensity of less than 130% would be accepted
in the project, and the average cropping intensity of the systems is
expected to be 165% at full development, four years after completion of each
subproject. Yields would vary depending on the degree of water control, the
availability of extension services, credit and input supplies.
Yields and Production
7.03      Without the project, yields in the rainfed areas are estimated to
increase at 1.25% per year, and at 1.4% per year in the presently irrigated
areas needing rehabilitation. This means a yield increase by 1990 of
about 0.4 tons/ha over the present level of 1.7 tons/ha for rainfed areas,
and of about 0.5 tons/ha over the present level of 2.2 tons/ha for irrigated
areas in need of rehabilitation. These yield increases would be induced
by improved infrastructure, better availability of inputs and more effective
extension services, but offset somewhat by the continued deterioration of
these systems.
7.04      Yields with the project are estimated at 3.3 tons/ha four years
after implementation of each subproject. Increases would be due mainly to
the availability of a reliable supply of water in the project areas, together
with better access to institutional credit and physical inputs, and improved
rice extension service support through adequate hiring and training of rice
production technicians from NIA and MOA. Present and projected palay
(threshed unmilled rice) yields are shown in Table 7.1. With the project,
palay production would increase from the present 61,000 tons to about
186,000 tons at full development in 1990. Phasing of production from start
of irrigation facilities under the project to full development is given in
Table 7.2.

Harvest, Drying, Storage and Processing
7.05      Rice is normally harvested by hand, and threshed either mechanically
by pedal- or motor-driven portable threshers, or by hand in the case of easy
shattering rice varieties which need to be threshed shortly after harvest. In
those areas with a pronounced dry season such as in Northern Luzon, farmers
stack the second rice crop for a while until they have the opportunity to rent
a motorized thresher. The National Food Authority (NFA) and the private sec-
tor have about 1,900 threshers available in the 35 project provinces. After
threshing, the paddy is sun-dried on whatever suitable surface is available
before being stored at home or carried to mill or market. NFA and private
traders provide in some instances portable mechanical dryers in those areas
where the harvest of the first crop coincides with heavy rainfall or in case
of an extended rainy season. Most of the larger rice mills have concrete
drying floors. Major private and NFA milling/storage centers have drying
floors and a total of some 500 mechanical dryers in the project provinces.
Existing drying arrangements are generally adequate for present production
levels, and in the past, both NFA and the private sector have reacted fairly
quickly to meet increasing demand for drying facilities.
7.06      As of 1980 about 45% of NFA's total storage capacity of about
1.75 million tons was located in the project provinces and distributed over
431 warehouses. Some 1,200 smaller private warehouses provide additional
storage for 0.4 million tons. NFA plans to increase its overall storage
capacity over the next few years to meet the projected production increases
of all irrigation projects under implementation, including the approximately
125,000 ton production increase with the proposed project which is only
about 1% of the national production. The private sector is expected to
undertake some storage investments to accommodate the increased production.
7.07      In the project provinces there are about 6,900 rice mills and
hullers with a total capacity of about 5,000 tons of palay per day. The
milling capacity is evenly distributed throughout the project area. In the
future, incremental milling capacity would be required to process the addi-
tional palay to be generated by the project. No difficulties are anticipated
in the provision of expanded milling facilities since the private sector is
enterprising, has access to development financing earmarked for this type of
investment, and is fairly quick to react to market demand.
8. MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND COST RECOVERY
Market Prospects
8.01      CIS farmers sell most of their surplus palay to local assemblers,
millers and wholesalers; about 10% of all palay production is purchased by
the NFA. At the end of 1981, private middlemen were paying farmers about



- 46 -
P 1.50/kg, while NIA paid P 1.55/kg. Private middlemen sell rice to other
intermediaries, in a complex pattern which usually involves several transac-
tions before rice reaches consumers. The complexity of the transaction net-
work raises the final price of rice considerably, but also engenders healthy
competition among middlemen and a reasonably robust market.
8.02      The production of rice lagged behind consumption for practically
the entire post-war period, until rapid growth in yields during the mid-1970s
at last produced a rough balance in 1976/77 and an exportable surplus in 1978.
Exports grew from 46,000 tons in 1978 to 236,000 tons in 1980, or about 6% of
total milled rice production. During this time, total end-of-year stocks of
rice were also increased from 836,000 tons to 1,660,000 tons. Population
growth is expected to slow from 2.4% in the early 1980s to 1.9% in the
1995-2000 period. With a moderate 3% p.a. per capita income growth and an
average income elasticity of demand of 0.09, the growth of total domestic rice
consumption would slow from 2.65% p.a. in the late 1980s to 2.18% p.a. in the
late 1990s. With large increases in production expected as national irriga-
tion projects now under construction come onstream and as new varieties and
better cultural practices are adopted, the surplus of rice could grow to over
600,000 tons a year about 1990 and about 900,000 tons a year in the year
2000./1 There are tentative plans for a limited government consumption
subsidy for the poorest elements of the population, which would reduce this
surplus somewhat. The major outlet, however, must be the export market.
Because Philippine milled rice is of low quality by world standards, it is not
now a profitable export. Concerted efforts to improve milling standards could
remove this constraint, and open to Filipino producers a large world market
with good long-term prospects.
Prices
8.03      Since 1957, the Government has purchased a portion of palay produc-
tion (up to 18%) at a support price set to encourage production. Government
purchases have built price stabilization stocks and also provided contacts in
the world rice market. Through 1972, the farmgate support price for palay and
the domestic retail price of. rice kept pace with changes in the world market
price of rice. Between 1972 and 1975, to keep domestic prices down in the
face of record high world prices for rice, the Government subsidized consumers
/1 The estimates of surplus are from the draft Philippines Irrigation Program
Review prepared by the Bank. The draft is now under revision, based on
recent discussions with, and data provided by, various Philippine agencies
concerning yields, cropping intensities, and estimated future rainfed area
on the supply side, and also per capita income growth and income elasti-
city of demand. In general, the Philippines- agency estimates of long-
term supply are lower, and of long-term demand somewhat higher, than those
of the Bank. On this basis, the surplus projected by the Bank could be
lower than noted above.



- 47 -
by maintaining a low official ceiling price for rice and a correspondingly low
farmgate price for paddy through sales of imported rice below cost. At the
same time, the enormous increase in oil prices caused a near doubling of the
fertilizer-to-palay price ratio, with attendant declines in farm yields
because of reduced application, and also lower net incomes. After 1975, the
ratio fell slightly, then began a gradual increase to a record high in 1981.
Widespread typhoon damage compounded this adverse price trend, holding 1981
rice production to the 1980 level while domestic consumption rose 2.5%. Rice
exports were cut off and government rice stocks released on the market to
maintain price stability.
8.04      Bank projections of world market prices of Thai 5% broken rice indi-
cate an increase from US$434/ton FOB Bangkok in 1980 to US$557/ton in 1985 and
US$575/ton in 1990 (in constant 1980 dollars). Rice exported by the Philip-
pines in recent years has generally contained 25-35% brokens, and has sold at
a 30% discount below Thai 5% brokens. If this quality and price differential
is maintained, the world market price of Philippine export rice would be
US$390/ton FOB in 1985 and US$402/ton in 1990. However, in the expectation
that it will have continuing surpluses, the Government has already taken some
initial steps to enhance its competitive efficiency, e.g., establishment of
rice mills which incorporate the latest design and technology. The designa-
tion of export production zones and steps to promote varietal uniformity would
be among the other steps which would narrow the price differential between
Philippines and other rice exporters. The 1981 average farmgate price of
palay was almost the same as the estimated 1982 export parity price of P
1.50/kg. Farmgate prices are expected to approximate export parity prices
during the 1980s. The appraisal of the project recognizes that predictions of
the long-term rice price trends are not very reliable; it also assumes that
price ratios of rice and other project goods and services will remain constant
over the period of project analysis and that farmgate rice prices will reflect
the cost to the Government of importing equivalent amounts of rice. Details
of the calculation of this cost are in in the project file, in financial and
economic terms. A similar project file shows the price structure for corn,
for which irrigated rice would substitute on part of the project area.
8.05      Farmgate fertilizer prices used in the farm budgets and economic
analysis are based on the Bank's price projections for urea, triple super-
phosphate (TSP) and muriate of potash. Observed 1981 prices are converted to
mid-1982 farmgate prices by adding estimated inflation factors of 5.5% for
urea, 5.9% for TSP and 2.9% for muriate of potash. World prices for these
fertilizers are expected to increase rather slowly during the 1980s, roughly
in line with the expected increase in the world price of rice and other
project inputs. Price structures for these fertilizers are included in the
project file.
Farm Incomes
8.06      Samples of CIS farms show generally low household incomes, but
wide variation between regions in total household income and proportion



- 48 -
coming from on-farm production.  A 1978 survey showed average CIS annual
household incomes in the four regions studied were about P 9,300 but ranged
from P 3,800 to P 17,400, of which the share of on-farm production ranged
from 11% to 69%. A smaller 1980 sample showed 80% of total income averaging
P 7,140 was from on-farm production. These variations make generalizations
about farm incomes and their growth due to the project difficult, but a rough
approximation can be made through farm models representing common farm types.
The models represent typical farms of 0.9 ha and 2.4 ha, for owner-operators
and share tenants, and for new irrigation and rehabilitation. Assuming that
onfarm income is two thirds of total household income for communal system
households, seven-eighths of project households are below the rural poverty
income level; the project would reduce this share to two-thirds. The
project's impact on rainfed farms would be greatest, with net farm incomes
rising 170-260% on presently rainfed rice farms and 280-350% on presently
rainfed corn farms. Irrigated rice farm net incomes would rise 80-100%. The
project's effect on rice farm incomes is summarized in Table 8.1, and farm
models are presented in detail in Annex 4, Table 2-5.
Cost and Rent Recovery
8.07      Cost recovery never approaches 100% on irrigation projects in the
Philippines because irrigators, being largely a low-income group, are favored
by a government policy which allows 50 years for government construction
expenses to be repaid at zero interest. The project's direct beneficiaries
would be subject to the same terms that other CIS beneficiaries face: during
construction IAs would contribute labor, materials and/or cash worth 10% of
subproject costs./I The remaining 90% must be repaid over a period of up to
50 years at zero interest. These repayments are set in terms of palay with
farmers agreeing to pay a fixed number of cavans of palay per irrigated
hectare per year or the cash equivalent in current palay prices. Repayments
are, therefore, indexed roughly to the rate of inflation. For the project,
average annual repayments would be about two cavans per ha for rehabilitation
subprojects and about three cavans per ha for new subprojects. Total cost
recovery for communal systems has three sources: the 50-year stream of
capital cost repayments, the initial IA 10% contribution, and incremental land
taxes, in order of magnitude. Land taxes are 1% of assessed value under

would rise by P 2.3 million per year at full development as irrigation
raises land values. In present value terms, water charges would account for

of this index because, as farmers would pay all such charges, the costs
are never incurred by government and so cannot be recovered by government.
Although the cost recovery index shows a high degree of subsidy, the
beneficiaries are asked to pay a larger share of costs than their neighbors
on recent Bank-assisted national systems, where the appraisal estimates of
the cost recovery index average about 17%.
8.08      The project rent recovery index /1 measures the economic impact of
the project and the burden of water charges on beneficiaries. Project rent
is the incremental cash income from the project less allowances for costs of
farmer capital, labor, farm management and risk. The rent recovery index
ranges from 12% to 28% for various farm types analyzed. It is 19.0% for the
irrigation construction component as a whole. The rent recovery indices on
the three most recent Bank-assisted national irrigation projects are 20% for
Medium Scale Irrigation Project (Loan 1809-PH), 24% for Magat II Irrigation
Project (Loan 1639-PH) and 30% for the Second National Irrigation Systems
Improvement Project (Loan 1526-PH). Table 8.2 shows the details of the cost
and rent recovery analysis.
8.09      The proposed project charges on beneficiaries (10% of costs paid
at the time of construction, and the rest paid over 50 years at zero inter-
est) are consistent with the objective of narrowing the gap between rural
and urban incomes. Although the beneficiaries could bear higher charges,
the proposed charges are at their legal limits. NIA is exploring the possi-
bility of a change in the law which would allow high repayments in the first
few years with any remaining balance written off as an explicit grant to the
irrigators. This option would greatly increase the cost recovery index, but
must be designed carefully to avoid excessive burden on farmers in the
initial years. The following agreements would be reached with the
Government during negotiations:
(a) the Government would not reduce the existing level of capital
cost repayment expected of project beneficiaries; and
(b) NIA would send to the Bank by December 31, 1983, a report
detailing current estimates of the level of water charges,
the capacity of the beneficiaries to pay, and actual
collection rates, and explaining the Government's policy
on project cost recovery and measures to improve collection
of water and charges.

9. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Benefits
9.01      The proposed project would contribute to government objectives of
rural poverty reduction and increased rice production. At full development
(1990), the irrigation construction component would result in increased palay
production of 106,000 tons a year through higher yields, higher cropping
intensities and expanded physical area under rice. At current milling stand-
ards for Philippine rice, this additional production would have an export
value of about US$37.1 million in estimated mid-1982 world prices, or US$22.5
million in farmgate prices. After deducting production costs, it would mean
incremental net income of US$14.1 million to project farmers, or about US$588
per year for each of nearly 24,000 farm families. The nationwide strength-
ening of NIA's PIOs, and training of NIA and MOA staff and farmer leaders
would improve the efficiency in the implementation of NIA's planned irrigation
program, involving several hundred thousand ha of construction or rehabilita-
tion in the next ten years. No attempt has been made to quantify the benefits
of this institution strengthening, but it would introduce large improvements
in the quality, speed and efficiency of NIA works, including the O&M of
national systems managed by the PIOs, and in the O&M of communal systems by
irrigators. By organizing and training farmers and involving them in the
design and construction of their systems, it would improve the capacity and
incentive of irrigators to keep their systems in optimum condition, maximizing
production while reducing the future burden on NIA of O&M and costly rehabili-
tations. The irrigation construction component would cost about US$1,825 per
ha, or US$2,550 per directly-benefitting farm family (1982 prices); this is in
line with the per hectare costs of previous Bank-assisted irrigation projects
in the Philippines, and considerably cheaper than the historical average cost
per direct beneficiary.
9.02      Beneficiaries.  Of the nearly 24,000 farm families representing
roughly 144,000 people who would benefit directly from the irrigation
construction component, those currently growing rainfed crops and those
opening new areas to cultivation would benefit more than farmers currently
using irrigation in both absolute and proportionate terms. Share tenant
farmers would gain more in proportionate terms than owner operators, but less
in absolute terms. Absentee landlords, receiving the difference between
incremental net income of owner-operators and share tenants, would get about
one-fifth of the total incremental net incomes at full development. They are
not included among benefitting families because no reliable estimate of their
numbers is available. Smaller owner-operators would gain proportionately
slightly more than larger owner-operators and the reverse would be true for
share tenants. Most of the CIS farmers in the country not directly
benefitting from project irrigation construction would receive indirect



- 53 -
benefits from the training and PIO strengthening components of the project,
since they depend on the PIOs for periodic assistance in dealing with
technical problems and in undertaking rehabilitation works.
9.03      Fiscal Impact.  Because of the easy repayment terms which local
laws offer to IAs on construction loans, there would be an element of
indirect subsidy for the CIS farmers in the project (para. 8.07). In
accounting terms, the net charge on the Government-s fiscal resources would
be the interest payments on the Bank loan, less additional revenues from land
taxes resulting from higher values on project-assisted land (estimated to
total roughly P 2.3 million per annum at full development).
9.04      Employment Effect.  The project would create additional employment
from three sources: (a) initial construction activities generating over
31,000 man-years of full-time employment - about 63% of which would be paid
in cash, the remainder credited to the IAs 10% share of construction costs -
over a period of about five years, assuming 250 man-days per year; (b) opera-
tion and maintenance of new and rehabilitated systems generating 400 incre-
mental man-years per year at full development (although incremental paid
labor would exceed 500 man-years owing to the expected shift in O&M respon-
sibilities toward regular paid IA employees);/l and (c) more intensive
farming operations generating over 10,000 incremental man-years per year at
full development. The incremental farm employment represents an increase of
80% in rice farm labor use by directly benefitting farmers. This additional
demand for labor would not represent a constraint on production, but rather
would greatly reduce seasonal unemployment in the benefiting area, and would
be increasingly important in the future as the rural labor force,
particularly landless labor, continues to grow in numbers. Even at peak
months the demand is unlikely to exceed labor supply, assuming 24 man-days
per month and 2.5 workers per family. The project would help to maintain
constant or even slightly improved real wages for local unskilled labor,
preventing any continuation of the deterioration of real wages seen during
the 1970s.
9.05      Effect on Food Availability and Prices.  Incremental project pro-
duction would increase food availability, particularly in relatively remote
areas. Food availability in most areas is of less concern than food afford-
ability. The project would greatly increase the total purchasing power of
the small farmers who comprise the bulk of its beneficiaries, while contri-
buting marginally to the restraint of rice price increases. The irrigation
construction component of the project would greatly increase local rice
production, but would add only about 1% to national production in 1990.
Existing trade channels minimize inter-regional rice price variations, and
hence the project is expected to have negligible effect on rice prices.
/1 With the project, total O&M labor would be 957 man-years, 653 of which
would be paid in cash. Without the project, total O&M labor would be
556 man-years, only 151 of which would be paid in cash.

Financial and Economic Analysis
9.06      Financial Analysis.  The financial analysis of the project deals
with quantifiable benefits and costs; benefits of PIO strengthening and
training are not readily quantifiable, and were not included in the analy-
sis, nor were their costs. Benefits included in the analysis were limited
to the increased value of palay production in 1982 farmgate prices. Costs
included were of two types: increased costs of rice production, and irri-
gation system construction costs. Benefits and production costs were esti-
mated by compiling farm budgets for twelve farm types: for currently rain-
fed rice, irrigated rice and rainfed corn, owner-operator and share tenant
cases were selected, and within each case larger and smaller farms were
modeled. The approximate number of farms represented by each type, and
their phasing of entry into the project, were also estimated. Then the farm
types were aggregated to yield total farm benefits and costs. These were
matched against construction costs, and assumed to extend for 30 years. The
budgets are shown in Annex 4, Tables 2, 3 and 5. The total capital costs of
construction activities would be US$61.3 million, yielding a financial
internal rate of return of 21.5% over 30 years.
9.07      Economic Analysis.  Economic analysis measures the net impact of
the project on the economy; thus the distinction between owner-operator and
share tenant is no longer important, since both farm types use similar
resources and techniques to produce similar outputs.  Farm size also was
found to be relatively unimportant in determining net crop revenue per ha.
Annex 4, Table 5 therefore shows the farm budgets in economic terms for
rainfed and irrigated farms on a per ha basis. Unit prices are shown in
Annex 4, Table 1 and are assumed to remain constant over the period of
analysis. All tradeable components are valued directly in foreign exchange
and converted to local currency at the official exchange rate and adjusted
for local transport and handling. Specific coversion factors have been used
for all nontradeable inputs and outputs. Farm labor is priced at P 4.90
per day, based on an average financial wage of P 11.30 per day adjusted by
the conversion factor of 0.52 for rural unskilled labor and the consumption
conversion factor of 0.84. Construction costs were adjusted by the con-
struction conversion factor of 0.827. Aggregation of farm budgets was done
as in the financial analysis, and the overall results of both financial and
economic analyses are shown in Table 9.1. The economic internal rate of
return, based on the 33 representative sample subprojects, is estimated at
19.2% over 30 years.

/c  Of the 33 subprojects appraised in detail, 25 are new systems and 8 are
for rehabilitation of existing systems. The rates of return for the indi-
vidual new subprojects range from 10% to 31%, and for the individual
rehabilitation subprojects from 16% to 36%.
Sensitivity Analysis
9.08      Both financial and economic analyses were subjected to tests to
determine the response of the internal rate of return to adverse changes
in benefits and costs. The results are summarized in Table 9.2. The most
adverse changes would be delays in benefits with costs incurred on
schedule; a lag of three years in the onset of benefits would reduce the
financial and economic rate of return to 11.2% and 9.4%, respectively.
Such a long delay is highly unlikely on such small, simple systems. A
one-year lag, which is more possible, and an accompanying cost overrun of
20% would reduce the rates of return to 12.3% and 9.9%, respectively.



- 56 -
Switching values, based on a 10% opportunity cost of capital, show the rates
of return to be far more sensitive to reductions in benefits than to increases
in costs. Even so, benefits would have to fall by 32% (financial) and 25%
(economic) in order to reduce the project's financial and economic rates of
return to the opportunity cost of capital.

Environmental Effects
9.09      CISs generally would have slight environmental impacts because they
would be small, widely dispersed, near foothills on well-drained upper plains,
and without storage structures. Hence, schistosomiasis and malaria vectors
are seldom a problem. Only seven subprojects, in four provinces, are located
in schistosomiasis endemic areas, and most of the subprojects located in
malaria endemic provinces are at elevations where malaria rarely occurs.
Since canals are used for domestic purposes such as swimming and laundering,
some health risks would occur if human, animal or household wastes find their
way into the canals. Optimum levels of fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide
use are seldom achieved in CISs, but use rates are expected to rise under the
project, and some harm to downstream aquatic and shore life could result. To
deal with these minor potential problems, several measures have been planned:
(a) drainage facilities have been included in each subproject design; (b) the



- 57 -
Ministry of Health would continue its current monitoring of disease vectors in
endemic areas; (c) the project's monitoring program of selected subprojects
would examine water quality; (d) crop production training programs would
stress the environmental and economic importance of the appropriate use of
chemical inputs; and (e) water management training courses for IAs would
include explanations of the health as well as the agricultural importance of
inspecting and maintaining irrigation and drainage systems.
Risks
9.10      The National Irrigation Administration has had a long and generally
successful experience with the construction of CISs, and hence no risks are
foreseen in construction activities. The O&M and cost repayment aspects of
such systems have a less sucessful history, however, and the participatory
approach to future communal irrigation development has not been tried on such
a large scale as NIA is now planning to undertake (see para. 1.30). Yet it
offers the most reasonable prospect of solving the managerial/O&M problems of
CISs. The management of NIA is fully committed to the participatory approach,
and would monitor its progress carefully in order to correct any problems as
soon as they are identified. Hence, this area of risk is also the best hope
for future development of the communal irrigation subsector.
9.11      Projected crop yields which assume a significant increase in the use
of fertilizers, crop protection chemicals and other inputs may not materialize
if the increases in prices of the inputs are not adequately compensated by a
corresponding higher price for palay. There is the added uncertainty that
many farmers may be ineligible to borrow funds from the rural or other banks
because of their default of past loans. Moreover many of the rural banks
themselves do not have access to the Central Bank's rediscounting mechanism
because of a high level of arrears in their outstanding portfolio. These
problems affect the entire agricultural sector and can only be addressed by
policies which improve the economic efficiency of input supply and which
suitably modify the regulations governing the operation of rural banks. The
Government continually reviews the ratio of input to product prices, and has
made periodic adjustments to the latter to reflect rising production costs,
having regard at the same time to the interest of consumers. With regard to
credit, the Government has recently taken steps, through suitable amendments
to the regulations of the Monetary Board, to enable a larger number of rural
banks (including many which were hitherto excluded) to participate in agri-
cultural credit programs. Loan defaults by borrowers have been dealt with by
rescheduling the repayments, particularly where arrears result from natural
calamities like typhoons and floods; it is the Government's policy to deal
sympathetically with defaults arising from force majeure.
9.12      Unrestrained deforestation in the watersheds poses a general risk
to irrigation development. While the overall encroachment of the watersheds
is to some extent unavoidable because of a growing shortage of cultivable
land, the Government is committed to a program of regulated watershed
management, and has already obtained the assistance of the Bank and other



- 58 -
donors in this regard. The ongoing Bank-assisted Watershed Management and
Erosion Control Project (Loan 1890-PH) includes a provision for two feasibil-
ity studies which are expected to create a basis for further Bank support to
watershed protection and development. In the communal irrigation areas it is
also expected that the participatory approach would be particularly effective
in engendering an interest in protecting the watersheds.
10. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
10.01     During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government on the
following principal points:
(a) NIA would by December 31, 1983, begin to implement a phased
program satisfactory to the Bank and IFAD with a view to achieve by
December 31, 1985, a uniform set of selection criteria and design
standards satisfactory to the Bank and IFAD to be applied to all its
communal irrigation systems, regardless of financing source
(para. 4.15);
(b) NIA would submit for review by the Bank prior to implementation
full evaluation reports for subprojects costing more than
P 5.0 million each, and summary data forms for subprojects
costing less than P 5.0 million (para. 4.16);
(c)  NIA would submit for review by the Bank and IFAD before December 31,
1982, the indicators that would be monitored and other details of
the M&E system (para. 4.19);
(d) NIA would prepare by December 31, 1982, for review by the Bank,
terms of reference for consulting services for the financial
reporting system study (para. 4.23);
(e) NIA would establish the Special Account and the counterpart Operat-
ing Account and maintain and operate the accounts in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank and IFAD (para. 5.06);
(f) NIA would ensure that the aggregate cost of civil works done by
force account would not exceed 40% of the total cost of civil
works, or US$32 million (para. 5.08);
(g) NIA would cause all its regional and provincial offices to maintain
separate accounts for the project. These would be collated by the
Project Manager. After audit by the COA, the project accounts,
together with the auditor's comments, as well as his opinion on
the certification of expenditure on force account works, would be
sent to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal
year (para. 5.12);



- 59 -
(h) the existing level of capital cost repayment expected of project
beneficiaries would not be reduced, and NIA would send to the Bank
by December 31, 1983, a report detailing current estimates of the
level of water charges, the capacity of the beneficiaries to pay,
and actual collection rates, and explaining the Government's policy
on irrigation project cost recovery and measures to improve collec-
ion of water charges (para. 8.09).
10.02     Subject to the above assurances, the proposed project would be
suitable for a Bank loan of US$71.1 million. The loan, which includes a
capitalized front-end fee of 1.5% on the Bank loan, would have a term of
20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 11.6% p.a.   The
borrower would be the Republic of the Philippines.

because of the uneven distribution of expenditures over the year, only 40%
of the expenditures were subjected to a half-year of price increases) and
1987 (for which, because expenditures would be completed by mid-year, only
one quarter of that year's price increase was applied).
Note: Totals may not add because of rounding of the decimals.

/a  The regional profile covers 44 projects, and the country profile covers 10
projects.  The proposed project is essentially different from its predeces-
sors in so far as it would pick up a time-slice of ongoing activity in the
subsector. Detailed reasons in support of the estimated schedule of dis-
bursements are given in para. 5.11.
lb High initial disbursements are due to the front-end fee (US$1.05 million)
and the retroactive financing (of up to US$1.5 million) for expenditures
from January 1, 1982.

/a  Figures in parentheses are for share tenants; other figures are for owner-operators.  Production costs include cost of
labor.
/b  Values shown are for rainfed land converted to irrigated land, and reflect a cropping intensity of 165%.
77  Share tenants and owner-operators apply inputs at equal rates.  Extensive surveys show that landlords pay varying shares
of share tenant inputs depending on type of input.
/d  Proportion of paid mechanical cultivation 10% at present, 20% in future without project, and 40% in future with project.
7e  Cost is for seeds: seedling pulling, bundling, scattering and transplanting is done by exchange labor.
7f  Water charges are the sum of P 125/ha for operation and maintenance, and 2% of the debt per hectare incurred by the
irrigators' association for system construction. Debt per hectare is 90% of total capital cost per ha, and based on a
sample of 25 proposed projects for 1982 would average about P 13,300/ha.
/g  Includes threshing, of which 30% is mechanical at present, 40% in future without project, and 50% in future with
project.
/h  All production credit is for six months, with loan size based on any excess of an assumed minimum consumption level of
P 4,800 over net crop revenue but never exceeding cash production costs (excluding the landlord's crop share). For
owner-operators, interest would fall from 28% p.a. to 20% p.a. with the project because higher net revenues would
increase the share of low-cost formal credit in total borrowings. For share tenants, the same effect would reduce
average interest from 38% to 26% p.a.
/i  Minor costs of sacks, string, etc.
73  Land tax is 1% of assessed value if value is no more than P 3,000/ha, or 2% if value exceeds P 3,000/ha.  Assessed
values are assumed to he P 2,400/ha for rainfed land, P 3,200/ha for unimproved irrigated land, and P 3,600/ha for
new or improved irrigated land. Landlord's share is 50% of gross crop revenue.
/k  Farmgate palay price mid-1982 is P 1,499/ton.  Share tenants and owner-operators achieve equal yields.
/1  Incremental is excess of future with over future without project.

COMMUNAL IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Accounting Procedures for Force Account Work and Minor Contracts
1.        Force account work for the proposed project would include the
construction of on-farm facilities for all subprojects, construction of
laterals for new subprojects up to 500 ha size, and repair and improvement
of diversion works and laterals for all rehabilitation subprojects. Some
office buildings and workshops may also be constructed through force account.
In the past, NIA has experienced considerable difficulty in attracting bids
for such works. On-farm development has the added difficulty of execution on
short notice to avoid interrupting the growing season and to account for bad
weather. Moreover, farmers can appreciate the construction of such works on
their fields only when they see palpable evidence of water availability after
the construction of the main conveyance facilities. Reimbursement for force
account expenditures would be based on the statements of expenditure
procedure. The same procedure would be used for minor civil works contracts
less than P 1 million each. The aggregate amount of civil works done by
force account would not exceed 40% of the total cost of civil works, or
US$32 million.
2.        NIA maintains reliable records on physical progress of works,
materials quantities and payments to contractors. Systems and procedures at
both headquarters and provinces are adequate to account for these expenditures
on an item by item basis. Under the proposed project Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs) would be used to justify disbursements for both force
account work and certain payments to contractors. NIA's system for preparing
and verifying SOEs is good; Bank supervision missions would verify at random
completed works and related accounts.
3.        NIA receives yearly budget allocations from the Government for each
project.  The project office prepares a detailed work plan and assigns job
codes. Separate job codes are assigned for contract and force account works.
Detailed cost estimates are prepared for each job by the field offices with
headings for equipment use and time, major materials (centrally procured),
miscellaneous materials (locally procured), direct labor, fuel and lubricants
and engineering supervision. These cost estimates are subject to the review
of an auditor from COA attached to each project/regional office. For the
proposed project, the expenditure would be incurred and monthly accounts would
be submitted by each provincial office to the regional office. All payment
vouchers and monthly accounts are reviewed by the Auditor. The accounting
section of the regional office would verify expenditures for each job code
against the estimated cost and submit to the project manager in NIA's central
office a summary of expenditure with copies of payment vouchers. NIA's
central office would prepare the withdrawal application using the monthly
summary for the project.

Page 2
4.        Regarding force account works, disbursements would be based on a
percentage of the product of quantities of the following major items of work
and agreed unit rates. Documentation to support disbursements would identify
the location of the completed works. The unit rates would be based on the
analysis for each item to be submitted by NIA with supporting documents for
Bank review before September 30, 1982, or before claiming first disbursement
for force account work, whichever is earlier. These unit rates would exclude
the depreciation of the equipment directly financed under the project. Unit
rates would be revised periodically based on NIA's detailed accounts and
verification of actual expenditures by supervision missions. For minor
contracts subject to the statement of expenditures procedure, NIA would retain
copies of contracts, progress reports, invoices and evidence of payments made
to contractors for periodic review by Bank and IFAD staff.
