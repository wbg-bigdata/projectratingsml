HEMORANDUM AND RECOMOENDATION 0 THE PRESIDENT
OF TgE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR AN OYO STATE URBAN PROJECT (IDF II)
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Federal Republic of Nigeria for US$50.0 million is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with 20 years maturity
including a five-year grace period and would help finance an urban
infrastructure rehabilitation project in Oyo State. The project would be
cofinanced by a grant from the Government of Japan for US$3.7 million
equivalent.
2.        Background.  Oyo State, with a 1988 population of over 10 million of
which about 60S live in urban areas is, after the city-state of Lagos, the
most urbanized state in Nigeria. Many of its largest towns pre-date colonial
times and are primarily trading and service centers with significant inputs
and support for agricultural activities. These old Yoruba towns with their
traditional dense core areas surrounded by haphazard newer developments, which
lack any organizing structure, planning and urban services, are not geared to
meet the present demands of industry, commerce, communications and services.
3.        Ibadan, the state capital and second largest city in Nigeria, with
an estimated population of three million, is the major commercial, industrial,
educational and administrative center of the southwestern region of Nigeria.
The provision of basic services and infrastructure particularly to the poor,
has lagged behind the city's rapid population growth (about 5? per annum).
Past neglect of the local revenue base and of operations and maintenance of
assets has led to scarce financial resources, deteriorated infrastructure and
costly and inefficient services, which add significantly to the cost of
private sector business activities. To further exacerbate the problem, the
rapid uncontrolled and dense urban sprawl has made it difficult to improve
access and services to the newly developed areas. There is, therefore, an
urgent need to establish an effective urban planning and investment framework
and to address identified deficiencies while mobilizing financial resources.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has been approached by the
Oyo State and the Federal Governments for assistance in financing an urban
rehabilitation and development project. The Bank is in a good position to
respond effectively to this request given its experience in similar projects
in the sector, especially with the Infrastructure Development Fund (IDF)
Project (Ln. 2925-UNI) approved in March 1988. In view of the severity of the
urban problems, the urgency and scope of the state's investment needs in the
major towns, and the lack of alternative financing, the participation of the
Bank is appropriate. The Bank's lending strategy in the urban sector, which
has evolved from the lessons of past and ongoing projects, supports in the
short-term, a wholesale financing mechanism established under thz IDF Project
for funding priorit  city-wide investments with h'gh returns and a particular
focus on rehabili. tion and maintenance of existing assets.



5.        The IDF approach combines institution-building for project
preparation, along with incentives for states and municipal authorities to
strengthen financial performance. It relies on selected domestic financial
intermediaries, which in Nigeria represent a concentration of management,
marketing, and financial expertise. to prepare. appraise, finance, and
supervise urban projects and sub-projects. It is consistent with the Bank's
overall financial sector strategy in Nigeria. That strategy combines support
for the macroeconomic reforms that underpin efficient financial policies with
specific support for financial reform, focussed on banking supervision and
regulation, systemic solvency, and the instruments of monetary control. These
issues are to be addressed in the proposed Budgetary and Financial Policy
Loan, later this year. The Bank's sectoral lending strategy focuses on
creating fiscal self-sufficiency at the state level and strengthening
municipal authorities in order to promote more efficient, equitable and
sustainable delivery of urban services. The participating local banks,
involvement combines institution-building for project preparation, along with
incentives for states and municipal authorities to strengthen their financial
performance.
6.        Prosect Obiectives.  The main objectives of the project are to:  (a)
promote the efficient functioning of Ibadan and of Oyo State's secondary towns
as regional development and service centers; (b) strengthen the financial,
operational and managerial capacity of the institutions responsible for urban
management and services at the state and local levels; (c) mobilize financial
resources at the state and local government levels; and td) improve urban
physical and investment planning, coordination and evaluation. A long-term
sector financial and urban objective is to develop a market for state and
municipal bonds through which a significant portion of the infrastructure
programs of states and local authorities can be financed. In order to attain
this objective, the capital market must develop confidence in state investment
projects, and develop the capacity to appraise these projects. The states, in
turn, must establish their creditworthiness and demonstrate the ability to
prepare high priority infrastructure programs, within their financial and
managerial capacity, and in balance with other state investment needs. The
IDF approach will contribute to the achievement of these objectives, by
enhancing the ability of state and municipal authorities--and domestic
financial institutions--to prepare projects for financing through local bond
markets.
7.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project components are:
(a) infrastructure rehabilitation in Ibadan: flood control through
channelization and maintenance of major storm drains; improved solid waste
management; and integrated community improvement programs in three pilot
areas; (b) a line of credit for infrastructure improvements in selected local
government towns; (c) revenue enhancement and institutional strengthening
through the provision of technical assistance, training and equipment to Oyo
State and local government institutions to help plan and implement improved
financial management systems and enhanced revenue generation, particularly
property taxation in Ibadan, and to strengthen their capacities to plan,
implement, manage, operate and maintain urban infrastructure and services; and
(d) support to the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMWH) for
coordinating and monitoring project implementation. Under arrangements



modeled on the ID? mechanism, eligible participating financial intermediaries
(PFIs) would act as administrators for US$31.7 million of Bank funds for the
Bank-appraised Ibadan infrastructure components of the project, and onlend
US$17.5 million of Bank funds received from the FGN to OYSG for the local
government line of credit. OYSG in turn would re-lend these funds to eligible
local governments in Oyo State for financing urban infrastructure
improvements. The PFIs would also finance approximately 10 percent of the
project costs and be responsible for preparation, appraisal and supervision of
infrastructure rehabilitation subprojects in the selected local government
towns. FMWH would be provided with US$0.8 million for technical assistance
and training. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$68.8 million
with a foreign exchange component of US$53.7 million (782). A US$3.7 million
equivalent grant from the Government of Japan will cofinance the technical
assistance and training. Retroactive financing up to US$1.5 million would be
provided for eligible expenditures incurred by OYSG after September 1, 1989.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Nigeria are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Maps are also attached as well as the Staff Appraisal Report
No. 7488-UNI dated April 12, 1990.
8.        Agreed Actions.  Agreement reached between the Bank, FGN and OYSG
include the following: (a) implementation of the project by FGN in accordance
with the IDF Policy Statement and Project Guidelines previously established
under the IDF Project; (b) commitment of the funds in the line of credit for
local government subprojects within three years of loan effectiveness;
(c) OYSG compliance with Bank procurement guidelines; (d) OYSG to achieve
revenue targets starting in 1990 by an average of 5X annually in real terms
over a 5-year period; (e) annual monitoring of the financial performance of
the PFIs; and (f) commitment by Ibadan Municipal Government to introduce an
enhanced tenement rating system in Ibadan. Conditions of loan effectiveness
are: (a) land acquisition for resettlement areas and sites for solid waste
operations; and (b) appointment of a senior engineer and a senior accountant
for the Project Coordination Unit of OYSG. Conditions of Disbursement for the
line of credit component are that (a) a sub-loan has been made in accordance
with agreed procedures and terms and conditions; and (b) the PFI making the
sub-loan has entered into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the FGN.
9.        Benefits.  Economic benefits under the project would derive from:
(a) more efficient allocation of limited financial resources by OYSG and
mobilization of additional funds by OYSG and local governments; (b) more
appropriate urban development, planning and management systems and practices;
(c) improved urban infrastructure and services enhancing prospects for
industrial investments and employment; and (d) reduction of flood damage to
lives ai.d property, increased property values, and improved sanitation and
environmental conditions, particularly benefitting the poor. The economic
rate of return is about 222.
10.      Risks.  The risks associated with the project include difficulties
in obtaining required inter-agency coordination and political reluctance to
implement resource mobilization measures. The project will reduce these risks



-4-
through the establishment of an interministerial committee, technical
assistance and training (some to be provided through municipal partncrship
arrangements). Furthermore, improvements in tax management, billing axd
collection will be preceded by visible improvements to infrastructure and
service delivery so as to increase the public's willingness to pay. The risks
of political interference in the credit decisions of PFIs have been minimized
by the selection of participating Nigerian financial intermediaries with
strong management and technical capability.
11.       Recommendtion.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
