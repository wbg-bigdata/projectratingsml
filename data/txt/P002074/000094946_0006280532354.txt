3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The major objectives of the project were to: (i) strengthen the financial, operational and management
capacity of the institutions responsible for urban management and services at state and local government
(LG) levels; (ii) improve strategic urban planning, investment programming, budgeting and coordination;
(iii) introduce appropriate cost recovery mechanisms and mobilize financial resources at the state and LG
levels; and (iv) remove major city-wide infrastructure constraints, thereby promoting the efficient
functioning of lbadan and Oyo state's other major urban areas as regional development and service centers,
with emphasis on maintenance and rehabilitation of existing assets, and improved investment planning and
management.
3.2 Revised Objective:
N/A
3.3 Original Components:
(a)    Ibadan Infrastructure Rehabilitation
(i)    Stonn drainage and flood control, involving channelisation of about 14.5 km priority
sections of major flood prone urban streams; replacement of undersized bridges and
culverts; essential drain maintenance equipment (excavators, loaders and trucks); and
funds for dredging and rehabilitating 50 km of additional drains;
(ii)    Solid waste management, providing 40 skip collection trucks, 300 Nos. 8m/3 skips, 6
transfer haulage trucks and 15 Nos. 60 m3 trailers, 4, 000 ton/day refuse transfer station
with attached central offices and workshop, development of 150 ha. new sanitary landfill
site, including a 3.5km long access road, and heavy equipment for landfill operations;
(iii)   Environmental rehabilitation, involving reclamation of the existing 20 ha. refuse dump and
erosion restoration and control works on about 50 ha. of eroding slopes;
(iv)   Spare parts credit facility for private minibus owners and assistance to the Vehicle
Inspection Office (VIO); and
(v)    Community improvement programs (CIP) in 3 pilot areas covering some 140 ha. and
benefiting about 66,000 people with irnproved roads, footpaths, drains, water supply,
waste disposal, power supply and street lighting, as weSll as telephone and community
facilities. The CIP was also planned to include the development of two resettlement areas,
comprising a total of 150 plots of land to serve about 150 families displaced by the drain
channelisation and the CIP.
(b)    Selected LG Towns and other LG centers
A line of credit for the towns of Ile-Ife. Ilesa, Ogbomosho, Osogbo, Oyo and Saki as well as other
eligible LG centers to finance:
(i)    preparation of structure plans, infrastructure development plans and investment programs;
(ii)   priority works of city-wide infrastructure rehabilitation and integrated CIPs; and
(iii)  institutional support measures to strengthen revenue generation and municipal
management, particularly the planning and maintenance f unctions of LGs.
- 2 -



(c)    Revenue Enhancement and Institutional Strengthening
Training, technical assistance and supporting equipment for all institutions involved in planning,
implementation and management of urban infrastructure and services, including:
(i)    Project Coordination Unit (PCU) within the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
(MFEP);
(ii)   Internal Revenue Department of MFEP;
(iii)   Departmnent of Local Government (DLG) through coordination and training for rating and
valuation and assistance for LG development;
(iv)   Ibadan Municipal Government (IMG);
(v)    Ministry of Lands, Housing and Surveys (MLHS) for producing Ibadan digitized maps;
(vi)   Environmental Protection Commission (EPC) through drainage maintenance assistance,
operational assistance to solid waste management; and
(vii)   Ministry of Works and Transport (MWT) for transport and traffic planning and for
maintenance operations.
(d)    Support to the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMWH)
(i)    staff training in project selection, approval and supervision;
(ii)   training and study funds for post-evaluation of urban infrastructure projects;
(iii)   consultant services to undertake regular project performance audits;
(iv)   study funds to prepare other state projects; and
(v)    vehicles and equipment to support project activities.
3.4 Revised Components:
The project was not revised, but a total of US$ 10 million was cancelled at the time of the mid-temi review
in November 1995 due to the failure of three LGs in Oyo State to produce their agreed counterpart funds
and also to slow progress of the three LGs in Osun State. Phase II assistance (line of credit for priority
investments) to three LGs was therefore discontinued (section 3.3 b).
3.5 QualitvatEntry:
N/A
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project's objectives were not specific but general and broad ranging, and therefore it has been difficult
to measure their attainment. However, most of the project's components were completed in an attempt to
meet the objectives articulated at appraisal.
The objective to strengthen the financial, operational and management capacity of the institutions
responsible for urban management and services at the state and LG levels was partially met. Training
programs were developed and work attachments for all institutions involved in planning, implementation
and management of urban infrastructure and services were successfully implemented. A total of about 400
officers benefited from training, both locally and outside Nigeria, to enhance their competence on the job.
The duration of the different types of training programs ranged from two to six weeks. Capacity building
training was implemented for the Solid Waste Management Authority (SWMA) benefiting 40 staff. A
computer skill center was established in the State Ministry of Finance for the project staff use. The
rehabilitation of building, procurement of furniture and equipment for the Simeon Adebo Staff
Development Center (SDC) was implemented to enhance SDC's role in capacity building. To the extent
- 3-



that the training was implemented and the institutional strengthening components were completed, capacity
was enhanced. However, no measures were put in place to measure their impact.
Additionally, this project was a follow-up of the completed IDF I project (Loan 2925) in which a
wholesaling mechanism was piloted to finance infrastructure at the LG level through the private financial
sector and also build up management capacity of the LGs. If the LGs had financed their sub-projects
through the IDF mechanism they would have been supported to build institutional capacity to implement
infrastructure projects through the private sector. It did not work. The private financial institutions (PFIs)
considered the state governments (which channelled funds to the LGs) too high a credit risk and were
unwilling to lend for long term infrastructure financing despite their commitments at appraisal. Moreover,
the LGs were unable to provide the counterpart funding to carry out their sub-projects, and thus this
objective could not be met (see also section 7.6).
The objective to introduce appropriate cost recovery mechanisms and mobilize financial resources at the
state and LG levels was partially met. The introduction of a valuation-based property tax system under the
project provided an up-to-date property tax base as a basis for billing and collecting much needed revenue
for the LGs. Property enumeration and valuations were carried out in the five Ibadan Municipality LGs.
This resulted in a revised tenement rate edict and the introduction of a more viable valuation based
tenement rate system. The establishment of a State Valuation Office (SVO) and zonal valuation office at
LGs helped to improve administration of the tenement rate system in the State. The computerization of the
valuation records provided the basis for establishment of an integrated information system for valuation
records and a platform to investigate, analyze, review and report on the revenue generating program of the
LGs. However, the billing and collection machinery at the LG level remains weak and would need
continued support from the SVO for the foreseeable future. The political will to collect tenement rates also
remains weak.
The objective to remove major city-wide infrastructure constraints, thereby promoting the efficient
functioning of Ibadan was achieved. The project financed rehabilitation of 54 vehicles and equipment and
procurement of 23 vehicles, plant and equipment for operation of the Solid Waste Management Authority.
The project also financed rehabilitation of the Ibadan Municipal Government workshop, the Environmental
Protection Commission yard, the Ring Road disposal site, and the eroded slopes of Upper Ogunpa
catchment. An office complex for EPC (now State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)) and SWMA
was also built. The construction of two landfill sites at Lapite and Aba-Eku, with a capacity of 25 and 60
ha respectively, and a transfer station at Aperin with ancillary equipment were financed and successfully
completed.
The objective to improve strategic urban planning, investment programming, budgeting and coordination
was not met. Due to implementation delays, the components related to this objective were canceled and
funds reallocated to the then on-going storm drainage component (section 3.4).
4.2 Outputs by components:
The project's outputs were fairly satisfactorily completed, except for the storm drainage and flood control
component which constituted about 30 percent of the original project cost.; this component was only about
20 percent completed at project closing. Similarly, the prioritization studies for city-wide infrastructure
rehabilitation and institutional support measures to strengthen revenue generation and municipal
management for LGs in Oyo State (Oyo, Ogbomoso, and Saki) were not implemented due to the inability of
the affected LGs to contribute the agreed 25 percent of the project cost, which led to the cancellation of
US$10 million from the loan for the Phase II program in six LG towns of Oyo and Osun States. Neither
was the preparation of a structure and investment plan for these towns carried out. However, project
-4 -



identification and prioritization studies were carried out for LGs in Osun State (Osogbo, Ile-Ife and Ilesa).
Solid Waste Management: The refuse disposal site at Ring Road which, had been overflowing with solid
waste and constituted a nuisance and environmental hazard for several years, was restored to an
environmentally friendly site. Rehabilitation of the 20 ha landfill site, planting of trees and general
landscaping, arrested pollution of ground and surface water in the neighboring residential areas. The
rehabilitated area has been turned into a public park.
Two landfill sites and a transfer station were constructed to enhance solid waste collection and disposal in
Ibadan city and are effectively being used. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) carried out for the
landfill site at Aba-Eku and the Ogunpa Channelisation identified some environmental hazards and made
recommendations for mitigating the hazards. The mitigation measures were taken into account during the
design of the landfill site at Aba-Eku.
Environmental management: To reduce the incidence of increased runoff of surface water during and after
heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of the Upper Ogunpa river, stone masonry retaining walls were
constructed. Erosion gullies were filled, drains desilted, soil and vegetative cover restored and the slopes
stabilized through tree planting and grassing.
Spare Parts Credit Facility: A line of credit was established for spare parts, to improve public
transportation within Ibadan Municipality which offered assistance to public transport operators, through
easy access to spare parts. However, operation of the spare parts warehouse was poorly managed with
serious irregularities. This led to the cancellation of contract staff appointments and closure of the
warehouse. An audit of the accounts of the scheme was conducted, following which the remaining spare
parts were disposed by public auction.
A vehicle and some equipment were procured for the Vehicle Inspection Office to enable the inspectorate to
test public transport vehicles for road worthiness, and drivers for competence. A road maintenance study,
with the objective of setting up a road maintenance system, was successfully completed. However, the
necessary follow-up actions, which included organization of a workshop on the road maintenance study and
implementation of the recommended five-year maintenance program, was not implemented. The study was
handed over to the Ministry of Transport for implementation of its recommendations under the Multi State
Roads Project (Cr. 2415).
The Community Improvement Program (CIP) which involved upgrading of a comprehensive range of
essential infrastructure and services in an integrated manner in three predominantly poor neighborhoods
(Mokola, Yemetu and Agugu) was successfully completed. The program was implemented with the active
involvement of both the local governments (through a CIP unit created under the project) and the three
communities from the planning phase through implementation. The CIP unit educated the communities on
their responsibility for operations and maintenance. A total of 26 km of roads, 48 km of drains, social
infrastructure, including V.I.P. toilets, health centers, fire station, post office, community water supply and
electricity supply, were provided in the three communities. Additionally, a storm drainage and flood
control scheme was implemented. The facilities have been handed over to the appropriate government
agencies and communities. An impact assessment study of the CIP scheme concluded that the CIP has
provided benefits which have improved the health and living conditions of the residents of the three
communities. These include, easy access to transport, reduction in the incidence of flooding, clean and
healthy environment, improved electricity supply and better planned development.
Revenue Enhancement: The introduction of a valuation based property tax under the project provided an
- 5 -



up-to-date property tax base. Property enumeration and valuations were carried out in the five LGs of
Ibadan Municipality. This resulted in a revised tenement rate edict and introduction of a viable valuation
based tenement rate system. The establishment of a State Valuation Office and zonal valuation offices at
LGs have marginally improved administration of the tenement rate system in the State. Computerization of
the valuation records provided the basis for the establishment of an integrated infonnation system for
valuation records and a platform to investigate, analyze, review and repcrt on the LGs revenue generating
program. However, as mentioned in section 4.1 above, the billing and collection machinery at the LG level
remains weak.
Institutional Support: The agencies involved in urban development, NMFEP, DLG, IMG, MLHS, EPC,
MWT and FMWH all benefited as intended at appraisal. An office complex, built to provide
accommodation for the former EPC (now SEPA) and the Board of SWMIA, was completed and is being
occupied by SEPA. The EPC yard and IMG workshop which were in disrepair were rehabilitated and
currently house over 75 trucks, heavy equipment, containers and other waste management facilities. A total
of 54 vehicles, plant and equipment were rehabilitated and 13 vehicles, plant and equipment were procured.
These were handed over to the SWMA established under the pro ject for w;aste collection and disposal. The
initiative of carrying out plant and vehicle rehabilitation and maintenance through contract by the private
sector has proved effective. Most vehicles have been kept on the road and in good operating condition
under this arrangement.
4.3 ,Vet Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Tfhe projected weighted average ERR was 22 percent, with ERR :for the flood control component estimated
at 21 percent, and the ERR for the Community Infrastructure Program (CIP) estimated at 24 percent, and
the project life assumed to be 25 years. The total cost of these two sub-components comprises 56 percent
of the rehabilitation component whose benefits were expected to be quantified pursuant to the methodology
established during project preparation. Benefits of the solid waste component were not measured during
the ex ante economic analysis as the least cost solution was adopted. At the ICR stage, the CIP was
completed, but the stonn water drainage and flood control component was only about 20 percent completed
in terms of kilometers of culverts, drains, bridges rehabilitated, dredged, etc. Since only 20 percent of the
drainage component was completed, benefits in terms of flood drainage prevention are likely to be minimal.
It is unlikely that any real benefit will result in the event of a 25-year flood or larger. Minor benefits may
accrue for smaller, more frequent rainfall events. Estimates of net benefits quantified from 5-year flood
damage prevention result in a negative ERR. Benefits for the CIP were not quantified due to data
constraints. A qualitative impact study conducted bv the relevant government ministry upon completion of
the CIP component failed to capture key benefits through appropriate data collection. However, the impact
study noted concrete benefits accruing from the CIP, including decremase in travel time, reduction in
maintenance cost of vehicles, increased street trading and commercial activitv due to improved roads and
street lighting, to name a few which are quantifiable. Also, property values have enhanced by 40% in CIP
areas as opposed to increases of 20% in surrounding non-project areas.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
N/A
4.5 Institufional development impact.
Training and technical assistance were provided, as intended in the SAR, to all institutions involved in
planning, implementation and management of urban infrastructure services. External and intemal formal
training benefited over 400 staff of the project agencies in areas suc]h as procurement, computers,
infrastructure maintenance, informnation systems, urban managernent ancl property taxation. Some staff
also benefited from work attachment in parallel agencies outside of Nigeria. This was supplemented by
-6 -



rehabilitation and/or construction of improved office facilities, procurement of furniture and equipment as a
means to upgrade performance. The impact of this training and technical assistance on overall institutional
development has not been assessed, as no measures were put in place in the project to deterrnine
institutional impact.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control ofgovernment or implementing agency:
Performance of the Contractors: Poor performance of the contractor on the storm drainage and flood
control component led to a decision to cancel this component. It took the contractor considerable time to
effectively mobilize on site even after payment of mobilization advance and issuance of commencement
notice. Construction of an office complex for the EPC (now SEPA) and the SWMA was also delayed as a
result of cash-flow problems and poor communication between the contractor, consultant and the PCD.
Performance of the Consultants: The intemational consultants and their local partner on the storm drainage
and flood control component were unable to work in harnony largely because of state government
interference. This was compounded by the high turnover of the intemational consultant's resident project
manager, which resulted in conflicting advice to the client at different times with adverse implications on
implementation. The consultant's contract for computerizing the valuation records was terminated for lack
of transparency in handling the bid evaluation for computer hardware. Additionally, under the Osun State
component, performance of the consultant on preparation of the priority components in the three local
governments was poor. Considerable time was lost in rectifying the anomalies in the design and omissions
in the bidding document, which led to the component not being implemented due to time constraints.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Delay in Meeting Effectiveness Condition: The effectiveness conditions included provision of a legal
opinion on the Loan Agreement (LA), Project Agreement (PA), Subsidiary loan agreement (SLA),
establishment of the mechanism for payment of counterpart contributions by Standing Payment Orders,
appointment of contract officers for the Project Coordination Department and timely commencement by the
implementing agencies. These took longer to complete than was originally anticipated in the SAR,
Macroeconomic Problems: The Nigerian economic environment suffered some major setbacks during
implementation period, including fiscal imbalances, inappropriate macro-economic policies and
unprecedented depreciation of the local currency. These led to price increases in construction materials and
cost overruns on the project components that were implemented.
Scarcity of Petroleum Products: Most of the contracts suffered delays as a result of a national scarcity of
petroleum products in early 1997, which resulted in arbitrary increases in the price of petrol and diesel
required by the contractors for their vehicles and equipment. This also led to increases in the cost of
construction materials and transportation.
Govemance Problems: Govemment officials and policies were changed very often. There were five
Govemors/Military Administrators in eight years, which adversely affected project implementation.
Govemment's Interference in Project Implementation: There was constant interference by the State
Govenmment in the administration of most of the contracts and on procurement issues. This was particularly
pronounced in the storm drainage and flood control contract where, as a result of constant interference, the
project witnessed a high rate of turnover of the consultant's international project manager. This lack of
continuity led to poor supervision and technical advice to OYSG. Interference, in some cases, resulted in
-7-



non-transparent procurement and contract award recommendations, which were unacceptable to the Bank
and caused undue delays.
Delay in Payment of Contractors' Certificates: The project suffered some delays in payment to contractors
and consultants due to slow payment procedures. This was due to the level of intemal administrative
approvals required for payment processing. For every payment, approval of the Military Administrator
(M.A.) was required, and he was not always readily accessible. Equally disastrous to the project were the
frequent changes in Government officials who were signatories to both the Special and Project Accounts,
i.e., Commissioners, Project Officials, and at times, the M.A.
Inefficient Project Coordination: The interministerial committee, set up as a Project Monitoring and
Implementation Committee, was functional only in the early stages of project implementation. There was
mutual suspicion of each other's role in the committee. The role of the committee was later taken over by
the office of the Commissioner of Finance. This arrangement also resulted in undue delays in granting
approvals for contracts and payments to contractors and consultants for services rendered.
Inadeguate Involvement of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMWH): FMWH did not provide
the necessary leadership, co-ordination and direction at the national level as was envisaged in the SAR.
Also, FMWH did not adequately administer the IDF Project Guidelines, and consequently failed to assume
primary responsibility for the project at the federal level.
Split of Ovo State: Osun State was carved out of Oyo in 1991. Some key staff who were involved in the
project from its inception were transferred to Osun State. This adversely affected project management and
implementation. Despite the experience of the transferred staff and the availability of funds from the
Japanese grant for engineering design and staff training, Osun State was unable to gather the administrative
capacity needed to implement the project.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agencv control:
Lack of Inter-agency Cooperation: Inplementation of the project was adversely affected by a lack of
cooperation among the various implementing agencies which led to delays in decision making. There was
unending conflict on which agency should be the lead agency. Commitment was lacking as the planners
believed that the PCD should have been located in the ministry in chazge of Physical Planning and Urban
Development and not in the Ministry of Finance. The professionals in the various implementation agencies
remained reluctant to fully co-operate with the Project Director which led to untransparent behavior and
communication gaps adversely affecting the decision-making process.
Inability of the PFIs to fully discharge their financial and technical intermediary roles: The PFIs proved to
be ineffective institutions for infrastructure projects (see section 7.6).
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total project cost was projected at US$68.8 million at appraisal. It was envisaged that the Bank would
finance US$50.0 million, the State and Local Govemments US$7.5 million, and cofinancing US$11.3
million. However, the financing plan changed during implementation as the financial intermediaries that
were to contribute about 11 percent (US$7.6 million) of total project costs failed to discharge their
financial commitment. At loan closing, the total project cost was estimated at US$30.0 million, out of
which the Bank financed US$24.7 million, State and Local Govenmments US$1.5 million and cofinancing
US$3.8 million. This reduced total cost was due primarily to cancellation of the uncompleted storm
drainage component which accounted for about 30 percent and was only about 20 percent complete at
project closing, despite several extensions of the Loan primarily to accommodate its completion.

Additionally, US$10.0 million was canceled at the time of the mid-term review as discussed in Section 3.4.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Overall project sustainability is rated uncertain for most components implemented.
On the positive side, an Operation and Maintenance Plan for project assets was prepared by OYSG and
agreed with the Bank. Secondly, sustainability of the CIP component is likely. The provision of basic
infrastructure facilities through the CIP component, despite its limited spatial coverage, has revitalized
economic activity in poor neighborhoods. On completion of the CIP schemes, agreement was reached on
maintenance of the various facilities with both the LGs (where the schemes are located) and the respective
beneficiary communities. Street lights were transferred to the beneficiary communities, and payments for
consumption of electricity are now made by these communities directly to National Electrical Power
Authority (NEPA); the health facilities at Yemetu and Agugu were transferred to the appropriate LGA for
operation and maintenance. The postal agency supported by the project was taken over by Nigerian Postal
Service (NIPOST), while the fire station was handed over to the Fire Services Division of the Ministry of
Works. The above arrangements were intended to help ensure sustainability of the CIP component.
Sustainability of the solid waste management component is uncertain. Construction of the Transfer Station
at Aperin and landfill sites at Aba-Eku and Lapite was completed and the facilities are being used.
However, dumping at the landfill sites is now uncontrolled, and their management is not in accordance with
the Operation and Maintenance Manual prepared by the Consultants.
A Solid Waste Management Authority (SWMA) was established under the project. The intention was to
make the SWMA self-sufficient, and an infrastructure maintenance fund was established for maintenance
of all project assets based on 2.5 percent of the capital costs of each component. A total of Naira 30
million was contributed through monthly deductions at source from the federal statutory allocations of the
State Government. Sustainability of the fund is not likely as the government is no longer contributing, and
the SWMA is not charging economic rates as recommended in the Operation and Maintenance Manual.
T'he SWMA has largely privatized domestic refuse collection while it continues to directly provide the
service to industrial and commercial areas; it rents refuse collection vehicles to private operators at
subsidized rates partly because there is a perception that the poor cannot pay the full cost for services, and
partly because there is a perception of reduced risk of vehicles being diverted for other uses, such as
construction works. As the SWMA is unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain refuse collection
services; its present management is inexperienced and tends to take an over-simplistic view of the provision
of a fairly conmplex service, in spite of technical assistance provided to establish sound waste collection and
disposal, revenue collection and vehicle and plant maintenance systems, sustainability remains uncertain.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
In view of the size and complexity of Ibadan's infrastructure investment needs, and given the limited
experience of Borrower staff to appraise such a project, the World Bank played a leading role in guiding
project preparation and appraisal as well as in coordinating donor assistance. The Bank's team followed a
-9



participatory approach with involvement and consultation with stakeholde:rs .nd allowing beneficiaries to
be part of the decision-making process. While the project now appears to have been overly complex
relative to the implementation capacity at the time, it is noteworthy that projects that were similarly
designed, at about the same time, have been successfully implemented in other parts of Africa. Moreover,
Nigena had the added advantage of an earlier piloted project (Loan 2925), which led the SAR team to put
in place certain safeguards, which appeared to be adequate at the time, to help mitigate against the risks
associated with institutional weaknesses. These measures included tecluhical assistance and training to
provide operationally relevant support in financial mangement, planning and administration.
The Bank carried out a very detailed assessment of the banking sector during preparation to determine the
feasibility of involving the private sector in the provision of iniastrucbtire. The PFIs were found to be
appropriate for channelling Bank funds to states on behalf of the Federal Government. It was concluded
following their appraisal that they could quickly build capacity to provide not only traditionl banking and
financing services but also engineering services to evaluate consultant ptoposals and generally advise on
techLical issues; this led to their inclusion in the project. While they were weak on the technical side, their
fimancial expertise remained an important asset in channelling funds. The void in their technical capacity
was met by providing consulting support to the implementing agencies independent of the PFIs.
7'.2 Supervision:
The Bank carried out at least two supervision missions per year throughout implementation, which were
supplemented with follow-up on critical actions between missions by staff of the Resident Mission in
Nigeria. This helped to maintain close liaison between the Bank and implementing agencies (PCD, PFI and
government agencies). There were no significant staffing changes throughout the project cycle which
helped to maintain continuity amidst the numerous changes of senior officials and govemors, each of whom
expressed renewed commitment to the project and pledged support to bring the project to its successful
completion.
The project was subject to a mid-term review, at which time it was reduced in scope and a portion of the
Loan cancelled as specified in para. 3.4. At that stage, the storm drainage component was seen as an
important means to meet the project's objective of removing city-wide constraints in Ibadan and to protect
the city from floods, but its preparation was delayed by late appointment of consultants for the design and
preparation of bid docurnents. Work commenced toward the end of 1995, delayed by a lengthy ICB
procedure followed by a special audit in order to finalize the award of contrac;. A 40-month contract was
subsequently signed in July 1995 with a clear understanding that the closing date of the project would have
to be extended. As the initial loan closing date was June 1996, the Bank cautiously agreed to a one-year
extension with the understanding that progress would be closely monitored based on an agreed action plan.
Toward the end of 1996 the contract had to be let to subcontractors due to financial difficulty experienced
by the original contractor's finn. The Bank agreed to a fiurther one-year extension to end-June 1998 in
order to allow the sub-contractors to carry out the work, justified largely because the MTR action plan had
been complied with. During the March 1998 mission, the OYSG made a case for a further one-year
extension to June 1999 to enable the subcontractors to make good on their assurances that the work could
be substantially completed by then. Moreover, the OYSG claimed that the contract term had not expired
and needed to utilize the remaining period in order to protect the governmernt from any liabilities that might
arise from contractor clairns. The Bank agreed on an exceptional basis to this final extension to June 1999
to allow expiration of the storm drainage contract period. Bringing this contract to its conclusion required
lengthy discussions and agreements w ithin the Bank (including with procturement advisors) and also with
the sequential Military Administrators of Oyo State.
Throughout implementation of the storm drainage and other project components, the Bank demonstrated
- 10-



understanding, co-operation, and flexibility in resolving critical issues. For the reasons provided above, the
Bank's supervision performance on this project is rated as satisfactory.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
As detailed in sections 7.1 and 7.2 above, the Bank's performance in the project's cycle is rated as
satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Oyo State's performance was satisfactory during project preparation and appraisal but deficient during
implementation. FMWH performance is rated satisfactory in project preparation but deficient in project
monitoring. The PFIs were found to be capable and well managed at the time of project preparation and
appraisal.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Throughout implementation the project was plagued by inadequate interagency coordination and
cooperation and political interference. Despite the availability of adequately qualified personnel in the
OYSG and the engagement of contract staff in the PCD during the early stages of the project,
implementation was affected by: (a) narrow sectoral interests of the various implementing agencies which
prevented effective project coordination; (b) management instability stemming from the frequent changes in
OYSG leadership; and (c) OYSG's interference in decision making on contract administration and
procurement issues.
On the other hand, each new government demonstrated its commitment to the project by maintaining the
flow of counterpart funds through the Standing Payment Order (SPO) set up for deductions to be made at
source by FMF from OYSG's share of the Federation Account; OYSG also complied with the Bank's
reporting requirements, including financial reporting.
The LGs' performance during implementation was unsatisfactory due to their inability to make counterpart
contributions for funding of the priority components in Oyo, Ogbomoso and Saki, which led to cancellation
of Phase II program in the LGs.
FMWH did not adequately administer the IDF project guidelines, and its performance was weak in carrying
out its other project components. Even though adequate funding was provided under the project for
FMWH to undertake regular performance audits and prepare other state projects, FMWH was only able to
conduct, through consultants, an impact assessment study of the three CIP components. It also failed to
provide the necessary leadership in the project coordinating committee.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
An important role of the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) was to assist the states to attain
financial discipline and creditworthiness to eventually enable them to approach the capital market for funds
for infrastructure investments. The ability of the PFIs to fulfill this role was negatively affected by fiscal
imbalances and macro-economic instability in the country during the nine years of project implementation,
which created disincentives for the PFIs to lend funds to OYSG for infrastructure projects. Thus, the PFIs
could not meet their own obligation for cofinancing subprojects, since the bulk of their deposits were
short-term and were not available for long-term infrastructure projects due to the mismatch of maturities.
Additionally, as explained above in 7.1, while the PFIs had adequate financial skills, they lacked the
required technical expertise to advise OYSG on technical parameters of the project and were unwilling to
- 11 -



procure those services extemally. Technical documents, which should have been reviewed by the PFIs,
were usually passed to the World Bank without substantive action. This led to the OYSG having to
procure the required technical consulting skills without recourse to the PFIs.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance is considered to be unsatisfactory and non-supportive of the project's
development objectives.
8. Lessons Learned
The lessons learned from the project are as follows:
1.    Project design was relatively complex, based on several broad ranging objectives and components
involving a number of OYSG agencies in its implementation. Although this was the standard design for
urban projects at the time, future projects need to be simpler and not attempt to overstretch the capacity of
a weak administrative infrastructure. Additionally, the objectives of future projects need to be measurable,
while broad-ranging and overly ambitious objectives should be avoided.
2.    Community Improvement Program:  It appears that the sustainable solution to problems of
inadequate provision of basic infrastructure lies in the facilities being decided upon and eventually tumed
over to the beneficiary communities. The priorities of the CIP, including the roles and responsibilities for
operation and maintenance, were decided jointly by the three communities and the LGs, and the
communities were involved at all stages of the project cycle. The strong working relationship between the
CIP and the LGs was helped by the existence of a CIP unit (created by the project) within the LGs
responsible for community mobilization and enlightemnent, which worked well with the communities
throughout implementation. These factors contributed to the success of the CIP component. One lesson
that could be derived from the experience is that all aspects of community involvement in infrastructure
need to be given equal emphasis. The demands of the early phases of the project led to decreased focus on
the logistics of cost recovery which is equally important in terms of sustainability.
3.    Revenue Enhancement: Revenue generation remains a major difficulty for LGs. While the project
helped to enhance the tax bases of several LGs, more needs to be done to improve the actual machinery for
billing and collection to help realize additional revenue.  Future projects must undertake both the
rationalization of tax bases as well as the improvements in the billing and collection mechanisms. This is
relevant also to the state parastatals such as the Solid Waste Management Authority in this project which
found it difficult to increase its rates due to cultural, political or legal constraints. To ensure sustained
provision of infrastructure services, costs must be directly or indirectly recovered.
4.    Interagency Coordination: There was unending conflict among the project executing agencies over
which should be the lead agency, which led to untransparent behaviors and lack of cooperation. While the
PCD was moved to the office of the Governor which led to greater cohesion during implementation, this
had its own difficulties and is not recommended for replication. In hindsight, the position of the Project
Director should have had a rank above all those seconded to participate in the PCD, which would have
empowered him to lead the team in a cohesive manner.
5. Line of Credit: A line of credit of about US$100,000 was set up within the Ibadan Municipality to
procure spare parts for vehicles; it had to be cancelled because of mis-management of funds. In retrospect,
this facility should have been packaged in such a way to attract a reputable private operator to manage it.
The project experience has shown that public sector management is not conducive to managing a line of
- 12-



credit of this nature due to the lack of professionalism in record-keeping and accounting.
6.    Rehabilitation is a cost effective way of lengthening the asset lives of waste management
equipment; rehabilitation works well, provided that maintenance contracts are drawn up. Historically,
equipment and other costly assets were poorly maintained and dumped before expiration of their useful
lives. The project demonstrated to the SWMA and to the OYSG generally that it is more cost effective to
rehabilitate and extend the useful lives of equipment rather than prematurely scrapping and purchasing new
ones.
