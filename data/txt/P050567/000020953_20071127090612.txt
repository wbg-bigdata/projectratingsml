A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE
1. Countryand sector issues

CountryIssues

1.      A comprehensive economic reform program was adopted in Egypt in 2004, when
significant change took place in the cabinet and several new officials were appointed to key
ministerial positions.    This new government has made economic reform its key objective,
notably in areas such as finance, investment, trade and industry.          It has also stated its keen
interest to enhance the provision of public goods and services, including physical and social
infrastructure. The latter includes the power sector.

2.      The investment needs in infrastructure remain substantial.               It is estimated that
approximately 4-6% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) needs to be invested annually in
infrastructure sectors in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to satisfy new
investment requirements as well as maintenance and replacement spending.'                The decline in
investment in the MENA region, including in Egypt, i s reported to have compromised the
infrastructure base, which i s further challenged by the high growth in demand for modern
infrastructure services.    To ensure adequate provision o f electricity, the Egyptian Electricity
Holding Company (EEHC) - responsible for generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity inEgypt - requires on average about 1,500 MW of new capacity each year. Promotion
of renewable energy projects plays a key part in Egypt's generation plan. Indeed, to date 225
MW of wind-turbines have been installed and are operational, performing well at an average
capacity factor of 42%.

3.      While investment is required to ensure adequate infrastructure, the Government of Egypt
(GOE) is increasingly concerned with the rising fiscal deficit and public debt, which rose from
3.9% in FYOO to 9.6% in FY05. To counter this, the GOE has been implementing several
measures to reduce the deficit over the medium term by restraining public expenditures and
increasing public revenues. A s a result, the deficit as a percentage of GDP for FY06 dropped to
8.6% and the GOE plans to reduce it further by 1% per year for the next five years. The key
measures that the GOE has adopted include redesigning of subsidies, controlling growth in
public sector employment and cutting unnecessary expenditures.                 Some reforms already
underway include:

    0   Increasing retail utility prices, including increases inelectricity and gas prices.

    0   Reducingcustom tariffs.

    0   Reducing price controls and subsidies on basic products, including diesel-fuel.
        Increasing interest inthe potential for public-private partnerships (PPPs).
        Strengthening and reorganizing the privatization program under the Ministry of
        Investment established inJune 2004.

4.      Against these reforms, the GOE remains committed to providing a public safety net
comprising of various subsidies, employment programs and cash transfers and agrees that there

                                                    1

i s much room for improving the cost-effectiveness of the safety net currently in place and its
coverage of the poor. Assistance to do this is included in the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS).

Sector Issues and Government Strategy

5.       Access to electricity is high in Egypt (98%). However, the fast growing demand puts
significant pressure on the sector's ability to provide reliable and reasonably priced electricity;
challenging both its ability to contribute to higher growth and poverty alleviation. To ensure
sustainable service delivery,          the GOE is implementing reforms in electricity pricing,
diversification of supply and improved efficiency through the development of a market for
electricity trade.

6.       Electricitv pricing:     InOctober 2004, the GOE approved anincrease inelectricity tariffs,
the first increase in 12 years, and a subsequent tariff increase was approvedin2005 inwhich the
average tariff changed to 14.86 Pt/kWh (2.5 US#ACW~).~                Further increases to industries were
announced in August, 2007. Still, Egyptian electricity prices are low by international standards
and when compared to a number of other countries in the region, since prices have declined
substantially inreal terms over the 12 year period of no price changes and, with the depreciation
ofthe Egyptianpound, inforeign currency terms as well.

7.       Inaddition to subsidized overall tariffs, there are also substantial cross-subsidies which
are not very well targeted. An inclining block tariff is used to subsidize residential customers
who use the least electricity. The GOE is fully aware of cross-subsidization in the sector and,
although the overall electricity retail tariff has increased, subsidies continue to prevail for
politically sensitive customer segments.           The GOE is keen to eventually reduce the level of
cross-subsidization in the sector and the subsidies in general, but recognizes that this will take
time. Bank assistance is being provided under the El Tebbin Power Project (Loan No. 7359-
EGT) to design and implement time of use tariffs and load management schemes, which would
assist in improving overall cost recovery, as well as sending signals for increased energy
efficiency by reducing demand for electricity at peak periods.

8.       Egypt's significant reserves of natural gas play a key role in electricity production.
Current proven reserves are estimated at 67.2 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), with an additional 120 Tcf
identified as probable and possible reserve^.^           To meet projected domestic demand (industrial,
commercial and residential) and export demand (via pipelines and liquefied natural gas
terminals) over the next 20 years, about 15 T c f is estimated to be required. This leaves Egypt
with a proven Reserves/Production (RP) ratio of over 80 years. Domestic gas consumption is
dominated by the power sector at 65%, followed by the fertilizer industry, petrochemicals and
other industrial sectors. The price of natural gas to industries as well as the power sector has
been set at 21 Pt/m3(US$l/mmbtu), but an increase over a 3 year period was recently announced
for the industrial sector which will see the gas price increase to US$2,65/mmbtu by the third
year.

9.       As naturalgas is becomingincreasinglyimportantto Egypt's economy, particularlywith
the growing potential for exports, moving towards cost-based pricing of gas is becoming
increasinglyimportant. As a result, the GOEhas undertakena study to determinethe costof gas,
whichthe Bank has assistedthroughESMAP(Energy SectorManagementAssistance Program).
The study has been disseminatedamong key governmentalstakeholders and providedthe basis
for the recent increase in gas price to industry and is informing the GOE's longer-termgas
pricingpolicy andstrategy.

10.      Diversification of supplv: As stated above, the fast growing demand for electricity
requires significant investment in generation capacity each year (the increase in demand for
electricityinEgyptaveragedabout 7% during 1997/98-2003/04 andis expectedto remaininthe
6%-7% range over the next 10 years). Installedcapacity of electric power was 20,452 MW in
2005/2006, of which 85% comprised thermal power (10% of which is providedby the private
sector through 3 IndependentPowerProducers, IPPs). The remainingcapacitywas attributedto
hydropower(14%) andwind (1%). Peak loadreached 17,300 MW in2005/2006, andabout 90%
o f the thermal power production was based on natural gas. Initiatives are underway to better
understand customer consumption patterns and loads to ultimately implement demand-side
management measures to reduce the overall consumption and the growth in demand.4 World
Bankassistanceis beingprovidedto this effort.

11.      The GOE's strategy is to continueto implement gas firedpower plants, with a long-term
view to increase the share of combinedcycle gas turbine technology inthe generation mix. In
addition, the GOE has a target of meeting 3% of its electricity needs from renewable energy
sources by 2010; and 20% by 2020 (includinghydro which today comprises 13% of the 20%
target). Bank technical assistance was recently requested to help in the development and
achievement of this plan. The New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) has the
responsibilityto developrenewableresources inEgyptandimplementthe government's strategy
on renewable energy. Until 2001, most of NREA's activities have been in the research and
development field, and since then its activities have increasingly turned to the production of
renewable energy. NI2EA has inrecent years successfullyaugmentedits revenues with income
from the sale of carbon reduction credits under the clean development mechanism. Indeed,
agreements have already been signed with the Japanese, the Danish and the German
governments.

12.      NREA's strategy is to capitalizeon Egypt's abundant wind and solar natural resources to
meet the renewable energy target set by the Government. For this purpose it plansto installan
additional 850 MW of wind by 2010 and considers the constructionof the proposedIntegrated
Solar Combined Cycle Power Plant (150 MWe) a key development towards improving and
diversifyingits institutionalandtechnicalcapacityinthe areaofrenewableenergy.

13.      Finally, as an incentiveto the development ofrenewableenergy, the GOE has established
a mechanism (the `Petroleum Fund'), where producers of non-fossil fuel electricity receive 2


4Energyintensity inEgypt in2004, defined as the energy consumptionper unit of GDP was equalto 0.22 toe 1000'
95 US$,which is comparableto other oil producing countries in the region (Algeria: 0.20) and lower than others
(Iran: 0.33), but higherthan WesternEuropeancountriessuchas Germany(0.18) andFrance(0.19).



                                                     3

PtikWh. This mechanism is intendedto accelerate development o f renewable energy by sharing
with developers the additional export revenue generated from fuel savings derived.

14.     Electricitv MarketDevelopment: Following the 2001 unbundlingo f the electricity sector
in Egypt, further reform of the sector includes market development, such as liberalization and
greater regional integration.    The Ministry o f Electricity and Energy is in the process o f
developing a plan for the introduction o f competition in the sector consistent with the
implementation o f further tariff increases and on-going improvement in the efficiency o f the
subsidiary companies.      This plan will see gradual opening of the sector, starting with the
generation segment. To facilitate reform, a regulatory agency has been established and an
electricity law i s under formulation. A Higher Energy Council was recently established under
the chairmanship of the Prime Minister and with members represented by the ministers o f
electricity, petroleum, finance, planning and economic development.          This council reviews
energy alternatives, their economics as well as overall energypolicy andplanning.

15.     Egypt's plans are consistent with and supported by - its participation in the European
                                             -
Neighborhood Policy (ENP) partnership, which was developed in the context o f the European
Unions' (EU) 2004 enlargement with the objective o f avoiding the emergence o f new dividing
lines betweenthe enlarged EU and its neighbors. A key feature o f the ENP i s the bilateral ENP
Action Plans mutually agreed between the EU and each partner country. These action plans set
out an agenda o f political and economic reforms with short and medium-termpriorities. Inthe
case o f Egypt, the action plani s under discussion and includes market liberalization (inprinciple
by 2010) and continued price reform inboththe electricity and gas sectors.

16.     Meeting the reform targets in the action plan will require far-reaching reforms o f the
Egyptian power sector. Some assistance on how to achieve this is being provided through the
EU. The European Investment Bank also has significant grant funds available to Egypt for
technical assistance. Nevertheless, significant work remains on the detailed steps required to
meet the liberalization objective, as well as Government policy on how to finance sector
investments in the longer term, including the respective roles of the public and private sectors.
On the latter, the GOE remains open to private sector participation, although the pressure on the
financial status o f the sector has led to the GOE opting for public sector financing for the time
being. Clearly, tariff/subsidy reform would need to accompany any large-scale re-engagement
with private participation, as well as and as mentioned earlier; reform o f the social safety net,
which i s a key priority o f the GOE. The Bank i s providing the Government with assistance to
formulate an energy pricing strategy including reforms to social safety nets and social protection
inorder to support the implementationoftariff/subsidy reforms.

2. Rationale for Bankinvolvement

17.     The proposed project integrates conventional combined cycle gas turbines with solar
thermal technology. It will contribute to an important global test o f a new approach to renewable
energy. As noted in the Bank's report to the Development Committee on the Clean Energy
Investment Framework, incentives are needed to induce technological change to a low carbon
economy. The proposed project would demonstrate how de-carbonizing o f the power sector
could be facilitated by the large-scale development o fnew energy productiontechnologies.




                                                 4

18.     The proposed project is strategic for the achievement o f the objectives o f GEF's
Operational Program 7 (OP7), which aims to reduce, over the long-term, the costs o f energy
technologies with low greenhouse gas emissions, and which are currently not cost-competitive
(see below under "Higher level objectives and Rationale for GEF funding"). The Bank fully
supports that pioneering objective. The proposed Egypt project i s one o f a series o f similar
projects, which together will contribute to learning about such technologies, and dissemination o f
that learning. Inthis way, Egypt, GEF, and the Bank arejointly participating ina very promising
global experiment.

19.     The proposed project is also strategic for the Bank in Egypt, now that the Bank has
regained a high-levelo f partnershipinthe country's energy sector after a gap o f some years. The
project will contribute to the goals, articulated in the CAS for Egypt, which include enhancing
the provision o f public goods through, inter alia, modernized infrastructure services to achieve
higher growth. The GOE and the Bank are engaged in an intensivepolicy dialogue inthis key
sector, and a comprehensive program o f financial and technical support has developed.
Reliability and long-term involvement are the foundation o fthis relationship.

20.     The Bank's current direct involvement in investment and advisory services across the
energy sector in Egypt provides a good basis for development o f sustainable energy solutions,
including renewable energy. It allows for substantial dialogue on the policy framework and
implementation arrangements associated with and required for this project's implementation, as
well as larger scale development and replication o f similar projects. Finally, Bank involvement
will also help attract strong bidders by ensuring the use of transparent and competitive
procurement processes, as well as appropriate management o f environmental and social impacts.

3. Higher levelobjectives to which the project contributes

21.     In 1996, the GEF's Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) recommended high
temperature solar thermal power technologies as one o f the renewable energy technologies that
had significant cost reduction potential. The GEF support for solar thermal technology was
identified as a means to increase market awareness through limitedscale demonstration projects
insolpr resource richdevelopingcountries.

22.     GEF Operational Program Number 7 ("Reducing the Long-term Costs of Low
Greenhouse Gas-Emitting Technologies") emphasized certain limited technologies including
parabolic trough based solar thermal electric technologies to be cost-effective. "For cost-
effectiveness, the scope o f the technologies covered by the operational program needs to be
limitedto those whose costs will drop significantly with economies of scale inmanufacture and
application."

23.     The selection o f technologies for OP 7 was made based on certain criteria; extent to
which basic research and development has already been done (for technologies where the
marketsare both inrecipient and developed countries) or significant prior operational experience
exists; size o f remaining technological barriers and risks; technology's current cost; prospects for
reduction in costs o f the technologies in question (steep learning curves); contribution that GEF
financing can make to cost reductions; and the primary market i s in the recipient countries




                                                  5

because o f resource endowment and potential for that technology, when commercial, to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

24.     Large-scale solar-based power plants are still a long way from being cost-competitive
with fossil-fuel based plants. However, within the range of solar thermal electric generation
options, the integration o f solar and combined cycle (ISCC) technology i s the most promising in
the long-term as a reliable and cost-effective source o f power supply. For developing countries
especially, where the primary need i s electricity (not necessarily green electricity), the
combination o f solar energy with a large-scale fossil fuel power plant can, in the technology
introduction stage, be more attractive than stand-alone solar plants. For this reason, the
technology i s consistent with the objectives o f GEF OP7, which justifies GEF grant support in
pursuit of the global program objective o f increasing the market share of low greenhouse-gas
emitting technologies that have not yet become widespread least-cost alternatives.

25.     OP7 states that "the objective will be achieved by GEF's promotion o f such technologies
so that, through learning and economies o f scale, the levelized energy costs will decline to
commercially competitive levels.       A project leads to reduction in GHG emissions not only
directly, but also indirectly by being one o f series o f projects that induce cost reductions in the
technology.    The direct outputs o f the technology are the amount o f energy generated, the
amount o f GHG emissions avoided, etc. The indirect project output, o f greater programmatic
interest, is the reduction in cost that it caused and the time horizon for the achievement o f
program objectives will typically be on the order o f decades. The technologies identifiedunder
thisprogramwill require the security o ffundingand long-term commitment ofGEF support."

26.     Consequently, GEF and the Bank agreed to pursue solar thermal projects in India,
Mexico, Morocco and Egypt as part o f a strategy to facilitate the commercialization o f solar
thermal technology.       The India project (later dropped) entered the work program in 1996,
followed by the Mexico and Morocco projects in 1999 and finally the Egypt project in 2004.
The Mexico and Morocco projects have already been approved by the GEF and the Bank while
the financing for the Egypt project has been negotiated, and the procurement process has been
concluded. After eight years o f preparation, construction i s ready to start - pendingapproval o f
the GEF grant bythe GEFandthe World Bank's Board o fDirectors.

27.     In essence, the GEF participation inthe project is intendedto support primarily global
program objectives, and Egyptian national development objectives only ~econdarily.~That i s the
rationale for substantial grant financing from the international community through GEF.
However, about half o f the financing for the solar component o f the project will come from
NREA's equity and borrowings which is a testimony to the fact that the global environmental
objectives are closely linkedto the Egypts's national sustainable energy development strategy.

28.     Inthe GEF-World Bankportfolio of solar thermal projects, the preferredconfiguration is
the ISCC. This configuration integrates the steam output fiom a solar field into the steam turbine
o f a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT). Giventhat there i s now significant experience relating
to combined cycle operation, as well as adequate knowledge o f solar field operations, the ISCC


 The proposedprojectwill makean important contributionto the Government's renewableenergytarget of 3% by
2010. The projectwill also strengthenNREA's capacity as an independentproducer ofrenewableenergy.


                                                     6

configuration i s sound from a technical standpoint. However, as projects utilizing this integrated
configuration have not yet been implemented,the first few projects, including the Egypt project,
may face teethingproblems. However, any problems that arise are not likely to be fundamental
in nature but rather related to optimizing energy flows, particularly under transient solar
conditions.

29.    By integrating the solar field with the combined cycle technology, the ISCC
configuration offers several cost reduction and operational advantages over independent solar
thermal plants that make them more suitable for introducing solar field based electricity
generation in developing countries. In the ISCC configuration, the need for an independent
power block for the solar field i s offset by utilizing a larger steam turbine in the CCGT plant,
thereby reducing the capital costs through economies o f scale. Such a configuration also reduces
the solar energy losses that occur in an independent solar plant due to daily start-up and shut-
down. In addition, the hybrid plant can remain in continuous operation irrespective o f solar
availability providing much needed generation. The solar field also offers a power boost when
CCGTs suffer a reduction in plant output at times o f high outdoor temperatures, since that
coincides withhigh solar radiation as well.

30.     In 2005, the World Bank commissioned an independent assessment of the World
Bank/GEF strategy for the market development o f concentrating solar thermal power.            The
study'sconclusions can be summarized as follows:

   Over the last 2 years, the industry has been reinvigorated. Several projects are presently
   under construction around the world. Nonetheless, these projects have not reached the kind
   o f critical mass to suggest that the industryi s now self-sustaining.

   Solar thermal electricity offers a number o f advantages when considered as part o f a country
   or region's energy generation options mix. Solar thermal, based on a hot fluid, can integrate
   well withconventional thermodynamic cycles andpower generation equipment.

   Inmost cases, the ISCC configuration showed lower Levelized Economic Cost (LEC) than
   the solar electricity generating systems in California.        The reason for this i s that the
   incremental cost o f a larger steam turbine i s much lower than building a stand-alone power
   block for solar electricity generating systems.

   ISCC i s well-suited for market introduction because the additional marginal investment for
   the conventional plant components i s relatively low. There are also areas o f overlap, and
   thuscost-reduction potential, withthe plant infrastructure andproject implementation costs.

   The technology is not new, but stalled in its development path. There is no fundamental
   reason why the technology could not follow a similar cost reduction curve to wind energy
   and eventually be cost-competitive. Cost reductions would require a combination o f plant
   scale-up, increasedproduction volumes and technological innovation.

   Against the thousands o f megawatts needed for CSP to reach full cost-effectiveness, the GEF
   portfolio alone will not lead to a significant reduction in the underlying cost o f the
   technology. However, the plant capacity of projects inthe GEF portfolio i s not insignificant



                                                  7

     compared to the present 300MW or so o f possible-to-firm CSP projects in OECD countries.
     The GEF co-financed plants will help to maintain momentum in the CSP industry and to
     develop operational experience indeveloping countries.

     By supporting implementationo fthe first solar thermal power demonstration plants,the GEF
     will helpcreate confidence inthe technology and institutional learning, thereby reducing the
     hurdlefor subsequentmarket entry o fCSP.

31.      Several ISCC projects outside the GEFBank portfolio are also being developed in
Algeria, Spain, etc. Over the long run, it is expected that the cost o f the technology will come
down due to technical progress and lessons learned from earlier deployment. In the Northern
Mediterranean "sunbelt," several solar-thermal power projects are already being planned in
Greece, Spain, and Italy through national programs and the support o f the EU. Bulk
transmission o f electricity from solar-thermal power plants from highinsolation sites inSouthern
Mediterranean countries, such as Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, may also open
wider opportunities for European utilities to finance solar plants in that region for electricity
consumed in Europe, and hence for Southern Mediterranean countries to become a base for
electricity exports. Reform o f electricity sectors across Europe, the rising demand for "green
power," and the possibility o f gaining carbon credits are increasing the viability o f such projects.
Finally, research and development work continues in Europe and the United States to further
reduce costs by improving plant components.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

32.      A grant from the GEF inthe amount o f US$49.8 million will contribute to the financing
o f the solar portion o f the ISCC power plant. The remainder o f the project cost will be covered
by an already-approved loan from the JBIC (for the CCGT component) and by NREA's own
resources, including loans from the National Investment Bank o f Egypt. Since the incremental
cost associated with the solar portion o f the ISCC i s US$97.2 million, NREA's net contribution
to finance incremental cost i s $47.4 million6. GEF support through the grant, as well as =A's
funding ofthe project, will contribute to reducing the long-term costs of the technology andwill
assist Egypt as well as other countries in adopting environmentally clean and cost effective
technologies through the demonstration effects and lessons learned.


2. Project development objectiveand key indicators

33.      The objective o f the project is to increase the share o f solar-based electricity in the
Egyptian energy generation thereby contributing to the Government's objective o f diversifying
electric power production.

3. GlobalDevelopmentObjective

35.     The global development objective o f the project i s to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
from anthropogenic sources by increasing the market share o f low greenhouse gas emitting
technologies.

36.     The project will demonstrate the operational viability o f hybrid solar thermal power
generation technology and contribute to replication o f integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)
power generationtechnology inEgypt and elsewhere through the learning effect provided by its
construction and operation, and through economies o f scale as use o f the technology spreads. It
i s one o f a number o f similar projects in the world supported by GEF, and by other financing
sources, as part of a global programmatic effort to accelerate cost reduction and commercial
adoption o f large-scale low greenhouse emitting generation technologies.       Secondarily, the
project will make a modest direct contributionto the reduction o f greenhouse gas emissions.

37.     To evaluate the performance o f the project in achieving this global objective, the
following indicators have beenchosen:


        a. Cost o f solar thermal (US$/kWh and US$/kW)
        b. Emissions reducedfrom use o f solar fuel (tons of COz/year).

4. Projectcomponents

38.     The project will finance the construction of an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC)
power plant, to be located in Kureimat, about 95 km south o f Cairo, on the eastern side o f the
riverNile.

39.     The plant will have a combined capacity o f about 150 MW, including 20 MW o f solar
capacity.   When own consumption o f 6.3 MW is deducted, the net overall plant capacity
becomes 143.4 MW. The total net energy produced by the plant i s expected to be 852 GWhper
year, which includes the solar contribution o f 33.4 GWh per year. This corresponds to a solar
share o f 4 % of the total annual energy producedby the plant operating at a full load.

40.     The project will be implementedthrough three components. For Component 1 the costs
are known since the procurement process for both the solar and the combined cycle portions
have been completed. These costs are inclusive of importtaxes on equipment and contingencies.
Having said that, NREA will apply for an import tax waiver for select equipment at the time o f
actual import, which would result in potential savings of US$22.4 million for the project. For
Component 2 and 3, estimated costs are presented.

Component 1: The design, construction and initial operation of the proposed Integrated
Solar CombinedCycle Plant includetwo sub-components:

        (a) The solar portion o f the power plant ( U S $ l l l million; of which GEF will finance
            US49.8 million and NREA US61.2 million) includes one contract for engineering,
            procurement, construction, testing, commissioning and two years operation and
            maintenance (O&M).      The solar island consists o f a parabolic trough solar field
            capable of generating about 73 MW (thermal) o f solar heat at a temperature o f 393"C,
            the related Instrumentation and Control (I&C) and control room andthe heat transfer
            fluid (HTF) system up to the HTF inlet and outlet flanges o f the Solar Heat
            Exchanger(s).

        (b) The capital cost ofthe combined cycle portionofthe plant (US$201 million; ofwhich
            JBIC will finance US$151.3 million and NREA US$49.7 million) includes one
            contract for the EPC aspect o f the power plant. Inaddition, one 2 year O&M contract
            will be financed by NREA (US$8.8 million). The combined cycle island will consist
            o f one gas turbine with I S 0 rating o f about 73.3 MWe, one heat recovery steam
            generator (HRSG), one steam turbine o f about 76.5 MWe, and solar heat
            exchanger(s) capable to absorb about 73 MW (thermal) solar heat plus all associated

Component 2:        Comprises capacity building to NREA through consulting services for
construction management during the construction, testing and operation o f the plant (US$6.36
million, including price contingency financed by JBIC). The capacity buildingwill focus on: (a)
detailed engineeringdesigns with special attention to the interface between the solar and CCGT
parts; (b) supervising the construction and environmental aspects o f the power plant; (c)
monitoring the commissioning and guarantee tests; (d) preparing the O&M contract for the

Note: Amounts are expressed in US$million

41.      The above costs reflect a reduction inthe size of the solar field from 30 MW to 20 MW.
The lowest bid for 30 MW was US$130 million. Since the GOE is contributing a significant
portion towards the cost o f the project, they requested the Bank's No Objection to negotiate a
reduction inthe cost through a reduction inthe solar field size. The Bank's Central Procurement
Board (OPRC) granted this request. The 33% reduction in the solar field size translates into a
reduction inthe solar share o f electricity generated by the ISCC from 6% to 4% and the cost o f
the 20 MW i s 20% lower than that of the original 30 MW. At 20 MW, the solar islandremains a
substantial project component and i s deemed to adequately serve the project's pioneering
objective.

42.      It is important to note that the EPC cost differs from the incremental cost, in that EPC
cost i s the EPC cost o f the plant during project preparation and construction (for design,
construction and hardware, etc) while the incremental cost i s the difference in cost between the
ISCC and a reference plant comprising a combined cycle plant with the same output. Annex 15
presents the detailed incremental cost analysis for the proposed project. For Morocco, the EPC
cost o f the solar component was $74.6million while the incremental cost was $63.16million (at a
10% discount rate).


                                                11

  43.      The Egypt project still is relatively expensivevis a vis Morocco where biddinghas also
  been completed, contracts signed and the prices are known (see summary table below). The
  Mexico bidding process i s being re-launched in light o f price increases and intandem with the
  Mexican Congress authorizing an increase in the budget approved for the thermal part o f the
  plant which has experienced substantial price increases. The bidding process is expected to be
  completed by February, 2008. For the solar component, bidders are requested to bid within the
  envelope o fthe GEF grant (US$49.8 Million).

  44.      The main reasons for the cost differential between Egypt and Morocco has to do with
  significant price increases in the raw material, which continues to increase (for example the
  Index for Steel Prices (SBB World Index) is currently increasing at a monthly rate of 3.7%; the
  index was 201 in January 2007 and it was 220 in September 2007)7. This factor is affecting
  practically all power generation technologies, and i s not specific to solar technologies*. The
  other main factor is that there i s only a limited number of active bidders in the market, and
  several newprojects to bid on. With the Morocco biddingprocess being slightly ahead o f Egypt,
  the solar contractors were all heavily loaded with projects which ledto price increases inEgypt,
  as Contractors need to expand their manufacturing capabilities.' Furthermore, the split package
  inEgyptmayhave increasedcost due to reducedscope for economies of scale.


  5. Lessons learned and reflected inthe project design



  7It shouldbenotedthat such increaseinraw materialand equipmentprices are affecting almostall technologiesin
  powergeneration,and is not confinedto ISCC inparticularor evenrenewableenergytechnologiesingeneral.
   Forexample, the ElTebbinPowerProjectinEgyptfinancedbythe WorldBankhas experienceda 40% cost
  increase inthe bidpricescomparedto the appraisalcost estimates (fromUS$450 millionto US$630million).
   This mighthelpexplain, for example, why the lowestbidder inMorocco was the highestbidder inEgypt.

Power Sector Development in Egypt

45.     NREA has gained significant experience in designing and implementing wind energy
projects with international loan and grant financing.         Important lessons drawn fiom this
experience include the importance o f transparent and well-managed competitive bidding
processes, which have contributed to attracting the interest o f major international suppliers.

46.     Furthermore, through the development o f these projects, NREA has operated under
Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with EEHC and has gained significant experience in
structuring and negotiating such agreements.          This experience will be very useful for the
proposed project, in which a PPA will be put in place as well as a Gas Purchase Agreement
(GPA).

Solar Thermal Power Plant Development Worldwide

47.     N o large scale solar thermal power plants have beenbuilt indeveloping countries to date,
however several small-scale projects are under construction around the world.             The most
significant solar thermal installations are inCalifornia where 354 MW o f parabolic troughs, with
back-up gas fired steam boilers have been generating electricity and selling it to the utility since
the 1980s. Spain has also beengaining valuable experience indesigningand constructing solar
thermal power project, using the tower technology. The plant comprises 11 MW and i s located
inSeville. It is beingconstructed on aturnkeybasis.

48.     To meet the cost reduction objective o f this type o f project, it i s necessary to move
beyond the troughhackup boiler designuponwhich the California plant i s based. The purpose i s
to permit higher thermal efficiencies, improve the dispatchability o f the plant and to encourage
greater competition in the design and supply o f equipment. Such a plant would be more
attractive to utilities, thus increasing the market size.


6. Alternatives consideredand reasonsfor rejection

49.     Project Concept: The project was originally conceived to be carried out by the private
sector under the arrangements o f an Independent Power Producer (IPP), with the solar portion
financed fiom the GEF grant. In mid-2002, the Ministry o f Electricity and Energy, through
NREA, proposed a change to the project's concept mainly as a result of a general down turn in
investor appetite for IPPs and a policy change within the GOE whereby foreign currency
exposure related to private sector investment projects was to be borne by private investors. This
policy change was the result o f increased cost to the Government from the IPPs through the take
or pay contracts mostly denominated inUS$inconjunction with the devaluation o f the Egyptian
pound. Inorder to confrm the lack o fprivate sector interest, independentconsultants carried out
a survey o f investors who had previously expressed interest in developing the solar-thermal
project as an IPP. Inthis survey, 31 investors were contacted to registertheir interest to invest in
an IPP-styleproject given the policy change on foreign currency exposure. Only one company
filled out the requested questionnaire; another 21 responded by stating that they were either not
interested in general or not interested given the policy change. Three firms contacted were no
longer inexistence, and six responded that they would be interested inprinciple, but did not fill



                                                  13

out the questionnaire and thus were not considered serious. The financing and implementation
concept therefore changed and the project was presentedto the GEF for Work Program Inclusion
inMay2004 underthe current public sector concept.

50.      Project Configuration (ISCC): Early discussion on how to implement OP7 and the
recent assessment o f the World Bank/GEF              Strategy for the Market Development o f
Concentrating Solar Thermal Power have raised the question o f whether solar electricity
generating systems with little fossil co-firing would have been a better configuration for the
project rather than the ISCC configuration.      The assessment recognizes that there may be an
issue interms o f perception with an ISCC plant with a solar contribution o f only 4%. However,
the assessment also points out that a 20MW solar field ineither configuration will still generate
approximately the same amount o f GWWyear o f solar electricit and provide the same level o f
O&M experience, through having to maintain some 130,800 m o f solar array. As such, given
                                                                    Y
Egypt's interest in developing alternative energy solutions and recognizing that there i s a
significant non-technical lead time associated with any new project (permits, authorities, contract
administration, etc.) regardlesso fproject capacity, the ISCC choice helpsto meet Egypt's energy
goals, while deploying a solar field, a field that could have been deemed too hardfor the sake o f
a 15-20 MW plant.

51.      Technology Choice (Solar Trough): Although there are, broadly, three solar thermal
technologies: the parabolic trough; the central receiver, and the parabolic dish stirling system, the
parabolic trough i s the most technically and commercially proven option. The GOE has stressed
its preference for a commercially proven technology to the extent possible to minimize risk. As
such, it has beendecided that the project designbe based onthe parabolic trough technology.

52.      Solar Storage: The storage option was not considered because the storage technology
would add another innovative element (not yet commercially proven on a large scale) and would
add extra cost. Nevertheless, it would be possible at a later time to increase the solar field by
adding a storage device to the plant.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

53.      The project will be financed by the following sources: GEF, NREA, JBIC and the
National InvestmentBank o fEgypt (through NREA). The GEF grant will contribute towards the
cost o f the solar portion o f the plant and inparallel JBIC will contribute to the cost of the CCGT
portion, including the consulting services contract responsible for the supervision o f power plant
design, construction and performance integration o f the two parts. NREA will contribute to the
costs o f both the solar and CCGT portions, as well as the O&M contracts and the cost o f
mitigationo f environmental and social impacts.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

54.      Given that the proposed design has yet to be proven commercially world-wide, the
Engineer, Procure and Construct (EPC) arrangements will be followed by 2-year Operation and
Maintenance (O&M) contracts to ensure proper operation and maintenance o f the ISCC plant



                                                  14

and achievement o f maximum output by the solar field.         There will be an O&M contract for
each portion o f the plant, but the O&M contract for the CCGT will be responsible for efficient
operation o fthe entire plant as well as maximizing the output from bothparts (see more below).

55.     The construction and operation o f the ISCC power plant will be implemented in four
separate contracts: (i) the construction and O&M o f the solar island; (ii) construction o f the
                                                                             the
combined cycle island; (iii) O&M o f the combined cycle portion; and (iv) a construction
                                the
management consulting contract for the supervision and integration o f the solar and combined
cycle islands. The arrangements are being secured using the international competitive bidding
procurement method. NREA, as the Executing Agency and as the mandated agency inEgypt to
develop renewable resources, will be responsible for project management. NREA will establish
a Project Implementation Entity Unit (PIE) headed by an experienced Project Manager who will
report to the Deputy Chairman for Projects and Operation. The PIE will be responsible for the
day to day management activities o f the proposed project and will be staffed by core specialists
intechnical, financing/accounting, procurement andenvironmentalmatters.

56.     The PIE will be based at the project site. As required, the PIE will liaise closely with
other departments at NREA headquarters for support in legal, financial, and planning matters.
Furthermore, EEHC has assured that it will support NREA, as needed, in any technical or
managerial aspects, particularly related to the operation o f the CCGT as well as compliance with
the Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The PIE will benefit from the assistance o f the
construction management consultant during the implementation o f the overall project. Its main
tasks are described under section 4 (Project Components) above. This contract will be for the
duration o f construction plus the two year guarantee period, which will coincide with the two-
year O&M contracts (Le. a total o f about 5 years).

57.     During the construction and in particular during the O&M period, NREA will assign
counterpart personnel to the construction management consultant to ensure close coordination
and transfer o f knowledge with regardto the operation o f the plant so that NREA can take over
its operation when the 2 year O&M and construction management contracts expire, as well as
monitor and document the project's lessons learned. It will be important that after the issuance
o f the operational acceptance certificate (30 months from start o f construction), NREA revises
and readjusts the PIE organizational structure to take into account the start-up o fthe 2 year O&M
period, especially in terms o f personnel. The organizational scheme for project implementation
i s shown inAnnex 6. The World Bank will monitor the implementation arrangements as part of
its supervision o f the project.

58.     Contractual clauses regarding heat output from the solar-based power plant component
will be incorporated in the O&M contracts between NREA and the contractors in order to
maximize the solar output. The contracts for the O&M will be for 2 years. Therefore, the power
plantwill be operated by the contractors duringthe first 2 years from commissioning. There will
be penalties in case o f not meetingthe required generation output, the requiredheat production
from the solar field, or exceeding the fuel consumption. During these 2 years, NREA should
gainthe necessary experience to take over the plant.

59.     The project is expected to be implemented between 2008 and 2011, with operations
commencing in2010.

3. Monitoring and evaluationof outcomes/results

60.     NREA will monitor the progress against the agreed performance indicators listed in
Annex 3. Data and statistics on actual project output and outcomes will be gathered, analyzed
and includedinperiodic progress reports to be submittedto the Bank.

61.     NREA will be assistedinthis by the constructionmanagement consultant. For the EMP,
NREA will be assisted by the construction management consultant, and as needed, EEHC's
environment department to monitor and ensure compliance with the plan.

62.     The Bank supervision effort will cover the estimated 3 years o f construction and some
period o f the 2 year O&M inthe interest o f capturing lessons learned of the project in line with
the project's development objectives and rationale o f GEF support. Based on the review of the
periodic reports and outcomes o f the supervision missions, measures will be taken to ensure that
the project is completed without delay and achieves its plannedoutcomes.


4. Sustainability and Replicability

63.     The GOE's commitment to renewable energy resource development is strong as
evidenced by its declared objective o f diversifying energy sources, including having 3% o f its
electricity needs represented by renewable energy by 2010 and the establishment o f the
"petroleum fund'' which provides economic incentive to renewable energy producers.
Furthermore, although it i s anticipated that part o f the higher capital cost o f the hybridplant will
be offset by the proposed GEF incremental cost grant, NREA will finance incremental cost
above US$49.8 million, recognizing the cap on GEF grant support to the project. Finally, the
integration o f the solar field with a CCGT ensures that the hybrid will provide the required
electricity contribution to the system regardless o f solar radiation conditions. For these reasons,
the hybrid power plant i s expected to operate sustainably as an integral part of the Egyptian
power system. The incentive structure for the solar and CCGT O&M operators will ensure
efficient operation o f the plant and optimal design for integration o f the solar thermal with the
gas-fired plant and maximize solar output from the plant when inoperation.

64.     Dissemination o f information about this project will contribute to possible future
replication inother countries and to refiningthe GEF strategy regardingthis technology. Indeed,
the general approach adopted by the project is highly replicable within Egypt, regionally and
globally. An early study carried out by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program
(ESMAP) suggested that sites with ready access to gas supply, electricity evacuation and water
infrastructure would be capable of supporting 5-10GW of solar thermal plant in Egypt. High
insolation sites are available across much o f the region, though many lack the necessary
infrastructure at this time. Worldwide there are suitable sites and, unlike other renewable
technologies, integrated solar combined cycle power plants are inherently at utility scale.
Having said that, the main barriers to further replication are costs and the associated learning
needs, the overcoming o f which this project (and the ones in Mexico and Morocco) i s expected
to contribute to by providing a benchmark for costs and operational information and
disseminating it throughout the solar thermal community. However, it i s unrealistic to expect


                                                 16

that this project alone (or even combined with the two being prepared) will bring costs down to
levels that are competitive with conventional power plants. Further development of this
technology outside of the GEF's OP 7 i s needed as well as possibly additional international
financing institutions support to additional projects.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic analysis

65.     The appraisal of the proposed project i s based on a feasibility study prepared by
Lahmeyer Consultants and a conceptual design study prepared by Fichtner Solar Consultants.
These studies providedestimates o f the costs of hybrid solar thermal variants and their baseline
equivalent CCGTs, including the economic least cost plant size, its dispatch into the power
system, possible technology variants and cost estimates. Since the bidding process has been
completed, real market data on the cost of both the solar and combined cycle portions are
available and are usedas the basis to appraise the project.



Cost-BenefitAnalysis
66.     The cost benefit analysis of the project shows that for a total capacity o f 150 MWe, and
introducing a 4 % solar contribution, the installed cost of the plant will be about $290 million.
The installedcost includes the cost of equipment (based on bids awarded), andthe estimated cost
for consulting during implementation which has yet to be bid for but represents a small cost
component as well as the estimated cost for the EMP". The cost o f equipment excludes taxes
andimport duties(an estimated US$22.4 million).

67.     As for operating costs, the present value offuel, O&M and consumables amounts to $153
million over the 25-year lifetime and the constructionphase. The O&M costs ineconomic terms
assume an economic cost o f natural gas of US$2.52/mmbtu as compared to the actual price
charge to the power sector o f US$l/mmbtu. The cost o f gas assumption i s based on results o f a
study on the economic cost o f natural gas inthe domestic market which has been carried out by
international consultants financed by ESMAP (Energy Sector ManagementAssistance Program)
andmanagedby the World Bank.

68.     Economic benefits are derived from the economic value o f electricity generated, where
the average electricity tariff has been assumed to be US$0.07/kWh -- the price for electricity
exports to Jordan. The GEF grant o f $49.8 million has beenincluded as an economic benefit as
it reflects global willingness to pay for this project."

69.     Based on these costs and benefits, the project generates a net present value o f US$54
million and the EIRRo fthe project i s 13%.


Incremental CostAnalysis

70.     To determine the incremental cost o f the proposed project, the cost o f the proposed plant
has beencompared to a reference plant usingconventional fossil fuel based technology.


loThe estimatedcosts for consultingduring implementationandfor the EMP are assumedto be incurredduring
projectconstructionphase. Inpracticepartof such costs may be incurredduringoperatingphase.
  Inaccordance with OP10.04-EconomicEvaluationo f InvestmentOperations,paragraph8.


                                                     19

71.     The results show that a 150 MWe plant with a 4% solar contribution will increase the
installed cost by about US$99 million (from US$191 million (US$158.2 million inpresent value
terms) for a reference CCGT plant to US$290 million (US$240 million in present value terms)
for the ISCC plant). There will also be incremental O&M cost, the present value o fthese costs i s
about US$19.7 million over the construction and the 25-year project life. The costs are partially
offset by the reduced fuel consumption; the present value o fwhich i s US$4.3 million. Therefore,
the estimated net incremental cost (both capital and operating costs) for 20 MWe o f solar
capacity is US$97.2 million at a 10% discount rate. The proposed GEF financing i s capped at
US$49.8 million so the remaining incremental cost (US$47.2 million) will be financed by
NREA. Annex 15 presents the results inmore detail.

2. FinancialAnalysis

FinancialAssessment of theNew and RenewableEnergy Authority (NREA)

Past and CurrentPerformance of NREA

72.     NREA revenues stem from research and development activities and in recent years,
mainly from the sale o f electricity it generates from renewable sources to EEHC. Based on
audited accounts for the past four years, the company incurred losses, as it transitioned from a




                                                       20

purely research and development entity to one whose major activity is the production o f green
energy.

73.      NREA has recently been able to negotiate an increase in the tariff per kWh it receives
from EEHC for the electricity sold to the grid to 12 PtkWh with gradual annual increases
planned for future years. This has enabled NREA to fully service its debt obligations in the
fiscal year 2005, something it was unable to do in earlier years. As o f 2004/05, the authority's
long-term debt reached LE 1.28 billion (US$223 million), o f which the current portion is
estimated to have reached LE 38.4 million (US$6.7 million).

74.      Inaddition, as of 2004/05 NREA has started benefitingfrom the PetroleumFund, under
which it is eligible to receive 2 Pt per kWh o f energy produced from renewable energy sources.
In2004/05 this additionalrevenueamounted to LE5.8 million(US$1 million), andit is expected
to increase substantially as NREA's installed capacity i s augmented.

75.      The authority has low levels of accounts payables; however, its receivables from EEHC
amount to about LE 33.25 million (US$5.8 million, 287 days). In 2004/05 NREA was able to
collect 80% o fthe revenues it was owed from EEHC.

76.      The authority's main operating expense is with salaries and wages, which account for
about 80% o f total operating expenses. Expenditureson operations and maintenance (O&M) are
low amounting to about 8% of operating expenses and only 0.1% o f its gross fixed assets. As
NREA gears up to become Egypt's major producer of green energy, appropriate maintenance o f
its facilities will be critical to maximize the electricity output and ensure future sustainability of
NREA's assets.

Future Financial Performance of NREA

77.      Projections to assess NREA's future financial position and performance have been
carried out for the period 200906 to 2019/20.          A summary o f the assumptions used in the
forecast i s presentedi s Annex 9 and detailed assumptions are recorded inthe project files.

78.      Projections for NREA's future performance are based onthe following key assumptions:

     0   NREA expects to benefit from the sale o fcarbon emissionreduction credits (based onthe
         amount o f COz emissions saved from the electricity it produces from renewable sources)
         as an additional source of revenue. To this end, it has already signed two bilateral
         agreements encompassing 140 MW o f wind turbines planned to be operational by
         2008/09. It i s assumed that NREA will be able to sell carbon emission reduction credits
         for all the renewable projects it plans to implement inthe future, excluding the ISCC.

     0   From 2006/07 onwards, the tariff NREA charges EEHC for the electricity sold increases
         at the same rate as domestic inflation.

    0    Gradual increase inthe revenuecollected from EEHC to 98% by 2009/2010.
         Gradual increase in O&M expenditures to a level that is equivalent to 1% o f gross fixed
         assets by 2013/14, to be inline with additional installed capacity.



                                                   21

79.     The analysis shows even though NREA's operating margin and cash flow position are
positive, its overall financial performance (taking into account depreciation and finance charges)
deteriorates further in the short-term, with net operating losses being incurred up until
2009/2010, mainly due to the need for significant increases in O&M expenditures, as these
become a critical element in ensuring the maximization o f the electricity output o f current and
future installed capacity, which are key inensuringthe future sustainability ofNREA.

80.     It has been agreed with NREA's management to monitor two financial indicators (a) the
debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and (b) the self finance ratio (SFR) as proxies for financial
soundness. A minimum DSCR o f 1.1 and a minimum SFR of 0.1 are targeted to be achieved
uponproject close.


3. Technical

81.     The plant comprises essentially two portions (a solar portion and a combined cycle
portion). The figure below illustrates the designo fthe integrated plant.




82.     The main technical challenge of the proposed scheme i s the integration and performance
o f the two portions making up the power plant. Further, due to the financing sources
requirements, the Borrower had to separate the procurement of the two portions, resulting into
two contracts (one for the solar and one for the CCGT).         The technical integration risk i s
mitigated through (i)   inclusion inthe completed procurement process o f data exchange between
the two bidderswho have won the contracts; (ii) o f a constructionmanagement consulting
                                                  hiring
firm for the supervision and integration o fthe solar and combined cycle islands, and (iii) hiring



                                                 22

an experienced operator for O&M o f the combined cycle islandwith responsibility to coordinate
operation withthe O&M operator o fthe solar island.

83.    Several clarification meetings (with both Solar Islandand CCGT IslandBidders present)
have taken place to discuss the common section in the bid documents on the interface
requirements, where each Solar Islandbidder will provide their inputs. From the Solar Island
Bidder's inputs, one interface document was established which had to be met by the CCGT
Bidders.

84.    The Solar Islandis designedto achieve the lowest cost o f generation o f solar heat based
on the given data file o f 8,760 hourly reference values o f solar irradiation, solar position and
ambient temperature. The contract with the winning bidder includes a performance model for
the calculation o f heat output as a function o f solar irradiation, solar position and ambient
temperature.

85.    The CCGT Island is designed having as reference the solar island design and cost. In
addition, the supplier of the CCGT received interface requirements from the Solar Island
supplier.

86.    The performance risk is being mitigated through the formulation o f incentives in the
framework of the two O&M contracts for the solar and CCGT Islands- which will regulate the
operation o fthe plant over its lifetime.

87.    The verification o fthe performance ofthe solar O&M operation will be by measuring the
ambient conditions o f solar irradiation and ambient temperature and calculating with the
performance model the amount o f solar heat which should be generated. This calculated amount
will then be compared with the actual generated amount in order to determine if the guarantee
has been achieved. For the CCGT Island, a similar procedure can be adopted; in this case the
actual solar heat produced by the Solar Island serves as an input in order to determine the
requirementfor the CC Islandoperator.

88.     The performance and efficient operation o f the ISCC will ultimately be assured through
incentive mechanisms (penalties and bonuses) as follows:

   The Solar Islandis checked for heat production as a function o f irradiation. Ifit is not met
   there will be corresponding penalties.

   The CCGT Island is checked for electricity production as a function of Solar Heat supplied
   by the Solar Island. It is the responsibility o fthe CC IslandOperator to use all the Solar Heat
   supplied. Ifit is not metthere will be corresponding penalties.

89.     Ifthe electricity productionis not achieved, the shortcomingcan clearly be allocated to
one o fthe two operators.

90.     Inparticular, integrationand control ofthe system shouldbe flexible enoughto allow the
solar contribution to be consistently maximized, while under other circumstances allow power to
be efficiently generated on natural gas only (e.g., during night time or if the solar field i s not



                                                 23

operational).   The bid evaluation criteria and the determination o f the levelized electricity cost
(LEC) were included inthe biddingdocuments.


4. Fiduciary

Procurement issues:

91.     The supplier for the solar island was procured through an international competitive
biddingprocess, inwhichbidderswere giventhe maximum freedom o f choice to meet the plant
specifications from the technological and financial points o f view. The solar field will be o f the
provenparabolic trough type, where 2 types o f designare available (Euro-trough andLS-3). The
combined cycle plant configuration was optimized during the bidding process and became
definite when the winning bidder submitted his final design. The bid documents used allowed
flexibility for a range o f power output inorder to have sufficient competition. The bidders were
allowed to offer gas turbines o f their choice (different or not from the baseline design) which fit
best the evaluation criteria. This open approach aimed at ensuring that optimum technology at
least cost be employed.

92.     A procurement capacity assessment of NREA was carried out during project preparation
and identifiedthat NREA has gained good project implementation and procurement experience
as a result o f its work with several international donors financing some o f its projects. The
assessment also reviewed that NREA's organizational structure for implementing the project i s
satisfactory.

93.     The completed procurement for the solar island prior to final approvals has permitted
project preparation to address several critical procurement issues that are essential to achieving
the project objectives.     The bidding was carried out according to World Bank Procurement
Guidelines to ensure the selection o f reputable contractors/suppliers on a competitive basis. In
particular:

    Pre-qualification was      carried   out   to   ensure   that   only   appropriately   qualified
    contractors/suppliers were invited to bid. Prequalification criteria included: (i)  experience
    and past performance on similar contracts; (ii)capabilities with respect to personnel,
    equipment design, construction, manufacturing and operation facilities; and (iii)      financial
    position;
    The solar island EPC cum O&M contract was procured using the Bank Standard Bidding
    Document: for Supply and Installation of Plant and Equipment with two stage bidding
    procedures;
    Evaluation of the EPC cum O&M bid for the Solar Island and EPC CCGT Island bid was
    based on: (i)   the investment costs (in US$equivalent); (ii)   generation (kWh/a); (iii)  solar
    generation (kWh/a); (iv) O&M costs (US$/a); (v) fuel consumption (Btu/a); and (vi)
    guaranteed availability and degradation o f the unit, and (vi) the final evaluation report was
    cleared by the World Bank's operations procurement review committee.

94.     The CCGT Islandbiddingprocess is also completed. The contract is on the basis ofEPC
only. The O&M contract for the CCGT will be a separately bid. The O&M contractor for the


                                                 24

CCGT will have to guarantee that it meets the annual generation (number o f kWh) and fuel
consumption (number o f million BTU o f gas) predicted from the performance matrix (this
performance matrix i s similar to a performance model) for the actual amount o f solar heat
deliveredto the CC islandand also the annual ambient temperature profile.


Financial management issues:

95.    The project financial management assessment was conducted to assess the financial
management arrangements currently inplace at NREA and their adequacy to support the project
implementation. The purpose are to identifythe associated risks, buildup the relevant mitigating
measures, and agree with the grant recipient on how to deploy or adjust the current arrangements
to support the proposed project and on any special measures that needto be carried out.

96.    By virtue of its articles o f incorporation, NREA adopts the Egyptian UnifiedAccounting
System (UAS) in maintaining its accounts and for reporting on its financial position and its
results of operations.   The UAS i s complimented by the accounting standards issued by the
Central Auditing Organization (CAO) and applicable to public authorities o f economic nature
like NREA. For donors financed projects, NREA maintains separate parallel records (manual
and excel spreadsheets) in order to record and report on these projects' financial position. In
order to provide a full picture on the proposed project, the entire project funds (GEF grant, JBIC
loan, and NREA's local contribution) will be accounted for in one set o f records and financial
statements.

97.    A reporting risk arises from the nonconformity of NREA's accounting system with the
Bank's reporting needs and the inability o f the current system inplace to report separately on the
project funds and transactions. To mitigate this risk, the foreign exchange (FX) department will
maintain parallel records for the project transactions in coordination with the PIE at the project
site and the cost accounting department, and will be responsible for preparing interim and final
project financial statements requiredby the Bank.

98.    NREA's current auditing arrangements are not adequateto report on the project accounts
separately and inaccordance with Bank requirements. The CAO audit does not report separately
on a specific project's accounts. Inaddition, the Bank requests reviews of the interim financial
reports which are not typically provided by the CAO. Therefore it has been agreed that an
independentprivate auditor will be hiredto provide aproject audit and review reports as required
by the Bank.

99.    NREA did not manage a designated account under the Wind and Solar projects
preparation grants which exclusively used direct payments.         GEF grant funds will be fully
applicable to one large contract and therefore disbursementsunder the grant will also take place
via direct payments.

100.    The high share o f local contribution ($126 million out o f $327 million total project cost,
including 2-year o f eligible cost o f O&M) can result in delayed h d s availability and delayed
implementation. NREA will reflect the project investment requirements in its five year budget




                                                  25

planfor FY 07/08 to FY 11/12 to mitigate against this. Inaddition, NREA has already included
part o fthe project costs inits FY 06/07 approvedbudget.

101.    The above mitigating measures, NREA's previous experience with Bank procedures
through the preparation grants (for Solar and Wind Projects), and the relatively simple project
designwithlimitednumberof contracts result inan overall risk rating o fModest.

5. Social

102.    The project will be developed on a site belonging to NREA, close to the existing
Kureimat gas-fired combined-cycle power plant owned and operated by EEHC.                         All
construction-related activities will take place on this land. N o land acquisition i s likely to take
place as a result o f the project. The area covers desert land with no existing residents or any
economic activity taking place. The site i s several kilometers from the town o f Kureimat, and a
separateresidential area set aside for the employees o fthe existing power plant i s located about 2
kilometers from the project site. The existingresidential complex includes a kindergarten and a
sports club. In case any additional buildings will be required, these will be constructed on land
belonging to NREA. A labor camp will not be needed as the workers will be recruited locally
and will commute by bus on a daily basis. Moreover, the site is located ina relatively remote
area a long distance from the nearest permanent settlements, and the construction o f the plant i s
not likely to have negative impacts on local livelihoods. Rather, the planned project has been
reported to be received favorably by the local population for several reasons.             The most
important impact will be local employment, particularly during construction which will brin
income to the nearby communities. Small farmers occupying a total o f about 1,180 feddans15
south of the planned power plant also expect to benefit, particularly during construction, as
opportunities to sell their produce locally will improve.

103.    Inview of the above, no resettlement, land acquisition or loss of livelihood is likely to
take place as a result o fthe project and OP 4.12 i s not expected to be triggered.

6. Environment

104.    An initial scoping study on environmental impacts was undertaken as part o f the
feasibility study prepared by Lahmeyer. It reported that the environmental impacts o fthe project
were expected to be minimal as: (i) site is located in the desert without cultural or

                    Annex 1:Country and Sector or ProgramBackground


CountryIssues

A comprehensive economic reform program was adopted in Egypt in 2004, when significant
change took place in the cabinet and several new officials were appointed to key ministerial
positions. This new government has made economic reform its key objective, notably in areas
such as finance, investment, trade and industry. It has also stated its keen interest to enhance the
provision o f public goods and services, including physical and social infrastructure. The latter
includes the power sector.

The investment needs in infrastructure remain substantial. It is estimated that approximately 4-
6% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) needs to be invested annually in infrastructure sectors in
the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to satisfy new investment requirements as
well as maintenance and replacement pend ding.'^          The decline in investment in the MENA
region, including in Egypt, is reported to have compromised the infrastructure base, which is
further challenged by the high growth in demand for modern infrastructure services. To ensure

responsible for generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Egypt - requires on
adequate provision o f electricity, the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EEHC) -

average about 1,500 MW of new capacity each year. Promotion of renewable energy projects
plays a key part inEgypt's generation plan. Indeed, to date 225 MW of wind-turbines have been
installed andare operational, performing well at an average capacity factor of 42%.

While investment is required to ensure adequate infrastructure, the Government of Egypt (GOE)
is increasingly concerned with the rising fiscal deficit and public debt, which rose from 3.9% in
FYOO to 9.6% inFY05. To counter this, the GOE has been implementing several measures to
reduce the deficit over the medium term by restraining public expenditures and increasing public
revenues. A s a result, the deficit as a percentage of GDP for FY06 dropped to 8.6% and the
GOEplans to reduce it further by 1%per year for the next five years. The key measures that the
GOE has adopted include redesigning of subsidies, controlling growth in public sector
employment and cutting unnecessary expenditures. Some reforms already underway include:

        Increasing retail utility prices, including increases inelectricity and gas prices.

    0   Reducing custom tariffs.
        Reducingprice controls and subsidies on basic products, including diesel-fuel.
    0   Increasing interest inthe potential for public-private partnerships (PPPs).
        Strengthening and reorganizing the privatization program under the Ministry of
        Investment established inJune 2004.

Against these reforms, the GOE remains committed to providing a public safety net comprising
of various subsidies, employment programs and cash transfers and agrees that there is much
room for improvingthe cost-effectiveness of the safety net currently inplace and its coverage of
the poor. Assistance to do this is included inthe Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).

Sector Issues and GovernmentStrategy

Access to electricity i s highinEgypt (98%). However, the fast growing demandputs significant
pressure on the sector's ability to provide reliable and reasonably priced electricity; challenging
both its ability to contribute to higher growth and poverty alleviation. To ensure sustainable
service delivery, the GOE i s implementing reforms in electricity pricing, diversification of
supplyandimprovedefficiency through the development o fa marketfor electricity trade.
v:                      In October 2004, the GOE approved an increase in electricity tariffs, the
first increase in 12 years, and a subsequent tariff increase was approved in 2005 in which the
average tariff changed to 14.86 Pt/kWh (2.5 uS$/kWl~).'~Further increases to industries were
announced inAugust, 2007. Still, Egyptianelectricity prices are low by international standards
and when compared to a number o f other countries in the region, since prices have declined
substantially inreal terms over the 12 year period of no price changes and, with the depreciation
o fthe Egyptianpound, inforeign currency terms as well.

Inaddition to subsidized overall tariffs, there are also substantial cross-subsidies which are not
very well targeted. An inclining block tariff is used to subsidize residential customers who use
the least electricity. The GOE i s fully aware o f cross-subsidization in the sector and, although
the overall electricity retail tariff has increased, subsidies continue to prevail for politically
sensitive customer segments.         The GOE i s keen to eventually reduce the level o f cross-
subsidization in the sector and the subsidies in general, but recognizes that this will take time.
Bank assistance is being provided under the El Tebbin Power Project (Loan No. 7359-EGT) to
design and implementtime o f use tariffs and load management schemes, which would assist in
improving overall cost recovery, as well as sending signals for increased energy efficiency by
reducing demand for electricity at peak periods.

Egypt's significant reserves o f natural gas play a key role in electricity production. Current
proven reserves are estimated at 67.2 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), with an additional 120 Tcf
identified as probable and possible reserve^.'^ To meet projected domestic demand (industrial,
commercial and residential) and export demand (via pipelines and liquefied natural gas
terminals) over the next 20 years, about 15 Tcf i s estimated to be required. This leaves Egypt
with a proven ReservesProduction (RP) ratio of over 80 years. Domestic gas consumption is
dominated by the power sector at 65%' followed by the fertilizer industry, petrochemicals and
other industrial sectors. The price o f natural gas to industries as well as the power sector has
beenset at 21 Pt/m3 (US$l/mmbtu), but an increase over a 3 year periodwas recently announced
for the industrial sector which will see the gas price increase to US$2.65/mmbtu by the third
year.

As natural gas is becoming increasingly important to Egypt's economy, particularly with the
growing potential for exports, moving towards cost-based pricing o f gas is becoming
increasingly important. As a result, the GOE has undertaken a study to determine the cost of gas,
whichthe Bank has assistedthrough ESMAP (Energy Sector Management Assistance Program).
The study has been disseminated among key governmental stakeholders and provided the basis

for the recent increase in gas price to industry and is informing the GOE's longer-term gas
pricingpolicyandstrategy.

Diversification of supply: As stated above, the fast growing demand for electricity requires
significantinvestmentingeneration capacity each year (the increase indemandfor electricity in
Egypt averaged about 7% during 1997/98-2003/04 and is expected to remain in the 6%-7%
range over the next 10 years). Installed capacity of electric power was 20,452 MW in
2005/2006, of which 85% comprised thermal power (10% of which is provided by the private
sector through 3 IndependentPowerProducers,IPPs). The remainingcapacitywas attributedto
hydropower(14%) andwind (1%). Peak loadreached17,300 MW in2005/2006, andabout 90%
of the thermal power productionwas based on natural gas. Initiatives are underway to better
understand customer consumption patterns and loads to ultimately implement demand-side
management measures to reduce the overall consumption and the growth in demand.16 World
Bank assistance is beingprovidedto this effort.

The GOE's strategyis to continue to implementgas firedpowerplants, with a long-termview to
increase the share of combined cycle gas turbine technology in the generationmix. Inaddition,
the GOE has a target o f meeting 3% of its electricity needs from renewable energy sources by
2010; and 20% by 2020 (includinghydro whichtoday comprises 13%of the 20%target). Bank
technical assistance was recently requestedto help in the development and achievement of this
plan. The New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) has the responsibility to develop
renewable resources in Egypt and implement the government's strategy on renewable energy.
Until 2001, most of NREA's activities have been in the research and development field, and
since then its activities have increasinglyturned to the productionof renewable energy. NREA
has in recent years successfully augmented its revenues with income from the sale of carbon
reduction credits under the clean development mechanism. Indeed, agreements have already
beensignedwiththe Japanese, the Danishandthe Germangovernments.

NREA's strategy i s to capitalize on Egypt's abundant wind and solar natural resources to meet
the renewable energy target set by the Government. For this purpose it plans to install an
additional 850 MW of wind by 2010 and considersthe construction of the proposed Integrated
Solar Combined Cycle Power Plant (150 MWe) a key development towards improving and
diversifyingits institutional andtechnical capacity inthe area ofrenewableenergy.

Finally, as an incentive to the development of renewable energy, the GOE has established a
mechanism (the `Petroleum Fund'), where producers of non-fossil fuel electricity receive 2
PtkWh. This mechanismis intendedto accelerate development of renewableenergy by sharing
with developersthe additionalexportrevenuegeneratedfrom fuel savings derived.

Electricitv Market Development: Following the 2001 unbundling of the electricity sector in
Egypt, further reform of the sector includes market development, such as liberalization and
greater regional integration. The Ministry of Electricity and Energy is in the process of
developing a plan for the introduction of competition in the sector consistent with the

16Energy intensity in Egypt in 2004, defined as the energy consumptionper unit of GDP was equal to 0.22 toe /
000' 95 US$,which is comparable to other oil producing countries in the region (Algeria: 0.20) and lower than
others (Iran: 0.33), but higherthan WesternEuropeancountriessuchas Germany(0.18) andFrance(0.19).

implementation o f further tariff increases and on-going improvement in the efficiency o f the
subsidiary companies.      This plan will see gradual opening o f the sector, starting with the
generation segment. To facilitate reform, a regulatory agency has been established and an
electricity law i s under formulation. A Higher Energy Council was recently established under
the chairmanship of the Prime Minister and with members represented by the ministers o f
electricity, petroleum, finance, planning and economic development.           This council reviews
energy alternatives, their economics as well as overall energypolicy and planning.

Egypt's plans are consistent with - and supported by           -its participation in the European
Neighborhood Policy (ENP) partnership, which was developed in the context o f the European
Unions' (EU) 2004 enlargement with the objective o f avoiding the emergence o f new dividing
lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbors. A key feature o f the ENP is the bilateral ENP
Action Plans mutually agreed between the EU and each partner country. These action plans set
out an agenda o f political and economic reforms with short and medium-termpriorities. Inthe
case o f Egypt, the action plan i s under discussion and includes market liberalization (inprinciple
by 2010) and continued price reform inboththe electricity andgas sectors.

Meeting the reform targets in the action plan will require far-reaching reforms o f the Egyptian
power sector. Some assistance on how to achieve this i s being provided through the EU. The
European Investment Bank also has significant grant funds available to Egypt for technical
assistance. Nevertheless, significant work remains on the detailed steps required to meet the
liberalization objective, as well as Government policy on how to finance sector investments in
the longer term, including the respective roles o f the public and private sectors. On the latter, the
GOE remains open to private sector participation, although the pressureon the financial status o f
the sector has led to the GOE opting for public sector financing for the time being. Clearly,
tariffhubsidy reform would need to accompany any large-scale re-engagement with private
participation, as well as and as mentioned earlier; reform o f the social safety net, which i s a key
priority o f the GOE. The Bank is providing the Government with assistance to formulate an
energy pricing strategy including reforms to social safety nets and social protection in order to
support the implementation o ftariff/subsidyreforms.

             it                                                there
radiationwhich reaches 2400 kWh/m2/year;(iii)i s close to the extendedunifiedpower grid as
                                                   it
well as natural gas pipelines; and (iv) it is near to water sources (e.g., the Nile River). The
designofthe project is basedon a conceptual designreport preparedby Fichnter Consultants

The plant will have a combined capacity o f about 150 MW, including 20 MW of solar capacity.
When own consumption of 6.3 MW is deducted, the net overall plant capacity becomes 143.4
MW. The total net energy producedby the plant is expected to be 852 GWh per year, which
includes the solar contribution o f 33.4 GWh per year. This corresponds to a solar share o f 4 YO
o fthe total annual energy produced by the plant operating at a full load.

The project will be implemented through three components. For Component 1 the costs are
known since the procurement process for both the solar and the combined cycle portions have
been completed. These costs are inclusive of import taxes on equipment and contingencies.
Having said that, NREA will apply for an import tax waiver for select equipment at the time o f
actual import which would result in a potential saving o f US$22.4 million for the project. For
Component 2 and 3, estimated costs are presented.

Component 1. The design, construction and operation of the proposed Integrated Solar
CombinedCyclePlantincludetwo sub-components:

     The solar portion o f the power plant (US$111million; of which GEF willfinance US$49.8
     million and NREA US61.2 million) includes one contract for engineering, procurement,
     construction, testing, commissioning and two years operation and maintenance (O&M).
     The solar island consists o f a parabolic trough solar field capable o f generating about 73
     MW (thermal) o f solar heat at a temperature o f 393"C, the related Instrumentation and
     Control (I&C) and control room andthe heat transfer fluid (HTF) system up to the HTF inlet
     andoutlet flanges o fthe Solar Heat Exchanger(s).

     The capital cost ofthe combined cycle portion of the plant (US$201 million; of whichJBIC
     will finance US$151.3million and NREA US$49.7million) includes one contract for the
     EPC aspect of the power plant. Inaddition, one 2 year O&M contract will be financed by
     NREA (US$8.8 million). The combined cycle island will consist of one gas turbine with
     I S 0 rating o f about 73.3 MWe, one heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), one steam
     turbine o f about 76.5 MWe, and solar heat exchanger(s) capable to absorb about 73 MW
     (thermal) solar heat plus all associated balance ofplant equipment.

Component 2.        Comprises capacity building to NREA through consulting services for
construction management during the construction, testing and operation o f the plant (US$6.36
million, including price contingency).      The capacity building will focus on: (a) detailed
engineeringdesigns with special attention to the interface between the solar and CCGT parts; (b)
supervising the construction and environmental aspects o f the power plant; (c) monitoring the
commissioning and guarantee tests; (d) preparing the O&M contract for the CCGT part interms
satisfactory to the Bank. As such, NREA will seek the Bank's comments on the draft contract

before requestingproposals; (e) providing assistance during the 2 year guarantee period as well
as assisting NREA in monitoring and evaluation o f the performance o f the whole plant at least
duringthe two years o fthe O&M period; and (f)providing training and transfer o f know-how in
ISCC plant operation, with particular emphasis to dispatching and integration into the power
system so that NREA staff can successfully take over the power plant after the respective O&M
contracts expire.

Component 3. Comprises the Environmental and Social Impact management component to be
financed by NREA (US$0.45 million, including price contingency).          This component will
include the implementation o f the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which mitigates the
potential environmental and social impacts associated with the construction and operation o f the
power plant.

                            Annex 6: ImplementationArrangements


The project will be implementedby NREA. NREA was established in 1986 (Law No. 102) to
act as the focal point to introduce and promote renewable energy technologies, with a particular
emphasis on commercial scale electricity generation from renewable sources. NREA has been
able to very successfully assume this role and i s increasingly focusing on electricity production
fkom wind, and other renewable sources. NREA receives full support from the Ministry o f
Energy and Electricity to succeed in its role and also receives support from the Egyptian
Electricity Holding Company (EEHC) in furthering its capacity to prepare and implement large
projects.

NREA, as the Executing Agency and as the mandated agency in Egypt to develop renewable
resources, will be responsible for the project management.        NREA will establish a Project
Implementation Entity (PIE) headed by an experienced Project Manager who will report to the
Deputy Chairman for Projects and Operation. The PIE will be responsible for the day to day
management activities o f the proposed project and will be staffed by a core specialists in
technical, financing/accounting, and procurement matters, which will be based at the project site.

Ln addition, the PIE will liaise closely with other departments at headquarters for support in
legal, financial, environment and planning matters. NREA will be assisted in this project by a
Consulting Engineering Consultant. Its main mission will be to: (a) review o f the detailed
engineeringdesigns with special attention to the interface between the solar and CCGT parts; (b)
supervise the construction and environmental aspects o f the power plant; (c) monitor the
commissioning and guarantee tests; (d) prepare the O&M contract for the CCGT portion; (e)
provide assistance during the 2 year guarantee period as well as assisting NREA in
monitoring/evaluation o f the performance o f the whole plant at least during the two years o f the
O&M contractual period; (f) provide training andtransfer o f know-how inISCC plant operation,
withparticular emphasis to dispatching and integration into the power system so that NREA can
successfully take over the plant after the respective O&M contracts expire.

              Annex 7: FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements


ExecutiveSummaryand Conclusions:

The project financial management assessmentwas conducted to assess the financial management
arrangements currently in place at NREA and their adequacy to support the project
implementation. The purpose i s to identify the associated risks, build up the relevant mitigating
measures, and agree with the grant recipient on how to deploy or adjust the current arrangements
to support the proposed project and any special measuresthat needto be carried out.

The proposed GEF grant will be made to the GOE and be on-granted to NREA. NREA will also
be responsible for financing part of the project cost and repaying the JBIC loan which will
finance the foreign cost related to the conventional part o f the plant. This loan has already been
approved and i s guaranteed by the GOE. Cost recovery o fthe power producedunder this project
will beensuredthrough a power purchase agreement (PPA) betweenNREA andEEHC.

By virtue o f its articles o f incorporation, NREA adopts the Egyptian Unified Accounting System
(UAS) in maintaining its accounts and for reporting on its financial position and its results of
operations.    The UAS is complimented by the accounting standards issued by the Central
Auditing Organization (CAO) and applicable to public authorities of economic nature like
NREA. For donor financed projects, NREA maintains separate parallel records (manual and
excel spreadsheets) in order to record and report on the projects' financial position. In order to
provide a full picture on the proposed project, the entire project funds (GEF grant, JBIC loan, and
NREA's local contribution) will be accounted for inone set ofrecords and financial statements.

A reporting risk arises from the nonconformity of NREA's accounting system with the Bank's
reporting needs and the inability o f the current system inplace to report separately on the project
funds and transactions. To mitigate this risk, the FX departmentwill maintain parallel records for
the project transactions in coordination with the PIE at the project site and the cost accounting
department, and will be responsible for preparing interim and final project financial statements
requiredby the Bank.

NREA's current auditing arrangements are not adequate to report on the project accounts
separately and inaccordance with Bank requirements. The CAO audit does not report separately
on a specific project's accounts. In addition, the Bank requests reviews o f the interim financial
reports which are not typically provided by the CAO. Therefore, it has been agreed that an
independentprivate auditor will be hiredto provide project audit and review reports as required
bythe Bank.

NREA didnot managea designated account underthe Wind and Solar projects preparationgrants
which exclusively used direct payments. The GEF grant funds will be fully applicable to one
large contract andtherefore disbursementsunder the grantwill also take place via direct payment.

The high share of local contribution ($126 million out of $327 million total project cost,
including 2-year o f eligible cost o f O&M) can result in delayed funds availability and delayed
implementation. To mitigate this risk, NREA will reflect the project investment requirementsin



                                                 40

its five year budget plan for FY 07/08 to FY 11/12. In addition NREA has already includedpart
ofthe project costs inits FY 06/07 approvedbudget.

The above mitigating measures, NREA's previous experience with Bank proceduresthrough the
preparation grants (for Solar and Wind Projects), and the relatively simple project design with
limitednumberof contracts collectively contribute to an overall FMrisk of Modest.

CountryFMIssues:

The Report on Observance of Standards and Codes - Accounting & Auditing (ROSC-AA)
(2002) and the draft Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) report (2003)
identifiedsome weaknesses inthe reporting andauditing environment inEgypt. The ROSC-AA
includedan assessment as to the degree of compliance with International Standards on Auditing
(ISA). Compliancewas found to vary among audit firms andwas not always ensured. The 2003
CFAA assessed the fiduciary risk associated with the budgeting arrangements, internal control
system, and accounting and financial reporting arrangements to be significant (this assessment
covered state owned enterprises and Public Authorities). Such risks are applicable to NREA as a
public Authority. Thus, the condition of the country overall reporting and auditing environment
affects the project assessed risks and, accordingly, special measures are being taken with regards
to F Marrangementsas shown below (special reporting and separate audit arrangements).

ImplementingEntity:

NREA was established in 1986 as a public authority reporting to the Minister o f Electricity and
Energy. Its budget is preparedinaccordance with the provisions of the law o fthe State's Public
Budget. Its board of directors is entitled to ratify its organizational structure, to ratify its annual
budget and final accounts, and to lay down the rules, regulations and internal statutes related to
financial, accounting and administrative affairs.

NREA's staff at the FX department has acquired some experience with Bank procedures through
the Solar Thermal and the Wind preparation grants. In addition, possible synergies can be
materialized from coordination between the FX department, the cost accounting department and
the audit department. This i s feasible especially as the cost accounting department already
records financial information at the project level with classificationas to the type o f expenditures.

The cost accounting, general accounting, purchasing and auditing departments are headed by the
Head o fthe financial sector. The FX, finance and the budget departments are headedby the Head
o f the economic and commercial sector. Both o f the Head o f the financial sector and the Head o f
the economic and commercial sector report to the Vice President for financial and administrative
affairs. The relationships are illustrated inthe following chart.

Budgeting:

NREA prepares an annual budget consisting o f a current budgetthat is submittedto the Ministry
o f Finance and an investment budgetthat i s submittedto the Ministry o f Economic Development


                                                  43

(formerly Ministry o f Planning). Inaddition, it preparesa five year investmentbudgetplan. The
new 5 year plan will be for the period from FY 07/08 to FY 11/12. The budget submission
usually takes place in February o f each year.      Since the budget i s subject to parliamentary
approval, exceeding allocations cannot take place without parliamentary approval. Changes
among components however can take place with the approval o f the Ministry o f Economic
Development. Changes inallocations o f donors' financing requirethe approval o fthe donor and
the Ministry o f International Cooperation. The project budget i s currently being prepared in
sufficient details to allow monitoring any deviations.

For the project purposes, payments from the local budget are subject to the review o f the budget
department, the audit department and the Ministry o f Finance controller. For payments from
foreign loans and grants, the Economic and Commercial sector i s relatively more autonomous
where budget approval and withdrawal applications are processed within the same sector.
However they are later subject to post reviewby the audit department.

Accounting:

By virtue o f its articles o f incorporation, NREA adopts the Egyptian UnifiedAccounting System
(UAS) inmaintaining its accounts. Inthis context, it follows the standard chart of accounts per
the UAS. Yet it follows the accounting standards issued by the CAO as a complimentary
framework for the UAS.            On the project level, the cost accounting department records
transactions at the individual project level, classify them by type o f expenditures and allocate
overheads to relevant projects. Although the cost accounting department is not concerned with
the project's sources of funding, its recording o f project expenditures, mainly direct costs,
provides a good source for reconciling project records maintainedby the FX department with the
cost accounting records. For reporting on its financial position and its results o f operations,
NREA applies the accounting standards issuedby the Central Auditing Organization in Egypt.
For donors financed projects, NREA maintains separate records (manual and excel spreadsheets)
through its FX department inorder to monitor inflows andoutflows o f donors funds and to report
on the projects' financial position.

Finally the limitednumber o f contracts underthe project components rendersthe management o f
the project funds andthe related accounting and reportingfunctions less complicated.

InternalControl:

The project payments will be processed through multiple layers o f control before payments are
issued. Throughout this process, segregation o f duties will be observed between those who
prepare, review, authorize and reconcile payments. Contractors' certificates o f payment will be
reviewedand approved by the construction management consultant, NREA's site engineers, and
finally the audit department. Inaddition, bank reconciliations are conducted by a section that i s
different from the section that processesthe payments.

Original documents will follow the typical filing system o fNREA. Inparallel, filing o f copies o f
project supporting documents will be kept at the FX department along with appropriate cross
referencing to NREA's central filing system.



                                                 44

The risk o fineligible expenditures arises withthe introduction o fthe use o f a designated account.
However this risk will be mitigated with the grant funds being fully applied to one contract that
i s subject to Bank prior review. Inaddition, direct payments will be made to the contractor from
the GEF account.

N o special internal audit function exists. The audit function i s limitedto a compliance check in
the form o fanex-ante reviewfor eachpayment.

Flow of Funds:

Banking Arrangements:       The fact the GEF grant funds will be fully applicable to one large
contract allows for the use o f direct payments as a preferred method o f disbursement, as such
there i s no needfor a project designated account.

Availabilitv o f Counterpart Funds: With the large amount o f local contribution required (about
US$126 million), there i s a risk in the timely availability o f the local contribution. NREA will
submit its 5 year budget plan inFebruary 2007 taking into consideration the project investment
requirements. Inaddition, NREA has already included part o f the project costs inits FY 06/07
approved budget. Also, the Government has expressed strong commitment at the top to execute
and support this project.

Allocation o f Grant Proceeds: The GEF grant will be fully applied to one contract which will
include the engineering, procurement, construction, testing, commissioning and two years
operations and maintenance o f the solar portion o f the plant up to the set ceiling o f US$49.8
million. As mentioned above, NREA i s already working on incorporating this project's
investmentrequirements inits 5 year investmentplanfor the period from FY07/08 to FY 11/12.

DisbursementArrangements:

The proceeds o fthe Grant will be disbursedto the contractor through the Bank's direct payment
procedure and will be used to finance project activities under the contract. Withdrawal
Applications (WAS)for direct payment (and/or Special Commitments) will be accompanied by
appropriate records (ie., contract and invoices) in accordance with the procedures described in
the DisbursementLetter and the Bank's `Disbursement Manual'. NREA will be responsible for
submitting WAS for direct payment to the Bank accompanied by the necessary supporting
records.     As projected by Bank's standard disbursement profiles, disbursements will be
completed by Project closure. A four month grace period will be allowed for the payment o f
invoices submittedby the closing date.

Reporting:

Reporting on the earlier Recipient-executed preparation grants was relatively simple based upon
the low size ofthe grants andthe simplenature o fthe very few consultancy contracts under these
grants. The previous grants were accounted for by the FX and finance department at NREA.
Since the construction management consultant will provide NREA with periodic progress reports
covering the three contracts under the project, such input can be used as a basis for reconciling
the financial reports generatedat the FX

     applications and quarterly financial statements sent to the Bank. The Bank will follow up
     during supervision missions. The format o fthe reports should be quite simple (a trial balance
     listing all sources anduses o f funds and bank reconciliations).
(ii) financial statements. Thesewillbeproducedwithin 3 weeks from eachquarter

(iii)Annual financial statements. The project financial statements should be ready 3 months from
     the end o f fiscal year to enable the submission o f the audit report within 6 months after the
     closing date o f the fiscal year. The project financial statements will have to include: (i)  a
     statement o f sources and uses of funds indicating funds received from various sources and
     project expenditures; and (ii)  schedules classifying project expendituresby component, sub-
     component, and category.
To minimize the reporting requirements from NREA, template financial reports were shared with
JBIC inorder to consider possible synergiesbetween the World Bank and JBIC progress reports.
As feasible, the Bankwill try to agree with JBIC on common financial reports format.


AttestationArrangements

To meet the Bank audit requirements, NREA had contracted a private auditor acceptable to the
Bank to report on the preparation grants financial statements. Acceptable reports were received
by the Bank and no overdue reports are outstanding as o f October 2006. For the proposed
project, a similar project audit assignment will be required for which the auditor's terms o f
reference will needto be agreed betweenNREA and the Bank. This i s inaddition to an audit o f
NREA's financial statements as the revenue earningkontinuing entity. Discussions with JBIC
representative indicated that they do not have an audit requirement for these project financial
statements.

The project will be subject to two types ofattestation engagementsas follows:




                                                    46

Annual Audits: Annual audits for the project will be conducted by an independent private
auditor acceptable to the Bank who will be contractedand paid by NREA to audit all project
componentsandprovideone reportfor the project as a whole. The audit report, accompaniedby
a management letter, will cover the project's financial statements and use of direct payments.
The report should be submitted by NREA to the Bank no later than six months following the
closing of the fiscal year subject of the audit @seal year July I to June 30). The external audit
report should be in accordance with the Bank auditing requirements/TOR and conducted
accordingto InternationalStandards on Auditing (ISA). Inaddition, NREA shouldprovide the
Bank with its annual financial statements and the CAO audit report on them no later than six
monthsfollowingthe closingofNREA's fiscal year.

QuarterlyReviews: The same project auditor will also be requiredto conduct quarterlyreviews
ofthe project'sinterimfinancial statementswithin 45 days from the endof each calendarquarter.
Withdrawals from the loan that are included in interim statements will be part of the scope of
these quarterlyreviews.




SuDervision Plan

After the approvalof the grant, the Bank FMS will participate inthe Bank supervisionmissions
that follow upon implementationprogress. At leasttwo supervisionmissionsfor the projectwill
be carried out annually in addition to follow up visits as deemed necessary. The review and
audit reports of the interim and annual financial statements respectively will be checked on a
regular basis by the Bank FMS and the results or any issues will be followed up during the
supervision missions. Audit reports and management letters will be checked and any issues
identifiedwill be followed up by the Bank FMS. Also, duringthe Bank's supervisionmissions,
the Project'sfinancial managementand disbursement arrangementswill be reviewedto ensure
compliancewith the Bank's requirementsandto developthe financial managementratingto the
ImplementationStatusReport(ISR).

                               Annex 8: ProcurementArrangements


A. General

Procurement for the proposed project was advanced during project preparation and has been
carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The
Grant will finance a single contract, for which the procurement process is now completed in
accordance to World Bank Procurement Guidelines.               Procurement o f non-bank financed
contracts for other components o f the power plant (the combined cycle component and
consultant services) has been conducted using JBIC's procurement procedures and Standard
BiddingDocuments(SBD), which are satisfactory to the Bank.

CountryBackground

A legal framework anchored in the Public Tender Law No. 89/1998 governs public sector
procurement inEgypt; the system is described in the updated Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR) dated December 2005. The New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) is a
public entity governed by Law No. 102/1986. Thus, the national laws and regulations are
applicable to NREA's procurement system.

Procurement of the Solar Island: The solar island of this project was procured under one
contract for engineering, procurement, construction, testing and commissioning and a two-year
operation and maintenance contract (O&M) for the Solar field. Such contract consists of the
supply and installation (single responsibility contract) of the solar island which is a part o f the
ISCC Power Plant at Kureimat. The procurement process was carried out during preparation
with the help of an international consulting firm financed by a GEF grant to provide technical
assistance to NREA to: (i)develop the feasibility study, (ii)develop the prequalification and
biddingdocuments, and (iii) with launching the prequalification and bid documents. The
                                assist
borrower carried out a prequalification process under Bank supervision and no objection.
Prequalified contractors/suppliers were invited to submit bids for this component. Procurement
was conducted using the Bank's SBD for International Competitive Bidding o f Supply and
Install under two-stage procedures.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

An assessmentofthe New andRenewable EnergyAuthority's procurement capacity was carried
by Armando Ribeiro Araujo (Consultant) and Abdul Gabbar Al-Qattab (Procurement Specialist)
in May/October 2006.         NREA has gained good project implementation and procurement
experience as a result o f its work with several international donors financing some o f its projects.
NREAhasbeenresponsible for implementingthe project includingthe Solar Islandcontract.

The assessment also reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project.
Procurement i s carried out by the Purchasing Department o f the NREA, which i s divided into
two purchasing committees: one for smaller contract below one million Egyptian Pounds while




                                                  48

the other - high purchasing committee- supervises, monitors and approves the procurement
decisions for all largercontracts.

The Solar Islandbidding as indicatedabove has been completed in accordanceto World Bank
ProcurementGuidelines.

C. ProcurementPlan

This project involves the financing of only one contract under International Competitive
Bidding. Consequently,aprocurementplanwas not required.

D. FrequencyofProcurementSupervision

In addition to the prior review supervision carried out, the capacity assessment of the
Implementing Agency has recommended supervision missions to visit the field to monitor
implementationevery six months.




                                           49

                             Annex 9: Economic and FinancialAnalysis


Economic Analysis

The appraisal o f the proposed project is based on a feasibility study prepared by Lahmeyer
Consultants and a conceptual design study prepared by Fichtner Solar Consultants.                    These
studies provided estimates o f the costs o f hybrid solar thermal variants and their baseline
equivalent CCGTs, including the economic least cost plant size, its dispatch into the power
system, possible technology variants and cost estimates. Since the bidding process has been
completed, real market data on the cost of both the solar and combined cycle portions are
available and are usedas the basis to appraise the project.


Cost-BenejitAnalysis
The cost benefit analysis o f the project shows that for a total capacity o f 150 MWe, and
introducing a 4 % solar contribution, the installed cost of the plant will be about $290 million.
The installedcost includes the cost o f equipment(based on bids awarded) and the estimated cost
for consulting during implementation which has yet to be bid for but represents a small cost
component as well as the estimated cost for the EMP17. The cost o f equipment excludes taxes
and import duties (an estimated US$22.4 million).
As for operatingcosts, the present value o f fuel, O&M costs and consumables amounts to $153
million over the 25-year lifetime andthe constructionphase. The O&M costs ineconomic terms
assume an economic cost of natural gas o f US$2.52/mmbtu as compared to the actual price
charged to the power sector o f US$l/mmbtu. The cost o f gas assumption i s basedon results o f a
study on the economic cost o f natural gas inthe domestic market which has beencarried out by
international consultants financed by ESMAP (Energy Sector Management Assistance Program)
andmanagedbythe World Bank.
Economic benefits are derived from the economic value of electricity generated, where the
average electricity tariff has beenassumedto be US$0.07/kWh -- the price for electricity exports
to Jordan. The GEF grant o f $49.8 million has been included as an economic benefit as it
reflects global willingnessto pay for this project.'*
Based on these costs and benefits, the project generates a net present value of US$54 million and
the EIRRofthe project is 13%.




17 The estimatedcosts for consultingduring implementationand for the EMPare assumedto be incurredduring
projectconstructionphase.Inpracticeparto fsuch costs may be incurredduringoperatingphase.

Financial Analysis

FinancialAssessment of the New and RenewableEnergyAuthority (NREA)

Past and Current Performance of NREA

NREA revenues stem from researchand development activities and inrecent years, mainly from
the sale o f electricity it generates from renewable sources to EEHC. Based on audited accounts
for the past four years, the company incurred losses, as it transitioned from a purely research and
development entity to one whose major activity is the productionof green energy.

NREA has recently been able to negotiate an increase in the tariff per kWh it receives from
EEHC for the electricity sold to the grid to 12 P t k W h with a 5% annual tariff escalation. This
has enable NREA to fully service its debt obligations inthe fiscal year 2005, something it was
unable to do in earlier years. As of 2004/05, the company's long-term debt reached LE 1.28
billion (US$223 million), o f which the current portion i s estimated to have reached LE 38.4
million (US$6.7 million).

Inaddition, as of2004/05 NREA has startedbenefitingfrom the PetroleumFund, under which it
i s eligible to receive 2 Pt per kWh o f energy produced from renewable energy sources. In
2004/05 this additional revenue amounted to LE 5.8 million (US$l million), and it i s expectedto
increase substantially as NREA's installed capacity i s augmented.

The company has low levels o f accounts payables; however, its receivables from EEHC amount
to about LE 33.25 million (US$5.8 million, 287 days). In 2004/05 NREA was able to collect
80% o fthe revenues it was owed from EEHC

The company's mainoperatingexpense is with salaries and wages, which account for about 80%
o f total operating expenses.      Expenditures on operations and maintenance (O&M) are low
amounting to about 8% o f operating expenses and only 0.1% of its gross fixed assets. As NREA
gears up to become Egypt's major producer o f green energy, appropriate maintenance o f its
facilities will be critical to maximize the electricity output and ensure NREA's future
sustainability.

Future Financial Performance of NREA

Projections to assess NREA's future financial position and performance have been carried out
for the period 2005/06 to 2019/20. A summary o f the assumptions used in the forecast i s
presentedbelow and detailed assumptions are recorded inthe project files.

Projections for NREA's future performance are based on the following key assumptions:

         NREA expects to benefit from the sale o fcarbon emission reduction credits (basedonthe
         amount o f COz emissions saved from the electricity it produces from renewable sources)
         as an additional source o f revenue. To this end, it has already signed two bilateral
         agreements encompassing 140 MW o f wind turbines planned to be operational by



                                                 52

        2008/09. It i s assumed that NREA will be able to sell carbon emission reduction credits
        for all the renewable projects it plans to implementinthe future, excluding the ISCC.
        From 2006/07 onwards, the tariff NREA charges EEHC for the electricity sold will
        benefitfrom gradual increasesto off-set domestic inflation.

    0   Gradual increase inthe revenuecollected from EEHC to 98% by 2009/2010.

    0   Gradual increase inO&M expenditures to a level that is equivalent to 1%o f gross fixed
        assets by 2013/14, to be inline withthe additional installed capacity.

The analysis shows even thoughNREA's operating marginand cash flow position are positive,
its overall financial performance (taking into account depreciation and finance charges)
deteriorates further in the short-term, with net operating losses being incurred up until
2008/2009, mainly due to the need for significant increases in O&M expenditures, as these
become a critical element in ensuring the maximization o f the electricity output o f current and
future installedcapacity, which are keyinensuringthe future sustainability ofNREA.

Duringappraisal the team agreed withNREA's management to monitor two financial indicators
(a) the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and (b) the self finance ratio (SFR) as proxies for
financial soundness. A minimum DSCR o f 1.1 and a minimum SFR o f 0.1 are targeted to be
achieved by project close in2011..

Assumptionsfor projections offinancial performance of EEHC
The analysis is based on actual audited results for the years 2001/02-2004/05 and company
estimates for 2005/06.       The projections cover the years 2005/06-2019/20. The project
implementationperiod i s 2006/07-2013/14.

Key Assumptions for financialstatements

Installedcapacity             i s assumed to increase according to the investment plan received
                              from NREA, with total installed capacity reaching 900 MW by
                              2009/2010 and remains constant at 1,000 MW from 2010/11
                              onwards.
Electricity production        i s assumed to be a function o f installed capacity, with an average
                              capacity factor o f 42% for the wind farms. (Source: NREA)
Electricity losses            includes own consumption and is estimated to be 1% o f gross
                              productionvolume. (Source: NREA)
Electricity prices            is assumed to increase annually by the local inflation from
                              2006/07 onwards for electricity generated from all projects.
Production sold as carbon     MWhNREA plans to sell according to the provisions o f the clean
emission reductioncredits     development mechanism as carbon emission reduction credits.
                              (Source: NREA)
Amount o fCOz saved           is assumed to be 0.567 tons by MWhproduced. (Source: Riso)
Price o f carbon emission     is based on the contractual prices per ton o f C02 saved, which is
reductioncredits              the price NREA has negotiated in its current agreements under the
                              CDMframework.

Petroleum Fund            is a fund created by the GOE in which the Petroleum Ministryis to
                          share with NREA the marginal income that is generated by
                          exporting the fuel saved in generating electricity from renewable
                          sources. (Source: NREA).
Inflation                 domestic inflation is assumed to be 5% per year as o f 2006/07,
                          while the foreign inflation i s assumed to be 2.5% per year as o f
                          2006/07.

IncomeStatement

Revenues                  are mainly derived from electricity sales to EEHC, other
                          significant source o f revenues comprise o f income from carbon
                          emission reduction credit agreements, and the petroleum fund
                          which are expected to increase substantially in the future. Other
                          sources o f revenues include research and development activities as
                          well as small scale renewable projects.
Salaries                  are assumed to increase with at the rate o f 10% per year. (Source:
                          NREA)
Operating & Maintenance   Comprise O&M costs for ISCC and wind projects. These are
costs                     assumed to increase gradually towards 1% o f gross fixed assets by
                          2014/15 and 1.5% by the end o f the projection (Source: NREA
                          and industrypractice).
ISCC Fuel Cost            the cost for natural gas needed to supply the ISCC Plant is
                          assumed to be the current domestic market price charged by
                          EGAS o f 22 Piasters/m3, and increase by the local inflation from
                          2010/11 onwards.
Administrative and Other   include rental o f buildings, utility services for administration,
Operating Expenses        vehicles, etc., and are assumed to increase annually at the rate o f
                           local inflation.
Depreciation              the current charge is based on the straight line methodology and
                          assumed to continue as such. To this charge, the project assets are
                          added which are assumed to depreciate over 33.3 years on
                           average, i.e., 3% per year.
Interest                  comprises interest payments on borrowings.
Profit tax                NREAtax rate is 10% o fits profits.

EnvironmentalImDactAssessment

Introduction: The proposed project falls under the World Bank environmental category B
classification due to the fact that the impacts are expected to be site-specific. The site o f the
proposed plant is a fenced area o f desert land - allocated to the Ministry o f Energy and
Electricity by the GOE for the proposed project - about 95 km south o f Cairo. O f the World
Bank's ten safeguard policies, only Operation Policy 4.01 on Environmental Assessment i s
triggered. As such, a full EnvironmentalImpact Assessment (EIA) o f the environmental, safety
and health impacts was carried out. The latest EIA was disclosed inthe Infoshop on December
28, 2006 and locally on June 20, 2006. The EIA was approved by the EgyptianEnvironmental
Affairs Agency (EEAA).

The plant will consist o f an integrated solar combined cycle power plant comprising a solar field
and a combined cycle power block. With the solar field comprising parabolic trough collectors
and heat transfer fluid (HTF) passing through heat exchangers to generate steam and the
combined cycle comprising one gas turbines, a heat recovery steam generator and a steam
turbine generator. The plant will occupy an area o f approximately 2,772,000 m2 (of which
130,800 the solar portion). The overall generating capacity of the power plant will be 150 MWe.
The configuration of the power plant is based on a conceptual design feasibility report carried
out by Fichtner Solar (consulting firm).

Alternatives considered: (i) and (ii)
                              site;       cooling system.

(i)Foursiteswere considered(RedSeaCoast, SinaiPeninsula, WestDesert andKureimat).
The Kureimat site has been selected based on the minimal additional infrastructurerequireddue
to the nearby 750 MW combined-cycle power plant, realization of desirable benefits for the
development o fthe site andthe availability o f a local workforce.

(ii)Two differentcoolingsystemshavebeenconsideredfor thisproject: "Once Through"
cooling and "Circulating Cooling" (also referredto as "cooling tower"), with or without storage.
Inthe Once Throughcooling system, coldwater is taken from a source such as sea or river at one
point, passedthrough the condenser to remove latent heat and discharged back to the source at a
higher temperature. Inthe Circulating Cooling system, the cold water is circulated through the
condenser to remove latent heat. The hot water from the condenser outlet i s further circulated in
a cooling tower where the heat carried by the circulating water i s further dissipated to the
atmosphere by evaporative cooling.

    For the proposed project, water will be abstracted from the Nile River. As such, the
    ISCC will share the water intake structure with the Combined Cycle (CC) plant which i s
    currently under bidding. There are two water intakes for this CC plant, one is under
    construction and the other i s in the design and tenderingphase. There will be an agreement
    between NREA and Upper Egypt Electricity Production Company, owner o f CC plant, that
    NREA will have its own feed water pipe from the second intake structure currently under
    design and tender. NREA will finance the water pipe and the additional pumps required for
    transferring the water from the planned intake structure to the ISCC plant. NREA's water



                                                 58

    pipelinewill be passing via UpperEgyptElectricity Production Company land and there will
    be no needfor any land acquisitions.

The circulating cooling system, i.e. the cooling tower ,has been selected for the proposed project
due to the following reasons: (i)  it requires less water (11,335 m3per hour compared to 22,890
m3 per hour, including make-up water, mirror washing, etc) (ii)it increases power plant
efficiency by 1% due to ambient temperatures; and (iii)     it is less costly (about 40% less) The
use o f cooling towers may result in the formation o f visible vapor plumes or ground fogging.
However, this has been assessed to be manageable given that the prevailing wind i s in the N S
and NE directions and the plant i s about 1.2 kilometers from the road. The option without
storage was also selected due to the higher cost associated with storage.

The EIA has beencarried out by Energy and Environment Consultants, and sub-contractors, and
has been prepared using a combination o f quantitative and qualitative assessment techniques
ranging from computer modeling for air, water, and noise and traffic impacts to ecological and
aquatic surveys and visual evaluations. The design o f the plant incorporates various measures to
minimize environmental impacts. These include use o f natural gas as the main fuel, low NO,
combustors inthe gas turbines, a stack height o f 35 meters to maximize dispersion o f emissions,
as well as oil interceptors fitted to the site drainage system and effluent treatment facilities to
treat wastewater prior to discharge.

Table 10.1below provides an overview o f anticipated impacts as they comply with Egyptian and
World Bank guidelines while the section below summarizes the potential impacts o f the
construction and operation o f the solar-thermal power plant as well as the proposed mitigation
measures.

                  Table10.1: Summary Environmental Impacts and Guidelines




    (1) There are no Egyptianstandards for NO2
    (2) The EgyptianStandardfor TSP (all sizes) refers to emissions far from inhabitedurbanareas.
    (3) "Chlorine shocking" may be preferable in certain circumstances,which involves using highchlorine levels
        for a few seconds rather than a continuous low level release. The maximum value is 2 mgr' for up to 2
        hours, which must notbe morefrequent than once in24 hours(andthe 24 hour average shouldbe 0.2mg/l).
    (4) There are no sensitive receptorsfor noise within 0.5 km o fthe power plant. The area has beencategorized
        as an "Industrial area" with respect to Egyptianambient noise standards and "Industrial commercial" with
        respectto WorldBankguidelines.



ImDactassessment and mitigationmeasuresduringconstruction

Air quality due to dust emissions. Construction activities will result in high levels of dust;
however there are no significant residential receptors or sensitive environments inthe immediate
boundaries of the power plant. Nevertheless, there could be effects o n air quality, visibility and
traffic safety. To minimize impacts, mitigation measures related to good site practice will be
employed, including:


                                                       60

   Roads will be keptdamp through use o f water sprays;
   Stockpiles o f friable materials will be sited and maintained appropriately (including the use
   o f sheets) so as to minimize dust blow (e.g., balancing cut and fill operations);

   Drop heights for material transfer activities such as unloading o f friable materials will be
   minimized;
   The construction phase will beginwiththe constructiono faccess roads;
   Roads created duringconstructionwill be compacted and graveled ifnecessary;
   Roads used on site will be maintainedingood order;
   Access into the site will be regulated;
   Vehicle speedlimits o f less than 35 kmihr on non-metallic roads will be enforced on site; and
   Lorries and vehicles will be sheeted during transportation o f friable construction materials
   and spoil.
In addition, to ensure that pollutant levels resulting from transport operations are kept to a
minimum during construction activities, all vehicles being used on site will meet pollutant
emission standards.

Aquatic environment. NREA will not conduct any construction activities on the Nile and the
project site i s about 2.5 km away from the Nile. Therefore no impacts on the aquatic
environment during construction are expected. However the following measures will take place
duringconstruction:

   No effluents will be discharged into the water body unless effluent quality has beenchecked
   and meets the Egyptianenvironmental Law 4 requirements, requirements o f Law 48/1982 as
   well as World Bank requirements.
   A site drainage plan will be developed to ensure that if any erosion occurs during storm
   events, minimal amounts o f sediment will result by reducing the flow velocity and sediment
   loadbefore discharge;
   Temporary stockpiles o f soil should be protected from erosion by usinga reduced slope angle
   where practical [such as a slope o f 30" instead o f 45'1.    This can be addressed by the site
   drainage planas described above, and
   Good site management practices will be enforced to ensure that the construction site i s kept
   clean and tidy at all times.
Inaddition, to ensure that access to the Nile river bank is not restricted for public use (as decreed
by EgyptianLaw) and navigation activities are not jeopardized, the following measures will be
implemented:

   The bank across which the intake pipes are constructed will be returned to its original state
   following construction; and
   Warningsigns will markthe intake structures.




                                                 61

All construction teams employed and contracts commissioned will incorporate these mitigation
measuresas part o fthe operational procedures inEPC and O&M contracts to be entered.

Noise emissions. There i s likely to be significant noise during construction. The noise levels
have beenmodeled and are presentedindetail inthe EIA report. The noise level during the day
time is expected to reach a maximum o f <60 dB(A) during the day at the fence of the power
plant and <55 dB(A) at night, both within World Bank and Egyptian guidelines. There will also
be additional noise due to the construction related traffic, expected at 0.3 dB(A) above ambient
levels duringthe peak construction period, Le., the first few years. The specific noise mitigation
measures listed below are based on standard good site management practices for construction o f
power plants and include:

0   Enforcement o f vehicle speed limits, strict controls o f vehicle routing and prohibition o f
    heavy vehicle movements duringthe night;
    Diesel engine vehicles and compression equipmentwill be equippedwith effective silencers;
    Activities with highest noise emissions (e.g. piling) will be undertaken only during the day
    shift (7 am-6 pm)andbetweenSunday andThursday andnot duringofficial holidays; and

0   Personnel will use hearing protection when using and/or working in the vicinity o f noisy
    equipment.
Flora and Fauna. Negative impacts on flora and fauna are not expected to be significant due to
the characteristics ofthe site, which is desert land with poor vegetation. Good site management
practices and implementation o f the following mitigation measures will ensure that any
disturbance i s reduced to a minimum:

0   Personnel andvehicles will be restricted to within the boundaries o f the construction site, lay
    down areas and access roads, and will not be permittedto enter surrounding land.

Soils and Hydrology. The potential for direct impacts on soil and groundwater during
construction i s largely dependent on the management o f the construction site and construction
activities. A range o f mitigation measures will be implemented to protect soils and, as a result,
the groundwater resources, from the direct impacts o fthe construction. These measuresinclude:
    Engineeredsite drainage systems will beprovidedto collect, balance, treat as requiredand
    control the discharge o fthe site run-off;

0   Vehicles and personnel will be restricted from accessing areas not designed for construction
    to prevent accidental or unnecessary disturbances or compaction o fthe soil; and

0   Spoil from construction activities will be monitored and controlled; waste materials which
    are unsuitable for reuse on-site, for example for landscaping, will be disposed o f at an
    appropriately licensed sanitary landfill site.

Inaddition, the potential for any transfer of existing contamination will be minimized through
the following mitigationmeasures:
    Protection o f the soil from accidental pollution by bordering around proposed storage areas
    for fuel and chemicals withthe capability to store at least 110% o fthe expected volume;




                                                  62

    Provision o f oil and interceptors, such as oil/water separators for the removal o f pollutants
    loading from the site drainage and for the retention and containment o f any accidental
    discharges during construction and operation;

    Removal o f waste materials unsuitable for re-use on site during construction to appropriate
    licensed landfill sites;

    Management of excavations during construction so as to avoid the generation o f drainage
    pathways to underlyingaquifers; and

    Provision o f impermeable bases in operational areas to prevent absorption o f any spillage o f
    process materials.

Traffic and Transport.       Construction activities during peak times will generate additional
traffic on local roads and inparticular, significant volumes o f heavy plant traffic and occasional
abnormal loads. To minimize any inconvenience and delays, hazards and potential damage to
other road users, local population and the local road network, the following mitigation measures
will be implemented:
    Abnormal load movements will be confirmed with the General Authority for Roads, Bridges
    and LandTransport (GARBLT)which i s the Competent Administrative Authority (CAA) for
    highways and regional roads and Giza Governorate for internal local roads. and will adhere
    to prescribed routes. Their movement will be scheduled to avoid peak hours and notices will
    be published in advance to minimize disruption as required by GARBLT and Giza
    Governorate.

    Consideration will be given to staggering construction shifts to split arrival and departure
    times;
    Scheduling of traffic will be undertaken to avoid the peak hours on the local road network
    wherever practicable; and
    Constructionworkers will be transported to the site by buses o f contractors.

Socio-economic effects. The assessment of impacts suggests an overall positive impact on the
local population given that the use o f local labor will be prioritized during construction. No
mitigation measuresare proposed.

Archaeology. Careful examination o f existing literature and data did not reveal any sites o f
archaeological or cultural heritage o f importance on or around the site. Inthe unlikely event that
remains being found, construction activities will be stopped and the Supreme Council o f
Antiquities will be consulted on the most appropriate measures, which could include the
following:
    Where possible, remains will be protected in-situfrom construction activities, by relocating
    non-essential activities;
    Where identified remains cannot be protected, an excavation o f the indicated area will be
    undertaken prior to the commencement o f construction activities to record and remove
    vulnerable remains andfeatures;




                                                 63

   Any finds o f archeological, historic or cultural significance will be given to the appropriate
   CAA; and

0  Preparation o f a Chance Finds Procedure which lays out the steps to be taken if
   archeological, historical or cultural remains or finds are discovered during construction
   activities. The procedures will clearly set out how the construction team will be briefed so
   that they are aware o f what to look out for and the actions which must be taken should a
   potentialfindbe uncovered.

Flooding. Since the site lies on the western edge ofthe eastern desert, there is a potential for the
power plant site to be affected by occasional flash flooding. In order to reduce any potential
impacts o f flooding during construction, the following mitigation measures will be implemented:
   During the early stages o f construction, a site drainage system will be built, equipped to
   protect the site against potential flooding;
   Site drainage will be constructed in such a way as to dissipate flood waters away from the
   main plant areas and to discharge clean waters to a natural drainage basin or a ground well
   and any potentially contaminated waters to the surrounding land and any potentially
   contaminated waters to the discharge facility via the oil interceptor;
   Desert lands to the east o f the site will be re-enforced to ensure that erosion does not take
   place; and

   Culverts will be constructed on the accessroadto allow adequate transit o f flood waters.

Solid Waste. To ensure that impacts from the generation o f solid waste and its disposal are
successfully avoided, the following mitigation measureswill be implemented:

0  All wastes taken off site will be carried out by a licensed waste contractor and NREA will
   audit the disposal procedure;

0  All solid wastes will be segregatedinto different waste types, collected and stored on site in
   designated storage facilities and areas prior to release to off-site disposal facilities;

0  All relevant consignments of waste for disposal, will be recorded, indicating their type,
   destination and other relevant information, prior to beingtaken off site; and

0  Standards for storage area, management systems and disposal facilities will be agreed with
   the relevant parties.

An engineer with responsibility for environmental aspects will be responsible for solid waste
management at the site and will ensure that all wastes are managed to minimize any
environmental risks.

OccupationalHealthand Safety. NREA will ensure that constructionactivities are undertaken
ina manner which does not present hazards to workers' health and safety. Inparticular, NREA
will establish and integrate policies and procedures on occupational health and safety into the
construction and operationo fthe power plant. Emergency andaccident response procedures will
also be included in an EHS manual for the power plant which will be prepared during
construction.



                                                 64

The following measureswill be implementedduringthe construction and operational phases:

    Compliance with international standards for good practice;
    Adherence to local and international guidance and codes ofpractice on EHS management;
    Management, supervision, monitoring and record-keeping as set out inthe plant's operational
    manual;
    Implementation o f EHS procedures as a condition for all contracts;
    Clear definition o f the EHS roles and responsibilities o f the companies contracted to work on
    site and to all their individual staff (including the nomination o f EHS supervisors and
    coordinator);
    Pre-construction and operation assessment o f the EHS risks and hazards associated with
    construction and operation, including consideration o f local cultural attitudes, education level
    o fworkforce and local work practices;
    Provision o f appropriate training on EHS issues for all employees o f site, including initial
    induction and regular refresher training, taking into account local cultural issues;
    Provision ofhealthand safety information;
    Regular inspection, reviewand recording o f EHS performance; and
    Maintenance o f a highstandard o f housekeeping at all times.

Impact assessmentand mitipationmeasures durinpoDeration

Mitigation measuresintroduced into the designand construction phase o f the power plant will be
carried forward into the operational phase through the O&M contracts and by NFEA. Several
proposed mitigation measures are integrated into the design o f the power plant in order to
minimize any impacts on the environment.           These include measures such as low N O x
combustors, noise silencers and water discharge controls.          The following section identifies
additional measuresto further mitigate impacts duringoperation o fthe plant.

Air Quality.

Emissions guidelines. Several specific measures have beentaken to reduce stack emissions from
the power plant and to comply with Egyptian and World Bank standards. The power plant will
fire natural gas as its main and only fuel which is the least polluting fuel available (with
negligible sulfur dioxide emissions and low particulate matter emissions). In order to reduce
NO, emissions when firing natural gas or light fuel oil, low NO, combustors are usedon the gas
turbines (and water injection to fuel oil inemergency). Inaddition, a stack measuring 35 meters
has been designedto minimize dispersion o f emissions into the surrounding atmosphere. Stack




                                                 65

emissions to the air from the proposed plant are expected to be within the Egyptian, as well as
the World Bank guidelines".

Air quality guidelines. Inorder to establish the potential atmospheric emissions from the power
plant and its impact on ambient air quality, dispersion modeling has been undertaken and the
results o f the modeling indicates that the predicted off-site maximum annual and 24 hour mean
ground levels o f NO2 and PM concentrations do not exceed the Egyptian nor the World Bank
ambient air quality guidelines when natural gas i s burned. As described above, natural gas i s
plannedto be usedat all times.

Aquatic Environment. Cooling water and process water for the plant will be drawn from the
N i l e River via an intake structure that i s shared with the Combined Cycle currently under
tendering and bidding. Potable water will be suppliedto the plant via the same source. Cooling
water will be recycled in the cooling tower, therefore no discharge o f cooling water to the Nile
will take place. The process water will be disposed o f after treatment via a pipelineback to the
Nile. The treated effluent will be continuously monitored to ensure that it meets the legal
requirements for discharge on the Nile (Law 48/1982). Incase o f non-compliance, the effluent
will berecycledfor further treatment prior to final disposal.

The following mitigationmeasureswill be implemented:

      An industrial treatment facility will receive wastewater from combustion turbine area floor
      drain, ST tube oil centrifuge, tank farm area, ST area floor washing and transformer area
      drain and process them into an oil/water separator where wastewaters are channeled to the
      common effluent tank for treatment before discharge to the Nile;
      GTG wash water will be collected in an individual sump and discharged with a portable
      pumpto a tanker for off-site disposal via a licensed contractor;
      Waters contaminated by chemical wastes will be channeled from neutralization pit and
      combustion turbine compressor wash effluent to the common effluent tank for treatment
      before off-site disposal;
      Sanitary wastes will be collected via plant sewage and sewerage lines in a local sanitary
      treatment plant where the untreated waters will be re-used in the plant plantation irrigation
      program while the dirt will be collected for off-site disposal by sanitary road tankers o f a
      licensed contractor;
      Solar field will be provided with an emergency strategy for immediate response to any
      accidental spillages, operational leakages or droplets o f thermal oil to allow collection and
      control as required;
      Bunds or sumps will be installed on-site to isolate areas of potential oil or other spillages,
      such as transformer bays, from the site drainage system;
      Oil and chemical storage tanks will have secondary containment structures that will hold
      110%o fthe contents o fthe largest storage tank;

Plants,July 1998.


                                                   66

   Areas for unloading oil and hazardous chemical materials will be isolated by curbs and
   providedwith a sump; equipped with a manually operated valve;
   Transformers will be provided with pits to retain 110% o f the coolant capacity o f the
   transformers which will include fire fighting water.       Alternatively, each main oil-filled
   transformer foundation will drain through a corner sump directly to an underground oil
   collection chamber sized to retain 110% o f the coolant capacity o f the transformer plus
   deluge water (for the worst single catastrophic failure). Adjacent to this collection chamber
   will be constructed an oil separator which will normally function to separate any oil
   contaminated to the storm water collected from within the transformer foundations and the
    clean water drained to the discharge structure. The transformers will not contain PCBs; and
    Storm water runoff from equipment slabs that may be subject to oil contamination exposure
   will be collected and channeledthrough an oil/water separator prior to discharge.

Inaddition, the following goodsite management practices will be adheredto:

    Wastewater will be collected and treated before being discharged. The main water treatment
    steps include:
        -
        --  neutralizationo f any wastewater that has a pHoutside the range o f 6 to 9;
            oil separation o f any wastewater that may be contaminated with oil or grease; and
            filtration o f any wastewater that may contain highconcentrations o f suspendedsolids.

0  N o solid wastes will be discharged into the Nile;

0   Drainage systems will be designed on site to prevent any contaminated surface runoff from
    being discharged into the Nile without prior oil separation and neutralization of any other
    contamination; and
    All effluent discharges will comply with local Egyptianand World Bank standards.

Noise Emissions. A number o f noise mitigation measures have been built into the conceptual
design o f the plant in order to ensure that noise levels are minimized and that all items o f the
plant are operating to local and international standards.

Specific designmitigation measuresinclude:
    Gas and steam turbine generators, air compressors, pumps, andthe emergency diesel engines
    are enclosed insound enclosures;

0   Air compressors are equippedwithair silencers; and

0  Noisy outdoor equipmenthave beendesignedto a noise limit of 85 dB(A) at one meter.

Inaddition, allpersonnel working innoisy areas will berequiredto wear hearingprotection.

0   Flora andFauna. N o significant impacts are expected.

VisualImpact. Landscaping will include tropical shrubs (trees, grass, andpalm groves) around
the site. All plantswill be indigenous species.



                                                 67

Soils and Hydrology. During plant operation, the main potential for impacts to occur to soils
and hydrology (including run-off into the surrounding lands) will arise as a result o f spillages
and storage o f chemicals and fuels on site.    Good site management practices will minimize
potential impacts.

Solid Waste. The mitigation and management measures during construction also apply to the
operation phase.

Health and Safety.      In addition to the operational health and safety measures during
construction described above, the following mitigation measures will be implemented during
construction:
   Development and implementation o f an Operational Health and Safety Plan with appropriate
   training during construction;
   Provision o ftraining for use o fprotectionequipment and chemical handling;

    Clear marking o f work site hazards and training inrecognitiono fhazard symbols;
   Development o f site emergency response plans;
   All personnel working or standing close to noisy equipmentwill berequiredto wear noise
   protectors; and
   Drinkingwater will be suppliedto the plant via plant water supply systemwhich will be
    complying with drinkingwater standards publishedby the World Health Organization.

                                Annex 15: Incremental Cost Analysis

Baseline
An analysis of Egypt's system expansion plan, fuel supply and availability, and potential
candidate plants suggests that the least-cost baseline course o f action will be the commissioning
o f further gas-fired combined cycle capacity. The baseline plant i s therefore assumed to be a
combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) fueled with natural gas capable o f producing the same net
energy output o f 852 GWhper year as the proposed GEF alternative.

GEFAlternative
The plant will be o f about 150 MWe capacity combining a conventional fossil fuel portion o f
about 130 MWe and an input from solar sources o f about 20 MWe. When own consumption o f
6.3 MWe i s deducted, the net overall plant capacity becomes 143 MWe. The total net energy
produced by the plant is expected to be 852 GWhper year, which includes the solar contribution
o f 33.4 GWh per year. This corresponds to a solar share of 4 percent o f the total annual energy
produced by the plant operating at a full load. The technology for the solar field i s parabolic
trough.

Inthe Egyptiancontext, Kureimat is a least cost site with excellent levels of solar insolation of
2,431 kWh/m2/year at a latitude o f 30, direct access to natural gas, water supplies and direct
access to the national electricity grid. The project i s basedon a feasibility study and a conceptual
designreport financed by the GEF, which assess the technical and economic feasibility o f solar
thermal technology inEgypt and specify the design o f the ISCC power plant at Kureimat. The
ISCC power station will have the characteristics shown inTable 1below.

             excluded.

The technical, economic and financial data are basedon bids awarded. Powerplant capacity and
the relative proportion of the fossil and solar components are indicative and basedon the results
o f the feasibility and draft conceptual designreport study. Plant configuration will be optimized
during the bidding process and will only become definite when the winning bidder is selected

and the contractual framework (the security package) negotiated. This open approach will help
ensure that optimum technology at least cost i s employed.

Scope of the Analysis
SystemBoundary
The analysis is basedon the direct comparison o fthe proposed solar thermal plant with the least-
cost conventional solution o f the same annual output. It i s recognized that the introduction o f
solar-thermal capacity to the national grid might require further adjustments in the system
expansion plan, not least because the proposed plant i s relatively small compared to the
conventional power stations that might be built in the baseline. These system-wide effects are
ignored in the current analysis. While they could be captured in a broader study o f the entire
system expansion plan, a simple plant-by-plant comparison was preferred, for the following
reasons:  .. The Egyptian power system i s growing relatively fast. Relative to this expansion and
             the overall size of the system, the proposed addition i s relatively minor and can be
             absorbedwithout major repercussions;
             There is a trade off betweenspatial and temporal system boundary: A plant-by-plant
             comparison ignores systemic effects, but allows the analysis o f the entire plant
             lifetime. A system expansion analysis, on the other hand, has a wide spatial system
             boundary, but usually covers no more than 10-15 years o f plant life. In the current
             context - where systemic effects are assumed to be small, and the time horizon o f the
             expansion plan i s relatively short - covering the entire plant life was considered more
             important.

An earlier sensitivity runof the system expansion plan performedby EEHC with and without a
solar thermal / fossil fuel hybrid plant resulted in incremental costs in the same range as
calculated inthe plant-by-plant comparison.

Additional Domestic BeneJits
The GEF alternative will result in some improvements in domestic air quality, but these
additional domestic benefits are marginal. Egypt has a separate program targeted at local air
pollution, especially inthe urbanareas where it i s worst.

T h i s project will position Egypt as a world leader in the commercialization o f solar thermal
technology and as a potential source o f goods and services for future solar thermal power
projects both domestically and abroad, particularly inthe highinsolation region inwhich it finds
itself.

Input Costs
Capital Costs
In aggregate, the 150 MW ISCC installed cost of US$290 million is approximately
US$1,933/kW. Looking separately, the solar thermal power generation without combined cycle
costs about US$4,937/kW (US$98.74 million for solar island divided by 20 MW (excluding
import taxes), substantially higher than the baseline CCGT, which costs about US$1,469/kW



                                                   90

(excluding taxes). The size o f the solar field i s 130,800 m2and i s estimated to cost US$ 754/m2
($98.74 million dividedby 130,800 m2).

In the GEF PDF Block C application, costs were estimated for the solar field of $1,897/kWY
average plant costs for a hybridat $894/kW and a likely cost o f solar electricity o f 9.5 US$/kWh.
For a volumetric central receiver, costs were estimated at $902/kW with the solar field at
$2,137/kW and solar electricity at 10.2 US$/kWh..

Recurrent Costs
The main recurrent cost elements concern operations and maintenance (O&M) and fuel
purchases. Good O&M data for solar thermal power are available from the 354 MWe o f plant
that has been operating in California since the 1980s. Over the years, operators have succeeded
in substantially reducing O&M costs by increasing the efficiency and lifetime of components,
improving the effectiveness o f the solar field, power block interface and other measures. As a
result, the typical O&M costs for a solar field have come down to about 1.3 US$/kWh,compared
with about 0.3 US$/kWh for a typical CCGT. The higher O&M costs o f the solar field are
partially offset by savings infuel costs. The economic cost of natural gas inEgypt i s estimated
to be US$ 2.52 per million BTU, which translates into levelized electricity costs o f 6.77
US$/kWhfor the integrated plant at a 10% discount rate.

IncrementalCosts
Using the data presented above, the results indicate that for a total capacity o f 150 MWe,
introducing a 4% solar contribution will increase the installed cost o f the plant from about
US$191 million for a conventional CCGT to about US$290 million for the integrated solar
combined cycle plant. There will also be incremental O&M cost, the present value o fthese costs
i s about US$19.7 million over the construction and the 25-year project life.      The costs are
partially offset by the reduced fuel consumption; the present value o f which i s US$4.3 million.
Therefore, the estimated net incremental cost (both capital and operating costs) for 20 MWe o f
solar capacity varies between US$SS.3 million to US$108.6 million, using discount rates
between 6%-14%.        The GEF financing is capped at US$49.8 million for the project and any
remaining incremental cost will be financed by NREA. US$97.2 million incremental cost has
been used in the cost estimates and financing plan o f this project. Table 3 below presents the
results inmore detail.

1.     Introduction
This project will assist the GOE, through its relevant agencies the Egyptian Electricity Holding
Company (EEHC) and New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA), to procure and benefit
from a hybrid solar thermal power plant through an Engineer Procure and Construct (EPC)
contract with a 2-year operation and maintenance (O&M) contract.            A similar project was
proposed in early 2002 using an independent power producer approach. However, the GOE
changed its policy on foreign currency exposure related to private sector investmentprojects, and
this causedprivate interest ininfrastructure projects (ingeneral) to evaporate. Therefore, based
on a request from the Government, the project's concept was changed to a publicly financed
approach.
Selection o f the EPC/O&M contractor will be through an international bidding process, and
details o f the selected plant design are expected to vary slightly, but based on the conceptual
design study by Fichtner Solar, the project i s expected to comprise an Integrated Solar Combined
Cycle (ISCC) plant configuration with a total capacity o f about 150MW and a solar thermal
component o f about 20MW. On an annual basis, the solar field will contribute about 4% o f the
total energy produced by the plant. The EPC/O&M contractors will be able to optimize their
design through choice o f proven solar trough technologies, turbine generator equipment, and
degree o f local content, as long as the proposed design meets the performance specifications
from the GOE.
2.     GEFContext
The proposed project addresses GEF Operational Program 7 (OP7): reducing the long-term cost
o f low greenhouse gas-emitting technologies. OP7 aims to accelerate market penetration o f
several large-scale backstop technologies that are constrained by high capital costs and high
commercial risks. The strategy i s to identify projects that address national priorities and then
finance the incremental costs o f investments, capacity building and other activities that reduce
marketbarriersandperceived risks by investors.
Based on the technical success o f the 354 MW o f solar thermal power plants still operating in
California after more than 15 years, this technology can be considered an important large-scale
non-carbon emitting backstop technology.        Many o f these plants currently operate at solar
outputs that exceed their initial design specifications.       However, current costs for this
technology are high, and significant cost reductions for this technology can only begin to occur
with the implementationo f newprojects. The proposed project is one of four similar projects
demonstration (the others being in India, Mexico and Morocco) which have been sponsored by
GEF as part its program to accelerate cost reductionand commercialadoption of large-scale non-
carbon emittinggeneration technologies.

3.       Key Issues
3.1      ProjectApproach
The switch from a private sector to a public sector financing approach has specific advantages
and disadvantages. The key disadvantage i s that it may not be sustainability over the long-term
because o f changing government policy and the public sector's limited access to capital.
However, inthe near-term,the proposed EPC/O&M contract approach for this project preserves
manyo fthe important features o fthe private sector approach. Namely, the choice o ftechnology
and its associated risks will be borne by the contractor during construction and the initial five
year operating period, and that entity will be inthe best positionto manage those risks. Second,
the contract will contain appropriate incentives for maximizing the utilization of the solar field
over the long term.    Third, the contractor and key suppliers will be positioned to capture o f
technology and organizational learning effects that are essential to achieving long-term cost
reductions.
The fact that the main activities o f NREA are evolving from research and development to
production and sales o f electricity from renewable sources i s a potentially powerful, but risky
development. It provides a strong governmental drive to realize the social and environmental
benefits o f renewables (as long as the policy remains strong), but it also means that significantly
more capacity buildingwill be requiredinsupport o fthis project.
Specifically, it i s stated that this project will benefit from a study that i s about to be
commissioned under a GEF preparatory grant to review institutional options for NREA in
support o f wind projects. The aim i s for the study to identify an actionplanthat can be included
inthe implementationofthe solar-thermal project. What is the timingofthis studyinrelationto
the project? Will the results be available intime to impact this project?
Regarding consulting services for project management during the EPC/O&M contract period, the
Project Brief reads as if the contractor will be responsible for project management rather than
beingtasked to support the Project ImplementationEntity (PIE) withinNREA intheir role as the
project manager and implementingagency. For effective capacity building, the PIE should lead
the project management team, and while the contractor may perform all the project management
activities, PIE members will need to be involved both for training purposes and to be able to
recommend documents for approval to NREA and EEHC management.
This would seem appropriate giventhat the Project Document states (on Page 10) that NREAhas
gained significant experience in designing and implementing wind energy projects with
international loan and grant financing. However, ISCC plants are significantly more complex
thanwind farms, andhavingthe project management and support contractor onboardbefore the
start o f implementationi s critical.
Another important project feature i s the decision to include an incentive/penalty structure inthe
O&M contract that will act to maximize the solar output, and to ensure the continuation o f the
incentive structure in the PPA contract between NREA and EEHC. This will help achieve the
GEF program goal by promoting an effectively operated demonstration and ensuring sufficient
learning experience within the solar thermal industry.
A single contract encompassing the ISCC plant is the proper basis for procurement. Use o f the
World Bank Procurement Guidelines and the Bank's standard two-stage bidding procedures
should ensure that a reputable contractor is selected inan open and transparent manner.


                                                 95

This reviewer agrees that a public financing o f the first solar thermal project can be done at
lower cost and with a greater degree of certainty, since the private sector would demand a
premium for assuming both the technical and financial risks of the project.            Inthe proposed
public sector approach, the contractor continues to assume the technical risks, but NREA and the
GOEare assuming the financial project risks.
The institutional and implementation arrangement for the project is clear from the level of the
NREA and below. However, above the NREA, it only states that the project will be overseen by
MEE. This reviewer believes that a Project Steering Committee (PSC) is needed to ensure that
the broader project objectives are met, especially those dealing with capacity building,
replication, information dissemination and public awareness. The PSC should have members
from other interested government ministries in addition to MEE, the GEF and the IFIs providing
loans to the project. Inaddition, an interested NGO shouldbe invited onto the PSC.
3.2     Scientific and Technical Soundness
Solar thermal power plants that raise steam to generate power have been successfully operating
for over 15 years. The basic concept o f the ISCC (integrating a solar thermal steam generating
field with a natural gas combined cycle power plant) i s sound and has been extensively studied.
While such a project has yet to be implemented, a project following this concept should be
completely feasible, as the technical basis for such an integrated system is quite straightforward.
Details of the technical and economic effectiveness of the power plant will depend o n the design
and equipment choices of the selected bidder. Therefore, this review is based on the conceptual
design identified inthe Project Brief, and it seeks to identify the most important technical issues
that will to be addressed duringthe implementation of the project.
The size of the solar thermal field at about 20 MW is sufficiently large to provide relevant
operating experience and contribute to the re-establishment o f manufacturing capacity for critical
solar field components that will help lead to lower costs inthe future.
The project document states that "two types of solar parabolic trough designs are available:
Euro-trough and LS-3." Infact, other potential designs do exist. Does the project intendto limit
bidders to these two types o f trough designs because they are more technically proven? Some
experts believe that the LS-2 collector is a more reliable design than the LS-3 collector. Will that
design be allowed?
The project document correctly states the need for proven technology, and the intention to pre-
qualify all bidders. It is therefore recommended that a list o f acceptable solar trough designs be
developed and reviewed with potential bidders during the pre-qualification process.              In the
prequalification discussions, the project should be open to other solar trough designs, provided
that the potential bidder is able to demonstrate an acceptable level o f development.
Page 9 states that "TOenable both existing types to compete for the project, the physical size of
the solar field will be scaled to fit the requirements o f both designs corresponding to a size of
1,000 x 1,125 meters." This i s unclear. Ibelieve that what is meant is that the physical area for
the solar field will be fixed at 1,000 x 1,125 meters, and the bidders will be allowed to optimize
the output of their solar field within this space limitation. Ifthis is the correct interpretation, then
the text shouldbe clarified.




                                                   96

This reviewer supports the decision to exclude thermal storage from the project design, as this
technology has not been adequately developed for solar trough systems and because storage adds
little value to a hybridplant.
The Project Brief states that NREA is working together with Fichtner Solar to develop the
performance specifications o f the proposed plant. Inaddition to minimum qualifications for the
solar trough technology, these performance specifications must ensure effective integration o f
the steam systems for the solar field and the gas-fired combined cycle plant. The contractor
selection process should also reviewplant designs to ensure that the plantwill operate effectively
in all modes. Inparticular, integration and control of the system should be flexible enough to
allow the solar contribution to be consistently maximized, while under other circumstances allow
power to be efficiently generated on natural gas only (e.g. during nighttime or ifthe solar field i s
not operational).
3.3     Adequacy of the FinancingMechanism
Page 13 states that a preliminary analysis o f the impact o f the project on NREA's financial
position has been conducted and will be finalized during appraisal. What was the result o f this
preliminary analysis? Given the cost and performance o f the conceptual design, and assuming
the current financial prices for gas and electricity, does the project have a positive cash flow?
The incremental costs analysis inthe Project Brief i s based on the economic prices for gas and
electricity, and it does not provide any insight into whether this project approach i s at all
sustainable. A preliminary financial analysis would indicate whether and by how much the GOE
may needto subsidize the NREA for operation o fthis plant.
Page 15 states: "Ensuring that the necessary controls are in place to monitor performance and
ensuring prompt payment o f the grant to the operators will be important considerations for the
project's implementation plan." This implies that the GEF grant will be partitioned into an
investment portion and an operating portion. This project feature i s specified nowhere in the
Project Briefthat this reviewercould find. It should be properly introducedand clarified.
Ifaportionofthe GEF grant isusedto support the O&M contract duringthe first 5-year period,
how will NREA be able to assume responsibilityfor O&M inthe second 5-year period?
3.4     Identificationof GlobalEnvironmentalBenefits
The project's principal global environment objective is to contribute to improving the economic
attractiveness o f solar thermal technology globally. The project will create global learning
effects that will lead to a reduction in costs for the technology over the long term.    Globally,
solar thermal power plants have the potential to provide a significant proportion of new
electricity generating capacity inthe next century on a non-carbon emitting basis if this project,
and the others within the program, are successful inreducing the technology's costs and risksto
a competitive level. Major markets exist for this technology inother highsunlight regions o fthe
world.
3.5     Fitwith GEF Goals
The project has a good fit with the GEF Operational Program #7. The plant itself will have
lower C02 emissions than a fossil-based plant o f the same annual output. More importantly, it
will help revitalize the solar thermal industry, and it will facilitate the technological and
organizational learning that are critical to achieving long-term cost reductions.

3.6     RegionalContext
The project is a good fit to Egypt's growing electricity demand, its growing commitment to
renewable energy power project development, its excellent solar resource and its current
availability o fnatural gas.
3.7     Replicability
This project, and its companions in Mexico, India and Morocco, i s not likely to result in
immediate cost-competitiveness for solar thermal power plants. The study Cost Reduction Study
for Solar Thermal Power Plants, Enermodal Engineering, May 1999 commissioned in
collaboration with the GEF Secretariat to determine the viability o f long term cost reductions for
solar thermal technology concluded that a phased approach should be adopted. These four
projects represent the first o f three phases, and they will provide an initial opportunity for cost
reduction. Inthe assessment o f this reviewer, the targets for cost reduction o f solar electricity in
the range of 10-11 US$/kWhand a capital cost o f solar fields of about $2,0OO/kW by 2010 are
quite achievable.       Meeting these targets would create very important opportunities for
replication of this project, not only in Egypt, but also throughout the Mediterranean Region,
South Asia, and other parts o f the world with similar climates.        The need for future GEF
buydown will most strongly depend on the cost o f conventional power and the valuation (ifany)
o f environmental externalities.
3.8     Sustainability
The public sector financing approach being proposed for this project will establish the
contractual arrangements necessary for the first 10 years o f plant operation. Beyond that period,
a new PPA will be required, but giventhat the investment costs will have beenwritten down, the
marginal operating costs for the plant should be attractive. For potential follow-on projects, the
project i s not designed to address the government policies that distort the market prices for gas
and electricity.
From the GEF perspective, the main sustainability issue will be to ensure that the plant i s
operated ina manner that maximizes the output from its solar field throughout the lifetime o f the
plantso as to maximize the technology learningand cost reductionbenefits.
4.      SecondaryIssues
4.1     Linkages to Other FocalAreas
N o comment.
4.2     Linkages to Other Programs
As already mentioned, this project has linkages to other similar projects in Mexico, India and
Morocco, and it forms part o fthe GEF program on Greenhouse Gas Reduction.
4.3     Degree of Involvement of Stakeholders
According to the Project Brief, there i s a high degree o f involvement o f the key government
stakeholders, especially EEHC andNREA. Early engagement with potential developers i s stated
to be underway to ensure a willingness to submit bids. Given that the new financing approach
will remove significant financial risks from the bidders, it can be expected that interest among
potential developers will be high.
