INTERNATIONAL BAIK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RBJOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENr
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE NATIONAL ELECTRICITY BOARD
OF THE STATES OF MALAYA FOR A FIFTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I sLbmit the followingt report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$20. million to
the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB) for a fifth
power project to be guaranteed by Malaysia.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has made four loans to the NEB totalling US$136.0
million, of which US$13.3 million has been cancelled. In September 1958
the Bank made its first loan (210-MA), amounting to the equivalent of
US$28.6 million, to the Central Electricity Board (now renamed National
Electricity Board of the States of Malaya) to finance the foreign
exchange cost of the first stage of the Cameron Highlands hydroelectric
scheme. A second loan (350-MA), equivalent to US$511. million, was
made in July 1963 for the second stage of that scheme, the first stage
of the Prai Thermal Station, and the expansion of transmission facilities.
In July 1966 a third loan (458-MA) equivalent to US$31.5 million was made
for the first stage of the Port Dickson Thermal Station, the second stage
of the Johore Bahru Thermal Station, and a further extension of the Cameron
Highlands scheme. A fourth loan (579-MA) equivalent to Us41165 million was
made in January 1969 for the second stage of the Port Dickson and Prai Thermal
Stations and for expansion of transmission facilities. Projects covered by
the first two loans have been completed and are operating satisfactorily.
Of the project financed under the third loan, the first stage of the Port
Dickson Station and the units at the Cameron Highlands scheme have been
completed and are in operation; the second stage of Johore Bahru is
expected to be in service by early 1971. Construction of the project
financed under the fourth loan is on schedule and the second stage of
the Prai Station is expected to be operating early in 1971 and that of
Port Dickson by mid-1972.
3.        In January 1970, Malaysia applied to the Bank for a loan for
the third stag^e of the Port Dickson Thermal Station and transmission lines
and associated substations to deliver the power to the load centers. The
project was appraised in February 1973. Negotiations took place between
June 4 and 8, 1970. The NEB was represented by Dato Osman bin Talib
(Chairman), Raja Zainal (Deputy Chairman), Chan Khee Pok (Acting General
Manager) and L.H. Tan (Financial Controller). The Government of Malaysia
was represented by Messrs. Sulaiman bin Abdullah (Deputy Undersecretary,
Economic Planning Unit), and Zakaria Yatim (Attorney General's Office).

4.       The proposed loan is the Bank's fourteenth in Malaysia. The
Bank also made a loan of US&6.8 million in February 1965 to the Public
Utilities Board of Singapore with the guarantee of Malaysia, of which
Singapore was then a part. Malaysia remains the Guarantor of this loan
until action has been completed for Singamore to assume this obligation.
The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to Malaysia, excluding
the loan to Singapore, as of May 31, 1970:
Loan                                                                   Amount

5.        The execution of projects financed under Bank loans has been
satisfactory and the rate of disbursement of these loans has been roughly
in line with expectations except for Loan 560-ME, because of changes in
equipment specifications, and for Loan 434-MA, because of delays in
completing the internal reticulation system and the water control scheme.
Orders for almost half the amount of Loan 560-MA have now been placed and



- 3 -
the Government has been urged to expedite procurement and withdrawvals.
Loan 434-MA is expected to be fully disbursed by the new Closing Date
of December 31, 1971. Loans for electric power, telecommunications,
ports, railwqays and highways, education, agricultural credit and land
settlement are expected to be presented to the Executive Directors for
their consideration during the Fiscal Years 1971 and 1972.
6.        In 1963 IFC invested US$818,000 in Malaysian Industrial Devel-
opment Finance Berhad (MIDF) in conjunction with Loan 348-MA and in
addition has taken part in three financing operations with MIDF: in
March 1966 IFC made a loan of US$1,275,000 to, and an equity investment
of US$284,000 in, Tasek Cement, Ltd.; in May 1967 it made a loan of
US$2,451,000 to, and an equity investment of US$1,016,000 in, Malayawata
Steel Ltd. and in December 1969 it made a loan of US$1,250,000 to, and
an equity investment of US$250,000 in, India-Malaysia Textiles Berhad.

PiRT III - THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report on the proposed project is attached entitled
"Malaysia - Appraisal of the National Electricity Board of the States of
Malaya Fifth Power Project" (PU-43a) dated June 19, 1970.



9.        Electric power in West Malaysia is provided principally by
the NEB wAhich serves the whole peninsula of Malaya except (i) Penang
Island which is supplied by a municipally-ow,ned plant, and (ii) part
of the State of Perak which is supplied by the Perak River Hydroelectric
Plant Company (PRHE). The installed capacity of NEB is 664W, made up
of 265MW of hydroelectric plant, 36014WI of steam plant, and 39MW of diesel
plant. NEB is constructing an additional 180MW of steam plant under Loans
458-HA and 579-MA scheduled for service between 1970 and 1972. Nearly all
of NEB's generating capacity supplies the Interconnected System which
covers most of the western side of the peninsula and the Southern System
around Johore Bahru. The Interconnected System is also connected to the
PRHE and the Penang City Council systems.  NEB has a long-term contract
to sell an increasing bulk power load to PRHE; total sales would be llOMW
by 1972 and would increase by 10MW per year thereafter.
10.       The project consists of the third stage at Tuanku Ja'afar
(Port Dickson) Thermal Station and transmission lines and associated
substations to deliver the power to the load centers. The third stage
at Port Dickson comprises three new units (Units 5 to 7) each of 120MW
and will bring the station to its final total capacity of 600MR4.
11.       The civil works for all three units ,fould be carried out
together and two of the three 1201vW units (Units 5 and 6) would be in
operation in 1974 to meet the conservatively estimated increase in power
demand by that time. The third unit would be installed within two years
thereafter to meet growth in power demand as it develops. INEB intends
to order all three units at once, retaining the option to cancel the
third unit should future demand projections show that it will not be
needed as soon as presently planned. A new order would then be placed
for a third unit to be installed in time to meet the revised load forecast.
12.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US*58.9 million
equivalent, of which US$46.7 million would be the foreign exchange compo-
nent. The present financing plan for the project includes: (i) bilateral
or suppliers' credits (estimated at US$26.7 million) for the boilers and
turbo-alternators for the thermal station, (ii) the proposed Bank loan
(US.4;20.0 million) for the foreign exchange cost of civil works, auxiliary
equipment for the thermal station, materials and equipment for transmission
lines and substation extensions, and consulting services, and (iii) INEB's
cash generation for local currency expenditures (US$12.2 million). Under
Loan 579-MA (Fourth Power) NEB obtained bilateral credits for major equip-
ment requirements without difficulty; and if such credits should prove not
to be available on reasonable terms, the Government would undertake in the
Guarantee Agreement to fill any financial gap. As a further precaution,
it is provided in paragraph 2(d) of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement that
no disbursements of the Bank loan may be made for the items required for
the Port Dickson Station until financing has been arranged for the boilers
and turbo-alternators.



13.       The items financed under the Bank loan would be procured after
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines
for procurement. As far as the boilers and turbo-alternators are concerned,
NEB would follow its usual practice of awarding all contracts for equipment
and civil works after inviting international tenders. No tenders for the
project have yet been invited.
14.       The NEB wias established in 1949 by the Government under the
provisions of the Electricity Ordinance enacted that year. It is a well-
organized and well-operated utility and has a great degree of autonomy.
The Board of Directors of the NEB at present consists of a Chairman, a
Deputy Chairman and nine other members, all of whom are appointed by
the Minister of Commerce and Industry. By the end of 1967 all key
positions in the NEB were held by Malaysians.
15.       The financial record of NEB is good and its present position
is sound. During the construction period of the project (1970-1976) a
substantial part of the Temengor hydroelectric project, expected to be
in operation in 1978, will probably also be constructed. NEB's financina
plan therefore covers the nine-year period ending August 31, 1978 in
which all payments for both projects would be made. During this period
net internal cash generation is expected to finance 55% of NEB's capital
requirements. In addition, the use of other resources, including Govern-
ment contributions towards rural electrification, drawdown of accumulated
cash reserves and sales of fixed assets, would increase the proportion of
construction costs which would be financed from non-borrowed funds to 60%.
Debt service payments would be covered satisfactorily from 1.9 to 2.2 times
by internal cash generation. The debt/equity ratio would remain at about
55/45 for about four years and would then improve gradually to 44/56.
16.       During the nine years to August 31, 1978 NEB expects to earn
an average rate of return above the required 8% per annum on its average
net fixed assets in operation. However, because of sizeable additions
to pLant in some years and the irregular pattern of annual tax payments,
the rate of return is expected to vary during this period between 7.5%
and 10.4%. The growth of sales is based on a conservative estimate which
is in fact expected to be exceeded, and it is therefore considered unneces-
sary to change the tariffs during the years that temporary shortfalls in
the rate of return might occur.
17.       The proposed project is the least-cost next step of power
system development and forms part of INEB's long-range planning to meet
future power demand. The disturbances in May 1969 slowed the growth of
power demand in Wlest Malaysia from an average annual rate of 16% between
1963 and 1968 to 9.6% between 1968 and 1969. However, in view of the
Government's efforts to stimulate the economy, power demand is expected
to resume growth at an accelerated pace. The project would have a unit
cost of US$145 per KW of generating plant installed, which is about
average for similar installations in the region. The incremental finan-
cial rate of return on the investment would be about 12%.



PART IV - LEGAL INSTR1JMETS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the NEB, the
draft Guarantee Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements contain pro-
visions usual for this type of project and follow the general
pattern adopted for previous loans to the NEB.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
19.       A report (EAP-lla) in which the current economic position
and prospects of Malaysia are reviewed was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 25, 1970 (R70-44). A basic data sheet is annexed.
20.       Malaysia's overall growth performance throughout the 1960's
was satisfactory. GDP in real terms grew by a yearly average of about
61-2 percent, mainly because of strong investment and production trends
in rubber and oil palm, tin mining and timber, as well as development
of import substitution industries. However, in the seventies Malaysia
faces two difficult economic and social problems which have emerged in
recent years despite the growth in output and income, namely increasing
unemployment and rural/urban income disparity. They were important
underlying causes of the disturbances in Kuala Lumpur in May 1969.
21.       In the long run, accelerated economic growth appears to be
a prerequisite for a solution to these problems, This in turn calls
for more aggressive Government development policies than in the past.
It will not be easy to develop and execute such policies since the
financial and managerial capacity of the public sector is already being
strained by extended Govelrment activities. The Second Malaysia Plan
(1971-1975), now under preparation and to be reviewed by the Bank, will
have to prcpose increases in both public and private investments, which
have recently stagnated. Malaysia is unlikely to be able to finance the
increased investments from internal resources and will therefore probably
need a larger inflow of public capital in the next five years than in the
past five. The debt-service ratio remains low at 2 percent as of end
1969, and is expected to remain below 5 percent for several years to come.
Malaysia is creditworthy for substantial external borrowings on conven-
tional terms.
PART VII - COMPLIANCE TITH ARTICLES OF AGFIEEMET
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.



PART VIII - RECOvIIENDATION
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
