APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND POWER PROJECT (STEG)
TUNISIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
a        i.        This report appraises a Power Project for the Societe Tunisienne de
l'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG), a Government-owned company responsible for the
production, transmission and distribution of electricity and gas for public
consumption throughout Tunisia.
ii.       The Project comprises 150 MW of gas turbine capacity in seven units
of equal size, which would be installed in Sfax (2), Menzel Bourguiba (2),
Tunis South (1), Korba (1) and Mietlaoui (1), to meet Tunisia's growing power
demand. The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$29.3 million,
including a foreign exchange component of US$25.1 million equivalent. The
Project forms a small part (about 6%) of STEG's 1977-1981 development program
amounting to US$483 million (US$435 million for electricity, US$6 million for
gas and US$42 million for buildings and general equipment).
iii.      The Bank has made two previous loans to STEG, totaling US$19.5
million. The first loan (724-TUN) of US$7.5 million was made in 1971 in con-
junction with a US$2.5 million equivalent loan from the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development, to finance a gas pipeline. The second loan (815-TUN)
of US$12 million was made in 1972 to finance a power project consisting of
two 20 MW gas turbines, transmission and distribution system expansion, and
consulting services for future plant and institutional development. The
first project was successfully completed in 1972 and the second one is nearing
completion. Bank lending for the proposed Project would be an opportunity
for the Bank to continue its institution-building effort which started under
the two previous loans and have led to improvements of STEG's organization
and operations.
iv.       STEG owns about 88% (367 MW in 1975) of Tunisia's total installed
capacity. Its generation, which accounts for about 90% of the total elec-
tricity production in the country, rose from 445 GWh in 1966 to about 1,200
GWh in 1975 (11.7% p.a.). Production is projected to increase to about 2,510
GWh in 1981 and the net installed capacity to about 670 MW.
v.        Under Loan 815-TUN, STEG agreed to maintain electricity tariffs at
such a level that the ratio of operating surplus to average value of gross
fixed assets in operation less average customer contributions would not fall
below 8.5% in any fiscal year beginning with 1973. STEG has met this covenant,
achieving a rate of return on the agreed basis of 8.5% in 1973, 9.3% in 1974
and 10% in 1975, when electricity supply rates were raised an average 16%
with effect from April; internal cash generation including customers con-
tribution was above 50% of construction requirements during these years.
This somewhat unusual rate of return covenant was so framed partly because



- ii -
of the uncertainty about STEG's fixed assets at the time Loan 815-TUN was
made. Since in the meantime STEG's assets have been identified and values
determined, Government and STEG have agreed to adopt a more conventional
rate of return covenant under which the return is computed after depreciation.
On this basis STEG's rate of return would be about 8% in 1977, and a marginal
adjustment in tariffs would be necessary in 1978 to maintain it at this
level. The agreement under Loan 815-TUN regarding debt limitation requires
that STEG would not incur any debt without the approval of the Bank, except
for financing the Project, if it would raise its total debt to more than
45% of the sum of its equity, including accumulated contributions made by
customers, and its total debt. Agreement has been reached on repeating it
also in the proposed loan.
vi.       The recently discovered reserves of natural gas in the Gulf of
Gabes estimated at 70-160 billion m3 which are being evaluated by STEG with
the aid of foreign consultants, would permit the introduction after 1980 of
this new source in Tunisia's energy balance and the substitution of gas for
oil for power generation thus increasing the volume of oil available for
exports, increased domestic use of gas and the development of new industries
based on the utilization of natural gas. Since it appears very likely that
STEG would be in charge of the construction and operation of the onshore
facilities for the transmission and distribution of offshore gas throughout
the country, STEG would undertake a study to establish its organizational
structure, its training needs and the required investments for the gas program.
STEG would also conduct a study of the level and application of connection
charges for electricity supply in order to determine whether its present
policy in this respect stipulating a rather high level of customer contribu-
tions has an inhibiting effect on extension of service. STEG has agreed to
submit by June 1978 the recommendations of these two studies to the Govern-
ment and the Bank. Since the Government's current oil pricing policy under
which the present internal prices represent only about 23% of international
prices, has a vital bearing on the relative consumption of primary and sec-
ondary sources of energy and thus on development of the sector itself, the
Government would undertake a study with a view to determining an appropriate
pricing policy for oil, gas and electricity. Government has agreed to submit
to the Bank not later than September 30, 1978 the recommendations of such a
pricing study, which would take into consideration STEG's policy on connec-
tion charges, and to exchange views with the Bank on these recommendations.
vii.      In order to meet the implementation schedule for the Project the
contract for the supply, installation and commissioning of the seven gas
turbine units included in the Project was awarded by STEG shortly after the
appraisal of the Project on the basis of international competitive bidding,
consistent with Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement. The advance contract-
ing was justified by the time constraint. The proposed Bank loan of US$14.5
million would finance 58% the foreign exchange cost of the Project; the
remaining foreign exchange costs would be financed by STEG (US$1.4 million)



- iii -
and by a consortium of private banks with the guarantee of the Compagnie
Francaise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Exterieur (about US$9.2 million) that
has already been agreed to in principle. No retroactive financing is proposed
since payments previous to loan approval are expected to be covered by the
private bank loan or by STEG. It is expected that disbursements from the
proposed loan would commence in FY 1977 after drawdown of the private bank
loan and would be for 100 percent of each payment. Government has agreed to
provide the funds to carry out the Project in the event of the company's
inability to arrange these funds.
viii.     The Project forms part of STEG's least cost development program of
meeting the projected growth of demand. The economic rate of return on the
Project is at least 13.2% if flare gas is used for the two gas turbines to be
installed at Sfax, and gas oil for the other five gas turbines included in
the Project. If offshore gas is used for the latter after 1980, the rate of
return would be about 24%.
ix.       In review of the agreements reached as set forth in Section 8, the
Project is suitable for a Bank loan to STEG of US$14.5 million equivalent, for
a term of 14 years including a 2.5-year grace period. Completion of steps for
effectiveness of the private bank loan of US$9.2 million would be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.






APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND POWER PROJECT (STEG)
TUNISIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Tunisia has requested a Bank loan to finance the
foreign exchange component of a power project consisting of about 150 MW of
gas turbine plant. A loan of US$14.5 million is proposed to finance part
(58%) of the foreign exchange cost.
1.02      The Project would form part of STEG's (Societe Tunisienne de
l'Electricite et du Gaz) development program for the period 1977-1981 (fifth
plan).
1.03      There have been two previous loans to STEG, totaling US$19.5 million.
These comprised Loan 724-TUN (US$7.5 million; 1971) for a gas pipeline made in
conjunction with a US$2.5 million equivalent loan from the Kuwait Fund for
Arab Economic Development, and the first loan for power, 815-TUN (US$12 mil-
lion; 1972) for a project consisting of two 20-MW gas turbines, transmission
and distribution system expansion, and consulting services for future plant
and institutional development.  The first project was successfully completed
in 1972 and the second one is nearing completion.
1.04      This appraisal report is based on the findings of a Bank mission
consisting of Messrs. V. Antonescu (Engineer), I. Mathai and J. Turcot
(Financial Analysts) which visited Tunisia in June/July 1976.
II. THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. The Country and the Economy
2.01      Tunisia covers an area of about 164,000 km2 (63,000 sq. mi) and has
a population of about 5.6 million with an average annual growth rate of 2.3%.
About half of its labor force is employed in agriculture which provides about
20% of Tunisia's GDP.
2.02      Political stability and the continuation of economic reorientation
since 1970, marked by an increased role of domestic and foreign private in-
vestment and less reliance on administrative controls, have created a favorable
environment for rapid economic growth in recent years. Average annual growth
of real GDP during 1970-1975 amounted to 9.2%. Expansion of production was
especially rapid in construction and manufacturing while agriculture production
showed little increase and mining output stagnated. The power industry has
grown fast especially since 1970, reflected by an average growth rate of
electricity consumption of 10.6%. This was mainly due to the rapid increase



-2-
in household consumption (13.8% average growth for 1970-75) which accounted
at the end of 1975 for 21% of STEG's total electricity sales.
B. Energy Resources
2.03      Tunisia's main energy resources are oil, natural gas and a small
hydropower potential.  Recoverable oil reserves are estimated at about 70 mil-
lion tons. Annual oil production was about 4.6 million tons in 1975 and is
expected to reach some 6.5 million tons annually by 1980, as a result of addi-
tional output from the new offshore fields in the Gulf of Gabes, and to
decline subsequently by 8-10% annually. About 4.8 million tons of crude oil
were exported and 1.1 million tons of oil products were imported in 1975.
Some 300 million m3 of oil-associated gas can be transported annually from
El Borma to the Gabes area through the Bank financed pipeline (Loan 724-TUN)
to supply a power station and various industries. In order to prevent gas
being flared, a project estimated to cost TD 9.6 million is now under consid-
eration for the reinforcement of this pipeline, increasing its capacity by
1981 to about 500 million m3 annually. Preliminary unofficial estimates of
offshore natural gas reserves at Miskar in the Gulf of Gabes are between 70
and 160 billion m3. While these volumes would be inadequate for gas liquefac-
tion and export, they would cover 35 to 80 years of Tunisia's current energy
consumption. If the volume of gas reserves is confirmed, the introduction
of natural gas could change drastically the energy supply pattern in Tunisia,
where the main benefits generated by the substitution of gas for oil would
be incremental oil exports. A project for the extraction and distribution
of this gas, by means of a pipeline to Sfax and thence to Gabes and Menzel
Bourguiba, is being prepared for the Fifth Plan (1977-1981). According to
recent studies made by foreign consultants, some 3.5 billion m3 of low-heat
value gas from Sidi Behara and Sidi Agareb (20 miles west of Sfax) could be
economically used for power generation. Tunisia's hydro power potential is
not significant, but so far about 29 MW has been developed. No favorable
sites exist permitting further developments except for a 25-MW power plant
at Sidi Salem, which is part of a multipurpose project (irrigation, water
supply, power) proposed for Bank financing, and a pumped storage plant at
Kasseb which appears to be less economical than other alternative plants and
therefore has not been included in the development plan. Some poor quality
lignite beds exist but in view of the oil and gas resources no investigation
has been undertaken to determine whether they could be economically developed.
2.04      Former proposals for an intercontinental gas pipeline from Algeria
to Italy through Tunisia, although still under consideration, would have a
less important impact on Tunisia's energy situation due to the recent discovery
of the new offshore gas reserve.

C. The Electric Power Sector
2.05      The power sector is served principally by STEG, a Government-owned
corporation, which is responsible for the production, transmission and distri-
bution of electricity and gas for public consumption for the entire country.
Its principal activity is the sale of electricity; gas sales accounted for
only about 3.3% of its total revenues in 1975. STEG was created by a decree
law in 1962 to take over the operation of seven private utility companies
upon their nationalization. During its early years, STEG's efforts were con-
centrated on physically integrating the seven separate systems. After 1970
STEG has been able to start on a systematic expansion of the integrated
national system and turn its attention to matters of organization, management
and finance.
2.06      After a relative stagnation before 1965, the power sector has de-
veloped rapidly. Power sector data are shown in Annex 1. The total installed
capacity of 415 MW in 1975 generated 1,346 GWh. Of this capacity 367 MW
(88.4%) was owned by STEG, which generated 1,204 GWh (89.5%), and 48 MW
(11.6%) by auto-producers, generating 142 GWh (10.5%). Natural gas accounted
in 1975 for 58.8% (707.5 GWh), liquid fuel for 38.6% (465.2 GWh) and hydro
for 2.6% (31.3 GWh) of STEG's power generation.
2.07      The main transmission system consisting of a 150-kV ring with 150-
kV and 90-kV secondary branches has a total length of about 1,400 km. The
first 225-kV line of about 100 km was built in 1974 between Gannouche and
Maknassy.  It will be operated at 150 kV until 1977 when it will be extended
up to Tunis and converted to 225 kV. The medium voltage lines (10-30 kV)
have a length of about 6,300 km and low tension distribution lines and cables
(220 V and 100 V) about 8,900 km.
2.08      Almost all of STEG's installed capacity, which amounted at the end
of 1975 to 367 MW, is interconnected. The major thermal power plants are
located in:
Tunis:                        Steam 158 MW, gas turbine 45 MW
Ghannouch (Gabes):            Steam 60 MW, gas turbine 60 MW
The total installed capacity in hydro plants of about 29 MW is concentrated
in the northern part of the country. STEG's total diesel capacity of about 15
MW, of which the major part is installed in Sfax, Sousse and Robbana, has the
role of stand-by capacity.
2.09      At the end of 1975 about 420 thousand households (40%) were provided
with electricity, of which 35 thousand were in rural areas (17% of total number
in rural areas) (see para 2.19, 2.20).



-4-
Tariffs
2.10       A new tariff system for electricity based on the marginal cost
concept was implemented by STEG in April 1975 as a result of a tariff study
financed from the first Bank loan for power (815-TUN). The new tariffs
are set out in Annex 2 and summarized below. For low and medium voltage
service, the customer can choose either time-of-day or block tariffs.
Low Voltage (220 V, 100 V)
(a) Time-of-day tariffs:
-    tariffs for agricultural consumers with peak time
cut (T millimes 17/kWh for day time and T millimes
7/kllh for night time)
-    tariffs for water heating with peak time cut (T
millimes 12/kWh)
(b) tariffs by blocks (first block 0 - 10 kWh/kVA/month
second block over 10 kWh/kVA/month)
-    lighting and domestic consumers
(T millimes 45/kWh for the first block;
T millimes 35/kWh for the second block)
-    motive power (T millimes 40/kWh for the first block;
T millimes 28/kWh for the second block)
Medium Voltage (30 kV, 15 kV, 10 kV)
(a) Time-of-day tariffs with a fixed charge of TD 15/month and
a demand charge of TD 1.5/kW/month
(T millimes 11.3/kWh for day time, T millimes 18.4/kWh for
peak and T millimes 4.1/kWh for night time)
(b)  tariffs by blocks with a fixed charge of TD 2.5/month and
a demand charge of TD 0.1/kVA/month
(T millimes 20.4/kWh for up to 50 kWh/kVA/montb
T millimes 15.3/kWh for over 50 KWh/kVA/month)
A special tariff comprising a relative low fixed charge
(TD 2.5/month) applies for medium voltage off-peak agri-
cultural consumers.
Average charges in 1975 were about T millimes 15/kWh (US4 3.5/kWh) for medium
voltage and T millimes 31.6/kWh (USe 7.44/kWh) for low voltage.



-5-
High Voltage (220 kV, 150 kV, 90 kV)
The tariff for this new category of consumers will be an-
nounced in 1976 as a ministerial order. It provides the same
rates as the time of day tariffs for medium voltage con-
sumers. The tariff can be granted under certain technical
conditions (e.g., the subscription of a minimum 8 MW cor-
responding to about 10 MVA is required).
2.11      The effect of the new tariffs on STEG's financial situation has
been slightly beyond expectations, especially during the first seven months.
The revenue per kWh sold during May/November 1975 was 16% higher than during
the corresponding period of the previous year, as compared with an expected
increase of about 14%. This was due mainly to the fact that the major part
of medium voltage consumers have not profited in time by the most favorable
tariff option because of a too short testing period.
2.12      A second stage of the tariff reform is being planned by STEG for
1978-1979, both with regard to tariff structures and to the level of electric-
ity rates. At the same time a method would be studied to bring tariff calcu-
lation systematically up to date on the basis of marginal costs. The tariff
reform would be carried out in connection with a study of Tunisia's pricing
policy for fuel. At present, oil prices (excluding motor fuels) in Tunisia
are only about one fourth of international prices (see para. 5.10), enabling
STEG to achieve satisfactory earnings without significant tariff increases.
Assuming that export sales of petroleum products could be increased if domes-
tic consumption were reduced, this policy results in a substantial subsidy to
users of oil products (and electricity). This policy is part of a deliberate
effort to promote industrialization, and we have no evidence that it has
caused an inefficient use of electrical energy or led to a distorted energy
consumption pattern. In view however of the vital bearing this has on sector
development, Government would undertake a study with a view to determining
an appropriate pricing policy for oil, gas and electricity; the study would
take into consideration STEG's policy on connection charges (para 2.18).
Suggested terms of reference for such a study, which have been agreed in
substance, are included in Annex 3. The final terms of reference would be
determined by the Government in consultation with the Bank. Government has
agreed to submit to the Bank not later than September 30, 1978 the recommenda-
tions of such a pricing study and to exchange views with the Bank on these
recommendations.
D. Development Program
2.13      STEG's 1977-1981 construction program reflects the National Five
Year Plan (Fifth Plan), which is to be considered by the Government by mid
1977. It was slightly reduced by STEG during the mission's visit to Tunisia
to reflect some changes in the industrial development program. STEG's con-
struction program (see Annex 4) amounts to TD 207.3 million (US$483 million
equivalent). The major part of these investments (90.2%) amounting to TD
186.9 million is provided for power, TD 2.5 million (1.2%) for gas and
TD 17.9 million (8.7%) for general development.



- 6 -
2.14      STEG's Department for Development and Coordination has qualified
staff with experience in power system planning. It prepares medium-term
development studies for determining the least cost development programs using
discounted cashl flow methods for comparison of alternatives. The present plan
for 1977-1981 is based on forecasts up to 1983, taking into account general
targets set up for 1985 and 1990.
2.15      To meet its forecast electricity sales, which are projected to
rise by 88% in the next five years (13.3% per year average - see para 6.02),
STEG's power program provides a generation component amounting to some TD 69.6
million (37.2% of total power program). It includes 290 MW of new capacity of
which 150 MW is the gas turbine plant proposed for Bank financing and 140 MW
is steam plant. The plant margin appears rather low in 1979 and 1980 (16-17%),
but this temporary situation is acceptable in view of the programmed comple-
tion by 1979 of the main part of STEG's future 225-kV grid, which would
increase significantly the reliability of the Tunisian power system, and
improve the capability of the existing link with the Algerian system, which
for stability reasons is operated now insularly.
2.16      The program proposed by STEG provides:
-    7 gas turbine units of equal size totalling about 150 MW
(the Project), to be installed two each in Sfax (1977) and
Menzel Bourguiba (1978), and one each in Tunis (1980), Korba
(1980) and Metlaoui (1980), and
-    the first of two 140-MW steam units to be installed in
Sousse (1981).
These capacities would be followed in 1982 by the second 140-MW steam unit in
Sousse and in 1983 by the 25-MW hydropower plant at Sidi Salem.
2.17      The transmission component of STEG's power program amounts to about
TD 36.8 million (19.7% of total power program) part of which (up to 1978) is
being financed with Canadian assistance. It comprises the construction of
some 775 km of transmission lines of which 550 km are 225 kV, 140 km are 150
kV, and 85 km are 90 kV. The new 225-kV transmission grid would comprise the
construction of a south-north and an east-west diagonal including the related
substations to transmit the generated energy from the Ghannouch and Sousse
areas, to increase the reliability of the system, and to achieve a strong
interconnection with the Algerian system. A continuing program of substation
construction is planned to enable the increasing demand to be met, both in
towns (150/30 kV Hammamet and Akouda-Sousse, 90/30/10 kV Tunis North) and in
industry (arc furnace in Menzel Bourguiba, cement factories in Bizerte, Thala
and Gabes).



2.18      The power program includes a large distribution component amount-
ing to TD 80.5 million (43.1% of total power program) of which TD 35 million
is for rural electrification, TD 29 million for urban distribution, TD 8 mil-
lion for industrial consumers and tourism and TD 8.5 million for reinforcement
and conversion of existing networks. STEG would cover by self-financing 38%
of rural electrification, and 48% of urban distribution, the rest being fi-
nanced by customer contributions including 100% financing of electricity con-
nections for industrial and tourism projects. Although this level of financ-
ing through customer contributions seems high, there is no evidence that this
policy has inhibited extension of service, particularly to poorer consumers.
STEG would review this policy in a study of the level and application of
connection charges for electricity supply and would submit to Government and
the Bank by June 30, 1978 the recommendations of such a study. The distribu-
tion program which is based on a Master Plan financed by the Canadian Interna-
tional Development Agency (CIDA), provides for the conversion of medium
voltage networks to a 4-wire system with solid grounded neutral, which would
allow single phase distribution in rural regions with dispersed population
thus obtaining savings estimated at about 20% of the total investment in rural
electrification.
2.19      While up to 1975, development of distribution networks was based on
short-term regional plans adjusted according to STEG's residual funds after
covering the financial requirements for the development of generation and
transmission facilities, the proposed five-year plan for distribution is based
on the Master Plan, which sets up the targets for the 1990 horizon. Its main
aim is for urban electrification to keep pace with the plans for housing con-
struction and to ensure in the shortest possible time the connections for exist-
ing habitations which at present are not supplied with electricity, while the
development of rural electrification is based on political decisions taken
by the Government in order to improve the standard of living in rural areas
and to meet the water pumping requirements for agriculture.
2.20      The intermediate targets of the distribution program for 1981 are
to reach 85% of supplied households in towns and 57% in villages as against
62% and 17%, respectively, in 1974. This program, based on an analysis of
forecast low-voltage consumption, appears to be adequate in view of its social
and political targets. Rate increases of reasonable magnitude which would be
required during the next five-year plan and the future introduction of off-
shore gas in the country are not expected to reduce electricity demand signif-
icantly.  The main objectives of STEG's distribution program for 1977-1981 are:
(a) in towns to raise the number of electrified households from
408 thousand in 1976 to 640 thousand in 1981 (average annual
rate 9.4%).
(b)  in villages to raise the number of electrified households from 44
thousand in 1976 to 118 thousand in 1981 (average annual rate 21.5%).
2.21      A dispatch center for the power system, to be completed in 1981, is
also included in STEG's construction program. It would replace the present
telephonic dispatch, which would become unmanageable by the end of the period
under consideration.



-8-
2.22      The gas component which is a small part of the development program
includes only the reinforcement of the El Borma pipeline to prevent gas being
flared and to supply new consumers in the Gabes area (66 MW gas turbine plant
at Bouchemma), distribution in the Tunis area, connections for industrial con-
sumers and studies for the offshore gas in the Gulf of Gabes but not any pro-
vision for transmission and distribution facilities for this gas.
2.23      A decision with regard to the offshore gas program would be taken
by the Government at a later stage on the basis of the ongoing studies. The
development of the offshore gas field would include the construction of pro-
duction facilities offshore, a submarine pipeline to the shore, a gas treat-
ing plant and a pipeline transmission and distribution network to consumers.
It is the Government's intention to create a new Franco-Tunisian enterprise to
develop and exploit the field, whereas STEG would be in charge of the construc-
tion and operation of the onshore facilities. Preliminary estimates indicate
that total investment required to develop the field would be TD 210 million
which would be financed by the mixed company mentioned above. The cost of the
main transmission and distribution pipelines is estimated at about TD 80 mil-
lion, excluding the investment required for distribution facilities in the
main cities. A Bank sector mission visited Tunisia shortly before negotia-
tions to assess the impact of natural gas on the energy market, to review the
Government's plans regarding offshore gas, the proposed financing, training
and institutional arrangements, and to define areas in which the Bank could
be of assistance. It is obvious that the planned introduction of offshore
gas to the Tunisian market would have an important impact on the industrial
development of the country, providing opportunities for the development of
industries based on the utilization of natural gas (e.g., petrochemicals and
fertilizers). For the power industry it would lead to its almost total
substitution for liquid fuel for electricity generation, the main benefits
being incremental oil exports. Its direct impact on industry and domestic
electricity consumption would be less significant, at least during the pro-
posed five-year plan, since it could be a substitute mainly for electric
heating and cooking, accounting at present for only 0.7% of STEG's total
electricity sales although impact on other energy sources (LPG, petroleum
white products) is likely to be substantial. For STEG, the introduction of
offshore gas would mean a substantially increased activity for construction
and operation of transmission and distribution facilities for gas (see para
4.05).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The Project is the gas-turbine component of STEG's 1977-1981 devel-
opment program for generation facilities. Its main objectives are:



- 9 -
(a) to ensure continuity of electricity supply after 1977;
(b) to cover the need of peak power capacity in the system,
for which no other suitable sources are available; and
(c) to allow STEG to implement after 1980 as the next standard base
load capacity of its system, 120-150 MW steam turbine units
instead of installing in 1980 smaller, and less efficient base
load units (60 MW).
At the same time, Bank lending for the proposed Project would be an opportu-
nity for the Bank to continue its institution-building effort, which started
under the two previous loans and has led to improvements of STEG's organiza-
tion and operations by decentralizing its financial activity, improving its
accounting and billing system, introducing budgetary controls and internal
audit and the revision of the tariff structure. The Bank's association with
the proposed Project would lead to an improvement of electricity tariffs
taking into account the introduction of offshore gas in Tunisia's energy
balance, as well as promote the establishment and implementation of the
measures necessary before STEG assumes future responsibilities in its gas
activities.
B. Description
3.02      Seven units of 21.4 NW each are proposed and would consist of
the turbine, generator and control equipment as a unit, and the transformer
and switchgear to connect the alternator to the transmission system. The gas
turbines would be heavy duty open-cycle units in their own housing so that
they could in the future, if needed, be moved to some other site. The pro-
posed locations and year of commissioning of the gas turbines are as shown in
para 2.16.
3.03      The two gas turbines to be installed at Sfax would be operated
with natural gas of low-heating value, recently discovered in the Sidi Agareb-
Sidi Behara zone (about 20 miles west of Sfax). All the other gas turbines
would be operated with gas oil (a petroleum distillate equivalent to diesel
fuel). A future conversion to offshore gas operation of the power plants is
considered by STEG, but this would be decided upon after the completion of the
ongoing studies. A more detailed description of the gas turbine units and of
the proposed fuels for their operation is given in Annex 5.
C. Status of Engineering
3.04      The gas turbine units would be installed by the suppliers of the
equipment under a supply and erection contract. Civil works and supervision
of the erection and of the required testing would be done by STEG's staff
which is competent and has undertaken similar work in the recent past, as
under the first Bank-financed power project.

D. Cost Estimate
3.05      The estimated construction expenditures for the Project are set out
in Annex 6 and summarized below:

Total Project Cost        1,790   10,770   12,560   4,172   25,105   29,277
3.06      The estimated Project cost is based on firm price bids received by
STEG in April 1976 so no allowance for price contingencies is shown. Physical
contingencies have been estimated at 1.5% both for local costs and for foreign
costs.
E. Financing
3.07      The proposed loan of US$14.5 million equivalent would finance 58% of
the foreign exchange cost of the Project. Remaining foreign exchange costs
would be met by STEG (US$1.4 million) and by a consortium of private banks
with the guarantee of the Compagnie d'Assurance pour le Commerce Exterieur
(US$9.2 million). Agreement in principle on the private bank loan has been
reached between STEG and the lender (about 8 years and 7-1/2% rate of
interest). The effectiveness of the private bank loan would be a condition
of effectiveness of the Bank loan. The local currency costs of about US$4.2
million equivalent will be financed by STEG. No retroactive financing is
proposed since any payments previous to loan approval are to be covered by
STEG or by the proposed private bank loan.



- 11 -
F. Procurement and Disbursement
3.08      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would finance part of the
c.i.f. cost of imported equipment and materials and of the foreign exchange
cost of related installation services. In order to meet the proposed time
schedules and to take advantage of the favorable prices offered for a limited
term by the lowest bidder (Alsthom), STEG awarded the contract immediately
after the field appraisal of the Project on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding, consistent with Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement. Such
advance contracting for the Project proposed to be financed from the Bank loan
was not avoidable since contracting at a later date would not have met the
implementation schedule for the Project and the supplier's condition with
respect to the offered timing and prices. It is expected that disbursements
from the proposed Bank loan which would be for 100 percent of each payment,
would commence in FY1977 after the drawdown of the private Bank loan. A
forecast of estimated disbursements is shown in Annex 7.
3.09      The Project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1980.
G. Environmental Impact
3.10      All five sites of the gas turbines are outside population centers,
and the nearest habitations are situated at about 1.8 miles, so that noise
will not be a problem. Moreover the equipment would be provided with special
hoods in order to reduce noise to a minimum level. The gas oil has a sulphur
content of less than 1%, and the low-heat gas is sulphur-free, thus the gas
turbines would not cause any unacceptable atmospheric pollution.
IV. THE PROJECT ENTITY
A. Background
4.01       STEG which is responsible for the production, transmission and
distribution of electricity and gas for public consumption for the entire
country has established an integrated national power system (para 2.05) and
is now well poised for a large scale expansion of activities.
B. Management and Organization
4.02      The company's management is competent and effective.  STEG is
governed by a board of eight members headed by a President General Manager,
all appointed by the President of the Republic. The management consists of



- 12 -
the President General Manager, a Deputy General Manager, a Manager of
Development and Coordination, and a Manager of Administration.
4.03      The operations of the entity come under the general supervision of
eight departments, which in 1975 took the place of the former nine divisions,
and are charged with production of electricity and gas, transmission, dis-
tribution, construction and equipment, finance, administration, general
affairs and data processing. The country is divided into 13 Districts which
operate the local services (see Annex 8). A further decentralization is
being studied by STEG, which would consist of the creation of local agencies
in towns, in the framework of the Districts, to be begun with the Tunis area.
4.04      STEG's present organization appears to be adequate for the ful-
fillment of the company's tasks for the next five-year plan. Nevertheless
its management is continually studying the organization with the assistance
of consultants. This action which started as early as the creation of the
company, has been advanced by the second Bank loan through financing of
studies for accounting system, reorganization and implementation of improved
computer procedures, which have been successfully completed.
4.05      The introduction of offshore gas on the Tunisian market (see para
2.23), which is likely to start by 1981, is expected to bring on new respon-
sibilities for STEG, concerning the construction and operation of onshore
facilities for transmission and distribution of natural gas. Therefore, a
study would be undertaken by STEG to define these new responsibilities and to
establish the organizational structure of the company, its training needs and
the required investments for the gas program. Suggested Terms of Reference
for such a study, which have been agreed in substance with STEG, are given in
Annex 9. The final terms of reference would be determined by STEG in consulta-
tion with the Bank. STEG would submit the recommendations of this study to
the Government and the Bank not later than June 30, 1978.
C. Staffing
4.06      During its early years, STEG's efforts were concentrated on filling
the gaps in supervisory and skilled manpower created when the expatriate per-
sonnel of the original companies left Tunisia. Electricite de France (EdF)
assisted materially in this program by seconding personnel to STEG and con-
ducting training courses in France. At present the total output of the Ecole
Nationale d'lngenieurs of about 80 engineers/year in different specialties of
main interest to the power industry, appears to be sufficient to cover STEG's
needs (estimated at an average of 30 engineers/year) and those of the rest of
the economy. STEG's training programs and facilities are satisfactory. They
will be improved by the new training center of Khledia, which was completed
in 1976.
4.07      At the end of 1975 STEG's total number of employed regular staff was
3,710, and is expected to exceed 4,000 by the end of 1976, which corresponds
to an average yearly increase for 1962-1976 of 4.5%. Although under the first
Bank loan (Loan 724-TUN) STEG announced its intention not to exceed the 1972



- 13 -
level of 3,200 employees through 1975, the increase of employed personnel
appears to be justified by the increased investment program, amounting to
TD 79.4 million during 1973-1976 (Fourth Plan), as compared to the planned
TD 42.8 million (86% increase), as well as by increased electricity produc-
tion, amounting for the same period to 4,620 GWh as compared to 3,890 GWh
assumed under the first Bank loan (18.9% increase); overstaffing is not now
considered to be a problem.
V. FINANCE
A. Financial Highlights
5.01 (a) STEG is a well managed utility enjoying operational autonomy
and having a proper accounting and management information sys-
tem. It has fulfilled the earnings covenant (para 5.04) and
the debt limitation covenant (para 5.05) with the Bank from
1973, the first applicable year. With minor tariff adjust-
ments it should be able to earn a minimum rate of return of
8% on net average fixed assets in service during 1977-1981;
(b) forty-nine percent of STEG's expansion requirements in 1976-
1981 is expected to be met from internally generated funds
including customer contribution and 47% from borrowing, 39%
from new borrowing for financing foreign costs and 8% from
drawdown of existing loans; and
(c) mainly because of computer problems STEG has not been able
to submit audited financial statements to the Bank within the
agreed period of four months after the end of the fiscal year
but improvement is expected in the future; a period of five
months instead of four has now been agreed for the submission
of audited financial statements to the Bank under the proposed
loan.
B. STEG's Relations with Government
5.02      STEG's annual capital and operating budgets, and its rate schedules
for supply of electricity and gas are required to be approved by Government.
Except for this overall control by Government, STEG is an autonomous body,
enjoying operational freedom in the conduct of its day-to-day business.
STEG's salary scales require Government's approval but since Government's
approval of salary revisions has been forthcoming whenever necessary, this
is not perceived in STEG as a problem affecting its operational autonomy.



- 14 -
C. Accounting and Reporting Systems
5.03      After implementing the recommendations of organization studies
financed by the Bank under Loan 815-TUN, STEG is now operating an efficient
accounting and management information system. With the help of consultants
STEG has identified all its assets and determined their values including the
pre-1969 assets, the valuation of which was an unresolved problem even at the
time of appraisal of Loan 815-TUN dated April 20, 1972. Computer applica-
tions to billing and collection, inventory control, personnel records and
most accounting functions are now completed. STEG is considering extension
of computer applications to other areas such as dispatching and maintenance of
high voltage substations. Some special features of STEG's present accounting
system are:
(a) interest during construction is not recognized;
(b) income taxes are recorded as charges and liabilities until
formal exemption is given, usually in the following year.
All tax exemptions, though valid for only one year at a
time, have always been granted every year and are expected
to continue (income taxes have been eliminated from the
financial statements in Annexes since exemptions are in-
variably given), and
(c) gas recovered from El Borma is charged to electricity op-
erations at an oil-equivalent (TD 7.5/ton) price for cost
determination. The income statement, however, is consolidated
and does not identify separately expenses allocated to El
Borma.
D. Past Performance and Present Position
5.04      Under Loan 815-TUN, STEG is required to maintain tariffs at such
a level that the ratio of operating surplus to average value of gross fixed
assets in operation less average customer contributions would not fall below
8.5% in any fiscal year beginning with 1973, operating surplus being defined
as the surplus before charging depreciation or interest on long-term debt.
STEG's rate of return on this basis was 8.5% in 1973, 9.3% in 1974 and 10%
in 1975 when electricity supply rates were raised an average 16% with effect
from April 1975, and internal cash generation was above 50% of construction
requirements during these years. The operating ratio (ratio of operating
expenses to operating revenues) was 83% in 1973 and 80% each in 1974 and
1975. Annex 10 gives STEG's income statements for 1974-1981.



- 15 -
5.05      Loan 815-TUN also requires that STEG would not incur any debt with-
out the approval of the Bank except for financing of the Project if it would
raise its total debt to more than 45% of the sum of its equity plus its total
debt, equity being defined to include the accumulated contributions made by
customers. During 1973-1975, the level of STEG's debt was well within the
the level of 45%, the highest in the three years being 35% in 1975. Although
current assets exceeded current liabilities in 1974, they were only about 82%
*         of the current liabilities in 1975 reflecting a very tight working capital
position. Of the current assets at end of 1975, 40% consisted of accounts
receivable for electricity supply which was equivalent to a high 38% of the
year's revenues.  Annex 11 gives STEG's balance sheets as of December 31,
1974-1981.
E. Collection of Receivables
5.06      STEG's accounts receivable for electricity supply were at an
unacceptable level until the appraisal of Loan 815-TUN (as high as 286 days'
revenues in 1970). Under Loan 815-TUN, Government agreed to make arrange-
ments satisfactory to the Bank to settle the electricity bills of Government
departments, local authorities and Government-owned enterprises. If any
accounts were outstanding by mid-1973, Government agreed to make a settlement
plan satisfactory to the Bank.
5.07      Government and STEG have taken energetic action to reduce STEG's
receivables for electricity supply to reasonable levels. STEG has introduced
computerized bill processing with outstanding success. Procedures now being
implemented provide for delivery of bills within 24 hours of meter reading
in the Tunis area and 48 hours elsewhere. High and medium voltage accounts
are billed monthly with 15 to 20 days for remittance and low voltage customers
are billed every second month with 15 days for remittance. The system is now
being extended to all of Tunisia. The Government departments operating under
the centralized state budget pay in advance 80% of the year's estimated bill.
Outstandings at the end of 1975 were equivalent to 145 days' revenues as
against 286 days'.revenues at 1970-end; they would have been less if credit
facilities were not extended in 1974-75 to municipalities to promote improve-
ments and install street-lighting. The last important hold-out among large
national companies (Societe Tunisienne d'Expansion Miniere - SOTEMI) is
expected to settle all its arrears by end of 1977. STEG is now well on the
way to attaining its target of restricting outstandings to 50-60 days'
revenues by the end of 1977. In order to ensure collections from municipal-
ities, STEG does not remit taxes collected for municipalities until its own
accounts have been settled.

5.09      STEG's net internal cash generation from operations is estimated
to be 27% of the construction requirements; the cash generation would be 49%
including customer contributions which is close to the 50% level STEG has been
aiming at as a minimum objective. Customer contributions amount to 22% of
capital expenditures reflecting STEG's targets for the development of distri-
bution networks and especially the Government's policy with regard to rural
electrification (see para 2.18). Only 47% of the financing would come from
borrowing; 39% from new borrowing, all for financing foreign costs, and 8%
from drawdown of existing loans. The proposed IBRD loan which would finance
about 3% of the construction requirements is assumed to be for US$14.5 million
at 8.7% for a term of 14 years including a 2.5-year grace period. As regards
the remaining foreign exchange requirements, a private Bank loan of about
US$9.2 million (para 3.07), French governmental credits, loans from Arab
sources and some suppliers credits are assured although terms and amounts
have yet to be finally agreed for the Bank loans and suppliers credits. A
major portion of the foreign exchange is for large steam stations for which
suppliers credits would likely be forthcoming. The gap in the financing plan
is therefore not as large as appears to be the case although it is difficult
to determine its precise magnitude at present. In order to remove any uncer-
tainty in the financing plan, Government has agreed that in the event of
STEG's inability to raise finances for the Project, Government would provide
funds to insure its implementation.
G. Future Performance
5.10      At present STEG pays for oil only about 23% of international prices
(TD 8.18 as against about TD 35 per ton) and is thus insulated from the world
increase in oil prices and therefore has been able to fulfill the earnings
covenant without any significant tariff increases. At current consumption
levels, the implied subsidy to STEG on this account amounts to about TD 5.23
million (US$12.19 million) a year or about 22% of its operating expenses (see
para 2.12).
5.11      Based on the expected load growth and the level of future expenses
STEG is expected to earn an annual return ranging from 9.6% in 1976 to 12.4%
in 1977. This assumes a continuation of the low fuel price STEG pays for
its fuel oil (23% of international prices). The operating ratio during
this period ranges from 78% to 83%.
5.12      STEG's debt equity ratio during this period would range from 40/60
in 1976 to 48/52 in 1980. The debt level is significantly above that in
1974/75 because of the heavy borrowings for the program during this period.
The working capital position would remain tight from 1977 to 1981 and would
need close attention in order that STEG may maintain adequate liquidity.



- 18 -
H. Proposed Financial Covenant
5.13      Partly because of the then existing uncertainties about the asset
values on which the rate of return covenant would have to be based, the rate
of return covenant under Loan 815-TUN was framed to relate directly to STEG's
investment and to reduce temporary fluctuations in the return that would arise
from fluctuations in depreciation charges on account of commissioning of major
assets. The covenant thus provided that STEG would maintain tariffs at such
a level that the ratio of operating surplus to average value of gross fixed
assets in operation less average customer contribution would not fall below
8.5% in any fiscal year. Since STEG's assets have since been identified and
values determined, this somewhat unusual covenant under which the return is
computed before depreciation is no longer necessary. It would be more appro-
priate to adopt a more conventional rate of return covenant under which the
return is calculated with net operating income after depreciation as the
numerator and average net fixed assets in operation less customer contribu-
tions as the denominator. Government and STEG have agreed to such a covenant
with an 8% rate of return beginning with 1977.
5.14      The proposed rate of return formula would exclude customer contribu-
tions from revenue and the assets base in accordance with conventional treat-
ment of these amounts. However, in view of their significance to the financ-
ing plan, should the proposed study of connection charges (para 2.18) indicate
that a change in policy would be desirable, revision of the rate of return
objective may be necessary. STEG would discuss with the Bank such a revision,
if necessary.
5.15      In order to enable STEG and the Bank to ensure that the provisions
of this covenant are likely to be met, STEG has agreed that before October 31
of each year it will furnish to the Government and the Bank a forecast showing
the expected rate of return for the current and next years and the tariffs on
which the computations are based together with a statement of any action which
it intends to take in order to achieve the agreed returns. Government on its
part has agreed to ensure that STEG's tariffs for electricity supply are
adequate for it to. earn the agreed rate of return.
5.16      STEG's rate of return on the above basis would be, with the present
electricity tariffs, about 8.6% in 1977, and 7.7% in 1978; in 1981 the return
is expected to be 6.2%. Marginal adjustments in tariffs (say, 5%) would be
necessary in 1978 for STEG to earn an 8% return in that year.
I. Proposed Debt Limitation Covenant
5.17      The agreement under Loan 815-TUN requires that STEG would not incur
any debt without the approval of the Bank except for financing the Project if
it would raise its total debt to more than 45% of the sum of its equity and
its total debt, equity being defined to include the accumulated contributions
made by customers. Even after considering the large borrowings necessary for



- 19 -
financing the total investment program, STEG's debt during 1976-1981 is not
estimated to exceed the level of 45% except in 1979, 1980 and 1981, and then
only marginally. This covenant would keep STEG's assumption of long-term
debt under review and together with the proposed earnings covenant would
ensure adequate cash flow for STEG vis-a-vis its debt service and construction
requirements. STEG has agreed to repeat this covenant in the proposed loan.
J. Audit
5.18      Under Loan 815-TUN, STEG's financial statements are to be audited
by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and submitted to the Bank
within four months after the end of each fiscal year. In the past this time
schedule has not been observed by STEG; the audited financial statements for
1975 were received in the Bank only in August 1976. STEG attributes the delay
to computer problems causing delays in compiling acounts and to the fact that
the auditors cannot start work until the annual report is available, generally
in April. Since the computer problems have been largely overcome, improvement
is expected in the future but not to the point where STEG can submit audited
financial statements within four months. Considering the audit program, STEG
and the Bank has agreed that five months would be a more realistic time limit.
The Bank has accepted Nawar & Co., an Egyptian firm of Chartered Accountants,
appointed by STEG as auditors for 1974 and 1975 as independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations, STEG has agreed to continue
to utilize the services of independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and to
submit the audited statements within five months after the end of each fiscal
year. For only 1976 STEG would submit the audited financial statements within
six months i.e. by end of June 1977.
K. Insurance
5.19      Apart from injuries to third parties and accidents to personnel,
STEG provides for insurance coverage through a nationalized company against
fire, explosion, mechanical and electrical damage at all generating plants
and substations of 90 kV and over, and against only fire in the head office
and district offices, store depots and warehouses. No coverage is provided
in respect of transmission or distribution lines or distribution substations.
The amount of the policy is about 80% of the net book value of STEG's assets
(annual cost:  a little over 1% of cash operating expenses).  STEG con-
tinuously reassesses risks in the face of sharply rising costs and the need
for securing maximum protection at an acceptable cost. Given the general
trend of providing greater protection of installations and the higher level
of training and experience among staff resulting in better operational
standards, STEG's insurance practice is acceptable. The insurance arrange-
ments would, however, be kept under review by the Bank during the course of
supervision.

VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Market Growth
6.01      The trend growth rate of STEG's electricity sales since 1966, when
the situation started improving after a stagnant period, has been 11.5% p.a.
and of system maximum demand 11.3%. Projections of the future trend have
been made by STEG using different methods, as described in Annex 14.
6.02      The forecast adopted for system planning purposes implies an average
growth rate of 13.3% for STEG's electricity sales and of 12.5% for maximum
demand over the period 1975-1981. This forecast reflects the economic expan-
sion of the country planned for the next five-year period and is considered
a suitable basis upon which to plan system expansion. Historic and forecast
sales (total and by categories of consumers), generation, maximum demand and
plant capacities are shown in Annex 14, Attachments I and 2. The increases in
sales and maximum demand are summarized as follows:
1966        1975         1981    Average Growth

6.03      Transmission and distribution losses estimated at 16.8% of STEG's
total generation in 1976 are expected to decrease to 15.3% by 1981, mainly
as a result of the construction of the 225-kV grid.
B. Least Cost Development Program
6.04      To meet the forecast power requirements, STEG is undertaking a
program comprising the installation in 1977-1983 of a total capacity of 455
MW, of which 150 MW is gas turbine plant, 280 MW is steam power plant and 25



- 21 -
MW is hydro plant. Since it appears that in the long range STEG primarily
needs additional capacity to cover the increased energy demand, and not to
firm up the system, a decision had to be taken with regard to the unit size
for future strategies which can be considered to meet the forecasts of energy
consumption:
Alternative I  -  installation of two 120-150 MW steam units which
would not be justified before 1981 due to their
size as compared with the maximum demand of the
system; in this case a capacity of 60-65 MW in
gas turbine, which would have lower capital cost
per installed kW but higher fuel costs per kWh,
would be necessary in 1980, and
Alternative II -  postponement of the 120-150 MW units until 1984,
renouncement of the 60-65 MW gas-turbine plants
and installation of an equivalent capacity in
50-60 MW steam units from 1980 on, requiring
higher capital costs per kW and higher operational
costs than the 120-150 MW units.
Common to both cases is the installation in 1977-1978 of 85-90 MW in gas
turbine plant which is the only feasible option within the available time
frame, and 25 MW hydro in 1983 (Sidi Salem). The transmission program would
be in both cases the same since the steam units would be located at the same
site (Sousse), and the additional gas turbines in case (I) would not require
new transmission lines.
C. Comparison of Alternatives
6.05      The alternatives described in para. 6.04 were compared as shown in
Annex 14, Attachments 3-5, the main variables being capital costs and fuel
costs. Two fuel alternatives were examined:
(a) gas oil for the gas-turbine power plants at Menzel-Bourguiba,
Tunis South, Korba and Metlaoui and heavy oil for the steam
power plant at Sousse during the whole economic life of these
power plants, and
(b) the same fuel as in alternative (a) until 1980 and conversion
of the power plants to natural gas operation after this date.
In both alternatives it was assumed that the Sfax gas-turbine plants
(2 x 21.4 MW) would be operated on low-heat value natural gas from the oil
fields at Sidi Behara and Sidi Agareb. Since this oil-associated gas would
be flared, if not used for power generation, its cost is negligible. Inter-
national prices for heavy oil ($82/t) and gas oil ($110/t) were used for
the comparison. As for the recently discovered offshore gas, which would



- 22 -
cover Tunisia's needs after 1980 for an assumed period of at least 20 years,
the additional expenses to use this gas comprise marginal costs for its pro-
duction, transmission and distribution and its ultimate replacement cost at
the end of the life of the field. The marginal supply cost is relatively low.
It was estimated by STEG at TD 3 per ton of oil equivalent (TOE). The replace-
ment cost of offshore gas depends on the cost of its substitute, the size of
the gas reserves, and the run-out date of the gas. Assuming that the substi-
tute for offshore gas would be oil at TD 35/TOE, and that the life of the gas
reserves would be 20 years, the replacement cost of the offshore gas would
range between TD 7/TOE and TD 16/TOE, at discount rates of 4-8%. This would
lead to an economic cost of gas ranging between TD 10/TOE and TD 20/TOE, which
corresponds to the cost price of gas delivered to the consumers.  For the
comparison of alternatives the upper limit has been used.
6.06      The proposed program (alternative I) which provides the installation
in 1977-1982 of 150-MW in gas turbines and two 140-MW steam units, was found to
have the lowest present value up to discount rates exceeding 30% in both fuel
alternatives. The relative advantage of alternative I would be maintained if
capital costs and electricity rates would be 20% higher.
D. Rate of Return
6.07      The return on the Project was estimated by calculating the discount
rate which equalizes the present values of the cost and benefit streams attri-
butable over time to the Project. Capital costs are based on firm price bids
received by STEG in April 1976. The costs were adjusted for taxes, internal
transfers and assumed price contingencies. The benefits comprise the revenues
from power sales attributable to the Project. It was assumed that the gas
turbines included in the Project would be used after 1981 mainly for peaking
and reserve. The estimated rate of return, at present electricity prices and
using low-heat value gas for the Sfax power plant and gas oil for the rest of
the gas turbines, would be at least 13.2% (see Annex 14, Attachment 7).
6 08      Supposing that offshore gas would be used after 1980 instead of oil
for all gas turbines (with the exception of the Sfax power plant which will
continue to be operated on low-heat value gas), the rate of return would
exceed 24% due to the lower economic value assumed for the offshore gas.
6.09      Assuming 20% higher capital costs the rate of return would be 9.4%
in fuel alernative (a) and 21.6% in fuel alternative (b). If electricity
rates would be 20% higher the rate of return would exceed 25% in both fuel
alternatives. The combinations of these different assumptions reflect the
fact that the rate of return of the Project is highly sensitive to variation
in fuel costs and electricity rates and less sensitive to increased capital
costs.

VII. MONITORING SYSTEM
7.01      Suggested key indicators for monitoring STEG's performance are
given in Annex 15, which STEG considers generally appropriate. STEG has
agreed to implement such a monitoring system in consultation with the Bank
and for this purpose, would submit to the Bank by June 30, 1977 for its
comments key indicators of performance.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Government has agreed to:
(a)  undertake a study with a view to determining an appropriate
pricing policy for oil, gas and electricity taking into con-
sideration STEG's policies on the level and application of
connection charges for electricity, to submit to the Bank not
later than September 30, 1978 the recommendations of such a
pricing study and to exchange views with the Bank on these
recommendations (para 2.12);
(b)  provide the funds to carry out the Project in the event of
STEG's inability to arrange these funds (para 5.09); and
(c)  ensure that STEG's tariffs for electricity supply are ade-
quate for it to earn the agreed rate of return (para 5.15).
8.02      STEG has agreed to:
(a)  undertake a study of the level and application of connection
charges for electricity supply and to submit by June 1978 the
recommendations of this study to the Government and the Bank
(para 2.18);
(b)  undertake an appropriate study to determine its organizational
structure, its training needs and the necessary investments
for the implementation of the program concerning the trans-
mission and distribution of natural gas throughout the country
and submit by June 1978 the recommendations of this study to
the Government and the Bank (para 4.05);
(c)  a revised rate of return covenant (para 5.13);
(d)  discuss with the Bank revision of the proposed rate of return
formula, which excludes customer contributions from revenue
and the assets base, should the proposed study of connection
charges indicate that a change in policy would be desirable
(para 5.14);



- 24 -
(e) furnish to the Bank before October 31 of each year, a forecast
of its earnings for the current and next years (para 5.15);
(f) extend to the proposed loan the existing covenant regarding
debt limitation (para 5.17); and
(g) continue to utilize the services of independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and to submit the audited financial
statements within five months after the end of each fiscal
year except for those relating to 1976 (para 5.18).
8.03      Subject to the foregoing, a Bank loan to STEG of US$14.5 million
equivalent is recommended for a term of 14 years including a 2.5-year grace
period. Completion of steps for effectiveness of the private bank loan of
about US$9.2 million would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
Bank loan. The loan could be effective within three months of signing of
the loan agreement.

ANNEX 3
APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND POWER PROJECT (STEG)
TUNISIA
Suggested -Qutline Terms of Reference, Energy Pricing Study
1.       The objectives of the study, which would cover only energy con-
sumed in Tunisia, would be:
- to determine a system of prices for the various sources of
energy which reflects the economic cost of supply to the
users including the long term marginal development cost
(resource cost) and the cost of externalities (employment,
pollution and other environmental costs);
- to formulate pricing policies (including fiscal policies)
to implement the above.
2.       To achieve the objectives the study should:
- assess the resource cost of various forms of energy in the
long run for energy produced domestically and imported;
- establish supply curves according to cost for each of the
main sources;
- project demand by source and end use at least until 1990;
- compare supply/demand projections and establish most likely
energy mix;
- assess the long term marginal cost of supply for each source
within the framework of the selected supply/demand projection;
-  assess the costs of externalities for each source of energy
and allocate these costs to the various categories of users;
- determine a cost structure for various forms of energy by end
use or end use sector (including the cost of externalities);
- prepare energy price schedules and test them against supply
demand projections;
- recommend an optimum price schedule.

d. General Equipment
- telemetering and supervisory control equipment at the Tunis
dispatch center
- equipment for a line circuit bay in the existing 30-kV outdoor
substation
- set of spare parts
2. Tunis-South Power Plant
This power plant is similar to the Sfax power plant, but would comprise
only one unit of 21.4 MW which would be provided with remote control
from the dispatch center in Tunis. The power plant would be operated
with gas oil, and would have fuel storage facilities including a tank
of 1,020 m3 capacity (about one month operation at 20% plant factor).
Main characteristics of the fuel:
-   calorific value .................... 10,800 - 10,900 kcal/kg
-   density at 150C ....... ............. 0.810 - 0.890
-   temperature of inflamability ....... not lower than 550C
-   mineral acidity .................... none
-   sulphur      .................. less than 1%
-   sodium ............................. 0.5 parts per million
potassium .......................... 0.1 parts per million
calcium         .................. 0.1 parts per million
-   vanadium ........................... 0.5 parts per million
3. Korba Power Plant
This power plant would comprise one unit of 21.4 MW, which would be
connected to the existing 90 kV transmission line. The power plant would
be operated with gas oil, and would be provided with the same fuel storage
facilities as the Tunis-South power plant.
4. Menzel Bourguiba Power Plant
This power plant is similar to the Korba power plant, but would comprise
two units of 21.4 MW each.   The capacity of the fuel storage tank would
be of 1,200 m3 (two weeks operation at 20% plant factor) which is considered
sufficient in view of the location of the power plant.
5. Metlaoui Power Plant
This power plant would be similar to the Korba power plant, with the
exception of its connection to the transmission system which would be
at 150 kV.

ANNEX 9
APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND POWER PROJECT (STEG)
TUNISIA
Suggested Outline Terms of Reference, Gas Organization Study
1.        The introduction of offshore gas on the internal market which is
likely to start by 1981 is expected to bring on new responsibilities for
STEG, which would be in charge of the construction and operation of the
onshore facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas
throughout the country. STEG should therefore undertake a study to deter-
mine by the end of 1978 STEG's organizational structure, its training needs
and the necessary investments for the implementation of the proposed gas
program.
2.        The study should include in the first phase the analysis of:
- the forecast consumption of natural gas both in the industrial
sectors (as fuel or raw material) and in households at least
until 1990;
- the comparison between distribution of natural gas through
pipelines and in bottles as liquefied natural gas, and the most
economical proportion between these two forms of distribution;
- the configuration of an integrated transmission and distribution
pipeline system and the stages of its erection;
- the organizational structure of STEG in view of its future gas
activities;
- STEG's needs of personnel for its gas activities and the required
training program to cover these needs;
- the required investments for the gas program and the scheduling
of development stages;
- STEG's objectives with regard to financial efficiency of the
future gas activity, its rate of return and level of service
to consumers.
3.        In the second phase detailed proposals should be made for imple-
mentation of the organizational and financial measures resulting from the
first phase of the study.   Coordination  with the proposed energy pricing
study will be necessary to avoid duplication of effort.

Assumptions Underlying Financial Statements
A. Income Statements
Sales
Actual    ---Estimated-------------
1975     1976  1977  1978  1979  1980  1981
Percentage increases
over previous years          11.8     10.9  13.4  13.4  13.9  13.4  13.4
Tariffs
The financial statements reflect an average 16% tariff increase
(14% for low tension consumers and 18% for others) with effect from
April 1975. No further tariff increases are assumed in the forecasts.
El Borma
The El Borma operation consists in extracting and transporting gas
for generating electricity and for supplying two industrial customers.
The El Borma expenses are consolidated with other expenses in the income
statements.
Other Revenues*
Other revenues reflect revenues from activities related to electricity
supply other than from direct sale of electricity such as hire of meters,
services rendered to consumers, etc.
Fuel Costs
Fuel costs are based on prices presentlv charged by the Govern-
ment monopoly responsible for sale of oil in the country, namely TD
8.18 as against the international price of about TD 35 per ton. At this
price STEG enjoys an implied subsidy of about TD 5.23 million (US$12.19
million) a year.
Wages and Salaries
The report assumes an average increase in salaries and wages of
about 6% a year. Appointment of additional staff is also assumed as
necessary for additional facilities brought into service.



ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 3
Depreciation
For major assets (power st ;.tion, pipeline, transmission line
or substation) depreciation is clarged for the period the asset is in
service during the year. For n-her assets (e.g., distribution), depre-
ciation is charged for the wLiole year. Depreciation is charged on all
assets in service including those financed by customer contributions.
Based on individual rates for various types of assets, the average rate
for STEG works out to about 5%.
B. Balance Sheets
Fixed Assets
The total values of fixed assets reflect revaluation as of 1969
of assets taken over from the original operating companies. Subsequent
additions are at cost. The balance sheets assume escalation of construction
expenditures during 1976-1981 calculated by compounding at annual rates
of increase of 13% (1976), 12% (1977-79) and 10% (1980-81) for local
costs, and of 9% (1976), 8% (1977-79) and 7% (1980-81) for foreign costs.
Accounts Receivable - Utility
STEG's estimated Accounts Receivable reflect progressive improvement
in bill collection resulting in a reduction of outstandings from 145
days' revenues in 1975 to about 58 days' revenues in 1981. This is
reasonable considering:
(i) the billing cycle (para 5.07);
(ii) improved billing and collection procedures especially the
procedure of 80% advance payment in February of electricity
bills by Government departments, and
(iii) strictly enforced policy of disconnections.
Long-Term Debt
Foreign debt is recorded in Tunisian Dinars for the amount
originally received. However owing to the large exchange variations
in the value of DM and US$, the debt was revalued at the end of 1975
and the loss/gain was directly taken to the year's revenue account.
The interest charges on debt at the end of 1975 varied from 3% to 7.25%.
Customer Contributions
Customer contributions are levied roughly on the following basis:
Urban domestic customers: Average TD 50 per connection.
Villages                 : Average 65% of cost of connecting village
to nearest transmission line.
Industrial customers    : Average TD 2,000 per km of line.

Customer contributions are not treated as revenue but are shown as
a distinct item under equity.
Customer Deposits
STEG obtains deposits from customers equal to one month's estimated
consumption.

THE SECOND POWER PROJECT (STEG)
TUNISIA
Justification of Project
Forecast of Sales and Demand
1.        The trend growth of STEG's electricity sales since 1966, when the situation
of the power sector started improving after a stagnant period, has been 11.5% p.a.
During the last five years the relative part of low voltage electricity in
STEG's total sales has increased from 31% in 1970 to 34% in 1975, as a result
of the increasednumberof customers and of STEG's tariff policy.  The part
of high voltage electricity has been stabilized at about 10%, whereas the part
of medium voltage has decreased from 59% to 56%.
2.        In making the forecast of total electricity consumption, STEG used
two approaches:
(a) a global approach consisting of the application of a general
model for extrapolating the demand on the basis of past trends,
and
(b) an analytical approach consisting of reviewing the industrial
consumers individually (mainly high and medium voltage) for
each sector of the economy, or for each region, to ascertain
their planned expansion and to identify new consumers. The
different categories of low voltage consumers, including the
new tourism projects, have been analyzed separately.
The extrapolation of the past trend up to 1986 through an exponential model
leads for 1981 to a level of 2,480 GWh (with 75% chance not to be exceeded),
which corresponds for 1975-1981 to an average growth rate of 13.7%. The
analytical approach showed that the consumption in 1981 level taking into account
delays and project which might not materialize, would be about 2,830 GWh,
of which 2,100 GWh for high and medium voltage consumers and 730 GWh for low
voltage consumers. This corresponds to an average growth rate for 1975-1981
of 16.2%. Since STEG's past forecasts based on global approaches have led
to lower figures than the effective electricity consumption, more credit
has been given to the analytical method. Assuming that autoproducers would
supply about 700 GWh in 1981, STEG's electricity sales for that year would
have resulted in about 2,130 GWh, which corresponds to an average growth
rate of 13.3% for 1975-1981, as compared with 11.5% for 1966-1975. This
forecast which reflects the economic expansion of the country planned for the
next five-year period, is considered a suitable basis upon which to plan
system expansion.

3.        The increase in total electricity sales and by categories of consumers
is shown in Attachments 1 and 2.
4.        Transmission and distribution losses estimated at 16.8% of STEG's
total generation in 1976 are expected to decrease slightly in relative terms,
mainly as a result of the construction of the 225-kV grid.
Least-Cost Development Program
5.        Since it appears that after 1980 STEG primarily needs
additional capacity to cover the increased energy demand, and not to firm up
the system, the following two alternatives to meet the forecast consumption
have been considered, which differ from each other by the unit size for base
load capacity, the timing of its installation and the additional capacity
to balance the annual power requirements:
Alternative I  - installation of two 140 MW steam units in 1981
and 1982 at Sousse and a capacity of 65 MW in gas
turbine in 1980 at Tunis-North (M'Nhila) and
Metlaoui, and
Alternative II - installation of five 60 MW steam units at Sousse
in 1980-1983.
Common to both alternatives is the installation in 1977-1978 of 85 MW in
gas turbine plant (Sfax and Menzel Bourguiba) which is the only feasible option
within the available time frame, and 25 MW hydro in 1983 (Sidi Salem). The
transmission program would be in both cases the same.
6.        The schedules for generation and capacities as well as the various
cost streams for both cases are shown in Attachments 3-5. The following
assumptions were made:
(a)  Steam power plant 2 x 140 MW
Capital cost:                     TD 210/kW (US$490/kW) at firm prices
Energy consumption:                2,500 kcal/kWh
Load factor:                       80%
Operation and maintenance costs: TD 300 thousand/year for first unit
TD 400 thousand/year for two units
(b) Steam power plant 5 x 60 MW
Capital cost:                     TD 257/kW (US$600/kW) at firm prices
Energy consumption:                2,800 kcal/kWh
Load factor:                       80%
Operation and maintenance costs: TD 250 thousand/year for first unit
TD 400 thousand/year for two units
TD 500 thousand/year for four units
TD 550 thousand/year for five units

(c) Gas turbine power plant (21.4 MW unit size)
Capital cost:             Tn 88/1uW (US$205/kW) at firm prices
Energy consumption:         -00 kcal/kWh (gas oil); 3,300 kcal/kWh (gas)
Load factor (after       -  '
Operation and maintenX ce costs: TD 50 thousand/year for 2 x 21.4 MW
TD 30 thousand/year for 1 x 21.4 MW
7.        Two fuel alternatives were examined:
(a) gas oil for the gas turbine power plants at Menzel Bourguiba,
Tunis North and Metlaoui and heavy oil for the steam power
plant at Sousse during the whole economic life of these power
plants, and
(b) the same fuel as in alternative (a) till 1980 and conversion
of the power plants to natural gas operation after this date.
In both alternatives it was assumed that the Sfax gas-turbine plant (2 x 21.4 MW)
would be operated on low-heat value natural gas. Fuel requirements for
electricity generation (1976-1983) are shown in Attachment 6.
8.        The proposed program (alternative I) was found to have the lowest
present value up to discount rates exceeding 30% in both fuel alternatives.
The relative advantage of alternative I would be maintained if capital costs
and electricity rates would be 20% higher.
Rate of Return
9.        The return on the Project is the discount rate which equalizes the
present values of the cost and benefit streams attributable over time to the
Project. Capital costs are based on firm price bids received by STEG in
April 1976. The costs were adjusted for taxes, internal transfers and assumed
price contingencies (9% in 1976, 8% in 1977-79 and 7% thereafter for foreign
costs and 13% in 1976, 12% in 1977-79 and 10% thereafter for local costs).
An economic life of 20 years for the gas turbines has been assumed. The gas
turbines would be used after 1981 mainly for peaking and reserve.   The
estimated rate of return, at present electricity prices and using low-heat
value gas for the Sfax power plant and gas oil for the rest of the gas turbines,
would be at least 13.2% (see Attachment 7).
10.       Supposing that offshore gas would be used after 1980 instead of oil
for all gas turbines (with the exception of the Sfax power plant which will
continue to be operated on low-heat value gas), the rate of return would exceed
24% due to the lower economic value assumed for the offshore gas.
11.       Assuming 20% higher capital costs the rate of return would be 9.4%
in fuel alternative (a) and 21.6% in fuel alternative (b). If electricity
rates would be 20% higher the rate of return would exceed 25% in both fuel
alternatives.   The combinations of these different assumptions reflect the
fact that the rate of return of the Project is highly sensitive to variations
in fuel costs and electricity rates and less sensitive to increased capital costs.
