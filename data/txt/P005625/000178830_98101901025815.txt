TUNISIA: SECOND POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 1355-TUN)
PREFACE
The Project consisted of the supply, installation and commissioning
of seven self-contained combustion turbine-generator sets for which Loan
1355-TUN of US$14.5 mliion was made to Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et
du Gaz (STEG) in January 1977. The Loan Agreement became effective on May 4,
1977 and was closed on June 30, 1981. The Project Completion Report (PCR) was
prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office based on
the appraisal report and other documents in the Bank's files, a completion
report prepared by STEG and the findings of a Project completion mission which
visited Tunsia in July 1981.
The PCR analyzes the extent to which the physical and institutional
objectives of the Project, as envisaged at the time the loan was approved by
the Bank's Executive Directors, were attained and examines the role of the
Bank on connection with the Project in this light.
Following normal procedures, a draft copy of the report was sent to
the Borrower (STEG) and the Guarantor (Government) for their comments. STEG
has indicated that the report is satisfactory and they have no comments to
offer. The telex is reproduced as an Annex to the report.

TUNISIA
SECOND POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 1355-TUN)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Project consisting of the supply, installation and commissioning
of seven self-contained combustion turbine-alternator sets was intended to
ensure continuity of electricity supply after 1977 and to meet peak demand.
It also had as its objective the formulation of a least cost generation
expansion program, the continuation of the institution-building effort started
under the two previous loans, especially the improvement of the pricing policy
for oil, gas and electricity. All the Project objectives were fully achieved
except in regard to energy pricing where the study was not completed to the
required standard. However, a prime objective of the study has been achieved
inasmuch as energy prices have been raised significantly towards international
prices.
The Project was completed ahead of schedule on the basis of fixed
price contracts but the final cost was 12.3% above the estimate mainly because
the Project cost estimates had excluded custom duties and taxes on imported
equipment, and the cost of fuel for test runs (PCR para. 4.4).
The initial performance of the combustion turbines was not
satisfactory because of the inferior quality of the turbines, and the severe
duty operation of the units (PCR para. 5.1). Despite this and the fact that
actual sales and peak demand were about 2% higher than the forecast, STEG was
able to meet the system's demand, although at times with a very narrow margin
(PCR para. 5.5). In 1981, STEG and the manufacturer reached an agreement for
bringing the units to normal operation (PCR para 5.3). Presently the units
are operating satisfactorily.
Institutional performance under the Loan was excellent. Prices of
petroleum products and electricity tariffs were revised on a regular basis,
although with some lag between the dates of their implementation (PCR para.
6.2). Because of adequate tariff increases, STEG was able to finance from
internally generated funds a higher percentage of its investment program than
was estimated at appraisal (28% compared to 27%), including customers
contribution the self-financing level was 47% (PCR paras. 6.1 through 6.3).
STEG also revised the connection charges levied for electricity supply,
introduced a new organizational structure, implemented a staff training
program, introduced key indicators to monitor performance and an optimum
inventory management system, computerized its accounting and billing
operations and reduced its accounts receivable to a reasonable level (PCR
paras. 6.5 and 7.1 through 7.4). As a result of implementation of these
measures and thanks to an effective management team, STEG has developed into
an efficient utility.



As regards the rate of return on the Project, it is difficult to make
a meaningful comparison between the actual and estimated economic rates of
return. This is because the development of certain natural gas fields was
-postponed, and this led to the firing of some combustion turbines with gas oil
instead of gas from these fields, which was to be supplied at the cost of
production.
The Bank played a constructive role in the development of STEG, and
the rationalization of petroleum product pricing, showing flexibility where
needed (PCR paras. 6.3 and 9.1).



TUNISIA
SECOND POWER PROJECT (Loan 1355-TUN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1. Introduction
1.1      The Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG), a
Government-owned corporation created in 1962 to take over the operation of
seven private utility companies upon their nationalization, is responsible for
the production, transmission and distribution of electricity for public
consumption throughout the country. STEG is also responsible for gathering,
transporting and distributing associated and non-associated gas, and
manufacturing and distributing town gas in the city of Tunis, an activity that
accounted for about 6% of its total revenues at the time of appraisal (1976).
1.2      During its early years, STEG concentrated on integrating into a
single national power system the seven separate systems, and in 1976 its
generating capacity amounted to 367 MW, consisting of 29 MW hydroelectric, 218
MW steam turbines, 105 MW combustion turbines, and 15-MW diesel units, and another
2x31-MW combustion turbines were under construction. At that time the
Tunisian system was characterized by a pronounced peak and a relatively low
base load demand (the plant factor was 45% for steam units and 34% for
combustion turbines). Thus, STEG was faced with the need to meet the peak
demand which was forecast to increase at an average rate of about 12% per
year. After 1970, the corporation was able to embark on a systematic
expansion of the integrated national system and by 1981 its installed
generating capacity was increased seven-fold, the production of electricity
eight-fold, and the number of customers two and one half-fold, while improving
its management and financial position.
2. Bank Involvement in the Sector
2.1      During the period 1971-1981, the Bank made five loans to STEG (Loans
724-TUN, 815-TUN, 1355-TUN, 1864-TUN, and 2003-TUN) totalling US$112.5
million, out of which two were for its gas activities and three for power
projects. Details of these loans are given in Annex 1.
2.2      Under Loan 724-TUN made in 1971 to finance a gas pipeline and Loan
815-TUN made in 1972 to finance 2 x 20-MW combustion turbines, the following
issues were addressed:
(a) improvement of manpower utilization;
(b) collection of statistical and accounting information;
(c) creation of subsidiaries;



- 2 -
(d) maintenance of separate records for the capital and operating costs
of the gas pipeline;
(e) implementation by 1973 of comprehensive cost related electricity
tariffs based on the marginal cost concept;
(f) internal generation of funds in the power subsector to finance
expansion; and
(g) strenghthening of STEG's financial condition by limitation of
debt/equity ratio to 45:55.
2.3      STEG, with the assistance of consultants, restructured its
organization and decentralized its activities, improved the accounting system,
billing and collections, introduced budgetary controls and an internal audit
system, and implemented a cost-related tariff structure. The efficient
development of the power subsector in the seventies attests to the
justification for addressing the above issues in the two lending operations.
3. Project Preparation and Appraisal
3.1      Origin and Preparation of the Project:   During the period 1972-75,
various power projects were discussed by the Tunisian Government and the Bank
for possible Bank financing to meet the particular needs of various times.
These ranged from a rural electrification project to generation projects
(installation of 2x60-MW steam units or several combustion turbine units to
meet the rapidly growing power demand). However, for one reason or the other,
no decision was made on the type of project to be financed by the Bank.
3.2      In September 1975, the Tunisian Government requested Bank assistance
in financing a project having two components; (i) a generation component
consisting of the installation of 90 MW in combustion turbines; an. (ii) a
rural electrification component. At the same time, STEG informed the Bank for
the first time that it had considered the following two alternatives for the
development of its generation plant: (i) installation of 60-65 MW in
combustion turbines by 1980 followed by two 120-150-MW steam units by 1981;
and (ii) installation of one 60-MW steam unit by 1980, in lieu of the
combustion turbines, followed by four to five 60-MW steam units until 1984.
Common to both cases was the installation in 1977-1978 of 85-90 MW in
combustion turbines which was the only feasible option for meeting the rapidly
growing power demand within the available time frame, and 25 MW hydro in 1983
(Sidi Salem). It is noteworthy that the proposed installation of 90 MW in
combustion turbines could have been avoided had STEG followed the Bank's
advice in 1972 suggesting the installation of 60 MW in steam turbines to be
commissioned by 1976. A preappraisal mission visited Tunisia in December 1975
but was informed that financing of the rural electrification component had
already been arranged with Sweden.   Thus, the mission identified a project
with only a generation component.
3.3      Project Appraisal:   The Bank Project was the combustion turbine
component of STEG's 1977-1981 development program for generation facilities
and was prepared entirely by STEG. The Bank appraised the Project in June
1976.



-3    -
3.4      Negotiations, Approval and Effectiveness:   No major issues delayed
loan processing. Negotiations took place in November 1976 and agreement was
reached on the following important issues:
a)   Rate of Return Covenant
At the time of appraisal of Loan 815-TUN (1972) there were
uncertainties about the value of the assets on which the rate of
return would have to be based. It was also felt that fluctuations in
depreciation charges on account of commissioning of major assets
would cause temporary fluctuations in the return. Consequently, the
rate of return covenant was formulated by relating operating surplus
before depreciation to the overall gross fixed assets. Subsequently,
the value of STEG's assets was determined with accuracy, and a more
conventional rate of return covenant was formulated under the subject
loan, relating the operating surplus after depreciation to the
average net fixed assets in service. While the formula was changed,
the target rate was decreased from 8.5% to 8% beginning with 1977.
b)   Audit
Because of the delays experienced in previous years in closing the
accounts, the Tunisian delegation requested, and the Bank agreed,
that audited accounts be submitted five months after the end of the
fiscal year instead of four months as provided under Loan 815-TUN.
c)   Institutional Development
i)   Energy products were highly subsidized reflecting partly the
Government's policy to promote industrialization, e.g. fuel oil
supplied to STEG was priced at only 23% of the border price.
The impact of this subsidization on resource allocation in the
economy needed to be assessed with a view to formulating an
appropriate pricing strategy for petroleum products and
electricty. The Government agreed to undertake such an energy
pricing study;
ii)   About 22% of the sector investment was planned to be financed
through customer contributions. Whether or not this high level
of connection charges would inhibit demand growth and access to
electricity for poor consumers was not clear. Therefore, STEG
agreed to undertake a study of the level and application of
connection charges levied for electricity supply;
iii)   The introduction of offshore gas in the Tunisian market,
expected at that time to start in 1981, would require STEG to
construct and operate additional facilities for the transmission
and distribution of natural gas. In order to define these new
responsibilities, STEG agreed to undertake a study of its
organizational strucure, staff training needs, and the necessary
investments for the implementation of a program of transport and
distribution of natural gas throughout Tunisia; and
iv)   Development of a monitoring system followed by the introduction
of key performance indicators.



-4 -
The Board approved the loan of US$14.5 million on December 23, 1976.
The loan was expected to become effective by April 12, 1977; however, the date
was extended to May 31, 1977 to allow the Government and STEG time to comply
with the special condition of effectiveness, i.e., effectiveness of a loan of
about US$9.2 million to STEG by a consortium of private banks. The loan
actually became effective May 4, 1977.
3.5      Project Objectives:   The main objectives of the Project were to
ensure continuity ot electricity supply after 1977, to cover the need of peak
power capacity in the system for which no other suitable sources were
available, to formulate a least cost generation expansion program, and to
continue the institution-building effort started under the two previous loans.
Specifically, the institution-building effort aimed at improvement of STEG's
organization and operations by decentralizing its financial activity,
improvement of the accounting and billing system, introduction of budgetary
controls, and improvement of the pricing policy for oil, gas and electricity
(para. 3.4(d)).
3.6      Project Description:   The Project consisted of the supply,
installation and commissioning of 7x21.4-MW self contained units consisting of
a heavy duty open-cycle combustion turbine, generator and control equipment
housed in a mobile construction, and the transformer and switchgear to connect
the alternator to the grid. Of the seven combusion turbines, two were to be
fired with low heat natural gas from the recently discovered gas fields of
Sidi Agareb-Sidi Bhara (about 30 km west of Sfax), and the remaining five with
gas oil. The proposed locations and year of commissioning of the combustion
turbines were as follows:
- two units at Sfax, in 1977
- two units at Menzel Bourguiba, in 1978
- one unit each at Korba, Tunis-Sud, and Metlaoui, all to be
commissioned in 1980.
3.7      Covenants:  Annex 2 gives the major covenants of the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements and the status of compliance with them. The objectives
of the covenants have been substantially achieved as evidenced by timely
completion of the Project and STEG's improved efficiency.
4. Procurement, Project Implementation, Costs and Disbursements
4.1      Revisions:   There were no important changes in the project except
that the two units of Sfax had to be ordered for operation with gas oil
instead of natural gas, as the feasibility study of the Sidi Agareb-Sidi Bhara
gas fields did not justify their development at that time.
4.2      Procurement and Implementation:   After the preappraisal mission
(January 1976), STEG invited tenders, on the basis of international
competitive bidding, for the supply of 90 MW in combustion turbines with an
option for an additional 60 MW capacity. Bids were opened in April 1976,
about two months prior to the arrival of the appraisal mission, and a fixed
price contract for the supply of 7 x 22-MW units was awarded in June 1976 to a
foreign supplier who was the lowest evaluated bidder. The contract price was
16% lower than the estimate because the supplier was in fact proposing to
supply equipment that was being manufactured for an infructuous contract of



-5-
his. In order to take advantage of the favorable prices offered for a limited
term by the supplier, the Bank approved advanced contracting. Disbursements
were, however, conditional on the Bank being satisfied that the procurement
was conducted in accordance with the World Bank Group guidelines for
procurement.
4.3       The civil works for the five stations at which the
combustion turbines were installed were awarded to three local contractors,
also on the basis of fixed price contracts.
4.4       Costs and Disbursements:   A comparison of actual and estimated costs
and disbursements is given in Annexes 3 and 4. Although the project was
completed ahead of schedule on the basis of fixed price contracts, the final
total cost was 12.3% above the estimate (cost overruns were 62% in local
costs, and 4% in foreign costs). The main cause of the increase in local
costs was that custom duties and taxes on imported equipment, and the cost of
fuel used for test runs were not included in the appraisal estimate. The
increase in foreign costs was due entirely to the necessary mechanical changes
resulting from the change of fuel to be used for firing the units at Sfax.
4.5      From the beginning, disbursements were well ahead of the appraisal
estimate because of early supplies by the supplier. By June 30, 1979 i.e. two
years in advance of the closing date (June 30, 1981), about 94% of the loan
amount was disbursed, leaving only the retention money undisbursed.
Disbursements were completed by July 17, 1981, and the undisbursed balance of
about 3% ($98,349) resulting from exchange rate fluctuations was cancelled
effective October 20, 1981.
4.6      The gas turbines were put into commercial operation on the following
dates (with the contract commissioning dates in parentheses):
Sfax:    No 1 -   December 15, 1977 (10/30/77)
No 2 -  December 15, 1977 (10/30/77)
Menzel Bourguiba:     No I - September   2, 1978 (07/15/78)
No 2 -     August 11, 1978 (07/15/78)
Tunis Sud:     No 1 -   October 25, 1978 (08/15/78)
Metlaoui:     No 1 -      July 15, 1978 (07/30/78)
Korba:    No 1 -    November 8, 1978 (08/15/78)
Except for the unit at Metlaoui, which was put into commercial operation 15
days ahead of schedule, commissioning of the remaining units was slightly late
(varying from 27 to 85 days) mainly due to delays in the completion of civil
works. However, the delays did not affect the power supply situation as the
commissioning was still 18 months ahead of STEG's original time-table (150 MW
by 1980).

5. Operating Performance
5.1      The operating performance of these combustion turbines has not been
satisfactory because of the inferior quality of the turbines, a condition
which was aggravated by their severe duty operation. Test runs of the
combustion turbines were not trouble free, and major mechanical and minor
electrical problems were manifest in six units both before, and after their
commercial operation (see Annex 5). In fact, all except one unit (the one at
Metlaoui which experienced only minor teething troubles in the run-up periods)
developed major mechanical problems including difficult start-ups, blow-off of
flame, vibration in the reduction gear, oil leak from the alternator end
bearing, seepage of rain water through the air filters into the alternator
compartment, and malfunctioning of flow divider and fuel pump. The
manufacturer rectified all the minor electrical problems and some of the major
mechanical problems; however the turbines developed the following major
defects within the warranty period: (i) rupture of turbine blades in the
high-pressure stage; (ii) cracking of blades in the low-pressure stage; and
(iii) premature corrosion of turbine hot part. In all cases, the warranty
periods were extended appropriately, and various meetings were held between
STEG and the supplier with a view to determining the cause of the problems and
agreeing on a plan of action to rectify the defects.
5.2      After inspection of all units by a joint team, STEG and the supplier
agreed at a meeting in March 1981 that the high level of non-availability of
the units of up to 39% (Annex 6), compared to the normal level of less than
10%, was due to:
(i) manufacturing defects in certain parts;
(ii) severe duty operation of the units leading to excessive wear and tear
and breakdown; and
(iii) non-availability of spare parts either with the supplier or with STEG
as a consequence of the maintenance and repair contract between the
supplier and STEG. Since maintenance and repairs were the
responsibility of the supplier, STEG carried a lower-than-
recommended level of spare parts inventory, while the supplier also
did not carry an adequate level of spares for fear of locking up
capital and therefore could not supply off-the-shelf a number of
spare parts.
5.3      Since both parties were responsible for the unsatisfactory
performance of the units, STEG and the supplier agreed that the latter would
bring the units to normal operation by September 30, 1981, and meet 82% of the
total foreign cost of the operation (FF 8.25 million), while STEG would meet
the balance of the foreign cost (FF 1.75 million) and the total local cost.
However, the agreed scope of work has not yet been completed because of the
dispatch of incorrect type of spares by the supplier. It is anticipated that
the work would be completed by August 1982.
5.4      Since the maintenance and repair agreement is not conducive to
efficient operation of the units, STEG and the supplier agreed to dissolve the
contract. Future maintenance and repairs will be conducted by STEG. For this
purpose, qualified staff from STEG's personnel are being trained by the
supplier, and adequate quantities of spare parts have already been ordered.



-7-
5.5      A comparison between appraisal forecast and actuals of generation
(GWh), sales, maximum demand and load factor is given in Annex 7. Annex 8
compares appraisal forecast and actual generation and fuel consumption. Annex
7 shows that generation, sales and peak demand increased at a slightly higher
average annual rate than anticipated (14.8% compared to 13%, 15.4% compared to
13.5%, and 13.4% compared to 12.3% respectively), while the load factor
remained unchanged at the 1976 level of 55% compared to the projected 57%.
The excess generation was taken up by steam plants (Annex 8). Although the
overall forecast demand was close to actuals, sales to industrial consumers
increased faster than estimated (16.3% p.a. compared to 13% p.a.), while sales
to low voltage consumers who are predominantly domestic, increased slower than
estimated (13.5% p.a. compared to 14.5% p.a.), showing that domestic consumers
are more sensitive than industrial consumers to tariff increases (the Tunisian
price control system permits industries to pass on to consumers any increase
in production cost). Annex 8 shows that overall there were only small
deviations between forecast and actual generation mix during the period
1976-1981, while on a yearly basis the deviations were significant depending
on the needs of the system and unit availability.
6. Financial Performance
6.1      Rate of Return:   Prior to appraisal of the subject Project, STEG
achieved the covenanted rate of return of 8.5% without requiring large tariff
increases (between 1972 and 1976, only one tariff increase of about 16% was
implemented in 1975) mainly because of the following:
(i)  the growth in sales and therefore of revenues was significantly
faster than the increase in investments; and
(ii)  STEG enjoyed a substantial fuel subsidy (in 1976 STEG was paying
about 23% of international prices for fuels consumed; this subsidy
was estimated at about 22% of total operating expenses).
6.2      Beginning in 1977, Government moved decisively towards eliminating
subsidies in the economy. During 1977-1982, six fuel price increases were
introduced: fuel oil prices increased on the average at about 35% p.a.; and
diesel oil prices at 16% p.a. Since these price increases were allowed to be
passed on to electricity consumers, they experienced regular tariff
increases.   Electricity tariffs not only kept pace with inflation but
increased at the rate of 3.2% p.a. in real terms. Specifically, tariffs were
raised by 20% in 1977, 12% in 1978, 15% in 1980, 8% in February 1981 and again
26% in September 1981. However, tariff increases were not implemented
simultaneously with fuel price increases. The lag between fuel price
increases and tariff increases made it difficult for STEG to meet the
covenanted 8% rate of return. During the period 1977-1980, STEG achieved a
rate of return on unrevalued assets of 7.5% in 1977, 7.4% in 1978, 8.5% in
1979 and 7.9% in 1980. A comparison of actual financial results and appraisal
estimates is given in Annexes 9 to 11.
6.3      Although the Loan Agreement required STEG to value its assets "from
time to time in accordance with consistently applied appropriate methods of
valuation or revaluation acceptable to the Bank," it was left to the
discretion of STEG to select the methodology and timing for revaluation of
assets. In fact, STEG did not revalue its assets because a high proportion of



-8 -
these assets had been recently added, and because the corporation claimed that
Tunisian law did not recognize such revaluation. Calculated on revalued
assets, STEG achieved a rate of return of 5.6% in 1977, 5.4% in 1978, 6.6% in
1979, and 5% in 1980. Nevertheless, during the period 1977-1980 STEG was able
to finance from internally generated funds (after meeting the working capital
and debt service requirements) 28% of its investment program compared to 27%
estimated at appraisal. Including customers contribution, the self-financing
level was 47.2% against 49% estimat d at appraisal. Hence, the real objective
of the covenant, namely, internal cash generation to cover a reasonable
proportion of STEG's expansion requirements was substantially met.
6.4      Debt to Equity Ratio:   The debt/equity ratio was maintained below the
45/55 level and therefore, as agreed under the loan covenant, it was not
necessary for STEG to obtain the Bank's approval before incurring any new debt.
6.5      Working Capital and Accounts Receivable:   As expected at appraisal,
STEG's working capital position remained tight throughout the project period
and its current liabilities consistently exceeded current assets. Because of
the smooth functioning of the computerized billing system and the stringent
collection policy, STEG was able to substantially reduce its overdue accounts
receivable from the equivalent 145 days' revenues at the end of 1975 to 84
days' revenues at the end of 1980. However, the financially troubled company
SOTEMI, municipalities and Governmental departments have still outstanding
arrears.
6.6      Audit:  From 1974 through 1979, STEG's accounts were audited by a
foreign firm of chartered accountants. In an effort to bring a fresh look at
its accounts, STEG appointed another auditing firm to audit its 1980
accounts. However, the audit report prepared by the new firm has been
considered by STEG to be below standard, and therefore, another auditing firm
is being appointed to audit its 1981 accounts. A short list of five firms is
being prepared and selection of the auditor was expected late in April 1982.
As regards promptness in preparing the accounts, STEG has had difficulty in
closing the accounts in a timely manner and therefore audited accounts have in
the past been submitted to the Bank with one to two months' delay.
7. Management Performance
7.1      Management and Organizational Effectiveness:    Thanks to the
implementation of measures instituted as part of the institution-building
effort under the three Bank loans for the power sector, STEG has developed
into an efficient utility fulfilling its appointed role in the subsector. The
credit for this should go mainly to the effective management team that has
guided STEG during this period and to the Government which has created the
right operating climate for STEG's operations and taken appropriate measures
for ensuring its financial viability. Some of the specific measures taken to
strengthen STEG are discussed below.
7.2      As required under the Loan Agreement, STEG undertook the study of its
organizational structure, training needs of its staff, and investment
requirements for the transport and distribution of natural gas. A well-known
firm of management consultants was appointed to review STEG's organizational
structure. The study, completed with some delay, recommended the
reorganization of STEG to improve its efficiency and to decentralize



-  9  -
responsibility at the district level. Most of the recommendations of the
study were implemented, and the performance indicators established as a result
of this study are being used successfully as management tools. A Tunisian
consulting firm with technical assistance from two expatriate firms was hired
to conduct a study on the optimum inventory management and analysis of
existing procurement procedures. The recommendations of this study have been
implemented and the expected benefits stemming from the reduction of the level
of inventory are becoming noticeable. STEG has also studied its training
needs and for the past four years it has been preparing, on a yearly basis, a
training program and implementing it with considerable success. The study of
the necessary investments for the implementation of a program of transport and
distribution of natural gas throughout Tunisia was undertaken by another
expatriate firm of consultants, but the recommendations of this study have not
yet been used because the development of the off-shore gas field of Miskar has
been postponed.
7.3      The study of connection charges (para. 4.3 (d)(ii)) recommended that
a distinction be made between two categories of service connections, single
phase and three phase, and as a result of this change, all customers of each
category who are not further than 30 meters from the grid now pay uniform
charges. On the average, the new connection charges are lower than those
charged earlier. However, connection charges are reviewed annually to ensure
that they are appropriate as conditions change.
7.4      As required under the Guarantee Agreement, the Government appointed a
foreign firm to conduct the energy pricing study. The scope of the study was
subsequently expanded and it became an energy master plan study including
pricing policy. Due to inadequate input data and the poor performance of the
consultant, completion of the study was delayed, and in fact before the work
was completed the consultant declared bankruptcy. The study was, however,
continued by another consulting firm which prepared a preliminary report, but
of very poor quality. The Tunisian Government rejected the dubious
conclusions of this report and all efforts to complete this study have been
abandoned. Since both the Government and the consultant were in breach of
contractual agreements, the matter was not pursued any further and no suit was
filed against the consultant. However, the scope of the energy study
initiated under USAID financing in 1981 has been expanded to include the area
covered by the aborted study and a comprehensive report which would draw, to
the extent possible, on the preliminary report prepared by the consultants
should be completed by 1984.
7.5      Institutional Development:   Like most newly created power entities in
developing countries, STEG has evolved rapidly from a small, urban-based power
company into a mature national institution with country-wide operations and
expertise in various fields. Most of the tasks which initally required
outside assistance are now performed by STEG's own staff. To mention a few:
preparation of feasibility studies for rural electrification, updating of the
tariff study, preparation of least cost development programs, evaluation of
bids, and various studies involving management control system, organization,
standardization of distribution equipment, and socio-economic studies.     STEG
is also heavily involved in the field of renewable energy: (i) experimenting
on the Hamam Biadha photovoltaic solar scheme with the assistance of NASA
under USAID financing; (ii) implementing the solar scheme of Borj Cedria
jointly with the Ministry of Education and Research; and (iii) collecting data



- 10 -
and selecting the site for a wind energy scheme, the financing of which is
partly met by USAID. Preliminary work is being undertaken on assessing the
potential for geothermal and micro-hydro sources and the nuclear option is
being considered for introduction by 1995.
7.6      Financially, STEG has reached a relatively strong position with
access to the international capital market. Its first ever borrowing from
foreign commercial banks for investment was for the subject project. Since
then, STEG has secured many loans from foreign commercial banks.
7.7      Although STEG's planning capabilities, financial viability, and
credit worthiness have improved considerably in the last four years, its
investment decisions are often dictated by its ability to finance the program
rather than by the intrinsic merits of the investment from a technical
viewpoint. The action of deferring the construction of steam units in
adequate capacity is a case in point. STEG has continued to suffer from the
impact of deferring the construction of steam units and it is now faced with
the need to install an additional 150 MW in combustion turbines to meet the
demand until the next steam unit is commissioned in 1985. However, the latest
addition in combustion turbines is not as disastrous as it would appear to be,
because within the next 5 years the old units are schedulled for retirement,
and the system still has to face a pronounced peak load.
8. Project Justification
8.1      Rate of Return: During appraisal, the rate of return on the Project
was calculated on the basis that the two units installed at Sfax would be
fired with flared gas from the Sidi Agareb and Sidi Behara oil fields, whose
economic cost was assumed to be negligible. However, the Government decided
to postpone development of these fields to a later date, and consequently all
units were fired with gas oil. Thus, in the ex-post calculation of the rate
of return, the fuel cost is considerably higher than the capital cost of the
pipeline which was taken into account in the ex-ante calculation of the rate
of return. In addition, the benefits attributed to the Project were
overstated because the costs associated with transmission and distribution
were not taken into account. Therefore, a meaningful comparison of the
ex-post and ex-ante return on the Project is not possible.
8.2      The economic return on power projects is not a measure of their
justification, but instead is a measure of the adequacy of tariffs in
reflecting the economic cost of supply. It is more consistent with power
systems operations in calculating the return on investments to take the entire
development program over a period of time rather than isolate a component from
the system. Therefore, for the calculation of the ex-post return, the time
slice of STEG's investment program between 1976 and 1981 has been taken (Annex
12). The rate of return on this basis is 2.1% which demonstrates the
divergence between the economic cost and actual tariffs charged by STEG
(tariffs are about 75% of their economic cost of supply).
8.3      Although STEG's economic rate of return on its 1976-1981 development
program is low (2.1%), the corporation was able to finance about 22% of its
investment program from internally generated funds during this period. This
was possible because STEG is not charged international prices for fuels used
for generation (para 3.3 (d)), and because STEG bears only the transportation
and distribution expenses associated with the El Borma gas wich accounts for
about 35% of the corporation's total fuel used for power generation.



9. Bank Performance
9.1      During the period 1972-1976, the Bank on the one hand and Government
and STEG on the other held divergent views on the priorities of power
development. Constrained by financial resources, the Tunisians advocated the
less capital intensive generation expansion strategy involving the
installation of combustion turbines instead of steam units recommended by the
Bank. Attempts at reconciling the two points of view proved fruitless and
this might have somewhat soured the relations between the Tunisians and the
Bank for a while. However, in spite of the short notice given (request for
Bank assistance was made in September 1975), the Bank mounted a preappraisal
mission in December 1975, and appraised the project in June 1976.
9.2      From the time of appraisal the relations between the Bank and the
Tunisians have been excellent.
9.3      The Bank identified the right issues at appraisal and provided
appropriate covenants to ensure action. This is borne out by STEG's present
efficiency of operations, financial strength, and the Government's actions to
achieve rational energy pricing.
10. Conclusions
10.1     The project was successfully completed and in spite of the technical
problems encountered in the operation of the combustion turbines, the project
achievements exceeded the overall expectations at appraisal except in regard
to energy pricing. Even in regard to energy pricing, although the study
itself has not been completed to the required standard, significant progress
has been made in increasing energy prices to international prices which was
one of the prime objectives of the study. Briefly, the achievements of the
Project are as follows;
(a) the demand through 1981 was satisfactorily met, with in fact greater
reliability of supply, although the actual rate of growth exceeded
the forecast;
(b) adequate reserves of plant are now available to meet emergencies;
(c) significant progress towards rationalization of energy prices, thus
greatly reducing the burden imposed by the fund subsidies on the
budget. For example, the domestic fuel oil price is now 74% of the
border price compared to 23% at appraisal!/;
(d) electricity tariffs have been increased to levels which enable STEG
to finance more than 45% (including customers' contribution) of its
current development program from revenues;
(e) rationalization of connection charges to reflect STEG's real cost of
connecting its customers to the system;
1/ Mediterranean average spot market price in January 1982
was US$163/ton (TD 87.5/ton).



- 12 -
(f) reorganization of STEG and opening of more district offices to
improve the quality of customer service; and
(g) establishment of a systematic training program enabling STEG to
operate the system with very little need of consulting services.
11. Lessons To Be Learned
11.1     There are two main lessons to be learned from this lending operation:
(a) in cases where combustion turbines are called upon as an expedient
means to meet the urgent load needs of a system and there are
indications that the units would be operated under a severe
dispatching schedule (more than one start-up per day, or operation
exceeding 1,500 hours per year at base load rating or 1,000 hours per
year at peak load rating) provision for the supply of ample spare
parts (well above the recommended security stock) should be made. In
instances where the owner does not already have plant of a similar
type or is unlikely to be able to provide an adequate supply of spare
parts, a comprehensive contract for the supply of spare parts and
provision of expert staff can be used provided the responsibilities
and obligations of the contractor are spelled out in detail and
both the owner and the contractor adhere to the terms and conditions
of the contract; and
(b) by encouraging borrowers to secure financing from private commercial
banks, the Bank could help open up for borrowers private commercial
finance as a significant source of cofinancing for their investment
programs. This has been demonstrated by the success of STEG in
attracting a considerable amount of financing from commercial banks
since it obtained a private commercial loan for the subject project
in 1977.

COMPLETION REPORT
Assumptions in Rate of Return Calculation
Fuel Costs
Border prices of fuels have been used. Fuel consumption, border
prices and fuel cost is as follows:
------ Gas Oil            ----- Fuel Oil -----       Fuel Cost
Consumption     Price    Consumption     Price
(tons 1,000)    TD/ton   (tons 1,000)    TD/ton     TD 1,000
1978           53.7       59.9           -            -         3,217
1979          110.3       85.2           -             -        9,397
1980           65.9      122.5         143.2         68.1      17,825
1981           18.2      169.1         258.6         96.8      28,110
1982           35.5      169.1         338.2         96.8      38,741
1983           35.5      169.1         419.7         96.8      46,630
1984           35.5      169.1         452.7         96.8      49,824
From 1982 onwards it was assumed that the units financed under this loan would
be used as reserve and peaking units and that the plant factor would be about
5%. Fuel prices during the period 1982-1986 were assumed to remain at the
1981 level. The actual specific consumptions (370 gr/kWh for GT and 250
gr/kWh for steam) have been used.
Operating and Maintenance Costs
The operating and maintenance costs used are:
(a) TD 50,000 per year at stations having two combustion turbine units.
(b) TD 30,000 per year at stations having one combustion turbine unit.
(c) TD 300,000 per year for one steam unit and TD 400,000 for two units.
(d) For transmission, 2% per year of total capital cost.
(e) For distribution, 4% per year of total capital cost.
Deflator
The factors used are the cost of living indices from 1976 to 1981
(base 1976 = 100) published by the Central Bank of Tunisia.

Generation
Up to 1981 the actual output of the units was taken. From 1982
onwards the generation mix is assumed to be as below:
Combustion

1982          103.0    1,252.3
1983          103.0    1,576.8
1984          103.0    1,708.2
Losses
Generation losses of 3.6% for GT and 8% for steam, and transmission
and distribution losses of 13% have been used.
Tariff
