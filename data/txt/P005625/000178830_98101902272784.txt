REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO SOCIETE TUNISIENNE DE L'ELECTRICITE ET DU
GAZ WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A SECOND POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Societe Tunisienne de I'Electricite et du Gaz with the guarantee of the
Republic of Tunisia, for the equivalent of US$14.5 million to help finance a
second power project. The loan would have a term of 14 years, including 2-1/2
years of grace, with interest at 8.7 percent per annum. Additional financing
of about $9.2 million for the project would be provided by a consortium of
private banks. Their loan is expected to have a term of about eight years,
with interest at 7 1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economic Development of Tunisia:    A Basic
Report" was distributed to the Executive Directors in January 1975. Since
then, two updating economic reports, both entitled "Memorandum on the Economic
Position of Tunisia", were circulated on May 23, 1975 and September 17, 1976.
The main conclusions of the basic economic report and the updating missions
are reflected below. Country data sheets are attached in Annex 1.
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered by scarcity of natural re-
sources. Much of the country is arid or semi-arid, and agriculture is highly
dependent on rainfall. Minerals are mostly of low quality and, apart from
phosphates, limited in quantity. Relatively small quantities of petroleum
were discovered in the mid-1960's and have since become an increasingly
valuable source of revenue and export earnings. Industrial development has
been handicapped by the small size of the domestic market as well as a lack
of skills and experience. Tourism has developed rapidly and workers' remit-
tances have become a significant item in the balance of payments. Tunisia
has enjoyed a large amount of external aid and used it to expand economic
and social infrastructure, broaden the industrial base, make available a wide
range of social and welfare services to a large part of the population, and
increase the rate of growth. Per capita GNP increased by 4.2 percent annually
from 1961 to 1975. Like most countries, however, Tunisia has not yet found
adequate ways to cope with unemployment and poverty and to achieve a balanced
distribution of consumption among income groups, between urban and rural
areas, and among regions.
4.        Government strategy in the 1960's relied heavily on central plan-
ning of investment and resource allocation, with the public sector playing a
major role in production as well as providing infrastructure and services.
Foreign exchange shortages and concern with inflation led to recourse to a
pervasive system of price determination and controls. An unusually long

series of poor crop years due to shortage of rainfall slowed the growth of
output. Many of the investments in public enterprises proved to be un-
economic and private initiative in most sectors except tourism and petroleum
was limited.
5.        The Government's present development strategy was introduced in the
early 1970's. Its principal objectives are: (a) accelerating growth based on
export-oriented industries, by encouraging private initiative, reducing direct
Government involvement in production and relaxing administrative regulations;
(b) creating jobs, primarily in the expanding industrial sector, encouraging
worker emigration, reducing population growth and improving education and
training; and (c) maintaining internal and external financial stability. The
1973-76 Fourth Plan set a target rate of GDP growth of 7 percent, providing
for a 5.4 percent growth rate in per capita private consumption. Investment
was projected to increase by 80 percent above the level of the 1969-72 Plan.
National savings were to finance three-quarters of investment. Exports of
goods and services were projected to grow at 8.8 percent per year at constant
prices and imports at 12.2 percent. The Plan foresaw net external capital
inflows increasing by 55 percent over 1969-1972 average levels and providing
23.5 percent of total investment. Debt service was to be held to below 20
percent of exports. The original Plan targets were conservative in terms
of both growth and savings potential, particularly in view of the favorable
impact of the changed petroleum and phosphate prices on the Tunisian economy
(paras. 9 and 10).
6.        The real growth of GDP has accelerated since 1970, reaching 9.6
percent per annum during the period 1970-75, compared with 4.6 percent during
the previous decade. The acceleration can be attributed partly to fortuitous
factors such as good weather, leading to record cereal and olive crops, partly
to important growth in tourism, petroleum and phosphate revenues and workers'
remittances, and also to the general reorientation of Government policy since
1970, which renewed self-confidence and initiative in the private sector. Ex-
pansion of manufacturing and phosphate production has been significant. By
1975, per capita GNP reached $760 (1976 Bank Atlas estimate). Investment
remained high in relation to GDP - 22 percent in 1970-75 compared to 23 per-
cent during the 1960s - while national savings rose sharply from an average
of 13.5 percent of GDP at current prices during the 1960's to 19 percent
during 1970-75.   Consequently, the share of external borrowing in financing
investment dropped from 44 percent in the 1960's to 13 percent during 1970-75.
7.        The balance of payments was in overall surplus from 1967 to 1974 and
since late 1973 benefitted greatly from sharply improved terms-of-trade. How-
ever, in 1975 the terms of trade began to deteriorate, the demand for Tunisian
exports sharply decreased, and despite substantial disbursements on external
borrowing, international reserves declined by 11 percent. At the end of 1975,
net reserves amounted to $344 million, equivalent to about 3 months of imports.
8.        Tunisia has maintained relative price stability, thanks to prudent
fiscal and monetary policies and a skillful use of price controls and of price

subsidies for basic consumer goods. Consumer price increases averaged 4.2
percent annually during 1970-74. There was, however, a 9.6 percent increase
in consumer prices in 1975, largely because of increased export and import
prices. During 1970-74, the official GDP deflator rose at an average annual
rate of 8.9 percent and average investment costs increased by 9.6 percent.
The increases in these two price indices in 1975 were 5.2 percent and 14
percent, respectively.
9.        Despite the terms-of-trade loss in 1975, Tunisia still is on balance
a beneficiary of the changes in world market prices since late 1973, but this
favorable situation will probably change in later years. MIainly because of
sharply higher prices for petroleum, phosphates and olive oil, export earnings
rose from $714 million in 1973 to $1,254 million in 1974 and $1,328 million in
1975. On the other hand, increases in import prices, combined with higher
domestic demand, caused payments on imports to grow from $782 million in 1973
to $1,242 million in 1974 and to $1,525 million in 1975. The gains from
changes in terms of trade since 1973 are projected to disappear around 1978
or 1979, as a result of the expected stabilization or decrease in the prices
of Tunisia's major exports, and further increases in the prices of imported
industrial goods. At the same time, workers' remittances may continue to be
restrained by slower economic growth in W4estern Europe. Taking into account
likely capital inflows through direct investment and external aid, the level
of net reserves is projected to be equivalent to about 2.4 months of imports
at the end of 1976 and to remain at this level during the remainder of the
decade, when the balance of payments may reemerge as a serious constraint
on Tunisia's development.
10.       The recent changes in Tunisia's balance of payments position and
in Government savings do not call for a substantial revision in development
strategy. They suggest rather that Tunisia should continue its efforts to
achieve high investment and GDP growth rates. Since workers' emigration to
Europe and Libya is now limited, the effort to increase investment, particu-
larly in labor-intensive industry and agriculture, should be increased. With
an adequate savings level and continuing external aid, the Tunisian economy
has the financial resources that should enable it to sustain an average an-
nual growth rate of between 7 and 8 percent during 1976-81. The level of
future growth would also depend on continuing efforts to stimulate private
investment, to increase the international competitiveness of industry, and
to improve the planning and implementation of public investments.
11.       Tunisia has made impressive social gains.     By 1974, primary school
enrollment had reached 96 percent, and secondary enrollment, 20 percent, of
the relevant age-groups. Public health services have been greatly expanded
with many provided free. A family planning program has been introduced.
Total social expenditures during 1970-75 increased by about 10 percent per
annum and on average accounted for 9 percent of GDP and for 30 percent of
total public expenditures. Nonetheless, major social issues remain. Further



- 4 -
progress is needed in land reform and in creating employment. The unemploy-
ment rate was estimated at 18 percent in the non-agricultural sectors in
1975, and underemployment in the rural sector is high. There has been a
growing concentration of productive activities in a few urban areas, espe-
cially in Tunis.
12.       So far as can be judged from available data, there has been a
gradual improvement in income distribution. During the 1960's, real incomes
increased in all sectors but by a higher percentage in the modern sector than
in the rural sector, due partly to the series of poor harvests. In the modern
sector, especially in industry, increases in real incomes in the 1960's ex-
ceeded the rise in productivity; the income distribution trends favored in-
dustrial workers. Thanks especially to the income redistribution efi-ects of
free social services, the proportion of the total population living in poverty
was substantially reduced during the decade. About 90 percent of the poverty
group lived in rural areas. Since 1970, higher agricultural output, increases
in minimum agricultural wages, tax exemptions for low incomes, the inflow of
workers' remittances from abroad and the stabilization of basic commodity
prices through Government subsidies seem to have improved the absolute, and
possibly also the relative, position of the poorest social groups. [n rural
areas substantial income disparities remain, in part as a result of the
structure of land tenure.
13.       During 1970-75, agriculture provided nearly half of total employ-
ment, 29 percent of merchandise exports and 19 percent of GDP. Food process-
ing accounted for another 3 percent of GDP and over a third of value added in
manufacturing. During this period agricultural production rose substantially,
largely as a result of favorable weather. The potential for further growth
is clear. While large infrastructure investments were made during the 1960's,
current policy has emphasized projects that make a rapid and direct contribu-
tion to production and recognized various constraints on agricultural develop-
ment: absentee ownership, insecurity of tenure, inadequate access to agricul-
tural credit, inadequate extension services, insufficient agricultural educa-
tion, and underutilization of irrigation investments. Under the Fourth Plan,
more than $140 million was allocated to a rural development program executed
by the provincial administrations.
14.       During the 1960's, manufacturing production in Tunisia increased
by 8 percent annually. There has been a remarkable acceleration of growth in
the 1970's due in part to record years for the olive oil processing industry
and to favorable developments in the textile and chemical industries. The
early thrust of industrialization was supplied by large import substitution
projects in the state sector. These suffered, however, from the limited
domestic market and shortages of experienced staff and management. Mlore
emphasis has been put on export-oriented private industries since 1970.
Under the Fourth Plan, private manufacturing investment, particularly in food
processing, textiles, fertilizers and metals transformation, was expected to
average D 25 million per year, compared with D 12 million in 1972, and to



- 5 -
account for two-thirds of total investment in manufacturing; these targets
have been exceeded. Foreign and domestic private investment is now stimulated
by a comprehensive incentive framework, and facilitated by the streamlined
approval procedures of the investment promotion agency. Foreign investors
are expected to contribute know-how and overseas marketing. A new agreement
between Tunisia and the European Community was signed in April 1976. It
provides for duty-free entry into the countries of the Community of nearly all
Tunisian industrial products. The Government has established a special fund
to encourage growth of small industries and industrial decentralization, and
has started a program to establish industrial estates.
15.       The development of tourism in Tunisia is relatively recent.    Foreign-
visitor arrivals reached a level of 780,000 in 1972, with an annual rate of
growth over the period 1961-1972 of 30 percent -- higher than that of any
other Mediterranean country. While 1973 saw a drop in the number of visitor
nights, and 1974 registered another overall drop, there was a very strong
recovery in 1975, with over one million visitor arrivals. Since 1970, earn-
ings from tourism have been a major source of foreign exchange, having reached
$300 million in 1975. The rapid development of tourism in Tunisia has unfortu-
nately been accompanied by an inadequate development of infrastructure (par-
ticularly recreational facilities), shortages of trained manpower and inade-
quate services. The Government is endeavoring to alleviate these constraints
through a variety of measures, including revised investment incentives, in-
creased marketing and training efforts, codes to enforce quality standards
and more stringent zoning laws.
16.       Since the early 1960's Tunisia has obtained relatively large amounts
of official aid. A Consultative Group provides a forum for aid-coordination
among major donors (see para. 25). During 1970-74, annual loan commitments
from public sources averaged $136 million, or about $26 per capita.    About 69
percent of these commitments came from bilateral public sources, chiefly from
France (14 percent), the United States (13 percent), and the Federal Republic
of Germany (11 percent). About 12 percent came from oil-producing countries,
whose share rapidly increased from 8 percent in 1970 to 26 percent in 1974.
Commitments from the Bank Group during 1970-74 accounted for 29 percent of
total public commitments. Most aid has been obtained on concessionary terms:
during 1970-74, the average terms of borrowing from bilateral sources were
3.5 percent interest and 23 years to maturity, including 6 years of grace;
from multilateral sources, they were 6.0 percent interest and 26 years to
maturity, including 5 years of grace. During the same period Tunisia also
received annually some $40 million in grants. Loan commitments from private
sources average $32 million a year. Direct foreign private investment has
been comparatively small, but recently it has picked up momentum following
increased activity in the petroleum sector and new incentives offered to
foreign investors in manufacturing. Thus, net direct foreign investment
increased from $19 million in 1970 to $76 million in 1975.
17.       Tunisia's total public debt outstanding (including undisbursed) in-
creased from $846 million at the end of 1970 to $1,444 million at the end of
1974 and an estimated $1,700 million at the end of 1975.    The disbursed portion



- 6 -
outstanding at the end of 1974 was $956 million, equivalent to 27 percent of
GDP, compared with 40 percent in 1970; it is estimated at $1,160 milLion at
the end of 1975. Debt service payments in 1975 were 7.8 percent of export
earnings compared with 19.5 percent in 1970.    This significant decline in the
debt service ratio was mainly due to the sharp increase in export earnings
following the changes in world market prices in 1973 and 1974; it also
reflected reduced borrowing abroad, and Government efforts to change the
structure of the foreign debt. In the future, Tunisia will have to continue
to rely heavily on foreign financial assistance in order to reach its develop-
ment goals. While Tunisia is capable of servicing substantial additional debt
on less concessionary terms than in the past, it nonetheless should continue
to seek a large part of its external resources on concessionary terms in order
to maintain the debt service at a manageable level in the long run.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONIS IN TUNISIA
18.       Since 1962, Tunisia has received a total of twenty-six loans and ten
credits amounting respectively to $326.9 million and $70.1 million, net of
cancellations and refundings. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
Loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of October 31, 1976, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects.
19.       The Bank's lending strategy aims at supporting Government efforts
to (a) increase employment, (b) encourage more balanced growth and distribu-
tion of income among regions and income groups, and (c) promote export-
oriented policies and investments. The key supporting feature of this lend-
ing strategy is to encourage the Tunisian authorities in timely and well-coordi-
nated preparation of projects, with emphasis on technical assistance. The
Bank is also cooperating with the Government in its efforts to increase the
mobilization of domestic and foreign resources, in part through encouraging
project co-financing; the latter is particularly important in view of the
extent of Tunisia's external resource needs, the large scale of many priority
projects, and the limited availability of Bank resources. This latter effort
is a prime objective of the proposed project (see para. 38) and is also
supported through the Consultative Group (see para. 25).
20.       Within this broad framework, past Bank Group lending has emphasized
support for long-term investments in infrastructure and social development.
Lending for urban and social development, including water supply, education,
family planning and the Tunis urban planning and public transport project has
accounted for 33 percent of Bank/IDA commitments in Tunisia. Lendirng for
transport, power and tourism infrastructure has accounted for a further 33
percent. Agriculture and fisheries have received 12 percent of total commit-
ments. Industrial and hotel financing through the Banque de Developpement
Economique de Tunisie (BDET) has accounted for 16 percent, and the GAFSA
phosphate development project received 6 percent of total commitments. While
there have been some problems, project implementation on the whole has been
satisfactory. In a number of sectors, important institutional improvements
have been achieved and independent agencies have been created or strengthened.



- 7 -
21.       In agriculture, Bank involvement in several sub-sectors has met in
some cases with success, in others with difficulties. The first agricultural
project financed by the Bank Group was the 1967 Cooperative Farm Project,
completed in 1973 after substantial delays and revisions causecd by changes in
Government agricultural policy in 1969. The First Agricultural Credit Project
(Loan/Credit 779/263-TUN, $8 million, of 1971) should be fully disbursed by
the end of 1976. A 1971 IDA-financed Fisheries Project (Credit 270-TUN, $2
million), aimed at development of Tunisia's inshore fisheries, is expected to
be fully disbursed in 1977. A loan for an Irrigation Rehabilitation Project
(Loan 1069-TUN, $12.2 million) became effective in September 1975; project
execution is in its early stages. The Bank has also attempted to play a more
active role in rural development in Tunisia, but no specific project in this
field has as yet materialized. Our experience to date has, however, served to
underline the necessity for very close coordination and careful preparation of
future projects in this difficult but high priority sphere.
22.       Lending in the current fiscal year and the period ahead will seek to
approach the problems of rural and regional development increasingly through
an emphasis on projects promoting agricultural and industrial production, such
as the Second Agricultural Credit Project recently approved by the Executive
Directors, and urban and social development. Complementary to this primary
focus, the program would also finance selected priority projects in infra-
structure, particularly in power, such as the project proposed in this report,
and in roads. The project proposed in this report meets the latter criterion,
as it would contribute to ensuring continuity of electricity supply and would
strengthen the institutional framework of the power sector. The Sidi Salem
Multi-purpose project, also to be processed in the current fiscal year, would
support the first phase of execution of the Water Master Plan for Northern
Tunisia, consisting of: (i) construction of the Sidi Salem dam and reservoir
providing water for potable, industrial and irrigation purposes; (ii) con-
struction of an interconnection canal to Tunis and the Cap Bon Peninsula;
(iii) irrigation infrastructure and rehabilitation for some 16,600 ha, and
(iv) a 25 MW hydro power plant. Other projects under discussion with the
authorities include a fourth Water Supply Project, a second Fisheries Project,
a Rural Roads Project, and a seventh development finance company project.
Further direct lending for priority industrial sub-sectors in which Tunisia
has a comparative advantage will depend on progress achieved in the formula-
tion of sound projects. In addition, an economic mission to review the Fifth
Plan is examining the Government's rural development plans in an effort to
identify areas where Bank lending could be focused.
23.       The Bank Group accounted for about 17 percent of disbursements
of official assistance to Tunisia between 1970 and 1974. The Bank Group's
shares in total debt outstfanding and disbursed at the end of 1974 (including
loans from private sources) and in debt service during 1974 were 14 percent



- 8 -
and 12 percent respectively. Over the rest of the decade, the Bank Group's
share in disbursed external debt is expected to decrease to about 10 percent,
as will its share in debt service.
24.       IFC has invested in NPK Engrais (a fertilizer plant), in BDET, in
Compagnie Financiere et Touristique (COFITOUR, a company to promote and invest
in tourism projects), in Societe Touristique et Hoteliere RYI (a large hotel
development) and in Industries Chimiques du Fluor, which will produce alumin-
ium fluoride from local fluorspar for export. IFC's most recent investment,
in May 1975, was in the Sousse-Nord integrated tourism development project.
IFC's net commitments in Tunisia total $15.9 million. IFC's Board has ap-
proved the sale of IFC shares in NPK to the Tunisian Government.
25.       Since 1962 the Bank has chaired the Consultative Group for Tunisia
bringing together the principal donor countries and institutions concerned
with the country's development. The most recent meeting of the Group was held
in Paris in June 1975. New participants in the Group included Saudi Arabia,
Japan, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the Commission
of the European Communities.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Power and Energy Resources
26.       Tunisia's main energy resources are oil, natural gas and a very small
hydro power potential. Recoverable oil reserves are estimated at about 70
million tons. Annual oil production was about 4.6 million tons in 1975 and is
expected to reach 6.5 million tons annually by 1980, as a result of additional
output from new offshore fields in the Gulf of Gabes. Additional resources
lie in an area of the continental shelf on which the frontier between Libya
and Tunisia is currently in dispute. The two Governments have recently agreed
to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
27.       Some 300 million cubic meters of oil-associated gas can be trans-
ported annually from El Borma to the Gabes area through a Bank-financed
pipeline (Loan 724-TUtI) to supply a power station and various industries. The
reinforcement of this pipeline to increase its capacity to about 500 million
cubic meters annually by 1981 has recently been financed by the Kuwait Fund.
Preliminary estimates of offshore natural gas reserves in the Gulf of Gabes
are between 70 and 160 billion cubic meters. If the volume of gas reserves is
confirmed and exploited, this could dramatically change the energy supply
pattern in Tunisia, where the main benefits generated by the substitution of
gas for oil would be incremental oil exports. Some 3.5 billion cubic meters of
low-heat value gas from Sidi Behara and Sidi Agareb (20 miles west of Sfax)
could be economically used for power generation. Tunisia's hydro-power
potential is insignificant, but so far about 30 tIW has been developed. tNo
favorable sites exist permitting further development except for a 25-MW power



- 9 -
plant at Sidi Salem, which is part of the large multipurpose project (see
para. 22) proposed for Bank financing, and a pumped storage plant at Kasseb
which appears to be less economical and therefore has not been included
in the development plan for energy.
The Electric Power Sector
28.       The power sector is mainly served by the Societe Tunisienne de
1'Electricite et du Gaz (STEC), a Government owned corporation, which is re-
sponsible for the production, transmission and distribution of electricity and
gas in Tunisia. Its principal activity is the sale of electricity; gas sales
account for only 3.5 percent of its total revenues. In 1975 it supplied
almost 90 percent of the electric energy consumed in the country, the remain-
ing 10 percent being captive plant supplying individual industries.
29.        In 1970, STEG's installed capacity was 215 tMu generating 680 GWh.
In 1975 the equivalent figures were 367 MW and 1,204 GWh. Almost all of
STEG's installed capacity is interconnected. The major thermal power plants
are located in Tunis and Gabes. 14atural gas accounted for 59 percent, liquid
fuel for 39 percent and hydro for 2 percent of STEG's power generation.       The
total installed capacity in hydro plants of about 30 tW is concentrated in the
northern part of the country. STEG's total diesel capacity of about 15 1MN, of
which the major part is installed in Sfax, Sousse and Robbana, has the role of
standby capacity. The main transmission system, consisting of a 150 kV ring
with 150 kV and 90 kV secondary branches, has a total length of about 1,400
km. The first 225 kV line of about 100 km was built in 1974 between Gannouche
and Maknassy. It will be operated at 150-kV until 1977 when it will be
extended to Tunis and converted to 225-kV. The medium voltage lines (10-30
kV) have a length of about 6,300 km, and low tension distribution lines and
cables (220 V and 100 V) about 8,900 km. At the end of 1975 about 420,000
households (40 percent of the total) were provided with electricity, of which
35,000 were in rural areas (17 percent of total households in rural areas).
Tariffs
30.       As a result of a tariff study financed under Loan 815-TUtU, STEG
implemented a new tariff system for electricy based on the marginal cost
concept in April 1975, when electricity supply rates were raised an average of
16 percent. STEC is planning a second stage of tariff reform for 1978-1979,
both with regard to tariff structures and to the level of electricity rates.
At the same time STEG expects to bring tariff calculation systematically up
to date on the basis of marginal costs. Government approval of STEG's tariffs
is required. At present, oil prices (excluding motor fuels) in Tunisia are
only about one fourth of international prices, enabling STEG to achieve satis-
factory earnings without significant tariff increases. Assuming that export
sales of petroleum products could be increased if domestic consumption were
reduced, this policy results in a substantial subsidy to users of oil products
and electricity. While the present price policy is part of a deliberate
effort to promote industrialization, and the Bank has no evidence that it has
caused an inefficient use of energy or distorted energy consumption patterns,
it was agreed during negotiations that the Government would undertake an



- 10 -
energy price policy study, with the assistance of consultants. The Government
will submit the recommendations of the study to the Bank by September, 1978,
and exchange views with the Bank on them (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section
3.04). STEG has also agreed to conduct a study of the level and application
of connection charges in order to determine what effect its policy stipulating
a rather high level of customer contributions has on the extension of service
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.04). The Government's pricing study would
take the results of this study into consideration.
STEG's Development Program
31.       STEG's 1977-81 development program, as included in the Government's
draft Fifth Plan, amounts to TD 207.3 million (US$483.0 million) of which 90
percent will be for power, 1 percent for gas, and 9 percent for generaL
development. To meet forecast electricity sales, which ar2 projected Lo rise
by 88 percent in the next five years, the power program provides for a genera-
tion component of TD 69.9 million (37.2 percent of the total power program).
It consists of 290 MW of new capacity, of which 150 MIW is the gas turbine plant
under the project presented in this report, and 140 Mfl is steam plant. The
transmission component of the program is TD 36.8 million (19.7 percent of the
total program). It involves the construction of 775 km of transmission lines,
including a new 225-kV transmission grid to increase the reliability of the
system. A continuing program of substation construction to meet increasing
urban and industrial demand is also planned. The distribution component
amounts to TD 80.5 million (43.1 percent) and is based on a master plan
prepared with Canadian assistance, which sets up targets for the 1990 horizon.
Its main aim for urban electrification is to keep pace with plans for housing
construction and to ensure in the shortest possible time the connections for
existing housing which at present is not supplied with electricity; the
development of rural electrification is to improve the standard of living in
rural areas and to meet the water pumping requirements for agriculture. The
intermediate targets for 1981 are to supply 85 percent of households in towns
and 57 percent in villages as against 62 and 17 percent, respectively, in
1974. The master plan, based on an analysis of forecast low-voltage consump-
tion, appears to be adequate. A dispatch center for the power system, to be
completed in 1981, is also included in STEG's construction program.
32.       The gas component is a small portion of the development program al-
though parts of it may have important implications for the future development
of the power sector. It includes the reinforcement of the El Borma pipeline
to enable gas to be used rather than flared and to supply new consumers, the
distribution of gas in the Tunis area, connections for industrial consumers
and, especially, studies for the offshore gas in the Gulf of Gabes. A deci-
sion on the off-shore gas program would be taken by the Government at a later
stage on the basis of studies now underway. A Bank mission visited Tunisia in
November, 1976 to review the gas sector and possibilities for Bank assistance
in defining a hydrocarbon policy in general and in formulating institutional
arrangements for the development of the gas field and the training of person-
nel. The planned introduction of natural gas on the Tunisian market would have
an important impact on the industrial development of the country, providing



- 11 -
opportunities for the development of industries based on the utilization of
natural gas. For the power industry it would lead to the almost total sub-
stitution of gas for liquid fuel in electricity generation. The direct impact
on electricity consumption would be less significant, since it could be a
substitute mainly for electric heating and cooking, accounting at present for
only 0.7 percent of STEG's electricity sales. Preliminary estimates indicate
that the total investment required to develop the offshore gas field would be
around TD 330 million. The financing of this would be kept separate from
STEG's development plan.
33.       STEG's financing requirements for 1976 and the development plan
period (1977-81), excluding potential offshore gas development, amount to TD
240.7 million ($561.1 million). STEG's internal cash generation including
customer contributions would cover 51 percent of this amount. Only 44 percent
of the financing would come from borrowing, of which 35 percent from new
borrowing, all to finance foreign costs, and 9 percent from drawdown of exist-
ing loans. The proposed Bank loan would finance about 2 percent of the con-
struction requirements. Remaining foreign exchange requirements would be
met through foreign government credits, bank loans and suppliers credits.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
History
34.       The Bank has made two previous loans in the energy sector, totalling
$19.5 million. Both were made to STEG. The first (724-TUN), a loan of $7.5
million was made in 1971 in conjunction with a $2.5 million loan from the
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, to finance a gas pipeline. The
second loan (815-TUN), of $12 million, was made in 1972 to finance a power
project consisting of two 20-MW gas turbines, transmission and distribution
system expansion, and consulting services for future plant and institutional
development. The first project was satisfactorily completed in 1972 and in
spite of technical difficulties connected with the compression and treatment
plant, the audit rate of return on the project is about 72 percent, primarily
due to higher oil prices. The second one is nearing satisfactory completion
with both gas turbines as well as all transmission lines and substations in
operation.
35.       The proposed project was identified by a Bank mission which visited
Tunisia in December 1975. Project preparation was carried out by STEG, and
the project was appraised in June 1976. Negotiations took place in Washington
in November 1976. The-Tunisian delegation was headed by the General Mtanager
of STEG, Mr. Bahroun. A detailed description of the project is given in the
report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Power Project (STEG) - Tunisia" (No.
1304b-TUN) dated December 7 1976, which is being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III, a
Supplementary Project Data Sheet as Annex IV, and a map showing the location
of project components is also attached.



- 12 -
Objectives and Description of the Project
36.       The proposed project is the gas-turbine component of STEG's 1977-
1981 development program for generating facilities. Its main objectives are
(a) to ensure continuity of electricity supply; (b) to cover the need for peak
power capacity; and (c) to allow STEG to implement its next expansion program
with larger and more efficient steam turbine units than would be possible
without the prior installation of gas turbine units as proposed in this
project. Lending for the proposed project would also enable the Bank to
continue the provision of technical assistance to STEG in connection with
several studies which are important to the future development of STEG and the
energy sector in Tunisia (paras. 30 and 44). Thus the Bank will continue its
institution-building effort which started under the two previous loans and has
led to improvements in STEG's organization and operations: decentralization
of financial activities, improvements in the accounting and billing system,
introduction of budgetary controls and internal audit, and revision of the
tariff structure for electricity. The project would also provide the first
occasion for private co-financing in Tunisia; in view of the country's
important external resource requirements for the Fifth Plan, this is a sig-
nificant development.
37.       The project consists of seven gas turbines of about 20 MW each.      The
gas turbines would be heavy duty open-cycle units in their own housing so that
they could in the future, if needed, be moved to other sites. Two each would
be located in Sfax and Menzel-Bourguiba, and one each in Tunis South, Korba
and Metlaoui. These sites are at the extremities of Tunisia's basic network,
and are the centers in which actual and projected consumption is concentrated.
The two units to be installed at Sfax would be operated with natural gas
of low-heat value, recently discovered in the Sidi Agareb-Sidi Behara zone
(about 20 miles west of Sfax). The others would be operated with gas oil
pending conversion to natural gas should its feasibility be determined.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
38.       The total cost of the project (including 10 percent physical con-
tingencies but excluding price contingencies since the cost is based on firm
price bids (para. 40)) is $29.3 million with a foreign exchange component of
$25.1 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$14.5 million equivalent would
cover 58 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the project. The remaining
foreign exchange cost would be met by S'FEG ($1.4 million) and by a consor-
tium of private banks including the Societe Tunisienne de Banque and Banque
Nationale de Paris, with the guarantee of COFACE (about $9.2 million equiva-
lent-FF 46,000,000). The effectiveness of this loan would be a condition of
effectiveness of the Bank loan (draft Loan Agreement, Section 7.01). No
retroactive financing is proposed since any payments prior to Bank loan
signature would be covered by STEG or by the consortium loan.      All local
currency costs would be financed by STEG.



- 13 -
Project Execution
39.       STEG would be responsible for project execution.     The gas turbine
units would be installed by the suppliers under a supply and erection contract.
Civil works and supervision of the erection and of the required testing would
be done by STEG's staff, which is competent and has undertaken similar work in
the recent past, as for instance under the first Bank-financed power project.
Procurement and Disbursement
40.       Prior to appraisal STEG informed the Bank that in order to meet the
demand for electricity, the award of contracts would be necessary before the
proposed loan could be submitted to the Bank's Executive Directors but that
STEG would follow the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement in all steps. Shortly
after appraisal STEG awarded the contract, on the basis of international
competitive bidding, to take advantage of the favorable price offered for a
limited term by the lowest bidder (ALSTHOM of France).
41.       Disbursements from the proposed Bank loan would cover a portion of
the gas turbines and installation expenses. Disbursement of the proposed Bank
loan is expected to start after the proceeds of the private bank loan have
been fully withdrawn; on this basis it was agreed during negotiations that the
Bank loan would be disbursed against 100 percent of foreign expenditures, up
to $14.5 million, after the private bank loan and STEG's contribution had been
drawn down. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1980.
Environmental Impact
42.       All five sites of the gas turbines are outside population centers,
and the nearest habitations are situated about 2 miles away. Although the gas
turbines will not create noise nuisances, the equipment would be provided
with special hoods in order to reduce noise to a minimum level. The gas oil
has a sulphur content of less than 1 percent, and the low-heat gas is sulphur-
free. Thus the gas turbines would not cause any unacceptable atmospheric
pollution.
Management and Organization of STEG
43.        Except for general control by the Government, STEG is an autonomous
body, enjoying operational freedom in the conduct of its day-to-day business.
The company's management is competent and effective. It is governed by a
board of eight members headed by a full-time General Mianager; all board
members are appointed by the President of the Republic. The operations of
the entity come under the general supervision of eight departments. The
country is divided into 13 Districts which operate the local services. A
further decentralization is being studied by STEG, which would consist of
the creation of local agencies in towns.



- 14 -
44.       STEG's present organization appears to be adequate for the fulfill-
ment of the company's tasks for the next plan period. Nevertheless its man-
agement is studying the company's organization with the assistance of con-
sultants.  This action has been supported by studies under the second Bank
loan which have been successfully completed. The introduction of offshore
gas on the Tunisian market is expected to bring new responsibilities to STEG,
concerning the construction and operation of onshore facilities for transmis-
sion and distribution of natural gas. Therefore, a study would be undertaken
by STEG, under terms of reference prepared in consultation with the Bank, to
define these new responsibilities and to establish a new organizational
structure for the company, its training needs and the required investments for
the gas transport and distribution program; the recommendations of the study
would be submitted to the Bank by June 30, 1978, and STEG would exchange views
with the Bank on them by October 31, 1978 (draft Loan Agreement, Sections 4.04
and 4.07).
Financial Position of STEG and Financial Covenants
45.       Under Loan 815-TUN, STEG agreed to maintain tariffs at such a level
that the ratio of operating surplus before depreciation to average value of
gross fixed assets in operation less average customer contributions would not
fall below 8.5 percent in any fiscal year beginning with 1973. STEG has met
this covenant; its rate of return on this basis was 8.5 percent in 1973, 9.3
percent in 1974 and 10 percent in 1975. Partly because of the then existing
uncertainties about asset values, and to reduce temporary fluctuations in the
return that would arise from fluctuations in depreciation charges on account
of commissioning of major assets, the rate of return was computed before
depreciation. Since STEG's assets have now been identified and their values
determined, it is no longer necessary to adhere to this covenant. During
negotiations STEG thus agreed to adopt a more conventional rate of return
covenant with an 8 percent rate of return on the net value of fixed assets
in service beginning with 1977 (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.04). STEG's
rate of return on the new basis would be, with present electricity tariffs,
about 8 percent in 1977. Marginal adjustments in tariffs would be necessary
in subsequent years for STEG to continue earning an 8 percent return.
46.       Loan 815-TUN also requires that STEG should not incur any debt
without the approval of the Bank, except for financing the previous project,
if it would raise the company's total debt to more than 45 percent of the sum
of its equity and its total debt. Even after considering the large borrowings
necessary for financing the total investment program, STEG's debt during the
1976-1981 period is not estimated to exceed the level of 45 percent except
in 1979, 1980, and 1981, and then only marginally. The same covenant would
thus be extended to the proposed loan (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.05).
It would keep STEG's assumption of long-term debt under review and, together
with the proposed rate of return covenant, would ensure an adequate cash flow
for STEG vis-a-vis its debt service and construction requirements.



- 15 -
47.        Finally, under Loan 815-TUN, STEG's financial statements were to be
audited and submitted to the Bank within four months after the end of each
fiscal year. In the past, this time schedule has not been observed by STEG;
the 1975 audited financial statements were satisfactory but were received
only in August 1976. STEG attributes this delay to computer problems and
to the fact that the auditors cannot start work until the annual report is
available, generally in April. During negotiations, the Bank agreed to extend
the period for submission of STEG's audited financial statements to five
months after the end of each fiscal year (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.02).
However, in order to ensure that the rate of return covenant is met, STEG also
agreed during negotiations that by October 31 of each year, it would prepare
and submit to the Government and the Bank a forecast of operating revenues,
operating expenses and the rate of return for the current and following year,
a statement of the tariffs and assumptions underlying the forecasts, and a
statement of measures proposed, if any, to meet the 8 percent rate of return
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.04).
Benefits and Justification
48.       The growth rate of STEG's electricity sales since 1966 has been
11.5 percent per year and of system maximum demand 11.3 percent. The fore-
cast adopted for system planning purposes implies an average growth rate of
13.3 percent for STEG's electricity sales and of 12.5 percent for maximum
demand over the period 1975-1981. This forecast, which reflects the economic
expansion of Tunisia planned for the next five year period, is considered
a suitable basis on which to plan expansion of the power system. Two alter-
natives were considered regarding the size of power generating units and
the timing of their installation. The transmission program would remain the
same under each alternative. The proposed program providing for the instal-
lation of 150 MW of gas turbines through 1980 combined with two 140 tMW steam
units at Sousse in 1981 and 1982 was found to have the lowest present value.
49.       The estimated rate of return on the proposed project, at present
electricity prices and using low-heat value gas for the Sfax power plant, and
gas oil for the rest of the gas turbines, would be at least 13.2 percent. If
offshore gas is used after 1980 instead of oil for all gas turbines (with the
exception of the Sfax power plant which will continue to be operated on low-
heat value gas), the rate of return would exceed 24 percent due to the lower
economic value assumed for the offshore gas. The rate of return is highly
sensitive to variations in fuel costs and electricity rates and less sensitive
to increased capital costs. Project risks are no greater than can normally be
expected with operations of this type.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANiD AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Societe Tunisienne
de l'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG), the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Republic of Tunisia and the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided



- 16 -
for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors. Features of particular interest in
the Loan and Guarantee Agreements are discussed in paragraphs 30, 38, and 44.
51.       An additional condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan
would be the effectiveness of the loan agreement between STEG and private
banks providing foreign exchange financing for the project.
52.       The draft Loan and Guarantee Ageements conform to the usual pattern
for loans for Power Projects.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
54.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. 238: Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness: December 29, 1971; Closing Date: (Original)
June 30, 1976; (Current) June 30, 1978.
Since January 1974, steady progress has been made both in thte
National Family Planning program and in the management of the project. The
Government has welcomed and acted upon the recommendat[ons of the IDA sector
mission, and there are strong indications that the program will now continue
to develop positively. However, delays in project execution resulted in cost
overruns of more than 300 percent over the amount originally projected. In
an effort to fill the financing gap, and following a procedure necessitated
by the 1973 Agreement between the Bank Group and the Kingdormi of Norway, IDA's
Executive Directors approved, on August 10, 1976, an increase in the IDA credit
from $4.8 million to $9.6 million, the additional amount representing the
participation of NORAD, Norway's Agency for International Development. The
Project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1977.
Cr. 270: Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness: May 24, 1972; Closing Date: (Original) December
31, 1976; (Current) July 31, 1978.
Project implement tion is proceeding satisfactorily after earlier
difficulties and delays experienced in design of an economic project: vessel
suitable for operation by traditional fishermen; 87 boats have now been coM-
pleted and 62 delivered. After a period of reduced demand for project boats,
due to early construction shortcomings as well as difficulty of fishermen to
adapt to the more sophisticated Perkins engine, effective follow-up) action
has resulted in an increase in approved loan requests, wliclh now total 163.
However, since there is a considerable time-lag between sub-loan approval and
boat delivery due to the administrative procedures involved and since there
will be a rather high percentage of sub-loans which do not mlaterialize and
for which new customers will have to be found, the completion date is now
estimated at March 1978.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regaIrding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 581:  First Water Supply Project; US$15 million loan of January 16, 1968;
Date of Effectiveness: May 29, 1969; Closing Date: (Original)
December 31, 1973; (Current) December 31, 1976.
Cr. 209:  Second Water Supply Project; US$10.5 million credit of June 30, 1970;
Date of Effectiveness: December 12, 1970; Closing Date: (Original)
December 31, 1973; (Current) December 31, 1976.
Ln. 989:  Third Water Supply Project; US$23 million loan of May 29, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: September 24, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,
1979.
Because of problems with locally manufactured asbestos-cement pipe
completion of the First Project has been delayed. Constraints resulting from
lack of capacity in the local construction industry required that the Closing
Date be further set back until the end of 1976. Final project costs are ex-
pected to be about 6 percent below appraisal estimates (but 7 percent higher
in dollar terms because of devaluation). The Second Project is also behind
schedule for the same reasons as well as because of initial delays in final
design, but all major supply works have been completed, and only minor works
unrelated to the provision of water remain to be completed. Final costs may
be about 5 percent higher than original estimates because of current infla-
tion rates, but 20-25 percent higher in dollar terms. Because of delays
in execution, the Closing Date has also been extended to the end of 1976.
Bidding has been completed for all major components of the Third project.
Construction is on schedule, and disbursements are higher than anticipated.
Ln. 746:   First Highways Project; US$24 million loan of June 9, 1971, Date of
Effectiveness: October 26, 1971; Closing Date: (Original) June 30,
1976; (Current) June 30, 1977.
Ln. 1188: Second Highways Project; US$28 million loan of January 26, 1976;
Date of Effectiveness: June 16, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1979.
Progress in reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads and bridges
is good under the first project. All works are expected to be completed by
the end of 1976 or early 1977 (more than one year after the expected completion
date in the loan documents). The delays were mostly caused by delayed acquisi-
tion of right-of-way. The closing date has been extended by one year to June
30, 1977. Cost overruns have required the elimination of the Tunis-Turki
section of the Tunis-Hammamet expressway and considerable reductions in the
withdrawal percentages. Construction of the expressway section is now being
financed by the Kuwait Fund.
After prequalification of contractors under the second project, the
Government has invited bids for the improvement of one road; other improvement
works will be executed in accordance with the agreed timetable. Consultants
have been invited to submit proposals for a Pilot Rural Roads Project. A
separate invitation has been mailed to consultants to submit proposals for
the updating of the 1978 Transport Survey.

Ln. 779:  Agricultural Credit Project; US$5 million loan and US$3 million
Cr. 263:  credit, both of July 12, 1971; Date of Effectiveness:     January 25,
1972; Closing Date: (Original) July 31, 1975, (Current) December
31, 1976.
Project implementation was slow during 1973 and 1974, mainly due
to competing credit programs with softer terms than those of the Bank loan.
These difficulties were resolved in early 1975, when the Government finally
took steps to exclude use of these programs by potential Project subbcorrowers.
Since then Project implementation and disbursements have been satisfactory.
All Project funds are committed and the Loan/Credit is expected to be fully
disbursed by the end of 1976. Major agricultural credit policy issues, such
as the establishment of eligibility criteria for concessional credit, interest
rate levels and credit organization were addressed in the context of the
second agricultural credit project approved by the Executive Directors in
late November.
Ln. 815:   Power Project; US$12 million loan of April 20, 1972; Date of'
Effectiveness: August 4, 1972; Closing Date: (Original) July 31,
1975; (Current) December 31, 1976.
The project is nearing completion. Both gas turbines as well as
all transmission lines and substations are in operation. The cost of the
project is not expected to exceed the original estimate. A tariff increase
in 1975 raised STEG's overall electricity revenues by 12 percent, thereby
increasing the rate of return to 10     percent in that year (as compared with
8.5 percent in 1973 and 9.3 percent in 1974).
Ln. 858: Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan and US$10 million
Cr. 329:   credit, both of September 28, 1972;Date of Effectiveness:      June 26,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
After considerable delays in 1975 caused by the redefinition of the
project, the project is now moving ahead expeditiously. The last contracts
for infrastructure works are being awarded and supervising the construction
of works has already started. Recently revised estimates set the project
cost at about D 31 million, or 16 percent more than the appraisal estimates.
Although most infrastructure works will be completed by the end of 1977, the
project as a whole is unlikely to be completed before July 1978.

Ln. 798:  Fourth Development Finance Company Project; US$10 million loan of
February 9, 1972; Date of Effectiveness: April 13, 1972; Closing
Date: (Original) March 31, 1976; (Current) April 30, 1977
Ln. 881:   Fifth Development Finance Company Project; US$14 million loan of
February 20, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: MIay 24, 1973; Closing
Date: Miarch 31, 1978.
Ln. 1189: Sixth Development Finance Company Project; US$20 million loan of
January 26, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: June 7, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980.
Loan 798-TUN is fully committed but disbursements are slightly
behind schedule; the undisbursed balance (about $1 million) is expected to
be disbursed by December 1976. Loan 881-TUN is also fully committed and the
undisbursed balance is expected to be drawn down by December 31, 1976, three
months ahead of the original estimated schedule. Under Loan 1189-TUtN, $3.8
million had been committed as of September 30, 1976; disbursements are ex-
pected to be slower than projected for 1976 and 1977 but substantially to
increase thereafter to conform to the estimated schedule. Over the past
months, the effectiveness of BDET's management and the quality of its port-
folio have vastly improved. Progress was also made in loan arrears collec-
tion, validation of mortgages and overall working procedures. Prospects for
future development remain good.
Ln. 937:   Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432:   million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973; Date
of Effectiveness: September 24, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1976.
Project execution is about a year behind schedule particularly as
regards construction of the bus depot by SNT and the execution of traffic
improvements by the Municipality of Tunis. Action has been taken by these
agencies to speed up execution on these two components and to minimize
furtlier delays. Bidding for civil works is expected to take place soon.
Most other project components have proceeded with few delays. Procurement
of major equipment by SIJT has been completed and deliveries are being
received on schedule and will be completed by mid-1977. Ways of financing
cost overruns on the suburban railway equipment are under discussion. The
Closing Date for the loan, currently December 31, 1976, will have to be
extended.
Ln. 1029: Hotel Training Project; US$5.6 million loan of July 17, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: November 4, 1975; Closing Date: October 31,
1978.
Substantial progress has been made over the past mnonths. The
technical assistance team has completed classroom courses and are testing
them in the present school year. Final design for the first two schools and
prequalification procedures have been completed. It is expected that con-
struction contracts for the two schools will be awarded in early 1977.

Ln. 1042: Gafsa Phosphate Project, US$23.3 million loan of October 1, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: March 14, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1979.
Due to poor performance in the longwall methods trials, the Sehib
sub-project (underground mining development) is expected to be delayed by at
least one year. As a result of this slippage and higher inflation than fore-
seen, project cost estimates have risen appreciably; it is expected that they
can be financed partly by suppliers' credit and partly by internal cash gen-
eration. The modernization program has experienced some difficulties. The
severe drop in phosphate prices has seriously altered the financial perform-
ance of the company, possibly making difficult the financing of the expansion
program. The Government has proposed that the regional development study
be deleted from the project. Before agreeing to this request, the Bank has
asked for supplementary data on the development of the Gafsa region.
Ln. 1068: Irrigation Rehabilitation Project: US$12.2 million loan of
December 31, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 18, 197:j
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Progress in the Miedjerda subproject area has been satisfactory with
the exception of enforcement of certain key provisions of the land reform
legislation. A Government report has been requested on the progress made on
land reform. In Nlebhana, land reform implementation continues. Consultants
have been recruited and are preparing various studies necessary for project
implementation. Rehabilitation and construction works are ongoing. The Gov-
ernment and the agricultural credit Bank (BNT) have recently concluded an
on-lending agreement setting the terms and conditions of sub-loans under
the credit component of the project.
Ln. 1088: First Urban Sewerage Project; US$28 million loan of February 18,
1975; Date of Effectiveness: August 15, 1975; Closing Date: June
15, 1979.
Despite a six month delay in the early stages of project execution,
works are expected to be completed on schedule and disbursements shouldl reach
forecast levels by the end 1976.    Consultants have been retained to study
measures to improve the implementation capacity for public works and building
projects. Total project cost may increase by 10 percent over estimates, all
the increase being in the local cost component.
Ln. 1155: Third Education Project; US$8.9 million loan of August 13, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: March 1, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Since effectiveness, progress on this project has been good, partic-
ularly fronm a pedagogical point of view, although improved planning is still
necessary on the physical aspects. Five vacancies in the Planning Unit are
expected soon to be filled. The amended draft Government/UNESCO agreement
for implementation of the technical assistance component of the project
will soon be forwarded to the Bank for review and comment, as will also
the outlines of the studies to be undertaken.

SECOTD POWER PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:            Societe Tunisienne de 1Electricite et du Gaz (STEG).
Guarantor:           Republic of Tunisia.
Amount:              US$14.5 million equivalent.
Terms:               14 years including 2-1/2 years of grace, with interest
at 8.7 percent.
Project              The Project is the gas-turbine component of STEG's 1977-
Description:        1981 development program for electricity generation.     It
consists of about 150 MW in seven gas turbine units of
equal size to be installed two each in Sfax (1977) and
Menzel Bourguiba (1978), and one each to be installed in
Tunis South, Korba and 11etlaoui (1980). The main objec-
tives of the Project are: (1) to ensure continuity of
electricity supply; (2) to cover the need for peak power
capacity, and (3) to allow STEC to implement its next
expansion program later with larger and more efficient
steam turbine units than would be possible without the
prior installation of gas turbine units as proposed in
this Project.
Estimated Cost:      The cost of the Project is estimated at about $29.3
million equivalent, with the following main components:
------- $ Million -------
Local    Foreign     Total
Electro mechanical equipment       1.52     21.47      22.99
Civil works                        1.69      0.09       1.78

Total Project Cost               4.17     25.11      29.28
Since the estimated Project cost is based on the firm
price included in the contract signed by STEG in July
1976, no allowance for price contingencies is shown.

Financing Plan:      The proposed loan of $14.5 million would finance 58
percent of the foreign exchange cost of the Project.
The remaining foreign exchange costs will be provided
by STEG ($1.4 million) and private French and Tunisian
banks with the guarantee of Compagnie Francaise
d'Assurance pour le Commerce Exterieur (approximately
$9.2 million). The local currency costs of $4.2 mil-
lion will be financed by STEG.
