1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Macroeconomic policy framework at appraisal

1.       From 2002 to 2007 Guatemala experienced strong economic growth from 3.2
percent to 6.3 percent. High oil and commodity prices in the first half of 2008 and the global
financial crisis in the second half of the year slowed down the growth rate to 3.3 percent. At the
same time, additional exogenous factors, including the rise in food prices, exerted substantial
inflationary pressures on the Guatemalan economy in 2008. Inflation reached a peak of 11.4
percent in 2008, the highest rate in fifteen years.

2.       In 2009 the Guatemalan economy contracted sharply in the aftermath of the global
financial crisis. The economy only grew around 0.5 percent, but growth prospects have
moderately improved since then. Inflation slowed down significantly, reaching 2 percent, due to
the drop in economic activity and reduced oil and food prices. The credit tightening in global
financial markets affected the country by making credit lines more expensive and difficult to
renew. Remittance flows from expatriates, which accounted for 12.4 percent of the GDP in 2007,
fell to 10.7 percent in 2009 and severely affected the real economy, yet kept the balance-of-
payments current account deficit at 2.2 percent of GDP.

3.       At appraisal, Guatemala’s macroeconomic policy framework was relatively
unfavorable for the immediate short run, while cautiously favorable for the medium run.
Although exports of goods continued to fall and growth projections were revised downwards due
to the global economic turmoil, the Guatemalan authorities adopted sound fiscal and monetary
policies. In 2008 and prior to appraisal, the Central Bank responded to complex monetary issues
by adjusting the monetary policy interest rate twice (raising it from 6.5 to 7.25 percent). The
increased interest rate caused an inflow of short-term capital leading to a real appreciation of the
Quetzal and a decrease in exports of goods by 8.5 percent, an effect which was mitigated by
monetary sterilization operations. On the fiscal front, Guatemala was able to apply
countercyclical fiscal policy given its pre-crisis low debt and deficit levels.

Disaster Risk Management in Guatemala

4.      Over the past decades, Guatemala’s economic and social development has been
regularly disrupted by disasters caused by natural phenomena. The recovery and
reconstruction responsibilities have diverted government resources away from strategically
planned development activities in education, health and infrastructure. In addition, disasters in
Guatemala disproportionately affect the poor by disrupting their livelihoods and the delivery of
basic services 6 . For example, the 1976 earthquake resulted in more than 23,000 deaths and
damages estimated at 17.9 percent of GDP. More recently, Hurricane Mitch (1998) caused
estimated damages of 4.7 percent of GDP, while the toll of Hurricane Stan (2005) on the
economy was calculated to be 2.8 percent of GDP.

5.     The National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED) is the leading agency
for DRM in Guatemala. CONRED works as a coordinating mechanism providing a platform
and the legal framework for inter-ministerial coordination in cases of emergency and disaster

prevention. The National Council for Disaster Reduction (Consejo Nacional para la Reducción
de Desastres 7 ) led by the Vice-President of the Republic is the highest body that oversees
CONRED. An Executive Secretariat, SE-CONRED, supports the National Coordinator through
seven areas of expertise: (a) coordination, (b) financial management, (c) comprehensive disaster
risk management, (d) response, (e) preparedness, (f) mitigation, and (g) logistics. This structure is
replicated at the regional, municipal, and local levels. The coordinators are cross-sector
committees that include public, private, and civil society organizations and providers of
emergency services, and are convened by the most senior government representative in the
relevant locality.

6.       Acknowledging its high vulnerability to disasters, Guatemala has made significant
steps towards vulnerability reduction. The policy program of Government (2008-2012) Plan
de la Esperanza focused on increasing growth and reducing poverty and inequality. Linkages to
DRM were emphasized as means to assure productivity and growth. Relevant actions taken
included: (a) the development of risk evaluations; (b) disaster risk-informed territorial planning;
and (c) the adoption of an earthquake-resistant code.

7.       Moreover, Guatemala has sought comprehensive disaster risk reduction and long-
term DRM strategies, culminating with the adoption of the 2009-2011 National Program for
Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (NPDPM). Following Hurricane Stan (2005), a
consultative process led to the adoption of the NPDPM which aims to: (i) improve risk
identification and monitoring, (ii) invest to reduce risk, (iii) strengthen institutional and planning
capacity for risk management, and (iv) develop risk financing strategies. The Program sets out in
detail the four lines of action, responsible agencies, and budget allocations.          The Program
has been adopted by CONRED and funded by national budget appropriations since 2009.

Rationale for Bank’s assistance

8.      The Bank acknowledged the country’s commitment to disaster risk reduction and
was already supporting its efforts. In the aftermath of Hurricane Stan (2005), the GoG began to
work on a National Program for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation that required enhancing
national capabilities for a gradual implementation. Since then, DRM has been incorporated in the
national agenda by the Country’s Administrations showing a proactive approach towards the
investment in ex-ante risk reduction activities. The 2009-2012 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) reflected this engagement placing DRM as a self-standing policy issue in the context of
securing sustainable growth and productivity. A DPL with CAT DDO was explicitly requested by
the GoG for the CPS period.

9.       In April 2009, the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved the Disaster Risk
Management Development Policy Operation with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown
Option. The DPL with a CAT DDO for the Government of Guatemala was declared effective in
June 3, 2010. In line with Guatemala’s gradual development of a DRM agenda, the CAT DDO
was aimed to provide immediate liquidity in the event of a disaster triggered by an adverse
natural event, thus enabling a quicker response to address emergency needs and helping to avoid
redirecting budgetary resources allocated to social and investment programs.

10.       The development objective of this operation was to enhance the Government’s
capacity to implement its disaster risk management program for adverse natural events.
The DRM program aimed to: (i) improve risk identification and monitoring, (ii) invest to reduce
risk, (iii) strengthen institutional and planning capacity for risk management, and (iv) develop
risk financing strategies. Consistent with NPDPM, four key outcome indicators were agreed for
monitoring and evaluation of the CAT DDO:
     1) Data from INSIVUMEH and the vulnerability analysis are being used to prioritize public
          investments and produce more accurate alerts.
     2) SE-CONRED and SEGEPLAN are mainstreaming disaster risk management
          considerations in key plans with respect to capacity building, training, and investments.
     3) New public buildings meet the terms of improved building standards.
     4) Ministry of Finance has improved its response capacity to mobilize resources in case of
          disasters.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

15.     The DPL with a CAT DDO was a single tranche operation. The single Prior Action
was fully implemented (Table 1). The agreed drawdown trigger to access the funds was a
declaration of national and/or regional-level state of emergency by Executive Decree, in
accordance with Public Order Law 7, Article 14 of 2010.

16.      On May 27 and 30, 2010, a national state of emergency was issued by Executive
Decree No. 14 and 15-2010, ratified by the Congress on June 1st 2010 through Decree No.
23-2010. As a result of the eruption of the Pacaya volcano debris and ash rained down in several
Guatemalan cities and villages to the northwest of the volcano, including Guatemala City,
Antigua and Escuintla. Houses, social and transport infrastructure were blanketed by volcanic ash
and over 2,000 people were forced to evacuate. To make things worse, Tropical Storm Agatha hit
Guatemala on May 29, 2010, and caused mudslides, destruction to multiple bridges, damages to
at least 3,500 houses, an estimated 20,000 homeless people, and the evacuation of over 110,000

                                                9
people. The two events together resulted in economic damages and losses of US$1,552.6 million
equivalent to 2.6 percent of the 2009 GDP.

17.     To respond to the impact caused the eruption of the Pacaya volcano and almost
concurrent tropical storm Agatha; the Government of Guatemala withdrew, in June 2010,
the whole amount of the DPL with CAT DDO. Initially, the Government requested a first
disbursement in the amount of US$50,000,000 on June 15, 2010. As the Guatemalan authorities
realized the full magnitude of the disaster, the Government requested, on June 29, 2010, the
remaining undisbursed amount of US$34,787,500.

        US$85,000,000, which was paid to the Bank on June 3, 2010, out of the loan proceeds)

18.     There were four key outcome indicators linked to four areas of actions. These four
indicators form the basis for assessing the performance of this operation.

First Area of Action: Improving Risk Identification, Assessment and Monitoring
Indicator 1: Data from INSIVUMEH and the vulnerability analysis are being used to prioritize
public investments.

19.     In the three-year period (2009-2011) implementation of the National Program for
Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (NPDPM), the GoG significantly supported hazard’s
monitoring and risk identification efforts. Seismological, meteorological and hydrological
monitoring networks, under the control of INSIVUMEH, were upgraded and brought to new
standards. The improved data has been used to update hazard maps, particularly at the municipal
level, where DRM is being incorporated into development and land use plans. In a similar
account, seismic zoning has been integrated in the new building standards (NRD-1) proposed by
the Guatemalan Association of Seismic and Structural Engineering (AGIES) with a resolution
that includes municipal administrative divisions. Moreover, an agreement of more than 15
technical institutions and agencies will facilitate data exchange and the repository of information
through the Spatial Data Infrastructure Project hosted by the National System for Territorial
Information (SINIT in Spanish).

20.     Hazard and vulnerability analysis became part of project assessments for public
investment. All municipalities have flood and landslide “perception maps? developed by
SEGEPLAN and CONRED which have been used in the formulation of municipal development
plans. Twelve municipalities have produced their own land use plans (Planes de Ordenamiento
Territorial, POTs) based on floods and landslides hazard maps; and only one, the municipality of
Sta. Lucia Cotzumalguapa, has issued municipal ordinances to enforce the POT.

21.     The expected target to complete a vulnerability analysis of 20 public buildings was
exceeded. SE-CONRED and the Ministry of Education with the support of Bank technical
assistance (TA), funded by the GFDRR, produced a Safety Index for Education Centers based on
a similar index developed by PAHO for hospitals. The use of this tool has been officially reported
in 43 schools and 4 hospitals.
Second Area of Action: Strengthening Institutions and planning capacity for risk management.

                                                   10
Indicator 2: SE-CONRED and SEGEPLAN are mainstreaming disaster risk management
considerations in key plans with respect to capacity building, training and investments.

22.      The design and enforcement of a number of guidelines has opened the road to
incorporating DRM into relevant development processes. SEGEPLAN enforces a number of
instruments to incorporate risk analysis into key processes, among them: a) Linking DRM with
sectoral and institutional planning; b) Guidelines to include DRM in Territorial Planning; and c)
Guidelines to formulate Municipal Development Plans. At appraisal, 81 percent of the
municipalities (270) had completed their Development Plans, which incorporated DRM as a key
element for the Territorial Analysis. By 2012, this figure raised to 96 percent (321 municipalities).
This process is complemented with training and capacity building to end-users.

23.      Introducing DRM into municipal development plans and into territorial planning
shows mixed results. While 96 percent of the municipalities have incorporated natural hazards
maps to its development plans, only 4 percent have produced land use plans based on flooding
and landslides, two of the most frequent hazards in the country. A combination of factors,
including the lack of a culture of prevention and the need for municipal ordinances on the subject
tend to delay this practice. Guatemala City (the major urban area in the country), Quetzaltenango,
and Antigua Guatemala, comprising almost 17.6 percent of the country’s urban population, have
incorporated DRM into land use and territorial planning. High turnover of municipal staff makes
it necessary for SE-CONRED and SEGEPLAN to design a system to follow up the development
of DRM territorial plans at the municipal level and secure the sustainability of the practice.

24.      In addition, the National System for Public Investment (SNIP) incorporates DRM in
investment projects from national institutions and municipalities. Guatemala has adopted a
‘project cycle management’ approach in the SNIP to improve the quality of projects by ensuring
that all relevant issues and conditions are taken into account during design and implementation.
Risk analysis is being incorporated in public investments beginning at the earliest possible stage
in the project cycle and continues throughout the planning process, generating progressively more
detailed information. Seismic designs are verified during the project revision.

Third Area of Action: Investing to reduce risk.
Indicator 3: New public buildings meet the terms of improved building standards.

25.     The CONRED recommendation for using the seismic standards National Norm for
Risk Reduction One (NRD-1) contributes to the reduction of structural vulnerability to
earthquakes and other natural hazards. CONRED approved the NRD-1 in 2010 (Decree 03,
published in the Official Diary March 29th 2011). The identification of mechanisms to assure its
implementation will help to progressively reduce risk in new construction stock. The adoption
and enforcement of the standards by the municipalities of Guatemala City and Mixco in the
Metropolitan Area for new construction is an important achievement, and will motivate other
smaller urban centers to follow similar procedures contributing to the positive impact of this
regulation. Schools and hospitals have specific mechanisms for both existing and new
construction, which are also promoted by SE-CONRED.
26.     The enforcement of current seismic standards for design and construction of public
and private buildings needs to be improved in order to significantly contribute to risk
reduction. Although, SEGEPLAN requires that all public investment projects incorporate risk
analysis in the SNIP, only with Congress approval as a law, the implementation of these seismic
standards will be mandatory in the country. Special attention should be given to the establishment
of roles and responsibilities for implementation and supervision during design and building


                                                11
construction processes. New chapters in the construction code need to address low-rise structures
for dwellings.

Fourth Area of Action: Developing risk financing strategies.
Indicator 4: Ministry of Finance has improved response capacity to mobilize resources in case of
disasters.

27.      The GOG drafted a disaster risk financing strategy in 2012 to develop tailored
instruments to address Guatemala’s needs and practices. The purpose of the financial strategy,
as referred in the technical report produced with the assistance of the IADB 8 , is to improve
financial management of disasters associated to natural hazards. The proposal recommends that
some instruments be designed to promote prevention and mitigation, and others to stimulate risk
transfer mechanisms and/or bring in resources to cover funding gaps in public expenditure that
generally occur during emergencies for both, humanitarian assistance and reconstruction.

28.     Important steps are being taken towards the initiation of a disaster risk financing
and insurance (DRFI) strategy to face the negative impact of natural hazards. Some
examples of the progress achieved in this area are the assessment of the economic impact of
natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes through CAPRA, the draft law to modify
Congress Decree 109-96, that regulates CONRED, aiming to modify the availability of resources
for the National Fund for Disaster Attention (NFDA), the enactment of Decree 25-2010 that
requires the insurance sector to create reserves to address adverse natural events, the initiative to
develop agricultural insurance within a regional scheme, and the use of contingent loans such as
the DPL with CAT DDO.

29.      The consolidation of a DRFI strategy requires further definition of contingent
liabilities, financial instruments and institutional arrangements for its implementation.
Although progress has been achieved in understanding possible losses generated by disasters and
different financial instruments available, a final DRFI strategy requires that the GoG assess
possible fiscal losses for frequent and occasional events and establishes different financial
instruments for each case. Currently, MINFIN is undertaking basic studies to understand possible
contingent liabilities associated to natural hazards that the country could be facing.

                                                                        16
    2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

    External Factors

30.      In 2008, Guatemala entered into a period of slow economic growth triggered by the
global financial crisis, and accentuated by a food price spike and an oil crisis. The economy
of Guatemala was hit by a combination of declining exports, remittances and private capital
inflows. Due to falling import taxes, by mid-2009, the government tax revenue especially related
with exports had dropped by 7.8 percent. As a result, the GoG issued a decree to contain public
expenditure; main social programs were exempted but other agendas suffered delays, among
them the implementation of the National Program for Disaster Reduction and Prevention. The
crisis prevented the GoG (CONRED, SEGEPLAN and MINFIN) to offer technical assistance to
municipalities to include DRM in land use planning and monitoring budget appropriation. In
addition, the lack of resources for retrofitting public buildings limited the interest for carrying out
vulnerability studies.

31.     A 14-month delay of the Congress of Guatemala to approve the operation reduced
the loan implementation period. The Board approval was furnished on April 2009 and the loan
signature by the GoG in June, 2010. In addition, once approved, the loan was disbursed in full
within the first month, with no clear Bank guidelines to monitor the implementation of the DRM
Program upon full disbursement.

32.     During the implementation period of the CAT DDO, several disasters impacted the
country’s economy forcing realignment of resources to emergency response and slowing
down prevention and mitigation initiatives. The almost concurrent volcanic eruption of Pacaya
(May 2010) and Tropical Storm Agatha produced damages and losses for US$1.5 billion
equivalent to 2.6 percent of the GDP an activated the CAT DDO. In October 2011, heavy rains
associated to Tropical Depression 12 E caused losses estimated at 0.81 percent of GDP (see
Annex 4).

    Factors under Government Control

33.      Recovery processes associated with above-mentioned disasters provided an
opportunity to promote concepts related to reducing vulnerability. Incorporating a risk
reduction approach during and after the emergency requires political will and capacities, which
can positively impact by helping to break the vicious cycle of “development -disaster-
development?. The GoG has seized the opportunity to go beyond the replacement or reparation of
affected infrastructure, and begun to work on the intervention of vulnerability factors contributing
to sustainability and risk reduction.

34.      The new Government administration took office in January 2012, with limited
information regarding the requirements for renewing the CAT DDO. The financial cost and
legal aspects of using the revolving feature of the CATDDO were not clearly assessed by GoG
and the Bank during appraisal and implementation. Legal uncertainties regarding the need for a
Congress approval demotivated a newly established government to further explore this option. On
the other hand, the new Administration acknowledged and incorporated previous efforts in the
design of a National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction (2012-2017), which still is under
validation by national stakeholders.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:


                                                  17
35.     A better definition of outcomes, outputs and indicators would have made it easier to
measure progress and evaluate accomplishments of the overall operation. The PD has
shortcomings in the definition and selection of indicators, outcomes, outputs and baseline
proposed in different sections of the document (Table V.2, Table VI.1 and Annex 1). The design
of indicators is focused in a large number of outputs. The use of SMART indicators (specific,
measurable, attributable, realistic, timely bound), for example, could have facilitated monitoring
through Implementation and Status Reports (ISR) and evaluation through this ICR. In addition,
the indicators and baseline data presented in PD Table VI.1 and Annex 1 were inconsistent,
which made it difficult to understand what should be monitored and how to measure it13.

36.     Periodic monitoring reports were not requested by the Bank nor issued by the
Government during the implementation. According to the Loan Agreement (Article III-
Program), the Borrower should have furnished to the Bank for its review and comment a report
on the progress achieved in carrying out the Program, in such detail as the Bank shall reasonably
request. The Bank neither requested progress reports nor defined the details or periodicity
expected for these reports. The Government Final Completion Report was replaced by an Aide
Memoire as a result of a workshop (Annex 2).

37.      Bank staff assisted the national entities in monitoring the execution of the program
during the implementation period. The Bank was responsible for monitoring both the
macroeconomic environment and progress of program implementation as measured by the
indicators specified in the Loan Agreement. Although the project indicators were monitored in
coordination with three entities: SE-CONRED, SEGEPLAN and MINFIN, measurement of the
four outcome indicators were not reported on with enough frequency and verified to ensure data
quality.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

38.     Focus on disaster risk management will continue through the proposed National
Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction (2012-2017), and could be supported by a potential
second CAT DDO. To improve its capacity to manage risk resulting from adverse natural events
the Government has been formulating a NSDRR (2012-2017), providing continuity to initial
accomplishments and offering the policy framework for a potential second CAT DDO as stated in
current CPS.

39.      Support the consolidation of a comprehensive DRFI strategy through the design of
specific instruments tailored to needs and conditions of the country. Developing and
implementing a sustainable DRFI strategy is a long-term process that requires extensive capacity
building. This highly specialized endeavor could be supported by a GFDRR trust fund and carried
out in coordination with other units from the Bank (Treasury, PREM, GFDRR and LCSDU), the
international community and the leadership of the national authorities.

40.    At Central American level, Guatemala will continue to benefit from Bank-
supported initiatives, such as the implementation of the third phase of the CAPRA initiative.




13
   For example, PD Table VI.1 established a benchmark of 15 percent of urban areas that have incorporated disaster
risk management in the territorial planning, starting from a baseline of 5%.. How the baseline was measured is not
explicit in the PD, nor how to quantify urban areas. A different benchmark for the same indicator was established in
other section on the PDAnnex 1 (20 percent).

                                                        18
A recently approved Trust Fund for probabilistic risk assessment will help to evaluate risk at
national, municipal and sectoral levels, providing information to define risk reduction strategies.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Consistency with Government Priorities

41.     The CAT DDO supported Guatemala on the implementation of its National
Program for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (2009-2011) and made resources readily
available when most needed. The project supported the Program implementation through its
four major lines of action: 1) Risk Identification and Monitoring, 2) Planning and Institutional
Strengthening, 3) Risk Reduction, and 4) Financial Strategies for DRM showing full alignment
with the country’s priorities. Through a GFDRR trust fund (TF094228) the Bank provided
technical assistance in land use planning and the formulation of technical specifications for
building standards. At the same time, this CAT DDO assured quick and timely access 14 to
funding in the aftermaths of the 2010 joint impact of Pacaya volcanic eruption and Agatha storm.

42.     Project objectives, design and implementation remain consistent with Guatemala’s
current development priorities thus showing a high relevance of the CAT DDO operation.
The new Government Administration, which took office in January 2012, has outlined an
ambitious development agenda to ensure long-term sustainability of its development programs,
systematic attention to environmental issues and the mainstreaming of recurrent impact of
adverse natural hazards into specific plans. For example, the rural development plan addresses
DRM through: a) a focus on ex-ante vulnerability reduction, b) improvement of early warning
systems, c) use of territorial planning for disaster prevention and mitigation, and d) improved
emergency response.

43.      The National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction (NSDRR 2012-2017) will be the
new instrument to put into operation the National Policy for Disaster Risk Reduction. Under
the leadership of CONRED, specialized teams for DRM (Mesa Nacional de Diálogo para la
Gestión del Riesgo a los Desastres) have prioritized a number of activities that will have a direct
impact on the improved capacity for DRM in the country. The NSDRR proposes the continuity to
all the activities undertaken under previous PMPMD, among them those supported under CAT
DDO implementation phase.

Relationship with Bank Strategy

44.     The GoG and the Bank have agreed on including DRM into joint strategies. From
the outset, the project was aligned with the existing CPS (2009-2012) that included DRM through
promotion of sustainable growth and productivity. The relevance of the objective has been
confirmed through the current CPS (2013-2016), which incorporates DRM as a means to support
competitiveness and growth.

Complementarities with other World Bank activities



14
  The National State of Emergency was issued on May 27, 2010. The first disbursement request was received on June
7 and disbursed on June 15. A second request was made on June 24 and disbursed on June 29, 2010.

                                                       19
45.      The DPL with CAT DDO was complemented with other Bank technical assistance
activities in the country. A GFDRR-financed technical assistance in the amount of US$0.73
million aimed at enhancing Technical and Scientific Information for Municipal Planning was
prepared and implemented over a 2-year period (ending in January 31, 2011) through a
participatory process with several institutions, including INSIVUMEH, MAGA, SE-CONRED,
SEGEPLAN, and relevant municipalities. This TA supported the accomplishment of several CAT
DDO’s matrix outcomes, including the hazard and risk mapping, the methodologies for land use
and planning and school safety index, an updated seismic building code and setting up of the
Mesa Nacional de Diálogo para la Reducción del Riesgo15. Guatemala was also part of the first
phase of the Central American Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA) exercise, whose major
accomplishment was a compendium of risk maps that provided disaster risk specialists and
policy-makers with preliminary national level hurricane and earthquake maximum probable
losses. This information was useful to estimate disaster impact for the DRFI strategy.

Alignment with Good Practice Principles and Conditionality

46.     The DPL with CAT DDO looked for operational consistency with the Bank’s Five
Good Practice Principles of Conditionality. 1) This operation reinforced national ownership by
aligning its development objective, outcomes and outputs to government specific goals; 2) An
operational policy matrix was agreed up front with the GoG and coordinated with the IMF; 3) the
Bank supported the Government’s development of its integrated financial management system
(SIAF) and e-procurement system (Guatecompras); and 4) The policy matrix contains outcomes
that have been defined by the borrower and are closely linked to the supported policy actions.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

47.    This DPL with CAT DDO has enhanced the Government’s capacity to implement its
DRM program. Although it is very difficult to establish a direct causal relation between the
CAT DDO and the progress made by the government, it is possible to assert that Guatemala’s
DRM agenda has moved from emergency-centered actions to a more systemic risk management
approach with more participation of development entities as SEGEPLAN and MINFIN.

48.      To achieve the PDO, the project was divided into four outcomes, of which the
improvement of risk identification and monitoring data and the strengthening of
institutional and planning capacity for risk management are the ones with the best results.
Through the upgrade in more than 50 percent of meteorological, hydrometric and seismic
networks, Guatemala has improved its capacity to produce more accurate alerts. The scientific
data produced by INSIVUMEH also supports the GoG to make well-informed decisions to
effectively integrate disaster risk considerations into development plans, vulnerability analysis,
designing of seismic standards, and the establishment of disaster prevention plans.

49.    The instruments produced to guide municipalities and other government levels to
include DRM16 into regular business and operations are significant. This has gone in hand

with training and capacity building which have generated that disaster risk management
considerations are being slowly incorporated in key plans (municipal development and land use).

50.      The number of public buildings that meet building standards and the improvement
to mobilize resource in case of disasters were more limited. The formulation of the seismic
standards (NRD-1) represent an important milestone, although supplementary work is required to
ensure its mandatory enforcement, though its approval as a law by Congress and the
establishment of adequate institutional arrangements to supervise designs and works in each
municipality. In the other hand, despite the fact that several initial steps have taken place in the
country towards the definition of a DRFI strategy is only on its initial conceptual stage and the
limited information obtained regarding the fiscal exposure and contingent liabilities do not allow
to identify the adequate instruments to transfer or retain the risk.

51.     The four outcomes and action areas included in the project were aligned to the four
proposed objectives of the NPDPM. The Program focused on the following four objectives: (i)
improve risk identification and monitoring, (ii) invest to reduce risk, (iii) strengthen institutional
and planning capacity for risk management, and (iv) develop risk financing strategies. The
proposed new National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction (2012-2017) could provide
continuity to the NPDPM, identifies strategic lines of action, assigns specific roles and
responsibilities to public and private organizations, clarifies the role of local governments, and
provides a guideline for resources assignment.

52.     The achievements made by the DPL with CAT DDO have been part GoG
coordinated efforts with other international organizations. The IADB, the UN System,
UNISDR, CEPREDENAC, CABEI, and the European Commission through different projects
contributed to the NPDPM, therefore to several of the outcomes proposed in the project. The
upgrade of the monitoring networks was possible due to an investment credit provided by CABEI
to the GoG to complement national funding. Likewise, IADB assisted GoG in the design of the
risk financing strategic framework which will need to develop specific instruments and
procedures to make it operational. UNDP has supported institutional strengthening for DRM and
contributed to the development of different guidelines promoted by SEGEPLAN.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

53.     The CAT DDO exhibited high relevance to the needs of the country. The project’s
design and implementation strategies have contributed to the Government’s Development Plan
and the National Program for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (2009-2011), and continue to be
relevant as shown in the new National DRR Strategy (2012-2016) and the new CPS (2012-2016).

54.     In accordance with the purpose of the DPL with CAT DDO, this project provided a
quick source of liquidity injection after catastrophic events. The project was very efficient in
providing quick liquidity in response to the eruption of the Pacaya Volcano and the Tropical
Storm Agatha. The instrument also was an important innovation and advance in the Bank’s line
of products and the country’s risk financing tools.

55.    During project implementation, important policies and tools contributed to the
improvement of disaster risk management in Guatemala. Significant advances in disaster risk
monitoring, alerts and risk evaluation as well as different instruments for incorporating DRM in


                                                 21
planning process, among progress in other activities, contributed to position DRM in the
development agenda.

56.     Nonetheless, this ICR rates the project as Moderately Satisfactory, as the project
did not succeed in four of the thirteen outputs. Shortages in developing the analysis of fiscal
exposure, the assessment of contingent liabilities, the development of a comprehensive risk
financing strategy and difficulties in validating the number of retrofitted and repaired schools
contributed to this rating.

57.     In addition, the need of improvements in policy dialogue, monitoring and reporting
procedures, and clarity about renewal options were identified through this ICR. A sustained
policy dialogue between the Bank and the Government and an appropriate M&E structure during
the implementation could have helped to improve the results.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58.     The vulnerability of Guatemala to natural hazards, economic external shocks, and
violence impinges on both economic growth and the achievement of more equitable social
outcomes. The two events that occurred in 2010 (the volcano Pacaya and the Agatha storm) had
severe consequences in terms of loss of life and economic impact. The CAT DDO provided
financial resources to quickly respond to the disaster, likely reducing the burden of the shock on
the poorest, which are normally the more affected.

59.      Sustainability of social programs is usually threatened by the negative impact of
natural hazards. Poverty reduction programs in Guatemala are constrained by low tax revenue
and poorly funded social spending, reflecting historically weak fiscal capacity. Funding of these
programs tends to be diverted to cope with the humanitarian phase of a disaster and the later
recovery process. These funds are difficult to be paid back contributing to an even worst scenario
for the underprivileged. Having in place the CAT DDO contributed to fill partially the budgetary
gap helping handling these complex situations.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

60.     Institutional strengthening and capacity building was one of the most important
accomplishments during the program implementation period. CONRED significantly
improved its catalytic role to convene and coordinate different national and local entities engaged
in the DRM process, including scientific, sector ministries, the municipalities and belonging not
only to the public but also the private sector, the international community and the NGOs.
Particularly relevant for the purpose of DRM policy is the engagement of SEGEPLAN and
MINFIN through territorial planning, tracking for public investments and better understanding
DRFI needs for the country.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

61.      The progressive development of instruments for the incorporation of the DRM
agenda led to formulate an additional guideline for sectoral development planning.
SEGEPLAN developed guidelines to incorporate DRM within the planning processes at the
sectoral and institutional levels (Lineamientos para vincular la gestión del riesgo en el proceso de


                                                22
planificación sectorial e institucional) that go beyond the targets of the CAT DDO. SEGEPLAN
and MINFIN have acquired a prominent role in the implementation of the DRM agenda in
Guatemala by joining traditional stakeholders such as SECONRED. In addition, the permanent
inter-institutional dialogue and coordination allow DRM mainstreaming into regular development
business and a better use of resources.

62.     The DRM technical assistance provided during the Project implementation was a vehicle
for several innovations that have become common practice in DRM efforts. Notably (a) a
methodology for risk and vulnerability analysis and preventive planning that dynamically
integrates complex technical and scientific expertise with community knowledge through an
educational and awareness raising process for all participants; (b) the development of a School
Safety Index applied to more than forty schools in urban areas, along with a work in progress
methodology to be applied in rural areas where structural typologies differ substantially; and (c)
the establishment of a dialogue, exchange and DRM coordination mechanism integrated by
delegates from relevant national organizations know as Mesa Nacional de Dialogo para la
Gestion del Riesgo.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not Applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Negligible to low

63.      The DPL with CAT DDO has contributed to institutionalizing GoG’s capabilities
and methods to implement its DRM Program thus assuring its sustainability over time. The
sustainability of the intervention is high given the Government’s full ownership of the program.
The Government has contributed with important human and financial resources to the program
development objective which can be seen through at least three key accounts: 1) Legal and
institutional frameworks provide a comprehensive DRM system, boosting CONRED’s role as
coordinator and promoting the participation of other key institutions (SEGEPLAN, Ministry of
Finance and the municipalities); 2) The National DRR Strategy (2012-2017) acknowledges the
new administration’s interest to incorporate these issues into the new development agenda,
therefore, assuring continuity of processes after a short delay associated to the administrative
transition period; and 3) A reform of the National Fund for Disaster Attention (NFDA) assigned
to CONRED is considered to add financial resource for emergency management and risk
reduction in general.

64.     DRR program implementation can be delayed due to recurrent impact of severe
natural events in Guatemala. Recurrent emergencies force re-allocation of resources to
handle the humanitarian response and recovery process reassigning funds from on-going
programs. The GoG is working to progressively reduce possible impact in terms of loss of lives
and investments. For the later, a comprehensive DRFI strategy for Guatemala will support
national and local authorities to reduce the impact of an unexpected severe natural hazard. For
the former, efforts to reduce vulnerability through, for example, more hazard-sensitive land use
planning and development, and enhanced disaster response capacity will help reduce losses. The
CAT DDO in particular contributed to enhance risk mapping, land use planning, building design
and construction standards, and a preliminary risk financing strategy.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.     The Bank promptly addressed a formal request from the GoG for a DPL with CAT
DDO, through an interdisciplinary team comprised of staff from PREM, Treasury and
Disaster Risk Management - LCSDU. The team correctly identified country needs. Within 60
days the Bank completed the appraisal and approval phases. The relevance of the project to both
the GoG and the Bank contributed to a dynamic dialogue and exchange in the project formulation
and Board approval. While policy issues were fully assessed in preparation, the monitoring
framework was weak in terms of definition of outcomes and specific indicators.

66.      The CAT DDO was a new financial product considered by the Bank as pioneering
given its flexibility and promptness in formulation and disbursement. The team achieved two
important outcomes in preparing the project. Firstly, it was able to take advantage of a newly
created instrument, which was first approved for the Government of Costa Rica in September and
Colombia in December 2008. Secondly, it managed to include action areas focused in key issues
relating disaster risk management with development, moving the Government to look beyond the
traditional emergency management vision.

67.    The newness of the product may have contributed to a lack of clarity and
explanation to the client on how the renewal option of the CAT DDO was to function. It also,
may have contributed for the underestimation of the big challenge that a high number of outputs
and ambitious targets represented for the supervision.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

68.     The team undertook regular supervision missions and managed technical assistance
to provide support in the implementation. Through a GFDRR trust fund the team contributed
to the promotion of the municipal preventive planning to risk reduction and incorporate the risk
management into the development planning process. The major impact relates to the
enhancement of local DRM capacity by supporting the preventive municipal planning through the
development of municipal land use plans (including risk maps) for 12 municipalities, and
updating of the National building code.

69.      The opportunity to support the policies and outputs related with the disaster risk
financing strategy was not fully managed. Although the team did realize some activities, like a
regional workshop to exchange experiences among Central American countries related with
disaster risk financing, the insufficient technical assistance and coordination with IDB in this area
where the Bank has been a lead entity, resulted in shortages in the output related with developing
the analysis of fiscal exposure, the assessment of contingent liabilities, and the development of
the DRFI strategy.

70.    There was fragile monitoring of the program supervision. During project
implementation the appropriate documentation was not filed after every supervision mission. The
information provided and frequency of the ISR were not enough to document the progress. There

                                                 24
are in total four ISR: the first two, submitted before the loan effectiveness (05/12/2009 and
12/01/2009), the third a week after the loan effectiveness date (06/11/2010), and the last in
07/09/2012. None of the ISRs make a complete reference to the four outcome indicators
established.

71.     Further contributing to the Moderately Unsatisfactory rating was the failure of the
Bank to request from the GoG the presentation of periodic reports as established in the loan
agreement and to provide timely information about the instrument renewal options and
cost. As a result of not requiring the support from the Government, the Project did not benefit
from complete and supported information regarding the progress of indicators, and the possibility
of the GoG to take in a timely manner the decision of activating the revolving mechanism of the
CAT DDO.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.      Overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory: The Bank designed a
project that was well adapted to the needs of the country, and provided adequate financial support
to the emergency. However, the efforts and resources dedicated to support key policy and
institutional reforms during supervision of the CAT DDO were insufficient. The Bank
underestimated the challenges of supporting the dialogue and the achievement of ambitious
outcomes, and did not put in place an appropriate M&E framework at project design and
implementation, consequently the overall rating proposed is Moderately Satisfactory.17

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: not applicable (The Government and the implementing agency were the same)

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     Overall Borrower’s performance was rated as moderately satisfactory. During the
project execution, the GoG implemented the National Program for Disaster Prevention and
Mitigation (Programa Nacional de Prevención y Mitigación ante Desastres 2009-2011 18 ),
strengthened DRM national capacities, and progressively integrated other development agencies
(such as SEGEPLAN, Ministry of Environment, MINFIN and the Academia) in the DRM process.
The following aspects are worth highlighting:
      The Government’s implementation arrangements were aligned with the project’s needs.
      The Government was overall committed to the development of the disaster risk
         management agenda that was affected by the reduction of budgetary ceilings.




17
   The overall MS rating for Bank performance combines the MS rating for quality at entree and the MU rating for
supervision, and considers the overall project outcome ratings of MS. Based on the ICR preparation guidelines, “when
the rating is in the satisfactory range while the rating for the other dimension is in the unsatisfactory range, the rating
for the overall Bank Performance normally depends on the Outcome rating?.

        The Government coordinated with different donors and partners to accomplish the
         outputs.
        Although the Government managed to accomplish positive results and to put DRM in
         the public agenda, four out of thirteen established outputs were partially achieved,
         particularly those related to risk financing strategy, public facilities vulnerability
         analysis and construction codes for public buildings. The Government did not provide
         periodical reports as established in the loan agreement.
        The Government did not furnish a completion report. Hence the Government and the
         Bank carried out a consultation workshop with the implementation agencies to assess
         the projects outcomes (See Annex 2).

6. Lessons Learned

CAT DDOs as instruments that offer different opportunities:

74.      The CAT DDO is designed to not only provide liquidity. As a DPL, the CAT DDO
entails a combination of financial transfer to the country’s budget to provide liquidity after an
emergency, with an equally important component of DRM policy advice and dialogue. Therefore,
adequate resources and technical assistance to support achievement of project outcomes should
be provided accordingly.

75.      DPL with CAT DDO operations could be an opportunity to introduce broader
concepts of Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) for countries developing
comprehensive strategies. These types of projects are a conductive venue to inform national
stakeholders of the importance of having in place a comprehensive DRFI strategy tailored to
specific country needs and capabilities. Governments should be encouraged to structure
complementary financing mechanisms for emergency situations to offset the CAT DDO with
national reserve funds or resources from other sources, especially to address small-scale events,
since the instrument is better suited for fiscal unbalances caused by less frequent and more severe
disasters.

CAT DDOs as instruments as part of a broader engagement:

76.     Matching the CAT DDO with parallel technical assistance can enhance the DRM
policy dialogue. Having the DPL with a CAT DDO as part of a larger level of engagement with
the country through TAs or other lending operations can facilitate continued engagement and a
fluid exchange with the government.

77.     The process of designing a CAT DDO can provide a platform to bring other sectors
and institutions. A wide range of stakeholders coming from the public sector, academia, and
other organized groups of the civil society, can be part of a comprehensive initiative to support
the National DRM Plan and to introduce the risk perspective in the sectoral and territorial
planning.

78.     DPLs with CAT DDO require coordination with development partners in order to
achieve more sustained and broader impacts. Sustained changes at the policy level will require
a partnership approach with other bilateral and multilateral partners to exchange ideas, receive
feedback, but more importantly to avoid resource duplication and find synergies to scale up
impact. The Bank should support the local government to become a catalyst of this process,
where its leadership can align all DRM effort towards the same goal.


                                                26
79.      Given the multidisciplinary nature of DRM, the implementation of a DPL with CAT
DDO requires partnerships with other sectors within the World Bank Group. This type of
operation is perfectly suited to strengthen inter-sector collaboration with different teams in the
Sustainable Development network as part of the mainstreaming process, as well as PREM, FPD,
and Treasury. Although this approach was not implemented during supervision, it could improve
the fiscal evaluation, DRFI analysis, and financial management.

CAT DDOs should evolve:

80.      It is necessary to learn how to manage early disbursements of CAT DDOs. A
Declaration of Emergency caused by a catastrophic event triggers the disbursement of the
instrument and not the outputs/outcomes. Since regular DPL’s usually close after full
disbursement, this situation becomes a negative incentive for the completion of CAT DDO’s
output/outcomes when early full disbursement occurs. Moreover, Bank systems reported the
operation as closed and systematically did not required the ISR’s, therefore, they need to be
adapted to better reflect the Bank supervision for CAT DDO’s, especially when the disbursement
of the loan is made in early stages of the project implementation.

81.     DPLs with CAT DDO have a revolving and renewal features that need to be further
analyzed by the Bank and explained to governments during Project preparation. There are
three aspects that should be considered: 1) Financial: All the parties related to the instruments
should be familiarized with financial costs. The Bank should emphasize different options
available for repayment, renewal, and interest rate allocation; 2) Legal: It is strongly
recommended that the Bank reviews with the client during Project Preparation, national
regulations and legal implications for activating the revolving or renewal feature; 3) Technical:
Bank guidelines indicates that CAT DDO renewals will require that the original program (hazard
risk management and macroeconomic frameworks) remains largely in place. Therefore, it is
necessary to clarify the period of implementation of outcomes and outputs to better establish and
evaluate them, and facilitate the process of updating the Policy Matrix when repayments and
renewals are made, considering as an option the possibility to become a programmatic DPL. The
programmatic approach offers flexibility to manage risks and captures the medium-to long-term
nature of most significant reforms.

82.      An operational manual can be helpful to address emergencies and should be
considered for future DPLs with CAT DDO. Planning can contribute to a quick allocation of
resources in case of emergency situations. Identifying key roles and responsibilities of different
institutions and stakeholders in the DRM process, particularly for emergency response and
management, prioritization of funds, sequencing of activities, and funding decisions will allow
strategic decision making. Governments should be encouraged to have procedures and
mechanisms in place to address these aspects, especially inter-institutional coordination.

83.      Reporting mechanisms should be more specific in the loan agreements, and agreed
up front with the government including the designation of the responsible party. The most
important sources of information for an appropriate and timely monitoring and evaluation of
program implementation are the government’s reports, which should properly record progress
made through key outcome indicators. This would facilitate adjusting support in real time and
providing international experience from the Bank when most needed. In addition, the compilation
of these reports will smooth the write-up process of ICRs and the dialogue with counterparts.

     Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan with a Catastrophe Deferred
                                     Drawdown Option
                             (DPL with CAT DDO BIRF 7683)
                             Guatemala City, February 7th 2013
Background
In April 2009, the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved the Disaster Risk Management
Development Policy Loan (DPL) with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO),
requested by the Government of Guatemala (GoG) for US 85 million dollars, which was declared
effective in June 3rd 2010.

To respond to the impact caused by eruption of the Pacaya volcano and tropical storm Agatha, the
Government of Guatemala withdrew a first disbursement in the amount of US$ 50,000,000 on
June 15th 2010 and the remaining undisbursed amount on June 29th 2010. The agreed drawdown
trigger to access the funds was a declaration of national state of emergency by Executive Decree
N° 23-2010 issued by the Congress of the Republic on June 1st 2010.

CAT DDO development objective was to strengthen the GoG national capacities to implement
the National Program for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation to face adverse natural events.

Validation Workshop Purpose

The Validation Workshop aimed to review jointly the Implementation Completion and Results
Report (ICR) and collect inputs from GdG agency representatives in light of the assessment of
outcomes achieved, measured in terms of the accomplishment towards the General Objective and
indicators, Bank performance, GoG performance, assessment of key factors affecting
performance and lessons learned.

This validation workshop was attended by representatives of the Directorate of Public Credit
under the Ministry of Finance (DCP/MINFIN), Ministry of Planning (SEGEPLAN), Ministry of
Education (MINEDUC), Institute for Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology
(INSIVUMEH) and representatives of the World Bank.


Validation Workshop Development

Initially, DCP/MINFIN officials welcomed workshop participants and explained the context
under which the GoG requested the contingency loan to the WB. They also synopsized the DPL
with CAT DDO as instrument to ensure financial liquidity to cope with times of crisis. The four
key outcome indicators contained in the CAT DDO policy matrix and the thirteen output
indicators were individually assessed against their respective baseline and goals initially proposed.
They reviewed also internal and external factors that might have affected the project
implementation. Then, the ratings given to the accomplishment of project objectives and
outcomes, the proposed bank performance and the proposed Borrower performance were assessed
by the representatives of attending agencies. The Bank’s delegates explained rating criteria and
scale.


                                                30
They held discussions about the operation timetable, from the date of approval of CAT DDO on
April 14th 2009 through its congress approval on June 1st 2010 and total disbursement on June
29th 2010. They clarified that during the 14-month period elapsed between the approval date and
the execution date, the Bank accompanied the dialogue and the implementation of concrete DRM
actions through a technical assistance financed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and
Recovery (GFDRR).

Finally, validation workshop participants formulated the lessons learned resulting from the
implementation of this operation.

Comments from government agencies

1. About DPL with CAT DDO

The representatives of government agencies concluded the DPL with CAT DDO accomplished
successfully its main goal to support Guatemala on the implementation of its NPDPM and made
resources readily available when most needed following the declaration of the national state of
emergency as a result of the eruption of Pacaya volcano and tropical storm Agatha.

Furthermore, the validation workshop participants stated the declaration of the national state of
emergency as a result of a disaster is a sound trigger that activates the CAT DDO because it
provides said mechanism with flexibility and swiftness to disburse credit funds and said trigger
must be the primary precondition sufficient to release funds. They recommend establishing an
Operational Manual to guide the use and implementation of credit funds for similar operations.

It is advisable to have in place instruments complementing CAT DDO to diversify disaster
financing options in case of disasters, e.g. inter alia, implementing and strengthening a
prevention and response emergency fund. Importantly, have the best information about the CAT
DDO revolving facility and maintain dialogue during the project implementation.

The representatives of government agencies believe the DPL with CAT DDO was part of national
efforts undertaken to improve the country DRM capacity, timely supported by other development
partners.


2. About Outcome Indicators

Outcome Indicator 1: Data from INSIVUMEH and the vulnerability analysis are being used to
prioritize public investments

1.1 INSIVUMEH agreed with the outcome indicator values and stated the meteorological radar
    procurement is in progress.

1.2 MINEDUC reported the school safety index (SSI) was applied throughout 43 urban schools
    and the methodology is being revised for implementation in rural zones.

    SEGEPLAN confirmed the hospital safety index was applied in 4 national hospitals (Cobán,
    San Juan de Dios in Guatemala City, Salamá and Mazatenango).

1.3 They clarified the development of perception maps of flooding and landslides and historic
    records for all municipalities in the country (total of 333) was supported jointly by

                                               31
    SEGEPLAN and SE-CONRED. Likewise, the 12 municipalities selected are within the four
    watersheds identified, not additional ones.

Outcome Indicator 2: SE-CONRED and SEGEPLAN are mainstreaming disaster risk
management considerations in key plans with respect to capacity building, training, and
investments

2.1 Participants agreed with the outcome indicator matrix on the number of reports developed.

2.2 SEGEPLAN clarifies the methodological guide employed to mainstream risk variables in key
development plans and territorial planning is included in a single document that complements the
public investment guide and strategic planning.

2.3 Representatives of governmentagencies agreed on the percentage of urban beneficiaries
benefitted from the inclusion of DRM into urban planning processes as variable to measure this
outcome indicator.

Outcome Indicator 3: New public buildings meet the terms of improved building standards

3.1 MINEDUC clarified the schools affected by the eruption of Pacaya volcano and tropical
storm Agatha, were assessed and most of them had minor repairs as a result of volcanic ash fall
events, heavy rains and floods. Though some cases saw structural repairs, an updated record is
not available. Considering the foregoing, the validation workshop participants agreed to rate it as
target partially achieved.

3.2 SEGEPLAN clarified the NRD1 is a technical standard approved by a Government Order
instead of a Decree as mistakenly seen in the outcome indicator matrix. Additionally, the disaster
risk assessment was included into public investment projects, which promotes the enforcement of
the seismic standard. Bottom line: the representatives of government agencies recommend
upgrading the rating as target accomplished.

3.3 DCP/MINFIN reported it had designed a budget expenditure classifier to track budget
appropriation for disaster risk management. Its implementation at central level has advanced.
Furthermore, validation workshop participants observed the budget appropriation classifier
tracking the municipal public investment should be classified under Outcome Indicator 2.

Outcome Indicator 4: The Ministry of Finance has improved its response capacity to mobilize
resources in case of disasters

4.1 DCP/MINFIN stated its agreement on this outcome indicator rating

4.2 DCP/MINFIN requested to incorporate into the CAT DDO policy matrix, the progress seen in
identifying contingent liabilities resulting from natural threats (geological, hydrological and
meteorological ones) that may affect state finances. These are preliminary assessments. Upon
completion, they expectedly would contribute to measure risks and inform the design of risk
financing instruments.

4.3 Validation workshop participants believe the GoG has undertaken initial efforts to identify the
potential constituents of a DRM financing strategy. In the future, they expect to consider the
assessment and design of specific risk financing instruments such as equity funds, contingency
loans, insurances, etc.

                                                32
Bottom line: upon the assessment of outcome indicators as whole, the validation workshop
participants recommended to modify their current ratings, as follows:

   Upgrade rating of Outcome Indicator 1.2 from “Target partially accomplished? to “Target
    overachieved?
   Downgrade rating of Outcome Indicator 3.1 from “Target overachieved? to “Target partially
    accomplished?
   Upgrade rating of Outcome Indicator 3.2 from “Target partially accomplished? to “Target
    Met?

Correspondingly, the number of Outcome Indicators partially accomplished account for 4 out of
13.


3. About Factors that Affected the Credit Implementation:

Representatives of state agencies agreed on key factors identified in the ICR


4. About Ratings:

        4.1. Scope of Project Objectives

Representatives of government agencies believe the Project Objectives were accomplished as
much as GoG’s capacities to implement its National Program for Disaster Prevention and
Mitigation increased. Likewise, they stated said Project Objectives remain relevant beyond the
operation end because their continuity will be ensured by the proposed National Strategy for
Disaster Risk Reduction (2012-2017), thus keeping the government priorities in this topic.

On the other hand, disbursed funds contributed to provide the GoG with a quick source of
liquidity in the event of severe crisis following the impacts from the eruption of Pacaya volcano
and tropical storm Agatha.

        4.2. Loan Assessment

Representatives of state agencies deemed appropriate the “Moderately Satisfactory? rating
proposed for the loan assessment. They suggested implementing more adequate mechanisms to
ensure sound monitoring and evaluation from the Bank and country agencies.

        4.3. Bank Performance Assessment

The Bank’s performance in managing the credit requested by the GoG is rated “Moderately
Satisfactory? while the quality of supervision is rated “Moderately Unsatisfactory?, which
matches the criteria set forth in the ICR report.

Considering the Bank assessment guides, the validation workshop participants proposed the
overall bank performance to be reconsidered as “Moderately Satisfactory?.




                                                33
       4.4. Government Performance Assessment

Validation workshop participants rated the Government Performance as “Moderately
Satisfactory?, which is consistent with the proposed ICR assessment criteria.


Lessons Learned Proposed by Representatives of State Agencies

   1. The objectivity and quality of the Policy Matrix Outcome Indicators should be enhanced
      as they are critical to ensure sound monitoring and follow-up, as well as clarity to guide
      actions leading towards the achievement of outcomes and targets.
   2. The role and purpose of CAT DDO instrument played within a country risk financing
      strategy should be clarified.
   3. The CAT DDO met its goal, which was to provide the GoG with liquidity to cope with
      times of crisis. Here, the advantages of such instrument are acknowledged for its
      flexibility.
   4. The development of a CAT DDO Operational Manual is recommended in order to clarify
      arrangements and procedures regulating disbursements, frequency and responsibilities
      falling under reporting, monitoring and evaluation.
   5. Improve Bank’s technical accompaniment relating to capacity building and follow-up.
   6. Encourage regular inter-institutional meetings to discuss monitoring and follow up during
      the project implementation.


Comments on ICR Contents

DCP/MINFIN representatives informed comments and observations on ICR would be submitted
to the Bank in the coming days.

Furthermore, regarding the Bank’s proposal to support the Government of Guatemala in grant ing
a second DPL with CAT DDO operation, due note has been taken and MINFIN top management

       Annex 4. The Impact of Pacaya Eruption and Agatha Tropical Storm


The accumulated effects of all events associated to Volcano Pacaya eruption and the Tropical
Storm Agatha, that hit the country immediately after the eruption, including landslides, flooding,
and associated loss caused by extraordinary rainfall and storms between May and September
2010, have affected 3.9% of total population
of Guatemala.                                            Guatemala: Affected Population, 2010

losses affecting population livelihoods and
incomes (particularly women who are
affected directly by their own losses and the need to spend more time at home attending the
family, with less time for paid activities), and the environment (drainage capacity of rivers,
flooded soil restoration, water sources cleaning, debris and waste disposal).

                                                   Aggregate macro-economic effects of the two
                                                   events did not significantly alter the original
                                                   estimations, but posed an additional challenge
                                                   of financing and investment by increasing
                                                   cumulative risk. Guatemala's macroeconomic
                                                   performance through September 2010 has
                                                   been robust due to rapid increase in exports
                                                   and imports, as well as the recovery of almost
                                                   all productive sectors, except agriculture,
                                                   which experienced a significant slowdown
                                                   because of the disasters’ effects. Damage and
losses, due to the eruption of Pacaya and heavy rains after the passage of Tropical Storm Agatha
in 2010, were US$ 1,552.6 million equivalent to the 2.6 percent of 2009

In the overall evaluation of the eruption of Pacaya and Tropical Storm Agatha highlights some
important conclusions regarding:
1. The urgency of including disaster risk management as a strategic part in the estimation of the
    profitability, viability and sustainability of investments, infrastructure and human settlements.
2. It is paramount to foster risk understanding for developing risk reduction and transfer tools
    customized to local needs, so the country may have a Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance
    strategy to cope with future events.
3. The cumulative effect of events, which do not have a full recovery and reconstruction, gets
    worse with each new disaster increasing damages and losses, and reconstruction and recovery
    costs.
4. The cumulative effects of environmental degradation (reduction of absorption capacity and
    resistance to natural events) result in substantial damage and loss, even when the event is not
    extreme (for its strength and intensity).
